      <text xml:space="preserve">This section makes some definitions for the purposes of Part 2 of ICTA (except where the context otherwise requires).

The following are defined:

'''lease''' includes an agreement for a lease, and any tenancy, but does not include a mortgage or heritable security, and '''lessee''', '''lessor''' and '''letting''' shall be construed accordingly;&lt;br&gt;
'''lessee''' and '''lessor''' include respectively the successors in title of a lessee or a lessor;&lt;br&gt;
'''premises''' includes any land; and&lt;br&gt; 
'''premium''' includes any like sum, whether payable to the immediate or a superior landlord or to a person connected (within the meaning of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 839 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|section 839]]) with the immediate or a superior landlord.

Any sum (other than rent) paid on or in connection with the granting of a tenancy is presumed to have been paid by way of premium except in so far as other sufficient consideration for the payment can be shown to have been given. 

Where paragraph (c) of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 38 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|section 38(1)]] (rules for ascertaining the duration of leases) applies, the premium, or an appropriate part of the premium, payable for or in connection with either lease mentioned in that paragraph may be treated as having been required under the other. 

References in this section to a sum shall be construed as including the value of any consideration, and references to a sum paid or payable or to the payment of a sum shall be construed accordingly. 

In the application of this Part to Scotland-

'''assignment''' means an assignation;&lt;br&gt; 
'''intermediate landlord''' means, where an occupying lessee is a sub-lessee, any person for the time being holding the interest of landlord under a sub-lease which comprises the property of which the occupying lessee is sub-lessee, but does not include the immediate landlord;&lt;br&gt;
'''premium''' includes in particular a grassum payable to any landlord or intermediate landlord on the creation of a sub-lease; and&lt;br&gt;
'''reversion''' means the interest of the landlord in the property subject to the lease.

References to a lease extend only to a lease conferring a right, as against the person whose interest is subject to the lease, to the possession of the premises; and '''rent''' includes a payment by the tenant to defray the cost of work of maintenance of, or repairs to, the demised premises, not being work required by the lease to be carried out by the tenant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rental income''' is taxed under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]], if it arises from UK land&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;, and under Case V of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] if it arises from overseas land&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]].&lt;/ref&gt;. The rules for UK and overseas land are the same&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 70A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 70A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In most instances a company is deemed to have a single Schedule A business. If, however, it is a partner in a partnership, rental income from that partnership is deemed to be a separate Schedule A business.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]].&lt;/ref&gt; These rules are amended for life assurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;A life assurance company, by virtue of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 432AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|section 432AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]] is deemed to have the following categories of business (for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007:

*solely linked basic life assurance and general annuity business;
*business linked to pension, child trust fund and/or individual savings account business;
*solely linked non-life long-term business;
*non-linked long-term business;
*business outside the long-term insurance fund.

Additionally, UK land linked to overseas life assurance business is treated as a separate Schedule A business by virtue of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 441B of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|section 441B of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rental income is calculated in the same way as trading income&lt;ref&gt;Sections [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 21A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|21A]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 21B of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|21B]] of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;. In practice this means identifying the part of the profit shown in the financial statements that relates to rental income and making certain adjustments&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 42 of the Finance Act 1998|Section 42 of the Finance Act 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some special rules that apply to taxing rental income that do not apply to trading income.

These are:

*A Schedule A charge can arise on mutual business&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 21C of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 21C of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;;
*There are special rules dealing with [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Corporation tax/Leases|leases]];
*There are special rules dealing with [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Corporation tax/Furnished holiday accommodation|furnished holiday accommodation]];
*There is a special rule allowing a deduction for expenditure on sea walls&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 30 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 30 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A good sleeping bag is essential to staying warm at night.  Campers should absolutely not go to bed wearing their dirty day clothes.  This will only make the sleeping bag filthy and the camper will not be as comfortable.  Wear thermal underwear, pajamas, and/or a sweatsuit.  Layering will keep you warmer, but if you toss and turn a lot, they may twist around and become uncomfortable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Do not build a fire within {{units|6 meters|20 feet}} of a tent.  Sparks from the fire can easily travel that far and strike a tent, either burning a hole in it, or setting it ablaze.  If it is occupied, this can be deadly.  A fire should likewise not be built underneath trees as it is possible to ignite the tree's canopy.  Stay clear of vehicles as well.

      <comment>/* Obtain Data */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">How does the econometrician go ahead in analysing an economic theory? What is needed is a '''methodology''', i.e. a step-by-step procedure. This is similar to other social sciences.

== Theory ==
A theory should have a prediction. In statistics and econometrics, we also speak of '''hypothesis'''. One example is '''the marginal propensity to consume''' (MPC) proposed by Keynes. Other examples could be that lower taxes would increase growth, or maybe that it would increase economic inequality, and that introducing a common currency has a positive effect on trade.

== Specification of the Mathematical Model == 
This is where the algebra enters. We need to use mathematical skills to produce an equation. Assume a theory predicting that more schooling increases the wage. In economic terms, we say that the return to schooling is positive. The equation is:

&lt;math&gt;
Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X
&lt;/math&gt;,

where Y is the variable for wage and &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt; \beta_2 &lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of schooling, and X is a measurement of schooling, i.e. the number of years in school. We also call &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; intercept and &lt;math&gt; \beta_2 &lt;/math&gt; a slope coefficient.

Normally, we would expect both &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta_2 &lt;/math&gt; to be positive.

==Specification of the Econometric Model ==
Here, we assume that the mathematical model is correct but we need to account for the fact that it may not be so. We add an '''error term''', ''u'' to the equation above. It is also called a '''random (stochastic) variable'''. It represents other non-quantifiable or unknown factors that affect Y. It also represents mismeasurements that may have entered the data. The econometric equation is:

&lt;math&gt;
Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X + u
&lt;/math&gt;.

The error term is assumed to follow some sort of statistical distribution. This will be important later on.

==Obtain Data==
We need data for the variables above. This can be obtained from government statistics agencies and other sources. A lot of data can also be collected on the Internet in these days. But we need to learn the art of finding appropriate data from the ever increasing huge loads of data

==Estimation of the model==
Here, we quantify &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta_2 &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. we obtain numerical estimates. This is done by statistical technique called '''regression analysis'''.

==Hypothesis Testing==
Now we go back to the part where we had economic theory. The prediction was that schooling is good for the wage. Does the econometric model support this hypothesis. What we do here is called '''statistical inference (hypothesis testing)'''. Technically speaking, the &lt;math&gt; \beta_2 &lt;/math&gt; coefficient should be greater than 0.

==Forecasting==
If the hypothesis testing was positive, i.e. the theory was concluded to be correct, we '''forecast''' the values of the wage by '''predicting''' the values of education. For example, how much would someone earn for an additional year of schooling? If the X variable is the years of schooling, the &lt;math&gt; \beta_2 &lt;/math&gt; coefficient gives the answer to the question.

==Use for Policy Recommendation==
Lastly, if the theory seems to make sense and the econometric model was not refuted on the basis of the hypothesis test, we can go on to use the theory for policy recommendation. If your theory was really good, then maybe you will earn the Nobel Prize of Economics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two branches of econometrics: '''theoretical econometrics''' and '''applied econometrics'''.

The former is concerned with methods, both their properties and developing new ones. It is closely related to mathematical statistics, and it states assumptions of a particular method, its properties. It is particularly important to know when they are not fulfilled.

Applied econometrics does what it says: it applies econometric theory to branches within economics, such as unemployment figures, portfolio theory, demand and supply functions, et.c.

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Locate the fire in a safe place.  It should be clear for 10 feet (3 meters) all around.
*Do not light a fire beneath overhanging branches.
*Do not use accelerants, such as lighter fluid, gasoline, kerosene, etc.  Learn to light a fire without these.
*Put the fire out '''completely''' before leaving it.  If it's too hot to put your hands in the ashes, it's not sufficiently out.  Douse it down with water, turn the coals with a shovel, and be sure to extinguish every coal and ember.
*Do not build a fire on top of flammable material such as grass or leaves.  
*Cut away the sod (keep it moist so it stays alive, and replace it before your leave), and clear away the duff and litter.
*Keep fire extinguishing supplies handy and near the fire.  A bucket of water or sand, or a fire extinguisher are recommended.
*Do not remove burning sticks from a fire.
*Watch for embers that escape the fire pit and extinguish them immediately.
*Wear proper footwear around a fire.
*Be aware that paper, cardboard, and leaves create floating embers that rise out of the fire pit and may land dozens of yards away.
*Do not light a fire when conditions are adverse (high winds, or drought conditions).

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Keep your blades sharp. A dull knife is difficult to push through wood, requiring additional force. When the wood finally gives, the blade keeps going.
* Always push the blade away from you, and constantly consider where the blade will go.
* Keep your fingers clear of the blade at all times.
* When splitting wood with a knife, do not hammer on the back of the blade. This weakens the attachment to the handle and deforms the blade.
* Close a pocket knife when it's not in use or when you are carrying it.
* Keep all blades away from heat. Heat will remove the temper, softening the blade. A soft blade will not hold an edge, making it nearly impossible to keep it sharp.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Before chopping any wood, take a gentle practice swing to check that the axe will not catch on anything (such as an overhead branch).
* Consider what will happen if you miss whatever you are chopping at - will you accidentally hit a finger? A foot? A bystander? Leave plenty of margin for error.
* Make sure the axe head is firmly attached to the axe handle. If it is loose, you may tighten it by wetting the handle, by driving a hardwood wedge into the handle through the eye of the blade, or by rapping the axe handle vertically on a hard surface.
* Keep bystanders away by one arms length plus two axe-lengths. 
* When handing someone an axe, present the handle to them rather than the blade.
* Walk with the blade facing away from you.
* Sheathe the axe when it is not in use.
* Always maintain firm footing when using or carrying an axe.
* Stop when you are tired and rest. Tired people are more prone to accidents and mistakes.

__NOTOC__
=Writing in Chinese=
Learning to read and write Chinese characters will probably be your largest obstacle in this course. Since Chinese has no alphabet with reusable letters, there is no way around lots of writing practice and rote memorization. But while there is no small set of glyphs that can be used to write the entire language, there is reuse and repetition. Although pinyin is useful for representing the sounds characters make, they couldn't be used to replace characters, since many words make the same sounds.

Remember the way you learned to write the Latin alphabet—with extensive practice. While difficult and time consuming, learning Chinese characters can be an enjoyable and rewarding experience that provides a window into Chinese culture. The writing system has been in continuous use for over 3000 years, with the traditional characters essentially unchanged since the 7th century. There is a story in every character.

Additionally, because of the difficulty, people tend to be that much more impressed by foreigners who take it upon themselves to learn Chinese characters.


=== CJK strokes ===
The '''CJK strokes''' (also known as the CJK(V) or CJKV strokes) are the strokes needed to write the [[Chinese characters]] used in [[East Asia]]. The corresponding CJKV characters being the characters that come from Chinese [[Hanzi]], and which are now used in '''C'''hina, '''J'''apan, '''K'''orea, and still a little in '''V'''ietnam.

There are some thirty distinct types of strokes recognized in [[Chinese character]]s, some of which are compound strokes made from basic strokes. The compound strokes comprise more than one movement of the writing instrument, and many of these have no agreed-upon name.

Each single stroke includes all the motions necessary to produce a given part of a character before lifting the writing instrument from the writing surface; thus, a single stroke may have abrupt changes in direction within the line. For example:
:[[Image:S-black.png|30px]] is one stroke, named Shu, and also a basic stroke (one direction)
:[[Image:SZZ-black.png|30px]] is a compound stroke, named ShuZheZhe, comprising 3 basic strokes but written without lifting the writing instrument from the writing surface.

Several aspects of interest in the study of CJK(V) strokes are, for example, their use in [[East Asian calligraphy]] (how write them, which shape, which way), their change according to which style is in use, their naming and counting conventions, and their use on computers.

==== Basic strokes====

|-
|}

The &quot;dot&quot; is rarely a real dot.  Instead it usually takes the shape of a very small line pointing in one of several directions, and may be long enough to be confused with other strokes.

Certain strokes (such as ''gōu'' and ''zhé'', the &quot;hook&quot; and &quot;break&quot;) never occur alone, but always in compound strokes.  Thus, they are not in themselves individual strokes.

The character for &quot;eternity&quot; shown in the following image demonstrates some of these compound strokes.  The centre line is a compound stroke that combines three stroke shapes in a single stroke.

== Writing CJK strokes ==
To write CJK characters, one must know how to write CJK strokes, and thus, needs to identify the basic strokes that make up a character. The following section lists the most usual common shapes of the basic CJK strokes, and the proper way of writing each. Many different lists of basic strokes coexist and there is no broad agreement as far as the stroke names are concerned (examples). We use a set of 37 CJK strokes based on the [[Eight Principles of Yong|8 basic strokes of 永]], and 29 other compound strokes. We also use a common naming system, which is not the only available. The strokes are painted in black and a red arrow shows the way to write it (you can click on images to enlarge them).
;The 8 principles of Yong, the 8 basic strokes&lt;ref name=&quot;37strokes&quot;&gt;The extended CJK set of strokes has 29 strokes. These most common 29 used strokes can be reduced to combinations of 8 basic strokes. This subset is found in the character &quot;eternity&quot; 永, hence the name of this set. But other sets of CJK strokes can be found. See [[CJK strokes]] for further explanations&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[Image:8_Strokes_of_Han_Characters.svg|thumb|280px|left|The 8 basic strokes (8 stroke shapes in 5 basic and compound strokes), extract from [[:wiktionary:永|永]], &quot;eternity&quot;. Enlarge this image to see the red arrows, showing the way of writing of each.]]

:[[Image:G-black.png|25px]] － the Gōu 鉤, ending another stroke, is a sharp change of direction either down (after a Heng) or left (after a Shù).
:[[Image:T-black.png|25px]] － the Tí 提, is a flick up and rightwards
:[[Image:W-black.png|25px]] － the Wān 彎, follows a concave path on the left or on the right

:[[Image:N-black.png|25px]] － the Nà 捺, is falling rightwards (with an emphasis at the end of the stroke)
:(+ [[Image:XG-black.png|25px]] － the Xié 斜 is sometimes added to the 永's strokes. It's a concave Shù falling right, always ended by a Gōu, visible on this image).&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
;8 basics making 29 compound strokes&lt;ref name=&quot;37strokes&quot;/&gt;
This 8 traditional basic strokes are used to make all other compound strokes －or complex strokes－. In example, Shù ''plus'' Gōu produce [[Image:SG-black.png|25px]] named ShùGōu. The new way of naming strokes is simply the sum of the names of the basic strokes, in the writing order. Moreover, a turn of 90⁰ (and only of 90⁰) producing a Shù or a Héng is called Zhé 折. In example, Héng ''plus'' Shù ''plus'' Gōu produces [[Image:HZG-black.png|25px]] named Héng'''Zhé'''Gōu. Shù ''plus'' Héng ''plus'' Shù produces a Shù'''ZhéZhé''' ([[Image:SZZ-black.png|25px]]). Nearly all complex strokes can be named using this simple scheme.

It is essential to recognize and know how to draw the different strokes that make a character. To properly draw a Chinese character, it is also necessary to draw the strokes with respect to a [[Stroke order|certain order]].


==== Stroke Order ====
[[East Asian Calligraphy]]
Every character has a specific stroke order to it. It may seem at first like this would make writing characters harder by being one more thing to remember, but definite stroke orders actually help you to remember characters. The &quot;motor memory&quot; you develop from following the same order every time helps develop a rhythm that flows through until the end of the character. In contrast, just attacking a character with a random stroke order each time might leave you with lots of half-completed characters!

The principal rules to keep in mind are shown in the chart below, with specifics following.

'''1. Write from left to right, and from top to bottom'''.

As a general rule, characters are written from left to right, and from top to bottom.  For example, among the first characters usually learned is the word &quot;one,&quot; which is written with a single horizontal line: 一.  This character has one stroke which is written from left to right (see image).

[[Image:一-order.gif|100px|thumb|The character &quot;one&quot; has a single stroke which is written from left to right.]] 

The character for &quot;two&quot; has two strokes: 二.  In this case, both are written from left to right, but the top stroke is written first.  The character for &quot;three&quot; has three strokes: 三.  Each stroke is written from left to right, starting with the uppermost stroke.

This rule applies also to more complex characters.  For example, 校 can be divided into two.  The entire left side (木) is written before the right side (交).  There are some exceptions to this rule, mainly occurring when the right side of a character has a lower enclosure (see below), for example 誕 and 健.  In this case, the left side is written first, followed by the right side, and finally the lower enclosure.  

When there are upper and lower components, the upper components are written first, then the lower components, as in 品 and 襲.

'''2. Horizontal lines are written from left to right; vertical lines are written from top to bottom'''

'''3. Horizontal before vertical'''

When strokes cross, horizontal strokes are usually written before vertical strokes: the character for &quot;ten,&quot; 十, has two strokes written as follows: 一 &lt;font size=-1 color=red&gt;→&lt;/font&gt; 十.

'''4. There are some circumstances where the vertical stroke is written before a horizontal, such as when the character ends in a horizontal stroke at the bottom. E.g., 上 is written 一 then | then _.  

[[Image:人-red.png|thumb|200px|right|The Chinese character meaning &quot;person&quot; ([[Image:人-order.gif|20px|人 animation]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''rén'').  The character has two strokes, the first shown here in dark, and the second in red.  The black area represents the starting position of the writing instrument.]]

'''5. Cutting strokes last'''

Vertical strokes that &quot;cut&quot; through a character are written after the horizontal strokes they cut through, as in 書 and 筆.

Horizontal strokes that cut through a character are written last, as in 母 and 海.

'''6. Diagonals right-to-left before left-to-right'''

Right-to-left diagonals (ノ) are written before left-to-right diagonals (乀): 文.

'''7. Centre verticals before outside &quot;wings&quot;'''

Vertical centre strokes are written before vertical or diagonal outside strokes; left outside strokes are written before right outside strokes: 小 and 水.

'''8. Outside before inside'''

Outside enclosing strokes are written before inside strokes; bottom strokes are written last (see 4): 日 and 口.  This applies also to characters that have no bottom stroke, such as 同 and 月.

'''9. Left vertical before enclosing'''

Left vertical strokes are written before enclosing strokes.  In the following two examples, the leftmost vertical stroke (|) is written first, followed by the uppermost and rightmost lines (┐) (which are written as one stroke): 日 and 口.

'''10. Bottom enclosing strokes last'''

Bottom enclosing strokes are always written last: 道, 週, 画.

'''11. Dots and minor strokes last'''

Minor strokes are usually written last, as the small &quot;dot&quot; in the following: 玉.

If you're not sure about the stroke order of a Chinese character, you can usually look it up in an online Chinese dictionary. For example, [http://www.nciku.com nciku] has stroke order animations for almost all Simplified Chinese characters (look up a single-character word and scroll down to the bottom of the page).&lt;!--; there are probably other dictionaries that do the same for Traditional Chinese.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The study of Palaeontology involves the study of fossils, their occurrence, how they became fossils, their relationship with other fossils and living species, ecological role etc. There are different areas of study to this field and many scientists specialize in one area and have a patchy knowledge of the other areas of study.

*''Invertebrate paleontology'' 
*''Molecular Paleontology'' - the recovery of DNA from ancient human, animal, and plant remains.
*''Paleoanthropology'' - Human evolution.
*''Paleoautecology'' - the study of an individual fossil in relation to its habitat found in.
*''Paleobotany'' - Plants.
*''Paleoecology'' - Ecosystems.
*''Paleosynecology'' - the study of fossil assemblages.
*''Paleornithology'' - Aves.
*''Ichnology'' - Study of tracks, burrows etc. 
*''Taphonomy'' - Study of process of dying and what processes occur to organisms after their death)
*''Vertebrate paleontology''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Michael Gabbard lives in Southwest Florida on the Gulf of Mexico in the U.S.A. with his life-partner and 4 Chihuahuas.  Born in North Carolina and raised throughout the South, Texas, and California in a military family, Michael benefitted from the multi-cultural melting pot that is the American military.  He chose European History and English Literature as his major areas of study in college.

He is an avid collector of world coinage, recipes from the 'old south' and around the world, and as an amateur genealogist has researched his extended family tree back to 1790 c.e.  He is a student of religion, spirituality, and mythology.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Projects==
SuperCard files are usually refered to as projects.

A project can be:
*edited and played in Supercard
*played in the Supercard Player
*turned into a Macintosh Application with the Standalone builder.


A SuperCard project can contain:
* Windows, these windows contain one or more cards which contain the interface elements:
**buttons
**[[superCard Programming/Basics/Fields|fields]]
**graphics
* Menus
* Resources


Supercard Projects can use:
*external files
*QuickTime movies
*sounds
*text
*other files


A Supercard project must contain one window, but the other elements are optional.

Using SuperTalk we can find out a lot about a project from:

&lt;pre&gt;
the properties of the project
&lt;/pre&gt;

and

&lt;pre&gt;
describe(this project,all)
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Windows==
SuperCard displays its contents in standard (or custom) Macintosh windows.

The windows can be  Dialog, Movable, Palette, Plain, Scrolling, Shadow or Standard Style. You can also create custom windows of any shape in these styles: customWindow, customDialog, customPalette.

A project can be made up of one or many windows, the windows in a project can be any of the possible styles.

Windows do not have any parts, they contain cards which contains the other interface elements.

You can retrive a list of cards and backgrounds with

''describe(windowDescriptor, all)''

==Cards==
Windows can be thought of as a pack of cards. 
Cards can be thought of  as slides in a slide show or index cards of a rolodex.

A window contains at least one card.

Cards contain the interface elements: buttons, [[superCard Programming/Basics/Fields|fields]] and graphics. Cards can also display video, QuickTime and other media.
Cards have two layers the card layer and a background layer that is shared by one or more cards. 

A list of objects on a card can be obtained with SuperTalk:

''describe(cardDescriptor,all)''

== Background ==
Objects on a background appear on all the cards that share that background. Navigation buttons are an example of common background content.
If you create a new card it will share the background with the current card. Creating a new Background will create a background and the first card of that background.

A list of objects on a Background can be obtained with SuperTalk:

''describe(backgroundDescriptor,all)''
==Parts==
Parts or Objects 
There are three main types of card parts. These can be on the card or the background layer:
*buttons
*[[superCard Programming/Basics/Fields|fields]]
*graphics

Parts are added to a card (or background) by choosing the appropriate tool and drawing them.
For example you can choose the Round Rectangle button tool from the RTE's tool palette and draw a button. You can then double click it with the pointer tool and its info dialog will open and you can set it properties.

Parts can also be created with a SuperTalk script.
In SuperTalk scripts parts can be  referred to in three ways, by id, name or number.
The id is given to an object by SuperCard when it is created in such a way it will be unique.
The name can be give to an object via the Object Info dialog or with SuperTalk, it is not necessarily unique and can be changed.
The Number is the objects stacking order.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Complex numbers===

The [[wikipedia:Natural number|''natural numbers'']] are used for counting. By subtracting natural numbers from natural numbers, we can create [[wikipedia:Integers|''integers'']] that are not natural numbers. By dividing integers by integers (other than zero) we can create [[wikipedia:Rational number|''rational numbers'']] that are not integers. By taking the square roots of positive rational numbers we can create [[wikipedia:Real number|''real numbers'']] that are [[wikipedia:Irrational number|irrational]]. And by taking the square roots of negative numbers we can create [[wikipedia:Complex number|''complex numbers'']] that are [[wikipedia:Imaginary number|imaginary]].

Any imaginary number is a real number multiplied by the positive square root of &lt;math&gt;-1,&lt;/math&gt; for which we have the symbol &lt;math&gt;i=\, _+ \!\sqrt{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Every complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of a real number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; (the [[wikipedia:Real part|''real part'']] of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;) and an imaginary number &lt;math&gt;ib.&lt;/math&gt; Somewhat confusingly, the [[wikipedia:Imaginary part|''imaginary part'']] of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the ''real'' number&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;b.&lt;/math&gt;

Because real numbers can be visualized as points on a line, they are also referred to as (or thought of as constituting) the [[wikipedia:Real line|real line]]. Because complex numbers can be visualized as points in a plane, they are also referred to as (or thought of as constituting) the [[wikipedia:Complex plane|complex plane]]. This plane contains two axes, one horizontal (the ''real axis'' constituted by the real numbers) and one vertical (the ''imaginary axis'' constituted by the imaginary numbers).

Do not be mislead by the whimsical tags &quot;real&quot; and &quot;imaginary&quot;. No number is real in the sense in which, say, apples are real. The real numbers are no less imaginary in the ordinary sense than the imaginary numbers, and the imaginary numbers are no less real in the mathematical sense than the real numbers. If you are not yet familiar with complex numbers, it is because you don't need them for counting or measuring. You need them for calculating the probabilities of measurement outcomes.

[[image:Complexnumbers.png|520px]]

This diagram illustrates, among other things, the addition of complex numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;
z_1+z_2 = (a_1 + ib_1) + (a_2 + ib_2) = (a_1 + a_2) + i(b_1 + b_2).&lt;/math&gt;

As you can see, adding two complex numbers is done in the same way as [[wikipedia:Vector (spatial)#Vector addition and subtraction|adding two vectors]] &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(c,d)&lt;/math&gt; in a plane.

Instead of using rectangular coordinates specifying the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, we may use polar coordinates specifying the ''absolute value'' or ''modulus'' &lt;math&gt;r= |z|&lt;/math&gt; and the ''complex argument'' or [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComplexNumber.html ''phase''] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which is an angle measured in [[wikipedia:Radian|radians]]. Here is how these coordinates are related:

:&lt;math&gt;a = r \cos \alpha,\qquad b = r \sin \alpha,\qquad r = \, _+ \!\sqrt{a^2+b^2},&lt;/math&gt;

(Remember [[wikipedia:Pythagorean theorem|Pythagoras]]?)

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 
\begin{cases}
\arctan(\frac ba) &amp; \mbox{if } a &gt; 0\\
\arctan(\frac ba) + \pi &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0 \mbox{ and } b \ge 0\\
\arctan(\frac ba) - \pi &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0 \mbox{ and } b &lt; 0\\
+\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \mbox{if } a = 0 \mbox{ and } b &gt; 0\\
-\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \mbox{if } a = 0 \mbox{ and } b &lt; 0
\end{cases}\qquad\hbox{or}\quad \alpha = 
\begin{cases}
+\arccos(\frac ar) &amp; \mbox{if } b \geq 0\\
-\arccos(\frac ar) &amp; \mbox{if } b &lt; 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

All you need to know to be able to multiply complex numbers is that &lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
z_1 z_2 = (a_1 + ib_1)(a_2 + ib_2) = (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + i(a_1b_2 + b_1a_2).&lt;/math&gt;

There is, however, an easier way to multiply complex numbers. Plugging the [[wikipedia:Power series|power series]] (or [[wikipedia:Taylor series|Taylor series]]) for &lt;math&gt;\cos&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos x = \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \frac{(-1)^k}{(2k)!} x^{2k} = 1-{x^2\over2!}+ {x^4\over4!} -{x^6\over6!}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin x = \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!}x^{2k+1} = x-{x^3\over3!}+ {x^5\over5!} -{x^7\over7!}+\dots,&lt;/math&gt;

into the expression &lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha+i\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and rearranging terms, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^\infty {(ix)^k\over k!} = 1+ix+{(ix)^2\over2!} + {(ix)^3\over3!} + {(ix)^4\over4!} +{(ix)^5\over5!}+{(ix)^6\over6!} + {(ix)^7\over7!}+\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

But this is the power/Taylor series for the [[wikipedia:Exponential function|exponential function]] &lt;math&gt;e^{y}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;y=ix&lt;/math&gt;! Hence [[wikipedia:Euler's formula|Euler's formula]]

:&lt;math&gt;
e^{i\alpha} = \cos\alpha + i\sin\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

and this reduces multiplying two complex numbers to multiplying their absolute values and adding their phases:

:&lt;math&gt;
(z_1)\, (z_2) = r_1 e^{i\alpha_1}\, r_2 e^{i\alpha_2} = (r_1 r_2)\, e^{i(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

An extremely useful definition is the [[wikipedia:Complex conjugate|complex conjugate]] &lt;math&gt;z^* = a-ib&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;z=a+ib.&lt;/math&gt; Among other things, it allows us to calculate the ''absolute square'' &lt;math&gt;|z|^2&lt;/math&gt; by calculating the product

:&lt;math&gt;
zz^* = (a+ib) (a-ib) = a^2+b^2.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
----
&lt;br&gt;

'''1.''' Show that
:&lt;math&gt;
\cos x={e^{ix}+e^{-ix}\over2}\quad\hbox{and}\quad\sin x={e^{ix}-e^{-ix}\over2i}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''2.''' Arguably the five most important numbers are &lt;math&gt;0,1,i,\pi,e.&lt;/math&gt; Write down an equation containing each of these numbers just once. [[wikipedia:Euler's identity|(Answer?)]]

I wrote what I know of finite state machines, transition tables, and state diagrams from a more general mathematics/computer science background in a fashion I thought applied to digital circuits, but I was actually reading through here in an attempt to learn about digital circuits, so I am uncertain as to its appropriateness for this context.

== Fact Check ==

User:139.168.29.22 wrote that:

A system that has &quot;n&quot; inputs can potentially go from any state to 2^n other states. ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Digital_Circuits%2FFinite_State_Machines&amp;diff=725335&amp;oldid=699262 here])

This strikes me as false. A finite state machine with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; inputs could have only 1 state, its initial, with all combinations of those inputs generating a transition to the identical state. (For example: a 2-input AND gate acting as the function &lt;math&gt;F(x) = xx^\prime&lt;/math&gt;.) If someone else thinks he was right, feel free to comment here about it, and we can see about adding it back in. &amp;mdash;[[User:Jay W.|Jay W.]] 23:34, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

I think what that confusingly-brief sentence was trying to say was:
Given a system with &quot;n&quot; inputs,
the &quot;branching factor&quot; of any particular state is at most 2^n.
For example, given a finite state machine with only 1 input, each state can transition to at most 2^1 = 2 other states (a binary tree).
Certainly most real systems have a branching factor far, far less than 2^n -- any particular state goes to only a few other states, any particular input is ignored in most states.

It seems fairly obvious to me -- but it is obvious enough that we don't need to mention it to a new learner?

'''Forsythia''' is both the common name and botanical name of a plant genus belonging to the [[../Oleaceae/]] (Olive family). It is named after William Forsyth, and comprises six species of deciduous shrubs to 3-6 m tall, mostly native to Asia, but one native to southeastern Europe.

==Description==
The leaves are opposite, usually simple but sometimes trifoliate with a basal pair of small leaflets, and range from 4-12 cm long; the margin is serrated. The flowers are produced in the early spring before the leaves, bright yellow with four petals. The fruit is a dry capsule, containing several winged seeds.

The species are:
*''[[../Forsythia europaea/]]'', from the Balkans
*''[[../Forsythia giraldiana/]]'', from northwest China
*''[[../Forsythia japonica/]]'' from Japan
*''[[../Forsythia ovata/]]'', from Korea
*''[[../Forsythia suspensa/]]'', from China
*''[[../Forsythia viridissima/]]'', from China

The hybrids ''Forsythia × intermedia'' (''F. suspensa'' × ''F. viridissima'') and ''Forsythia × variabilis'' (''F. ovata'' × ''F. suspensa'') have been produced in cultivation.

==Ecology==
Forsythias are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including [[w:Brown-tail|Brown-tail]] and [[w:Gothic (moth)|The Gothic]].

==Use==
Forsythias are popular early spring flowering shrubs in gardens and parks. Two are commonly cultivated for ornament, ''Forsythia × intermedia'' and ''Forsythia suspensa''. They are both spring flowering shrubs, with yellow flowers. They are grown and prized for being tough, reliable garden plants. ''Forsythia × intermedia'' is the more commonly grown, is smaller, has an upright habit, and produces strongly coloured flowers. ''Forsythia suspensa'' is a large to very large shrub, can be grown as a weeping shrub on banks, and has paler flowers. Many named garden cultivars can also be found.

Commercial propagation is usually by cuttings, taken from green wood after flowering in late spring to early summer; alternatively, cuttings may be taken between November and February.

''F. suspensa'' (Chinese: [[wikt:连|连]][[wikt:翘|翘]]; pinyin: liánqiào) is considered one of the 50 fundamental herbs in Chinese herbology.  Forsythia sticks are used to bow a Korean string instrument called ''ajaeng''.

Forsythia bloom is frequently used as a ''[[../Phenology|phenological indicator]] for timing pre-emergent herbicides in lawns.

==Pests and diseases==
'''[[../Crown Gall/]]''' caused by ''[[../Agrobacterium tumeifasciens/]]''

'''[[../Leaf Spots/]]''' caused by several species of fungi including ''[[../Alternaria/]]'' and ''[[../Phyllosticta/]]'' spp.

'''[[../Dieback/]]''' caused by ''[[../Sclerotinia sclerotiorum/]]''

'''[[../Root Knot/]]'''
*''[[../Meloidgyne hapla/]]'': Northern Root Knot Nematode

'''[[../Scales/]]'''
*White Peach Scale: ''[[../Pseudaulacapsis pentagona/]]''
'''[[../Bugs/]]'''
*Four-Lined Plant Bug: ''[[../Poecilocapsus lineatus/]]''
'''[[../Beetles/]]'''
*Twobanded Japanese Weevil: ''[[../Callirhopalus bifasciatus/]]''
*Redheaded Flea Beetle: ''[[../Systena frontalis/]]''
*Twobanded Japanese Weevil: ''[[../Callirhopalus bifasciatus/]]'' (on roots)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rational choice theory''' assumes human behaviour is guided by instrumental reason. Accordingly, individuals always choose what they believe to be the best means to achieve their given ends. Thus, they are normally regarded as maximizing ''utility'', the &quot;currency&quot; for everything they cherish (for example: money, a long life, moral standards). 
As the modern formulation of much older descriptions of rational behaviour, '''Rational choice theory''' belongs to the foundational theory of economics. Over the last decades it has also become increasingly prevalent in other social sciences.  

Rational choice theory adopts methodological individualism; it conceives of social situations or collective behaviors as the exclusive result of individual actions. However, rational choice theory is not only applied to individual human actors. Often, the same pursuit of cherished values is assumed for collective entities, for example corporations or national governments.

For a choice to be considered &quot;rational&quot;, a number of assumptions are ordinarily stated:
* In economics, the key concept is preference: a preference ranking for a set of items is considered rational if preferences are 1) complete (every item is ranked) and 2) transitive (if A is preferred to B, and B to C, then A is preferred to C). Thus, the decision-maker is able to compare all of the alternatives, and all comparisons are consistent.  
* If uncertainty is involved, then the independence axiom is often assumed in addition to rational preferences.
* If decision-making over time is involved, time consistency is generally assumed as well.
* Finally, the rational decision-maker must always choose the item he or she prefers.

Often, to simplify calculation and ease prediction, some rather unrealistic assumptions are made about the world. These can include:

* An individual has precise information about exactly what will occur under any choice made. (Alternatively, an individual has a reliable probability distribution describing what will happen under any choice made.)
* An individual has the cognitive ability to weigh every choice against every other choice.
* An individual is aware of all possible choices.
Sometimes these assumptions have the status of &quot;as if&quot; propositions—statements that are not meant to be literally true but that predict the behaviors individuals are believed to exhibit. 

Both the assumptions and the behavioral predictions of &quot;&quot;rational choice theory&quot;&quot; have sparked criticism from a number of camps. Some people have developed models of bounded rationality, which hope to be more psychologically plausible without completely abandoning the idea that reason underlies decision-making processes.  For a long time, a popular strain of critique was a lack of empirical basis, but experimental economics and experimental game theory have largely changed that critique (although they have added other critiques, mainly by demonstrating some human behavior that consistently deviates from rational choice theory).  Early critiques of the rational choice approach in political science for example, argued that the rational choice theorists could not explain why people voted, much less make more sophisticated arguments about political behavior.

Why rational choice theory?

One question that can be asked is why people try to base their models on concepts such as &quot;reason&quot;, &quot;preferences&quot;, and what is implied by them, free will. Some potential reasons: a) They see people as &quot;rational&quot; beings, and thus believe that a model in which they are represented as such should be reasonably accurate; b) Assumptions of rationality have useful formal properties; c) The individualistic methodology and the mathematical formalization of rational choice behavior allow for an easier understanding of complex social phenomena.

      <comment>/* Historical Meaning of Regression */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Historical Meaning of Regression==
The ''historical meaning'' of the term '''regression''' was coined by statistician [[Wikipedia:Francis Galton|Francis Galton]]. He observed that tall parents tended to have short children and short parents tended to have tall children. It seemed as though the height of people was heading to the average of the population across generations. His friend [[Wikipedia:Karl Pearson|Karl Pearson]] collected statistics on the heights of individual family members. He found that sons of short fathers tended to be taller than the average height of those fathers and sons of tall fathers thus turned out to be shorter than their fathers.

==Modern Interpretation of Regression==
It can be said that '''regression analysis''' is used to model relationships between variables and determine the magnitude of those relationships.&lt;ref&gt; [[Wikipedia:Regression analysis| Regression analysis]] &lt;/ref&gt;. Regression analysis is really a more accurate description for regression, but regression is fully comprehensible as an abbreviated term and we will use that one henceforth.

==Examples==
A number of examples where regression can be used is:&lt;ref&gt; Examples 1-3 from Gujarati (2003, p.18-21)&lt;/ref&gt;

*1. Galton was interested in finding out why average height was stable over generations. We could also say that we are interested in finding out why the average height of sons would be different from the average height of fathers. A hypothetical distribution can be seen in the ''scatter diagram'' to the right. In it, you can also see the ''regression line'' which shows the average height of sons given the average height of the fathers.

{scatter diagram}

*2. A monopolist wants to know how demand adjusts for changes in price or output. This allows him to maximise profit. This price responsiveness is called ''price elasticity''.

*3. The ''Phillips curve'' describes the effect of changes in unemployment to the unemployment rate. This could be used to predict a suitable level of inflation that is suitable to the public opinion on unemployment.
 
*4. A policy maker may want to see if there is a relationship between expenditure on police and the crime rate in a particular area. It can be useful if we want to know how to tackle crime more efficiently by allocating more money where crime is higher.

      <comment>/* Regression versus Correlation */ Fixed grammar</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Statistical and deterministic Relationships==
A ''deterministic relationship'' implies that there is an exact mathematical relationship or dependence between variables. An example in physics is Newton's law of gravity: &lt;math&gt; F = k \left ( \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;, where F, the force, is proportional to a constant, k, the mass of two objects, &lt;math&gt; m_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m_2 &lt;/math&gt;, and inversely to the square of the distance.

A ''random'' or ''stochastic relationship'' allows that there is some variation in a relationship. This is where probability distributions will enter later on. The relationship may not be exact due to

*'''measurement errors'''
*'''reporting errors'''
*'''computing errors'''
*'''other influence''',

etc. One example is crop yield relative to rain fall. We may not be able to measure the amount of rain accurately (measurement error), we round off to one decimal point (reporting error), there is a bug in the computer software that computes the sum (computing error) and there might be other factors such the quality of fertilisers, the quality of the earth and pollution (other influences).

==Regression versus Causation==
Regression deals with dependence amongst variables within a model. But it cannot always imply causation. For example, we stated above that rainfall affects crop yield and there is data that support this. However, this is a one-way relationship: crop yield cannot affect rainfall. It means there is no cause and effect reaction on regression if there is no causation.

In short, we conclude that a '''statistical relationship does not imply causation'''.&lt;ref&gt; Gujarati (2003, p. 23) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Regression versus Correlation==
Correlations form a branch of analysis called '''correlation analysis''', in which the ''degree of linear association'' is measured between two variables. If we calculate the correlation between crop yield and rainfall, we might obtain an estimate of, say, 0.69. This is reasonably high to prove that there is a mathematical relationship between them.

There is a distinction in how we regard the relationship between rainfall and crop yield. In statistics, both variables are assumed to be variables with random error in them. Both are treated on an equal footing and there is no distinction between them.

In regression analysis, crop yield is the dependent variable and rainfall is the explanatory variable, according to our theory. The distinction is that the dependent variable has no random component, all values are fixed from this distribution

This will be important in {section on mismeasurement}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Terminology and Notation==
Above we discussed dependent variables and explanatory variables. There are many synonyms of various terms and these are no exception. The dependent variable can also be called: 

*Explained variable
*Predictand
*Regressand
*Response
*Endogenous
*Outcome
*Controlled variable

and the explanatory variable:

*Independent variable
*Predictor
*Regressor
*Stimulus
*Exogenous
*Covariate
*Control variable

If we have one explanatory variable. We get what is called '''two-variable (simple) regression analysis'''. If we include more than one explanatory variable, it is called '''multiple regression analysis'''. 

The '''error term''' is assumed to be  '''random''' or '''stochastic variable'''. It implies that it can take any value within a given probability distribution and there are no other factors determining it. If other influences were known, it would no longer be random.

Gmail chat is a relatively new instant messaging client which is compatible with other IM networks.  At present it is only available to users of GMAIL and Google talk.


The Google Talk applications implement [[XMPP]] (the [[w:Jabber|Jabber]] protocol). Clients which can use this protocol are widely available, so the lack of official Google clients on non-Windows systems is not an issue.

Using Jabber and associated technologies it is possible to talk to users of Google Talk even if you have a different Jabber client and do not have an account with Google.

(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Talk)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Econometrics in absence of data would not exist. All data can be classified into a category and that can be important as the success of good econometric work depends on the nature, sources and limitations of the data used.

==Types of Data==
There are three types of data: '''time series''', '''cross-section''', and a combination of them is called and '''pooled data'''.

'''Time series data''' of a variable have a set of observations on values at different points of time. They are usually collected at fixed intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, annually, quarterly, etc. Time series econometrics has applications in macroeconomics, but mainly in financial economics where it is used for price analysis of stocks, derivatives, currencies, etc.

'''Cross-section data''' are collected at the same point of time for several individuals. Examples are opinion polls, income distribution, data on GNP per capita in all European countries, etc.

'''Pooled data''' is a mixture of time series data and cross-section data. One example is GNP per capita of all European countries over ten years.

'''Panel, longitudinal or micropanel data''' is a type that is pooled data of nature. The difference is that we measure over the same cross-sectional unit for individuals, households, firms, etc. This branch of econometrics is called '''microeconometrics'''.

== Sources of Data ==
There are many sources of data and it can be very time-consuming to find all the data needed. In fact, finding data can take up more of the time than analysis in a project. Some sources are governmental agencies (Eurostat), international agencies (the International Monetary fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Health Organisation (WHO), etc.), firms, etc.

'''The Internet''' has become the newest source of information over the last decade. There are lots of economic and financial to obtain.

==Data Accuracy==
Because data in the social sciences are seldom generated under controlled conditions, there will always be unknown influences. This makes it difficult to obtain qualitative data for research. This was mentioned in the previous section.

'''Measurement of Scale'''
Data fall into four categories which are important to know:

*'''Ratio scale''' refers to quantities such as ratios &lt;math&gt; X_2/X_1 &lt;/math&gt; and distances &lt;math&gt; X_2 - X_1 &lt;/math&gt;. There can be ordering of the data where comparisons are meaningful, such as &lt;math&gt; X_2 \le X_1 &lt;/math&gt;.

*'''Interval scale''' refers to distances as mentioned above

*'''Ordinal scale''' refers to an order that is not quantitative but qualitative. We can also say that there is a &quot;natural order&quot; of grouping different categories. For example, there are different income classes (high, medium, low), sizes (large, medium, small), etc.

*'''Nominal scale''' refers to states but there is no ordering amongst them. For instance, genders (male, female), materials (paper, plastics, wood), etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Emergencies==

You can reach the police at any time by dialing '''110''', and fire and ambulance services by dialing '''119'''. Dispatchers may not speak English. However, because they can trace the phone line you are dialing from, you really only need to know two words:

*'''kaji''' = fire
*'''kyu-kyu''' = emergency

It's also a good idea to keep the number of your home country's embassy so that they can notify your relatives or other contacts overseas in the event of an emergency.

==Job trouble==

Japanese law is very employee-friendly. In most cases, it is very difficult for your employer to fire or demote you unless you have been warned well in advance and have had opportunities to improve your problematic behavior. Even if you are fired, you are generally entitled to advance notice or equivalent severance pay.

The government provides labor consulting offices in every city ([http://www.mhlw.go.jp/general/seido/chihou/kaiketu/soudan.html list in Japanese]) which you can visit if you need help.

==Marital trouble==

A married couple in Japan can divorce by agreement at any time: all that's required is a divorce application, which is available at city hall. However, if you are unable to agree on the terms of your divorce, it is very difficult and time-consuming to get a divorce: hearings in the Family Court move at a glacial pace and may take years of hassle and legal bills. As a result, many Japanese couples end up living separately but remaining legally married.

Child custody is a major problem for foreigners who marry in Japan. Although both parents have the right to custody of their children in principle, disputes generally result in custody being awarded exclusively to one parent. Due to oddities in the family registration system, it is almost impossible for a foreigner to be a single parent in Japan, so custody is most likely to be awarded to the Japanese spouse, particularly if that spouse is the mother.

However, because court enforcement mechanisms are very weak in Japan, divorce has very few financial repercussions.

==Police trouble==

===Questioning===

A police officer may stop you in public to ask you some questions. The best strategy is to '''cooperate''', as police officers expect cooperation from Japanese citizens. Some key points to remember:

* As a foreigner, '''you must carry your alien registration card at all times'''. 
* You must show your alien registration card to any public official if they ask for it. However, '''you are entitled to see their ID before showing yours''' in order to ensure that they actually are a public official. '''You have no obligation to show ID to anyone who is not a public official.'''
* Finally, '''you do not have to go to a police station''' unless you are arrested. If the police want to ask you questions, you can talk to them on the street or in any other convenient location.

===Arrest===

Getting arrested in Japan can be a very traumatic experience. Under Japanese law, the police may detain you for '''up to 23 days without a trial'''. They use this time to try to coerce a confession out of the suspect.

Criminal cases rarely proceed in Japan until the suspect confesses. Generally, if you do not confess to a crime while in police custody, the charges will be dropped or (if the evidence against you is strong) the police will detain you again. A form of &quot;plea bargaining&quot; often occurs through this process, where a suspect agrees to confess to a lesser crime in exchange for release and a lenient punishment (a fine or deportation).

If you are arrested, you are constitutionally entitled to the assistance of a lawyer. Local bar associations provide a &quot;lawyer on call&quot; (''toban bengoshi'') to assist anyone who is arrested. You can contact this lawyer by asking the police, or by [http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/legal/arrest_contact_list.html calling the hotline for your local area]. These attorneys are generally volunteers; you have no right to a government-appointed attorney until you are actually indicted (i.e., after you confess).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|Ruby on Rails|Getting Started/Running the Server|Built-In_Rails_Tools/Make a generator}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Generators==

===Introduction===
Rails comes with a number of generators which are used to create stub files for models, controllers, views, unit tests, migrations and more. Generators are accessed through the command-line script &lt;tt&gt;RAILS_ROOT/script/generate&lt;/tt&gt;

All commands look like
  rails generate generator generator-options

To see what options are available, just enter
  rails generate
and Rails will show you all available options and what generators are currently installed. By default, you can choose from the different generators. The most important are:

* controller
* helper
* mailer
* migration
* model
* scaffold

If you want more information on different generators, simply enter the generator commend e.g. &quot;&lt;tt&gt;script/generate model&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; in the console and you will get information to this specific command and examples explaining what the generator does.

You can use the generator multiple times for the same controller, but be careful: it will give you the option to overwrite your controller file (to add the actions you specify). As long as you have not modified the controller this might be fine, but if you have already added code then make sure you do not overwrite it and go back and manually add the action methods.

===Generate a Model===

To generate a model use the following:

  rails generate model ModelName column:datatype column:datatype [...]

Replace ModelName with the CamelCase version of your model name.
For example:

  rails generate model Person name:string age:integer

This would generate the following:

 exists  app/models/
 exists  test/unit/
 exists  test/fixtures/
 create  app/models/person.rb
 create  test/unit/person_test.rb
 create  test/fixtures/people.yml
 exists  db/migrate
 create  db/migrate/20090607101912_create_people.rb

Any necessary directories will be automatically created. Existing ones will not be replaced. The file &lt;tt&gt;app/models/person.rb&lt;/tt&gt; contains the Person class. &lt;tt&gt;test/unit/person_test.rb&lt;/tt&gt; contains the unit test stub for the Person class. &lt;tt&gt;test/fixtures/people.yml&lt;/tt&gt; contains a stub for test data which will be used to populate the test database during test runs. The &lt;tt&gt;db/migrate/20090607101912_create_people.rb&lt;/tt&gt; contains the database migration stub for the Person class. Note that the timestamp at the beginning of the file (&lt;tt&gt;20090607101912&lt;/tt&gt;) will always be different depending on the time you created the file. Also note how Rails pluralizes the class name to use the plural form as the corresponding table, fixture and migration names.

===Generate a Controller===

To generate a controller use the following:

  rails generate controller ControllerName [actions]

Replace ControllerName with the CamelCase version of your controller name. When no actions are given, Rails will create a Controller that responds to all 7 REST actions (new, create, update, edit, destroy, index &amp; show)

  rails generate controller People

would generate the following output:

  exists  app/controllers/
  exists  app/helpers/
  create  app/views/people
  exists  test/functional/
  exists  test/unit/helpers/
  create  app/controllers/people_controller.rb
  create  test/functional/people_controller_test.rb
  create  app/helpers/people_helper.rb
  create  test/unit/helpers/people_helper_test.rb

The file &lt;tt&gt;app/controllers/people_controller.rb&lt;/tt&gt; contains the PeopleController class. &lt;tt&gt;test/functional/people_controller_test.rb&lt;/tt&gt; contains the functional test stub for the PersonController class. &lt;tt&gt;app/helpers/people_helper.rb&lt;/tt&gt; is a stub for helper methods which will be made available to that controller and its associated views. Inside &lt;tt&gt;app/views/people&lt;/tt&gt; you will find the created templates for the controller. Depending on the given parameters, there will be different files.



===Generate a Migration===

To generate a migration use the following:

  rails generate migration MigrationName column:datatype column:datatype [...]

Replace MigrationName with the CamelCase version of your migration name. For example:

  generate migration AddCityToPerson

This would generate the following:

 exists  db/migrate
 create  db/migrate/20090607103358_add_city_to_person.rb

Migration are automatically generated each time you construct a new model, so you do not need to generate migrations by hand for each model. Typically you will use the migration generator when you need to change an existing model or need join tables. Again, the timestamp starting the filename will be different.

== Model-View-Controller==

[[Image:Mvc_rails.jpg|right|thumb|300px|MVC-Architecture inside Rails]]

As already mentioned, Rails relies on the MVC pattern. Model-View-Controller has some benefits over traditional concepts:

* it keeps your business logic separated from your (HTML-based) views
* keeps your code clean and neat in one place

=== Model ===
The model represents the information and the data from the database. It is as independent from the database as possible (Rails comes with its own O/R-Mapper, allowing you to change the database that feeds the application but not the application itself). The model also does the [[Ruby_on_Rails/ActiveRecord/Validations | validation]] of the data before it gets into the database. Most of the time you will find a table in the database and an according model in your application.

=== View ===
The view is the presentation layer for your application.  The view layer is responsible for [[Ruby_on_Rails/ActionView/Rendering_and_Redirecting#Render | rendering]] your models into one or more formats, such as XHTML, XML, or even Javascript. Rails supports arbitrary text rendering and thus all text formats, but also includes explicit support for Javascript and XML. Inside the view you will find (most of the time) HTML with embedded Ruby code. In Rails, views are implemented using ''ERb'' by default.

=== Controller ===
The controller connects the model with the view. In Rails, controllers are implemented as ''ActionController'' classes. The controller knows how to process the data that comes from the model and how to pass it onto the view. The controller should not include any database related actions (such as modifying data before it gets saved inside the database). This should be handled in the proper model.

=== Helpers ===
When you have code that you use frequently in your views or that is too big/messy to put inside of a view, you can define a method for it inside of a helper. All methods defined in the helpers are automatically usable in the views.

=== Best Practices ===
Current best practices include:

* fat model and skinny controller
* business logic should always be in the model
* the view should have minimal code
* Use helpers!
* use models
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

|}

; Notes
* ''m'' indicates that the noun is masculine (''el queso'' &amp;mdash; &quot;the cheese&quot;; ''los plátanos'' &amp;mdash; &quot;the bananas&quot;), whereas ''f'' indicates that it is feminine (''la lechuga'' &amp;mdash; &quot;the lettuce&quot;; ''las uvas'' &amp;mdash; &quot;the grapes&quot;)
* In South America, ''papa'' is used instead of ''patata'' and ''Plátano'' refers to a plantain or cooking banana whereas a normal sweet banana is known as a ''banana'' or ''banano''.
* While ''agua'' is feminine, it takes the masculine articles ''un'' and ''el''. For example, ''el agua curiosa'' (&quot;the strange water&quot;) and ''las aguas curiosas'' (&quot;the strange waters&quot;). This is because ''agua'' starts with an accented ''a''.
* ''Con'' means &quot;with&quot;, ''sin'' means without (''café con leche'' means &quot;coffee with milk&quot;, ''café sin leche'' means &quot;coffee without milk&quot;).
* Wine comes in two varieties, &quot;red&quot; and &quot;white&quot;. In Spanish, they are called ''vino tinto'' and ''vino blanco''.

; Examples
* ''Me gustan los huevos.''
*: I like eggs.
* ''No me gusta nada la lechuga.''
*: I don't like lettuce at all.
* ''Me encanta el té con leche.''
*: I love tea with milk
* ''Me gustan mucho las zanahorias, pero los pepinos son aburridos.''
*: I like carrots a lot, but cucumbers are boring.

=== What do you eat? ===
To ask what someone else eats, use ''Qué'' followed by a form of one of the verbs below (''¿Qué comes?'' means &quot;What do you eat?&quot;). To ask what someone likes to eat, use ''Qué te gusta'' then any of the verbs below (''¿Qué te gusta comer?'' means &quot;What do you like to eat?&quot;).

{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Verbs|Eating and Drinking|Comer y Beber|2}}

|-
| Comer
| To eat
|-
| Beber
| To drink
|-
| Tomar
| To have (food/drink)
|-
| Desayunar
| To (eat) breakfast
|-
| Almorzar [in Spain, comer]
| To (eat) lunch
|-
| Cenar
| To dine (eat dinner)
|}

; Note
All of these verbs are regular except ''almorzar'', which is one of the UE Verbs we learnt about in the last chapter; ''almuerzo, almuerzas, almuerza, almorzamos, almorzáis, almuerzan''.

; Examples
* ''¿Qué te gusta almorzar?''
*: What do you like to eat for lunch?
* ''Como naranjas y plátanos, pero no me gustan las peras.''
*: I eat oranges and bananas, but I don't like pears.
* ''Me gusta comer uvas.''
*: I like to eat grapes.
* ''¿Bebes leche?''
*: Do you drink milk?

=== A bottle of wine ===

; Notes
* We previously learnt &quot;unos/unas&quot; as the translation for &quot;some&quot;, e.g. ''unas manzanas'' (&quot;some apples&quot;), but this only works for plural nouns. &quot;Some bread&quot; has to be translated as ''algo de pan'' or just ''pan''.
* Also, there are two ways of saying &quot;a glass of&quot;. ''Copa'' is for glasses with a stem (mostly wine: ''una copa de vino''), and ''vaso'' is used for without a stem.
* Obviously, in all these phrases, the ''un'' can be replaced with any number (''Dos vasos de leche'' means &quot;two glasses of milk&quot;).

; Examples
* ''Tres botellas de vino tinto''
*: Three bottles of red wine
* ''Un medio kilo de arroz''
*: Half a kilo of rice
* ''Una barra de pan''
*: A loaf of bread
* ''Cinco kilos y medio de patatas''
*: Five and a half kilos of potatoes

== In the Shop ==
In Spanish, as in English, there are many ways of expressing what you would like to buy, some of which are listed below. You will also see some other useful words and phrases to use when shopping for food.
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Verbs|I would like...|Me gustaría...|2}}
! Español
! Inglés
|-
| Quisiera
| rowspan=3 | I would like
|-
| Querría
|-
| Me gustaría
|-
| Ahí está(n)
| There you go; voila.
|-
| Comprar
| To buy
|-
| La cuenta
| The bill / account
|-
| Cobrar
| To settle in cash
|-
| Costar
| To cost
|-
| Una tienda
| A shop
|}

; Notes
* ''Comprar'' is a regular verb (''compro, compras, compra, compramos, compráis, compran'').
* With ''ahí está(n)'', the ''n'' is added if the noun is plural.
* ''Costar'' is a O =&gt; UE verb (''cuesto, cuestas, cuesta, costamos, costáis, cuestan''), but obviously, you only use the third person.
*: Also, if you want to say &quot;How much does it cost?&quot; you use ''¿Cuánto cuesta(n)?'' (''cuesta'' is for singular things, ''cuestan'' for plurals, as seen below).
* In a bar or café in Spain, one usually pays for everything  on leaving ''¿La cuenta, por favor?'' is to ask for the bill and it relates to the verb ''contar'' - to count or to tell. Alternatively ''cobrar'' (collect) relates to payment (or cash) ''¿me cobra?'' = may I pay?


; Examples
* ''Quisiera una manzana, por favor.''
*: I would like an apple, please.
* ''Querría comprar una barra de pan.''
*: I'd like to buy a loaf of bread.
* ''Me gustaría comprar una botella de vino tinto, por favor.''
*: I'd like to buy a bottle of red wine, please.
* ''¿Cuánto cuestan las uvas?''
*: How much do the grapes cost?
* ''¿Cuánto cuesta un kilo de patatas?''
*: What does a kilo of potatoes cost?

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Qué comes?#In the shop|Go to the exercises]].

== Adjectives ==
=== &quot;E&quot; and Consonant Adjectives ===
In Spanish, clearly not all adjectives end in &quot;o&quot; or &quot;a&quot;. The good thing about these is that they stay the same, irrespective of gender.
* Adjectives ending in &quot;e&quot; add an &quot;s&quot; when in the plural.
* Adjectives ending in a consonant add an &quot;es&quot; when in the plural.

; Notes
* When an adjective (or indeed a noun) ends in ''z'', it changes to a ''c'' in plural, then adds the &quot;es&quot; (''feliz''/''felices'' &amp;mdash; &quot;happy&quot;).

; Examples
{| width=&quot;50%&quot;
|
* ''El hombre amable''
*: The friendly man
* ''La mujer amable''
*: The friendly woman
* ''Los niños amables''
*: The friendly boys
* ''Las niñas amables''
*: The friendly girls
|
* ''El hombre difícil''
*: The difficult man
* ''La mujer difícil''
*: The difficult woman
* ''Los niños difíciles''
*: The difficult boys
* ''Las niñas difíciles''
*: The difficult girls
|}

=== Colours ===
Colours in Spanish are just adjectives, so they still have to agree and go after the noun. They are shown below.

|-

| Negro
|}

; Notes
* Adjectives can  function as nouns if you add an article in front of them. For example, ''el morado'' means &quot;the purple one&quot;.
* ''Take care with Brown!''
** The plural form of ''marrón'' is ''marrones'' (without the accent);  ''las zanahorias marrones'' means &quot;the brown carrots&quot;.
** Marrones glacés are (in Spanish as in Italian) candied chestnuts.
** Hair and eyes color brown is usually  ''Castaño'' (chesnut).  Brown skin color is ''Moreno'' (tanned).  
* The adjective ''negrita'' (Literally:little black/bold face) is a term of familiarity or endearment is in Spanish and not to be confused with an offensive English expression.
* ''Naranja'' is only the noun form of the word; when used as an adjective, ''anaranjado'' is used.
* The color ''rosa'' ends in &quot;a&quot; even if applied to a masculine noun; ''el balón rosa'', &quot;the pink ball&quot;

; Examples
* ''La manzana verde''
*: The green apple
* ''Los huevos blancos''
*: The white eggs
* ''El queso amarillo''
*: The yellow cheese
* ''Las naranjas anaranjadas''
*: The orange oranges

      <comment>/* Places to Get Plugins */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A large portion of the power of Rails comes from the wide range of plugins which are available for download.

== Places to Get Plugins ==

* [http://agilewebdevelopment.com/ AgileWebDevelopment Plugin Repository] is currently the best location to find out about plugins available for Rails. This web site provides facilities for rating plugins and provides links to the plugin homepage and Subversion repository.
* [http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/Plugins Rails Wiki Page for Plugins] is the wiki page which contains a list of a large number of plugins.
* [http://www.railslodge.com RailsLodge Plugin Directory] is an easy to use plugin directory with sample code on how to install and use each plugin.

== Popular Plugins ==

Since other sites like the one above provide detailed information on plugins this book will not attempt to discuss every one of the popular plugins which are available, however there are some plugins which are used often enough and which are the source of enough questions that they are worth mentioning.

=== Acts_as_authenticated ===

This plugin provides a basis for authentication in your Rails app.

== Diving beetle Wikibugs ==

Hello Reece, I didn't realize the bug topic was just diving beetles and focused on predaceous d.b. So I made a new page. I want to know if that's ok. Thanks. [[User:Flolit|Flolit]] ([[User talk:Flolit|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Flolit|contribs]]) 16:21, 23 February 2011 (UTC)

== WCI 2011 : Accelerating Wikibooks : Would like to discuss! ==


Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:20, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

== De-sysop at [[WB:RFP]] ==

I've placed a notice on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3ARequests_for_permissions&amp;diff=2304819&amp;oldid=2304236 RFP] following our email exchange. Unless you change your mind before 15 May at that point someone will raise the de-sysop request at meta. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:20, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page.

== [[Mambo Open Source/Design/Convert templates from 4.5 to 4.5.x]] ==

I noticed that you created [[Mambo Open Source/Design/Convert templates from 4.5 to 4.5.x]] under the user name &quot;August.&quot; Is it, as it appears to be, redundant to [[Mambo Open Source/Convert templates from 4.5 to 4.5.x]]?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
Sometimes you have a large number of items to select from, for example you want to include one of many counties within a state to include in your search.  In the following example there are 87 counties that might be included in a search.  These county names are places in seven columns with 13 counties in all but the last column.

      &lt;/Item&gt;
   &lt;/EnumeratedValues&gt;
&lt;/CodeTable&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
The ideal way to do this would be to use a style sheet to pour the items into different cells of a table.  Unfortunately there is little documentation on how the itemset results can be styled into different tables.

==Convention over Configuration==
When starting to work with Rails you will find yourself looking at controllers and lots of views and models for your database. In order to reduce the need of heavy configuration, the team behind Rails has set up rules to ease up working with the application. These rules are not one-way. You may define your own rules but for the beginning (and for your further work, too) it's a good idea to stick to the conventions that Rails offers. These conventions will speed up development, keep your code concise and readable and - most important - these conventions allow you an easy navigation inside your application.

An example should show you how the conventions work together:
You have a database table called &lt;tt&gt;orders&lt;/tt&gt; with the primary key &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt;. The matching model is called &lt;tt&gt;order&lt;/tt&gt; and the controller, that handles all the logic is named &lt;tt&gt;orders_controller&lt;/tt&gt;. The view is split in different actions: if the controller has a &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;edit&lt;/tt&gt; action, there is also a new- and edit-view.

'''Colonial Goose''' is the name for a surprisingly effective preparation of roast leg of [[cookbook:lamb|lamb]].

Early colonial pioneers in [[cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] had sheep aplenty, but [[cookbook:goose|goose]] was relatively scarce. To prepare dishes similar to those they had back home in [[cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|England]] the pioneers were very inventive. Colonial Goose is now a recognised classic, with some restaurants featuring it as a main attraction at midwinter festivities (June 21 in NZ). It involves the careful boning out a leg of lamb, stuffing it with honey and dried apricots, and then marinating it in a red wine based marinade which even gives it the appearance of goose when cooked.

==Ingredients==
You need a large leg of [[cookbook:mutton|mutton]]. If you don’t know how to bone it out, ask your butcher to do it, stressing that you need to be able to stuff it.

;For the stuffing
* 30g (2 Tbsp) [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 1 large tablespoon clear [[cookbook:honey|honey]]
* 125g (1/2 Cup) dried [[cookbook:apricot|apricot]]s, finely [[cookbook:Dice|diced]]
* 1 medium sized [[cookbook:onion|onion]], finely diced
* 1 cup fresh [[cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]]
* quarter teaspoon of [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* quarter teaspoon of dried [[cookbook:thyme|thyme]]
* freshly ground [[cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 beaten [[cookbook:egg|egg]]

;For the marinade
* 250g (1 Cup) sliced [[cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s (about 1 or 2 medium carrots)
* two large [[cookbook:onion|onion]]s, sliced
* 1 [[cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 3 or 4 crushed [[cookbook:parsley|parsley]] stalks
* not quite full cup of [[cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]] such as claret

==Procedure==
#To prepare the stuffing, melt the butter and honey over low heat, add the other ingredients and combine well. 
#Force the stuffing into the cavity in the meat, and sew it up with fine string. 
#Place the leg into a plastic bag (which sits in a large bowl), and add the marinade mixture.
#The meat is best prepared just after breakfast, so it can then be regularly turned over in the marinade throughout the day. 
#Cook in oven at 180 °C for two hours but check on progress at 90 minutes. If the meat looks like over browning, it can be covered by foil. 
#Remove the string before carving. 
#Strain the marinade and use three or four tablespoons of the liquor to make [[cookbook:gravy|gravy]].

'''Lolly cake''' is a [[cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] cake which features [[cookbook:candy|lollies]] in the ingredients and thus can be thought of as &quot;candy cake&quot;.

The traditional candy used is Fruit Puffs which are like firm, slightly chewy [[cookbook:marshmallow|marshmallow]]s and are obviously fruity. Malt biscuits and coconut are also used and other ingredients can be added or substituted.

==Ingredients==
* 120 g (1.5 sticks) of [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 250 g of malt biscuits (one packet)
* 180 g of Fruit Puffs (one packet)
* 200 g (1/2 can or 7 ounces) [[cookbook:condensed milk|condensed milk]]
* shredded [[cookbook:coconut|coconut]]
* a pinch of [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]] (optional)

==Procedure==
# Crush the biscuits. They don't need to be a fine dust, some pieces can be left partially crushed to give the cake a nicer texture.
# Mix in cinnamon, if you want it.
# Warm the butter and condensed milk in the [[cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]] for 30 seconds until the butter is very soft. It's ok if the butter melts a bit.
# Cut the fruit puffs in half if you want or leave them whole.
# Mix the fruit puffs with the crushed biscuits, add the butter and condensed milk. Mix well. 
# Scoop up the mixture and roll it into a log shape, or take small amounts and roll into little balls.
# Roll in the shredded coconut until the log or each ball is completely covered.
# Place on a tray in the refrigerator and wait for it to harden. This takes a few hours. Put plastic wrap over the tray to keep the lolly cake moist.
# Cut cake while its still cold before it warms up again

==Install on Linux==
=== Install or update Ruby ===

It is important that you get the right version of the language.  Versions 1.8.2 and 1.8.4 are recommended.  1.8.3 has problems, and 1.8.5 (the current stable version) runs fine, but you will not be able to use breakpointer for debugging (a very handy tool).  So I recommend 1.8.4.

Get it from the offical [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ Ruby website]

Get it from the [http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/1_8_4/ SVN repository]

==== Debian ====
For Debian-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.), your best bet is to type:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install ruby -t '1.8.4'
sudo apt-get install irb rdoc&lt;/pre&gt;

This should install the Ruby language interpreter, the RDoc documentation generator, and irb command-line interpreter.

=== Install RubyGems ===

You should be able to obtain RubyGems by going to [http://docs.rubygems.org/ the Gems Website] and clicking the &quot;download&quot; link.  Choose the proper archive and install.

=== Install Rails ===

Get to the command-line and type: 
&lt;pre&gt;sudo gem install rails --include-dependencies &lt;/pre&gt;

==Install on OS X==
=== Option 1 ===
* [http://www.rubyonrails.org/down Download Ruby and RubyGems]
* Install Ruby
* Install RubyGems
* Get to the command-line and type: 
&lt;pre&gt;sudo gem install rails --include-dependencies&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Option 2 ===
* [http://locomotive.sourceforge.net/ Download Locomotive]
* Install Ruby on Rails software from Locomotive

=== Option 3 ===
* Use the broken Ruby installation on OSX 10.4 and [http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx follow this guide]

=== RMagic ===

A [[/RMagic Installation Shell Script/|shellscript]] has been made that will install everything you need to make RMagic work on your OS X box. Copy the contents, save it as a file and run the file through a terminal (by navigating to the file and type &lt;tt&gt;./name_of_file&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Installation on Windows==

To start, you will need the following components:
* Ruby
* RubyGems
* Rails
* a driver for your database

=== Ruby ===
Install Ruby as a regular application. You might need administrator privileges to install it successfully. Check the Ruby site for the latest version. The Ruby sites provides packages for all OS. Just follow their steps: [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ ruby website]

=== Gems ===
RubyGems is a packaged Ruby application. Using the &lt;tt&gt;gem&lt;/tt&gt; command helps you installing and deleting gem-packages. Gems allows you to install additional features for your application and easy management of already installed ones. RubyGems is now part of the standard library from Ruby version 1.9.

To verify availability, check the version of gems:
&lt;pre&gt;gem -v&lt;/pre&gt;

It should display the proper version (2.0.0 as of the writing of this book)

=== Rails ===
To install Rails, we can use our freshly installed gems (Rails is a gem). Use the console to type
&lt;pre&gt;gem install rails&lt;/pre&gt;

This downloads and install all the needed components on your system. After the installation is done, verify the installation by checking if you have the latest version:
&lt;pre&gt;rails -v&lt;/pre&gt;

It should display the current Rails version (2.3.2 as of writing this guide)

===DB Driver===
Rails supports a broad range of databases. The default database is SQLite3. You can specify the database you want to use when you first create your Rails project. But no worries, it can be altered any time. For this Wikibook, we will use SQLite3 as database.

To use SQLite3 on your system together with Ruby on Rails, download the latest dll files from [http://www.sqlite.org/download.html the sqlite website]. Choose the files that contains the dlls without TCL binding sqlitedll-3 x x.zip. After downloading, copy all the files inside the zip into your Ruby &lt;tt&gt;/bin&lt;/tt&gt; directory

At last, we need to install a gem for our database. Since we are using SQLite3 in this book, we want to install the proper gem:
&lt;pre&gt;gem install sqlite3-ruby --version 1.2.3 &lt;/pre&gt;

Even though 1.2.3 is not the current version, it will work as intended because newer version won't work in Windows

===Database Configuration===
If your first application is created, take a look inside the &lt;tt&gt;/config&lt;/tt&gt; folder. We need to tell Rails the name of our database and how to use it. Depending on your chosen database during the creation of the Rails application, the &lt;tt&gt;database.yml&lt;/tt&gt; file always look different. Because we decided to stay with the default SQLite3 database, the file will look something like this:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;# SQLite version 3.x
# gem install sqlite3-ruby (not necessary on OS X Leopard)
development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/development.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

# Warning: The database defined as &lt;tt&gt;test&lt;/tt&gt; will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run &lt;tt&gt;rake&lt;/tt&gt;.
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/test.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

production:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/production.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000&lt;/source&gt;


We may now give our database a proper name. Consider giving different names to your &quot;test&quot;- and to your &quot;production&quot;-database. This is especially important when working in a live-environment and you do not want bad data inside your database.

To create your database in our new project environment, we need to run
&lt;pre&gt;rake db:create&lt;/pre&gt;

Rake is a build in tool, that allows you to run many pre-made programs to ease up development. There is more functionality inside Rake then just creating a database. But one thing at a time. The &lt;tt&gt;db:create&lt;/tt&gt; commando creates the database with the given name (inside db.yml). If you're using SQLite3, you will find a *.sqlite3 file in the &lt;tt&gt;/db&lt;/tt&gt; folder. This is your database, stored in a single, handy file. For practicing and local development purposes, this is ideal because all your data is in one file that can be quickly read and written.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Aggregations==
Active Record implements aggregation through a macro-like class method called &lt;tt&gt;composed_of&lt;/tt&gt; for representing attributes as value objects. It expresses relationships like &quot;Account [is] composed of Money [among other things]&quot; or &quot;Person [is] composed of [an] address&quot;. Each call to the macro adds a description of how the value objects are created from the attributes of the entity object (when the entity is initialized either as a new object or from finding an existing object) and how it can be turned back into attributes (when the entity is saved to the database). 

Example:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    composed_of :balance, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Money&quot;, :mapping =&gt; %w(balance amount)
    composed_of :address, :mapping =&gt; [ %w(address_street street), %w(address_city city) ]
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

The customer class now has the following methods to manipulate the value objects:

   * Customer#balance, Customer#balance=(money)
   * Customer#address, Customer#address=(address)

These methods will operate with value objects like the ones described below:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
 class Money
   include Comparable
   attr_reader :amount, :currency
   EXCHANGE_RATES = { &quot;USD_TO_DKK&quot; =&gt; 6 }
 
   def initialize(amount, currency = &quot;USD&quot;)
     @amount, @currency = amount, currency
   end
 
   def exchange_to(other_currency)
     exchanged_amount = (amount * EXCHANGE_RATES[&quot;#{currency}_TO_#{other_currency}&quot;]).floor
     Money.new(exchanged_amount, other_currency)
   end
 
   def ==(other_money)
     amount == other_money.amount &amp;&amp; currency == other_money.currency
   end
 
   def &lt;=&gt;(other_money)
     if currency == other_money.currency
       amount &lt;=&gt; amount
     else
       amount &lt;=&gt; other_money.exchange_to(currency).amount
     end
   end
 end

 class Address
   attr_reader :street, :city
   def initialize(street, city)
     @street, @city = street, city
   end
 
   def close_to?(other_address)
     city == other_address.city
   end
 
   def ==(other_address)
     city == other_address.city &amp;&amp; street == other_address.street
   end
 end
&lt;/source&gt;

Now it’s possible to access attributes from the database through the value objects instead. If you choose to name the composition the same as the attributes name, it will be the only way to access that attribute. That’s the case with our balance attribute. You interact with the value objects just like you would any other attribute, though:

  customer.balance = Money.new(20)     # sets the Money value object and the attribute
  customer.balance                     # =&gt; Money value object
  customer.balance.exchanged_to(&quot;DKK&quot;) # =&gt; Money.new(120, &quot;DKK&quot;)
  customer.balance &gt; Money.new(10)     # =&gt; true
  customer.balance == Money.new(20)    # =&gt; true
  customer.balance &lt; Money.new(5)      # =&gt; false

Value objects can also be composed of multiple attributes such as the case of Address. The order of the mappings will determine the order of the parameters. Example:

  customer.address_street = &quot;Hyancintvej&quot;
  customer.address_city   = &quot;Copenhagen&quot;
  customer.address        # =&gt; Address.new(&quot;Hyancintvej&quot;, &quot;Copenhagen&quot;)
  customer.address = Address.new(&quot;May Street&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;)
  customer.address_street # =&gt; &quot;May Street&quot;
  customer.address_city   # =&gt; &quot;Chicago&quot;

=== Writing value objects ===

Value objects are immutable and interchangeable objects that represent a given value such as a Money object representing $5. Two Money objects both representing $5 should be equal (through methods such as == and &lt;=&gt; from Comparable if ranking makes sense). This is unlike entity objects where equality is determined by identity. An entity class such as Customer can easily have two different objects that both have an address on Hyancintvej. Entity identity is determined by object or relational unique identifiers (such as primary keys). Normal &lt;tt&gt;ActiveRecord::Base&lt;/tt&gt; classes are entity objects.

It’s also important to treat the value objects as immutable. Don‘t allow the Money object to have its amount changed after creation. Create a new money object with the new value instead. This is exemplified by the Money#exchanged_to method that returns a new value object instead of changing its own values. Active Record won’t persist value objects that have been changed through other means than the writer method.

The immutable requirement is enforced by Active Record by freezing any object assigned as a value object. Attempting to change it afterwards will result in a TypeError.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Calculations==
Calculations provide methods for calculating aggregate values of columns in ActiveRecord models.

=== Calculate ===

All calculations are handled through the calculate method. The calculate method accepts the name of the operation, the column name and any options. The options can be used to customize the query with :conditions, :order, :group, :having and :joins.

The supported calculations are:

* average
* sum
* minimum
* maximum
* count

The calculate method has two modes of working. If the :group option is ''not'' set then the result will be returned as a single numeric value (fixnum for count, float for average and the column type for everything else). If the :group option is set then the result is returned as an ordered Hash of the values and groups them by the :group column. The :group option takes either a column name or the name of a &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to&lt;/tt&gt; association.

'''Note''' that if a condition specified in the calculation results in no values returned from the underlying table then the calculate method will return &lt;tt&gt;nil&lt;/tt&gt;.

For example:

  values = Person.maximum(:age, :group =&gt; 'last_name')
  puts values[&quot;Drake&quot;]
  =&gt; 43

  drake  = Family.find_by_last_name('Drake')
  values = Person.maximum(:age, :group =&gt; :family) # Person belongs_to :family
  puts values[drake]
  =&gt; 43

  values.each do |family, max_age|
     ...
  end

=== Average ===

You can use the average method to calculate the average value for a particular column. For example:

  Person.average(:age)

Will return the average age of all people in the Person model.

An example of customizing the query:

  Person.average(:age, :conditions =&gt; ['age &gt;= ?', 55])

This would return the average age of people who are 55 or older.

=== Sum ===

The sum method will calculate the sum for a particular column. For example:

  Product.sum(:number_in_stock)

Will return the sum of products in stock.

An example of customizing the query:

  Product.sum(:number_in_stock, :conditions =&gt; ['category_id = ?', 10])

Will return the sum of the number of products which are in category 10 and in stock.

=== Minimum ===

The minimum method will calculate the minimum value for a particular column. For example:

  Donation.minimum(:amount)

Will return the lowest amount donated.

An example of customizing the query:

  Donation.minimum(:amount, :conditions =&gt; ['created_at &gt; ?', 1.year.ago])

This will return the lowest amount donated within the last year.

=== Maximum ===

The maximum method will calculate the maximum value for a particular column. For example:

  Donation.maximum(:amount)

Will return the largest amount donated.

An example of customizing the query:

  Donation.maximum(:amount, :conditions =&gt; ['created_at &gt; ?', 1.year.ago])

This will return the largest amount donated within the last year.

=== Count ===
Counts the number of items matching the condition(s).

  TestResult.count(:all)

Will return the number of TestResult objects in the database.

An example of customizing the query:

  TestResult.count(:all,:conditions=&gt;['starttime&gt;=?',Time.now-3600*24])

Will return the number of TestResult objects whose starttime field is within the last 24 hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==acts_as_list==
Acts as List will add methods to the ActiveRecord model which provide means for accessing the records as a list.

=== Directive ===

The &lt;tt&gt;acts_as_list&lt;/tt&gt; directive will add methods to the ActiveRecord object to make each instance act as an element in a list. &lt;tt&gt;acts_as_list&lt;/tt&gt; accepts two configuration options:

* &lt;tt&gt;column&lt;/tt&gt; : The name of the column used for keeping position (default is &lt;tt&gt;position&lt;/tt&gt;)
* &lt;tt&gt;scope&lt;/tt&gt; : Restricts what is to be considered a list. Given a symbol, it will attach &quot;_id&quot; (if that hasn’t been already) and use that as the foreign key restriction. It’s also possible to give it an entire string that is interpolated if you need a tighter scope than just a foreign key. Example: &lt;tt&gt;acts_as_list :scope =&gt; ‘todo_list_id = #{todo_list_id} AND completed = 0’&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Instance Methods ===

Each instance of a model which has the acts_as_list directive specified will automatically include methods for working with the records as a list:

* decrement_position
* first?
* higher_item
* in_list?
* increment_position
* insert_at
* last?
* lower_item
* move_higher
* move_lower
* move_to_bottom
* move_to_top
* remove_from_list

Methods which change the position of the item in the list affect the persistent data immediately. For example, a call to &lt;tt&gt;move_to_top&lt;/tt&gt; would be effective immediately.

=== Example ===

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_list
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Given three people in the database (Joe, Bob and Jane, initially in that order):

  p = Person.find_by_name('Joe')
  p.first?
  =&gt; true
  p.in_list?
  =&gt; true
  p.move_to_bottom
  p.first?
  =&gt; false
  p.last?
  =&gt; true

==acts_as_tree==
The &lt;tt&gt;acts_as_tree&lt;/tt&gt; directive will add methods to the ActiveRecord object to make each instance acts as a node in a tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Validations==
ActiveRecord supports a variety of model validation methods and allows for addition new methods as needed.

=== General Usage ===

For a complete reference of all validations check out the [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html#validation-helpers official guide] or the [http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations/ClassMethods.html API documentation]

Additionally you can apply a validation to one or more attributes using the &lt;tt&gt;validate_each&lt;/tt&gt; directive:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_each :first_name, :last_name do |record, attr, value|
      record.errors.add attr, 'starts with z.' if value[0] == ?z
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to define validations via custom methods or blocks:

* validate
* validate_on_create
* validate_on_update

For example:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
    class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      validate :validate_email

      def validate_email
        record.errors.add :email, 'Invalid email' unless email =~ /@/
      end
    end
&lt;/source&gt;

Normally validation occurs whenever a record is created or saved, however you can force validation to *not* occur using the &lt;tt&gt;save_with_validation&lt;/tt&gt; method passing @false@ as the argument.

===Important Validators===

====validates_acceptance_of====

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
validates_acceptance_of :play_rules
&lt;/source&gt;

If you need to check if the user has set or &quot;accepted&quot; a certain checkbox you can use this validation. In this case, the check box with the HTML attribute &quot;name='play_rules'&quot; needs to be checked in order to pass validation.

====validates_confirmation_of====

This validator checks if an input field has been entered correct both times. For example if you want the user to enter his password 2 times to make sure he enters the correct password (this is seen very often when registering for a site) this is the helper you want to use. To use it, make sure to define it correctly in your view (Note the '''_confirmation'''): 

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
&lt;%= text_field :user, :password%&gt;
&lt;%= text_field :user, :password_confirmation %&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

====validates_format_of====

&lt;tt&gt;validates_format_of&lt;/tt&gt; accepts a [[Regular Expressions|regular expression]] and checks for the input with the provided pattern given by the :with clause. Also note, that we used a customized message with this helper. This can be done with every validator in the same manner.

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
validates_format_of :username, :with =&gt; /\A[a-zA-Z]+\z/,  :message =&gt; &quot;Please use only regular letters as username&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

====validates_length_of/validates_size_of====

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
validates_length_of :username, :minimum =&gt; 5, :maximum =&gt; 50
validates_size_of :address, :in =&gt; 5..100
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;length_of/size_of&lt;/tt&gt; validator comes in handy if you need to check the input for a certain length of characters. In the example above, the username should not be longer than 50 characters and not shorter than 5. Alternatively you can specify a range that should be true in order to vaildate. Above the address should constist of 5 to 100 characters. Note that &lt;tt&gt;length_of&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;size_of/&lt;tt&gt; are the same.

====validates_numericality_of====

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
validates_numericality_of :amount_available
&lt;/source&gt;

Checks if the input is a number of any kind. To make sure, that the input is only an integer, you may use the optional &lt;tt&gt;:only_integer =&gt; true&lt;/tt&gt; command. There are some useful options with this command for example &lt;tt&gt;:greater_than =&gt; 100&lt;/tt&gt; makes sure that the given number will be greater then 100: so 101 will be the first valid number.

====validates_presence_of====

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
validates_presence_of :name
&lt;/source&gt;

One of the most basic validators, this one checks if anything has been inserted in the given form element (&quot;name&quot; in this case).

====validates_uniqueness_of====

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
validates_uniqueness_of :username
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, a bit of a more advanced validator: this one checks inside the database if the attribute is already taken or not. In this case, if the user chooses the username &quot;Paul&quot; and the name &quot;Paul&quot; already exists inside the username column of your database, it won't validate.

====with scope====

It can also validate whether the value of the specified attributes are unique based on multiple scope parameters. For example, making sure that a teacher can only be on the schedule once per semester for a particular class.

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
validates_uniqueness_of :teacher_id, :scope =&gt; [:semester_id, :class_id]
&lt;/source&gt;

When the record is created a check is performed to make sure that no record exists in the database with the given value for the specified attribute (that maps to a column). When the record is updated, the same check is made but disregarding the record itself.

=== Configuration Options ===

* message - Specifies a custom error message (default is: &quot;has already been taken&quot;)
* scope - One or more columns by which to limit the scope of the uniqueness constraint.
* if - Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine if the validation should occur (e.g. :if =&gt; :allow_validation, or :if =&gt; Proc.new { |user| user.signup_step &gt; 2 }). The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a true or false value.

When writing your validation keep in mind that you can mix all of these together and there are even more [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/activerecord_validations_callbacks.html#conditional-validation advanced functions] you might want to check out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ActiveRecord abstracts the connection to the database through connection adapters. It currently supports the following databases:

* DB2
* Firebird
* FrontBase
* MySQL
* OpenBase
* Oracle
* Postgresql
* SQL Lite
* SQL Server
* Sybase

If you need to access the current connection adapter directly you can do so through the &lt;tt&gt;ActiveRecord::Base.connection&lt;/tt&gt; class method.  All connection adapters share some common functionality which is defined in the following source files:

* active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb
* active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_specification.rb
* active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/database_statements.rb
* active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/quoting.rb

      <text xml:space="preserve">Active Record automatically timestamps during create and update operations if the table has fields created_at/created_on or updated_at/updated_on. This can be disabled on individual models by setting @self.record_timestamps = false@ in the class definition for the model. For example:

    class SomeModel &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      self.record_timestamps = false
    end

Although there is no explicit requirement, typically the _on fields should be date types, whereas the _at fields should be datetime types.

Timestamps are in the local timezone by default but can use UTC by setting &lt;tt&gt;ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone = :utc&lt;/tt&gt;. This will normally be specified in &lt;tt&gt;config/environment.rb&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Introduction ===

Associations are methods to connect 2 models. Operations on objects become quite simple. The association describes the role of relations that models are having with each other. ActiveRecord associations can be used to describe one-to-one (1:1), one-to-many (1:n) and many-to-many (n:m) relationships between models. There are several types of associations 

* ''belongs_to'' and
* ''has_one'' form a one-to-one relationship
* ''has_one :through'' is a different way to create a one-to-one relationship


* ''has_many'' and
* ''belongs_to'' form a one-to-many relation


* ''has_and_belongs_to_many'' or an alternative way
* ''has_many :through'' to create a many-to-many relationship

For all following examples, we assume the following 4 models:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

class Category &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

class Rating &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

class Tag &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end
&lt;/source&gt;

Also check out the ER-diagramm for the models below:

[[File:RoR_diagram_associations.jpg]]

===belongs_to===
The &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to&lt;/tt&gt; association sets up an one-to-one (1:1) or one-to-many (1:n) relationship to an other model.

In our example, one Rating belongs to exactly one Product, so we need to set up a &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to&lt;/tt&gt; association.

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :rating
end
&lt;/source&gt;

The product stores an id for a rating, both of them have a one-to-one Relationship. Meaning: One product belongs to one category and one product belongs to one rating.

===has_one===
The &lt;tt&gt;has_one&lt;/tt&gt; assocation is a one-to-one relation too. It declares that each instance of a product from the productmodel possesses only one rating_id.

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
class Rating&lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :product
end
&lt;/source&gt;

Since the rating and the product form a one-to-one relationship, it is up to us where we put the reference. Because we have put the reference (the rating_id) into the product (see belongs_to :rating into the product model), the association for the rating has to be has_one:product. &lt;tt&gt;Has_one&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to&lt;/tt&gt; always go together to form a relationship.

===has_many ===
This is a one-to-many connection to an other model. In this case, one category has many products. Pay attention to the spelling, if you use &lt;tt&gt;has_many&lt;/tt&gt;. The model that you want to reference needs to be written in plural.

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
class Category&lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products #note the plural here!
end

class Product&lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
end
&lt;/source&gt;

The category and the product are forming a one-to-many relationship. Since a category has many products we put the &lt;tt&gt;has_many&lt;/tt&gt; association inside the category. '''Note''' that also the product needs to contain a reference to the category. One product belongs to exactly one category, therefore we put &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to :category&lt;/tt&gt; inside the product model.

=== has_and_belongs_to_many ===

Also known as : ''HABTM''. 

&lt;tt&gt;Has_and_belongs_to_many&lt;/tt&gt; is the most complex association. You need to keep some things in mind:
Because of the way relational databases work, you can not set up a direct relationship. You need to create a joining table. This is easily done with migrations. If we want to create a HABTM association for our product and tag, the association for the joining table might look like following:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
class CreateProductTagJoinTable &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
   create_table :products_tags, :id =&gt; false do |t| #we DO NOT need the id here!
     t.integer :product_id #alternatively, we can write t.references :product
     t.integer :tag_id
   end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :products_tags
  end
end
&lt;/source&gt;

Because we do not need a primary key inside the join table, we use &lt;tt&gt;:id =&gt; false&lt;/tt&gt; to prevent the automatic creation of a primary key column. The naming of the table needs to be in alphabetical order. &quot;''P''&quot; is before &quot;''T''&quot; in the alphabet so the tablename has to be products_tags (note: plural).

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
class Product&lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :tags
end

class Tag&lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   has_and_belongs_to_many :products
end
&lt;/source&gt;

=== has_many :through ===
This association is an other way to form a many-to-many relation. Consider the following ER-Diagramm to show the relationship.

[[File:RoR_has_many_through.jpg]]

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
  belongs_to :supplier
end

class Supplier &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products
  has_many :categories, :through =&gt; :products
end

class Category&lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products
  has_many :suppliers, :through =&gt; :products
end
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead of using a join table we use another model for the relationship. If we want to find out which supplier is responsible for a specific category we need the product to link the models together.
This way we can store additional data inside a real model that also acts as a joining model. Whenever you need to store data that additionally belongs to association (e.g. the date of the creation) you might want to use this type of association.

===has_one :through===
As with &lt;tt&gt;has_many :through&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;the has_one :through&lt;/tt&gt; association uses an &quot;extra&quot; model to form a relation.

Consider this visual relationship:

[[File:RoR has one through.jpg]]

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
class Network &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :group
  has_one :user, :through =&gt;:group
end

class Group &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :network
  has_one :user
end

class User&lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :group
end
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Note:''' This example assumes that the membership inside a group is exlusive for each user.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Callbacks==
Callbacks provide a means of hooking into an ActiveRecord object's lifecycle.

=== Implementing Callbacks ===

There are four types of callbacks accepted by the callback macros:

* Method references (symbol)
* Callback objects
* Inline methods (using a proc)
* Inline eval methods (using a string) - deprecated.

Method references and callback objects are the recommended approaches, inline methods using a proc are sometimes appropriate (such as for creating mix-ins) and inline eval methods are deprecated.

==== Method Reference ====

The method reference callbacks work by specifying a protected or private method available in the object, like this:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    before_destroy :delete_parents
    
    private
      def delete_parents
        self.class.delete_all &quot;parent_id = #{id}&quot;
      end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Callback Objects ====

The callback objects have methods named after the callback, called with the record as the only parameter such as:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class BankAccount &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    before_save      EncryptionWrapper.new(&quot;credit_card_number&quot;)
    after_save       EncryptionWrapper.new(&quot;credit_card_number&quot;)
    after_initialize EncryptionWrapper.new(&quot;credit_card_number&quot;)
  end
  
  class EncryptionWrapper
    def initialize(attribute)
      @attribute = attribute
    end
    
    def before_save(record)
      record.credit_card_number = encrypt(record.credit_card_number)
    end
    
    def after_save(record)
      record.credit_card_number = decrypt(record.credit_card_number)
    end
    
    alias_method :after_find, :after_save
    
    private
      def encrypt(value)
        # Secrecy is committed
      end
      
      def decrypt(value)
        # Secrecy is unveiled
      end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

So you specify the object you want messaged on a given callback. When that callback is triggered the object has a method by the name of the callback messaged.

==== Proc ====

Example of using a Proc for a callback:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class Person
    before_save Proc.new { |model| model.do_something }
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Inline Eval ====

The callback macros usually accept a symbol for the method they’re supposed to run, but you can also pass a &quot;method string&quot; which will then be evaluated within the binding of the callback. Example:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    before_destroy 'self.class.delete_all &quot;parent_id = #{id}&quot;'
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Notice''' that single plings (’) are used so the #{id} part isn’t evaluated until the callback is triggered. Also note that these inline callbacks can be stacked just like the regular ones:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    before_destroy 'self.class.delete_all &quot;parent_id = #{id}&quot;',
                   'puts &quot;Evaluated after parents are destroyed&quot;'
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Callback Reference ===

==== before_save ====

This method is called before an ActiveRecord object is saved.

==== after_save ====

Once the active record object saved some method will be fired in that scenario we have to use the after_save callback.

==== before_create ====
called before creating a new object of the model

==== after_create ====
Called after creating new object and just before saving the records

==== before_update ====

==== after_update ====

==== before_validation ====

==== after_validation ====

{{&lt;math&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;{{BookCat}}{{BookCat}}&lt;includeonly&gt;✗✓⇔⇓&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/math&gt;}}==== before_validation_on_create ====

==== after_validation_on_create ====

==== before_validation_on_update ====

==== after_validation_on_update ====

==== before_destroy ====

==== after_destroy ====

=== Partially Documented Callbacks ===

The following callbacks are partially documented. Their use is discouraged because of &lt;ref name=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;&quot;Because after_find and after_initialize are called for each object found and instantiated by a finder, such as Base.find(:all), we’ve had to implement a simple performance constraint (50% more speed on a simple test case). Unlike all the other callbacks, after_find and after_initialize will only be run if an explicit implementation is defined (def after_find). In that case, all of the callback types will be called.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; performance issues.

==== after_find ====

The after_find callback is only executed if there is an explicit implementation in the model class. It will be called for each object returned from a find, and thus can potentially affect performance as noted in the &lt;ref name=&quot;performance&quot;/&gt; Rails API Documentation.

==== after_initialize ====

The after_initialize method is only executed if there is an explicit implementation in the model class. It will be called whenever an ActiveRecord model is initialized. It will be called for each object returned from a find, and thus can potentially affect performance as noted in the &lt;ref name=&quot;performance&quot;/&gt; Rails API documentation.

==Naming==
===Basics===
ActiveRecord uses convention for naming classes, tables and fields. Rails uses convention over configuration. ActiveRecord expects applications to follow certain naming conventions. These conventions extend from file naming, class naming, table naming and more. By default classes are singular, tables are plural, primary keys are &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; and foreign keys are &lt;tt&gt;''table''_id&lt;/tt&gt;.

'''Note:''' There are also certain names that are reserved and should not be used in your model for attributes outside of the conventions defined in Rails:

* &lt;tt&gt;lock_version&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; - This is only used when you have single table inheritance and must contain a class name
* &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; - Reserved for primary keys
* &lt;tt&gt;table_name_count&lt;/tt&gt; - Reserved for counter cache
* &lt;tt&gt;position&lt;/tt&gt; - Reserved for acts_as_list
* &lt;tt&gt;parent_id&lt;/tt&gt; - Reserved for acts_as_tree
* &lt;tt&gt;lft&lt;/tt&gt; - Reserved for acts_as_nested_set
* &lt;tt&gt;rgt&lt;/tt&gt; - Reserved for acts_as_nested_set
* &lt;tt&gt;quote&lt;/tt&gt; - Method in ActiveRecord::Base which is used to quote SQL
* &lt;tt&gt;template&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Classes ===

ActiveRecord classes are named in singular form.

=== Tables ===

Tables for ActiveRecord objects are named in plural form by default. This pluralization is often an initial point of contention for new Rails users.

If you need to change the table name there are several ways to override the default behavior.

==== Set use_pluralization ====

In &lt;tt&gt;config/environment.rb&lt;/tt&gt; you can specify &lt;tt&gt;ActiveRecord::Base.use_pluralization = false&lt;/tt&gt;. This will apply to all ActiveRecord objects.

==== Use set_table_name ====

You can call &lt;tt&gt;set_table_name&lt;/tt&gt; to specify a custom table name for a particular model.

For example:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class Dog &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    set_table_name 'dog'
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Override table_name ====

You can also override the &lt;tt&gt;table_name&lt;/tt&gt; method and return a value.

For example:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class Dog &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    def table_name
      'dog'
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Building a Migration */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Migrations==
&lt;ref&gt;'''Excerpts modified and republished from Steve Eichert's [http://www.emxsoftware.com/RubyOnRails/Ruby+on+Rails+Migrations+Explained Ruby on rails Migrations Explained] article.'''&lt;/ref&gt; Migrations meant to solve the problem of rolling out changes to your database.  By defining the changes to your database schema in Ruby files, development teams can ensure that all changes to the database are properly versioned.  Additionally migrations help to ensure that rolling out changes to fellow developers as well as other servers (development, QA, production) is handled in a consistent and manageable fashion.

=== Building a Migration ===
You can either build the migration on its own using

&lt;pre&gt;ruby script/generate migration Category&lt;/pre&gt;

and write the specific commands afterwards (if you want to create custom SQL, this is the way to go) or you can create a model that comes with the migration using

&lt;pre&gt;ruby script/generate model Category name:string amount:integer&lt;/pre&gt;

The console tells you that there were some files created and some already existent. As mentioned before, Rails will never overwrite existing files unless stated otherwise.

Now lets take a look at the migration
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
# 20090409120944_create_categories.rb
class CreateCategories &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :categories do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.integer :amount

      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :categories
  end
end
&lt;/source&gt;

First of all, take a look at the number (''20090409120944'') in front of your file. This is the timestamp of your file and important for the creation of the database tables. This timestamp will always be different, depending on the exact time of the creation of your migration. The idea behind this is to have a &quot;history&quot; of all your migrations available.

But why is this important?

Imagine that you work on a Rails project and you create tables, alter columns or remove columns from your database via migrations. After some time, your client changes his mind and he wants only very basic features and you already started to create advanced features and altered the database. Because you can't remember all the changes that went into the database and their order, you will either spend a lot of time working on the database to have the &quot;old&quot; state available or you have to start from scratch because it would take too long to remember and redo all changes.
This is where migration come in handy, because of the timestamp, Rails is able to recognize the changes in their actual order and all changes can be undone easily. Never alter the timestamp manually. This will certainly cause problems. For more on those topic, check out the &quot;[[Ruby_on_Rails/ActiveRecord/Migrations#Managing_Migrations |managing migrations]]&quot; section

Speaking of undoing and redoing: notice the two methods inside your migration &lt;tt&gt;self.up&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;self.down&lt;/tt&gt;. Both of them do exactly the opposite of each other. While &lt;tt&gt;self.up&lt;/tt&gt; creates our categories table with all columns, &lt;tt&gt;self.down&lt;/tt&gt; removes (drops) the table from the database with all its contents(!!). When Rails sees that the migration has not been moved to the database, it will use the &lt;tt&gt;self.up&lt;/tt&gt; method, if you undo the migration, the &lt;tt&gt;self.down&lt;/tt&gt; method gets executed. This way you can make sure that you will always be able to go back to a past state of your database. Keep in mind when writing own migrations always include a &lt;tt&gt;self.up&lt;/tt&gt; and a &lt;tt&gt;self.down&lt;/tt&gt; method to assure that the database state will be consistent after an rollback.

OK, let's start with the migration itself:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
create_table :categories do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.integer :amount
      t.timestamps
end
&lt;/source&gt;

We want to create a table called categories(&lt;tt&gt;create_table :categories&lt;/tt&gt;) that has a name and an amount column. Additionally Rails adds an timestamp for us where it will store the creation date and the update date for each row. Rails will also create an primary key called '''model'''_id that auto-increments (1,2,3,...) with every row.

You can choose from a variety of datatypes that go with ActiveRecord. The most common types are:

* string
* text
* integer
* decimal
* timestamp
* references
* boolean

But wait, there is not yet a single table nor column in our database. We need to write the migration file into the database.

&lt;pre&gt;rake db:migrate&lt;/pre&gt;

handles this job. The command is able to create the table and all the necessary columns inside the table. This command is not limited to migrating a single file so you can migrate an unlimited number of files at once. Rake also knows what migrations are already in the database so it won't overwrite your tables. For more info see &quot;Managing Migrations&quot;.

To add a connection between your tables we want to add references in our model. References are comparable to foreign keys (Rails doesn't use foreign keys by default because not all databases can handle foreign keys but you can write custom SQL to make use of foreign keys) and tell your table where to look for further data.

Let's add another model to our already existent database. We want to create a category that has multiple products. So we need to reference this product in our category. We want to create a model:

&lt;pre&gt;ruby script/generate model Products name:string category:references&lt;/pre&gt;

and insert it into the database

&lt;pre&gt;rake db:migrate&lt;/pre&gt;

Note the type :references for the category. This tells Rails to create a column inside the database that holds a reference to our category. Inside our database there is now a &lt;tt&gt;category_id&lt;/tt&gt; column for our product. (In order to work with these two models, we need to add associations inside our models, see Associations)

===Managing Migrations===
We already talked about how migrations can help you to organise your database in a very convenient manner. Now we will take a look at how this is achieved. You already know that the timestamp in the filename tells rails when the migration was created and Rake know what migrations are already inside the database.

To restore the state of the database as it was, say 5 migrations before the current, we can use
  $rake db:rollback STEP=5
This will undo the last 5 migrations that have been committed to the database.

To redo the last 5 steps, we can use a similar command
  $ rake db:migrate:redo STEP=5

You can also rollback or redo a specific version of a migration state, you just need to provide the timestamp:
  $ rake db:migrate:up VERSION=20080906120000
Choose whether you want the db_migrate:up method to be executed or the db_migrate:down method

Keep in mind, that restoring your database to a previous state will delete already inserted data completely!

=== Schema Method Reference ===

The following methods are available to define your schema changes in Ruby:

* &lt;tt&gt;create_table(name, options)&lt;/tt&gt;: Creates a table called name and makes the table object available to a block that adds columns to it, following the same format as &lt;tt&gt;add_column&lt;/tt&gt;. See example above. The options hash is for fragments like &quot;DEFAULT CHARSET=UTF-8&quot; that are appended to the create table definition.
* &lt;tt&gt;drop_table(name)&lt;/tt&gt;: Drops the table called name.
* &lt;tt&gt;rename_table(old_name, new_name)&lt;/tt&gt;: Renames the table called old_name to new_name.
* &lt;tt&gt;add_column(table_name, column_name, type, options)&lt;/tt&gt;: Adds a new column to the table called table_name named column_name specified to be one of the following types: :string, :text, :integer, :float, :datetime, :timestamp, :time, :date, :binary, :boolean. A default value can be specified by passing an options hash like { :default =&gt; 11 }.
* &lt;tt&gt;rename_column(table_name, column_name, new_column_name)&lt;/tt&gt;: Renames a column but keeps the type and content.
* &lt;tt&gt;change_column(table_name, column_name, type, options)&lt;/tt&gt;: Changes the column to a different type using the same parameters as &lt;tt&gt;add_column&lt;/tt&gt;.
* &lt;tt&gt;remove_column(table_name, column_name)&lt;/tt&gt;: Removes the column named column_name from the table called table_name.
* &lt;tt&gt;add_index(table_name, column_names, index_type, index_name)&lt;/tt&gt;: Add a new index with the name of the column, or index_name (if specified) on the column(s). Specify an optional index_type (e.g. UNIQUE).
* &lt;tt&gt;remove_index(table_name, index_name)&lt;/tt&gt;: Remove the index specified by index_name.

=== Command Reference ===

*&lt;tt&gt;rake db:create[:all]&lt;/tt&gt;: If :all not specified then create the database defined in config/database.yml for the current RAILS_ENV.  If :all is specified then create all of the databases defined in config/database.yml.
*&lt;tt&gt;rake db:fixtures:load&lt;/tt&gt;: Load fixtures into the current environment's database.  Load specific fixtures using FIXTURES=x,y
*&lt;tt&gt;rake db:migrate [VERSION=n]&lt;/tt&gt;: Migrate the database through scripts in db/migrate. Target specific version with VERSION=n
*&lt;tt&gt;rake db:migrate:redo [STEP=n]&lt;/tt&gt;: (2.0.2) Revert the database by rolling back &quot;STEP&quot; number of VERSIONS and re-applying migrations.
*&lt;tt&gt;rake db:migrate:reset&lt;/tt&gt;: (2.0.2) Drop the database, create it and then re-apply all migrations.  The considerations outlined in the note to rake db:create apply.  
*&lt;tt&gt;rake db:reset&lt;/tt&gt;: Drop and re-create database using db/schema.rb.  The considerations outlined in the note to rake db:create apply.
*&lt;tt&gt;rake db:rollback [STEP=N]&lt;/tt&gt;: (2.0.2) Revert migration 1 or n STEPs back.
*&lt;tt&gt;rake db:schema:dump&lt;/tt&gt;: Create a db/schema.rb file that can be portably used against any DB supported by AR
*&lt;tt&gt;rake db:schema:load&lt;/tt&gt;: Load a schema.rb file into the database

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Attributes==
ActiveRecord attributes are automatically determined from the underlying database schema. 

=== Basic Usage ===

All of the columns in a table are accessible through methods on the ActiveRecord model. For example:

Consider the following migration:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
# 20090409120944_create_products.rb
class CreateProducts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.float :price
      t.integer :amount
    end
  end
#...
end
&lt;/source&gt;

Because Rails has created a primary key for us and called it &quot;id&quot; we can already search for it inside the database. We can interact with the database via the build-in console:
  ruby script/console
gives us a console that let us communicate with Rails.

Before we can select data from our database it is time to insert some products

  &gt;&gt; Product.new(:name =&gt; &quot;my book&quot;, :price =&gt; 14.99, :amount =&gt; 4).save
if everything went right, Rails will show you a &lt;tt&gt;=&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; inside the console... Let's add some more products

  &gt;&gt; Product.new(:name =&gt; &quot;my movie&quot;, :price =&gt; 4.89 :amount =&gt; 1).save

  &gt;&gt; Product.new(:name =&gt; &quot;my cd&quot;, :price =&gt; 9.98, :amount =&gt; 12).save

Now we have 3 products in our database, going from 1 to 3...

So let's select the first entry

  &gt;&gt;Product.find(1)

and Rails tells you what it found for this id (remember: find only works when there is a Rails generated id as primary key)

  =&gt; #&lt;Product: id=1, name=&quot;my book&quot; ..... &gt;

so we are able to tell Rails to look for our entry with a specific id. But what happens when we have thousands of entries in our database? We can't remember every id of a Product, so Rails offers a very nifty solution:

  &gt;&gt;Product.find_by_name(&quot;my book&quot;)

  =&gt; #&lt;Product: id=1, name=&quot;my book&quot; ..... &gt;

and Rails gives as the output we wanted. This not only works for the name, but for all columns in the database. We could also use &lt;tt&gt;.find_by_price&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;.find_by_amount&lt;/tt&gt;

Or you can search for multiple products with their id:

&gt;&gt;Product.find(1,3)

=&gt; #&lt;Product: id=1, name=&quot;my book&quot; ..... &gt;&lt;Product: id=3, name=&quot;my cd&quot; ..... &gt;

You can also search for all products

  &gt;&gt;Product.all

or

  &gt;&gt;Products.find(:all)

for the first or the last product in your table

  &gt;&gt;Product.first/last

or

  &gt;&gt;Product.find(:first/:last)

If you want more controll over your data, you can use many build-in options or use custom SQL.
Let's try to find our data in descending order (3,2,1)

  &gt;&gt;Product.all(:order =&gt; &quot;id DESC&quot;)

or alternatively

  &gt;&gt;Product.find(:all, :order =&gt; &quot;id DESC&quot;)

will give you all your prodcuts, starting with the last inserted id - in our case: 3


When we query our database we get lots of infos we are not really interested in such as the &quot;created_at&quot; and &quot;updated_at&quot; column. We only want to take a look at our id and the name so we may use

  &gt;&gt;Product.all(:select =&gt; &quot;id, name&quot;)

or

  &gt;&gt;Product.find(:all, :select =&gt; &quot;id, name&quot;)

This method will only display the name and the id of our products making it way more readabel.

When searching for data, keep in mind that you can combine all these methods to your liking. To see more possibilities check out the [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#find-options RoR guide] or the [http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002208 API].

=== Overriding Attributes ===

You can override any of the accessor methods in your ActiveRecord model classes in order to add logic. For example:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
  class Product
    def name
      self[:name] || 'Unknown'
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

  p = Product.new

  p.name

  =&gt; &quot;Unknown&quot;

  p.name = 'my disk'

  p.name

  =&gt; &quot;my disk&quot;

You can access any attribute via &lt;tt&gt;self[attribute_name]&lt;/tt&gt; (to get) or &lt;tt&gt;self[attribute_name]=&lt;/tt&gt; (to set).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Using the &lt;tt&gt;rails&lt;/tt&gt; command ==

On the command line type &lt;code&gt;rails ''appname''&lt;/code&gt; replacing ''appname'' with the name of your application. This will create a directory called ''appname'' and will create the Rails application directory structure under that directory. The ''appname'' directory will be called the home directory for the application from here on.
Typical list of folders and files in rails application would look like following
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;DIR&gt;          app
&lt;DIR&gt;          components
&lt;DIR&gt;          config
&lt;DIR&gt;          db
&lt;DIR&gt;          doc
&lt;DIR&gt;          lib
&lt;DIR&gt;          log
&lt;DIR&gt;          public
&lt;FILE&gt;         Rakefile
&lt;FILE&gt;         README
&lt;DIR&gt;          script
&lt;DIR&gt;          test
&lt;DIR&gt;          tmp
&lt;DIR&gt;          vendor
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Using SVN ==

[http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2006/12/28/stop-using-the-rails-command/] If you are using Subversion another option for creating new Rails apps is to create a fresh Rails app using the &lt;tt&gt;rails&lt;/tt&gt; command, making changes that are common (i.e. add .ignore options for Subversion, set up standard plugins you always use, add database.yml.example, etc) and then commit it to Subversion under something like 'railsapp'. You can then check out into a new directory to construct the Rails app:

  svn copy /rails/railsapp /rails/new_app
  svn checkout /rails/new_app

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|Ruby on Rails|Getting Started/Creating the application|Built-In Rails Tools/Generators}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Running the Rails server==
=== The bundled WEBrick server ===
As you already know, Rails comes with an integrated server: WEBrick. WEBrick is a Ruby-written server to get you started right from the beginning. There are alternatives such as Mongrel or Phusion Passenger (formerly known as mod_ruby, a module for Apache). For local(!!) development WEBrick is a good choice.

To start up the server, simply open up a console, navigate to your Rails application and type
* On Windows, OS X and Linux: &lt;pre&gt;ruby script/server &lt;/pre&gt;

After some seconds, WEBrick has been initialized and you are ready to go. The console with the web server needs to stay open, otherwise the server will shut down. To see if everything is working as expected, open up your web browser and navigate to
&lt;pre&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Ruby on Rails Welcome aboard.png|thumb|Ruby on Rails Welcome aboard]]

You should see the default Rails start page saying that everything is working correctly. You can view the details page (name) for the current version of your environment and some other variables. The server console not only runs the server, but shows how the requests by the browser are processed, including the amount of queries, the used SQL syntax or the data from your submitted forms.
 
There are several options, including but not limited to:
* &lt;tt&gt; -p port&lt;/tt&gt;: Specify the port to run on
* &lt;tt&gt;-b ip&lt;/tt&gt;: Bind to a specific IP address
* &lt;tt&gt;-e name&lt;/tt&gt;: Use a specific Rails environment (like &lt;tt&gt;production&lt;/tt&gt;)
* &lt;tt&gt;-d&lt;/tt&gt;: Run in daemon mode
* &lt;tt&gt;-h&lt;/tt&gt;: Display a help message with all command-line options

=== Mongrel ===
To start a single mongrel instance:
* On all platforms: 
&lt;pre&gt;mongrel_rails start&lt;/pre&gt;
This should be executed in the root directory of the Rails app you wish to run on Mongrel. There are numerous options you can specify, including:

* &lt;tt&gt;-p port&lt;/tt&gt;: run on a specific port
* &lt;tt&gt;-e environment&lt;/tt&gt;: execute with a specific Rails environment, like &lt;tt&gt;production&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;-d&lt;/tt&gt;: run in daemon mode

Dialogue needs to be revised.
&quot;Regular&quot; is hardly ever used in Spanish in this context. Other suggested words could be &quot;bien,&quot; &quot;fenómeno&quot; (Arg.), &quot;tranquilo/a.&quot;

the link to the sound file for &quot;¿Cómo se deletrea?&quot; points to the sound file for &quot;Que tál&quot;
:Yes, I was about to tell the same. I am removing the incorrect link from this featured book.

== about double r ==

&quot;el pupitre&quot; is not considered a separate letter (and has never been).

More correct imposible --[[User:AleG2|AleG2]] 20:12, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

== about v and b ==

Though in some regions (e.g. Valladolid) v and b are pronounced differently, the norm is that they sound exactly the same (as can be seen in http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?LEMA=v&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;TIPO_HTML=2)

== more about v and b ==

The author's explanation that there is &quot;no difference&quot; in the pronunciation of b and v is just dead wrong.  It only applies in some circumstances.  There are many examples where this would not apply.  For example ventana (window) and vento (wind) are both pronounced with a V sound (as in Victor) not a B sound.  You would never hear a native speaker pronounce it otherwise.  This is such a basic elemental mistake that it calls into question the authority of the author to write this e-book.  The author does not appear to be a native Spanish speaker.  If you are just beginning to learn Spanish, I think you would be better served to find a textbook written by a native Spanish speaker with the proper credentials to back it up.  The last thing you want to do is invest a lot of time learning a new language only to find out you learned a bunch of bad habits.
:There are numerous authors of this page and the person who inserted this sentence on 4th April 2007 was editing anonymously, so we can't know how much of the rest of the book they are responsible for. If you see an error, you are free to correct it. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 02:21, 1 January 2010 (UTC)

== Alphabet ==

This lesson page makes a few apparently inaccurate claims about the Spanish alphabet:
# that &quot;ch&quot; is no longer considered a separate letter but merely a digraph
# that &quot;ll&quot; is no longer considered a separate letter but merely a digraph
# that &quot;rr&quot; is considered a distinct Spanish letter

From my understanding, &quot;rr&quot; has never been considered a separate letter.  &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;ll&quot; are still considered separate letters, except for collation purposes.  Is there some reference to back up those claims?  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 03:52, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

Well, I was bold and changed the lesson page per my understanding.  Feel free to revert and explain if you think I'm mistaken.  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 04:09, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

== Double 'r' ==
I'm afraid this is not correct:
&quot;r at the beginning of a word or when doubled (rr), it is pronounced as a full trill (IPA: /r/), [b]elsewhere[/b] it is a single-tap trill (IPA: /ɾ/)&quot;
'R' is also pronounced like rr in the middle of some words like 'enredo', 'alrededor', 'enrabietar'
It is used in words in wich the 'r' takes place as the begining of a syllable. So I am going to put 'syllable' instead of 'word'. I hope not to use my deficient English.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:84.125.39.236|84.125.39.236]] ([[User talk:84.125.39.236|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/84.125.39.236|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: Well, as you point out, it is trilled after an ''n'' or ''l''.  It's also trilled after an ''s'' (e.g. in ''Israel''), but otherwise, it's just tapped at the beginning of a syllable.   I've adjusted your edit accordingly.  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] ([[User talk:Rodasmith|talk]]) 15:35, 1 July 2008 (UTC)

== Fatal in English ==

Personally, I've never heard &quot;fatal&quot; as a response to &quot;how are you&quot; in English... if this part is to be included, it might be useful to mention where this usage is common... would it be reasonable to say that the Spanish &quot;fatal&quot; corresponds well to English &quot;terrible&quot;?

After re-reading the section, the table itself seems okay, translating Spanish 'fatal' as English 'very bad'... the confusing part (to me) is the sentence that reads: 

* Similarly, &quot;Fatal&quot; in the U.S. might mean a ruined manicure or a fight with one´s girlfriend, but would be reserved more for things like losing one's home in a Spanish-speaking country.

Since &quot;fatal&quot; is also a word in English, perhaps the writer means:

&quot;very bad&quot; in the U.S. ... but &quot;fatal&quot; in Spanish  ...

Or, perhaps there are dialects that use &quot;fatal&quot; in English in these situations, but I'm not familiar with them.

== mal or malo ==

the exercise &quot;How are you&quot; lists five words to be put in order - in the exercise the word 'mal' is used but in the answers it becomes 'malo' - can this be corrected by someone who knows the answer?</text>

Revise dialogue. &quot;¿Te gusta los deportes?&quot; should say &quot;¿Te gustan los deportes?&quot; since GUSTAR refers to the object, which, in this sentence is plural (los deportes). I had never heard &quot;chifla&quot; in that context before. I would use &quot;Me enloquece jugar...&quot; or &quot;Disfruto jugar...&quot; The Spanish structure for the verb JUGAR is &quot;jugar a.&quot; Therefore, the phrase should read &quot;... jugar al baloncesto.&quot; &quot;Practico la natación&quot; is awkward. Phrase should read &quot;Practico natación.&quot; Readers should note that the verb conjugation for ''Vosotros'' is used mainly in Spain, not Latin America.

: Thanks for that!
:* &quot;gusta&quot; was a typo; I've got it correct further down.
:* Can we not say &quot;Me gusta jugar...&quot;?
:* My bad. Sorry; it is now corrected
:* My bad again; fixed.
:* Yes, I'm still not sure where to put that note - probably in lesson one.
: Once again, thanks again! If you asee any more errors anywhere, please feel free to leave me a note, or fix them yourself. Saludos! [[User:Celestianpower|Celestianpower]] 11:48, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;Que&quot; without accent in a question ==

Two of the examples say &quot;Que opinas sobre&quot; (four say &quot;Qué opinas sobre&quot;). Are those typos? --[[User:AVRS|AVRS]] ([[User talk:AVRS|talk]]) 11:28, 7 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

== &quot;The difference between if and case&quot; ==

The section &quot;The difference between if and case&quot; distinguishes between the &quot;if&quot; expression and the &quot;case&quot; expression, but I do not think this is correct.  The Haskell 98 specification states that an &quot;if&quot; expression (if x then 1 else 2) is always equivalent to a &quot;case&quot; expression (case x of { True -&gt; 1 ; False -&gt; 2 }).

==Transwikiing==

Well, here's the nutshell:

*1. Go to [[Special:Import]] and bookmark the Import dialog.
*2. Find the wikipedia article (hopefully the same name), copy the name, then open the import dialog and paste the name in the window.
*3. If it's a Cookbook article, put it in the Cookbook namespace (make sure there's not already a cookbook article first!). Otherwise, just leave it as default (Transwiki). Leave it default oftherwise (you ''do'' want all revisions). 
*4. click Import, and wait for confirmation.
*5a. If it's a cookbook article, add the template {{tl|Cookwork}}. Then add the template {{tl|copied recipe}} or {{tl|Copied to Wikibooks Cookbook}} to the wikipedia article.
*5b. If it's any other sort of article, tag the module with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:twwp-2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (you '''must''' subst: that template!), and add either {{tl|Copied to Wikibooks}} or {{tl|copied howto}} to the wikipedia article.

::LOL... yeah, fun for me is using the admin tools is a creative manner, rather than in a destructive manner (blocking, deleting, etc.). Keep in mind that what brought me to wikibooks in the first place was a series of run-ins with the &quot;how-to police&quot;... I much prefer ''preserving'' material to ''excluding'' it.

== New clean up list ==

Herby, please consider checking out [[User:Iamunknown/Cleanup/Possible duplicate images|this list]], ''but only when you have nothing else in the world to do.'' It is a list of images that have the term ''wikipedia'' on their image description page. I have a hunch that many of them are likely now redundant to ones at Commons. Granted, dealing with this in an organised manner is definitely [[meta:instruction creep|instruction creep]]. Specifically, it is an example of &quot;when someone thinks 'This [project] would be better if everyone was supposed to [clean these up]'....&quot; But if we have extra time, I think it would be appropriate to deal with these. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 05:58, 9 December 2006 (UTC)


== [[Cookbook:Kefir]] and finding kefir grains ==

G'day Herby. Welcome to my nightmare - keeping a link to where people can find free kefir grains. I just noticed that you removed the SPAM link from the Kefir recipe, along with a link to where free kefir grains can be found. I get this ''all the time'' on WP. I personally think that this is one example where an EL is particularly relevant, because kefir is nothing without kefir grains; you can't ferment milk into kefir without them, and you can't walk into a supermarket and find them.

What I've proposed on WP is a link to a page on my website that has links to all the places people can get kefir grains. See [[w:Talk:Kefir#Finding Kefir Grains]]. Of course, since I'm affiliated with that page, I can't add the link to the kefir article without breaking EL policy - catch 22. 

If you think that this is a fair solution, please add [http://www.webaware.com.au/ferment/finding_kefir.php this link] to the [[Cookbook:Kefir]] recipe. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 21:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

* Thanks, mate. We'll see where it goes from there, I guess. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 12:42, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

== Re:  Broken Links ==

Thanks for the heads up.  I'm actually editing them as we speak.  The \[\[google:...\]\] interlinks don't seem to work correctly.  Google will only accept +'s for spaces, and mediawiki will put underscores in the google query.  I'm still getting used to the mediawiki interface.  In many ways it really abuses the senses.

Personally, I think anyone who's making a lot of work for other people (be they vandals, spammers, mass-non-licenced-uploaders, people who ignore naming policy, etc.) should simply be blocked until they make an effort to learn how to do things the right way. Of course there's no policy for blocking people for being a pain in the ass, but there's also no policy about '''not''' blocking people for being a pain in the ass. Just use your better judgement and make sure to lay out your reasons, and keep in mind that you might be setting a precedent, so set the bar high. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

== Blender 3D ==

I noticed you added {{tl|Cleanup-NC}} to [[Blender 3D]], which seems to act more as a disambigious page in a way or a portal for multiple books rather a single book using old naming. It even says its a &quot;collection of books&quot;. Is there something I might of missed for adding it? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:04, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

:Not sure I completely understand you - the pages of Blender 3D are incorrectly named with &quot;:&quot;?  I thought that the &quot;cleanup&quot; template indicated that?  If I'm wrong it would be good to know - haven't had a lot of time today, thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:24, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

:: The cleanup template is used to indicate a single book using the old naming convension of &quot;Book Title:Page Name&quot;, but in the case of Blender 3D there are multiple books in which the &quot;:&quot; happens to be part of the title name rather dividing book title and a page name. So there is nothing incorrectly named, I don't think. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:32, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

:::In a sense I think I understand your point about the &quot;top level&quot; page tho I thought I'd seen similar elsewhere but are you saying that [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] for example is correctly named?  If so I'm misunderstanding something. I do appreciate your help (&amp; patience!). --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: I'm saying &quot;Blender 3D: Noob to Pro&quot; is probably correctly named, because thats the entire name of the book. As in &quot;Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Chapter&quot;. At least thats been my impression. I think where your probably getting confused is &quot;Blender 3D: Noob to Pro&quot; is the title of a book, rather then &quot;Blender 3D&quot; being the title of a book. Everything in &quot;Programming:&quot; on the other hand needs to be properly renamed because it is not the name of a book, it is being used as a pseudo-namespace for a ton of books, which aren't named &quot;Programming:Language&quot;. I hope this hasn't confused you furthor. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:53, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

Hello, I'm Stevebritgimp (not signed in over here on wikibooks - and don't know how this all works - single log in would be nice) - anyway, Herby, you have made noises about Devon stuff, and I was wondering where the action was.

Hi Herby! There's still a couple pages that need to be fixed.

== Re: That user you blocked ==

I did a checkuser on that username you gave me (Bobobo, or something), and It came up clean. We don't currently have a policy linking our actions against vandals to those taken at wikipedia. I am generally of the opinion that when users come here, they have a clean slate regardless of what they have done on another project. For instance, some people could become very disgruntled with the wikipedia atmosphere, and misbehave on that server, without any intention of similar misbehavior on this project. That's just me though, there isnt a policy on the matter either way. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:49, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community.

Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== proxies list ==

Hi Herby, See [[v:Wikiversity:Open_Proxies#Todo_list|this page on wikiversity]] for a long (and growing) list of proxies. The best thing to do would probably copy those tables to wikibooks so they can be checked off locally. Obviously you don't been to do the ones on the first list: already blocked.

I chatted with some admins on #Wikipedia about the user you blocked: definitely a good idea, though blocking the proxies should also take care of that. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:Yup, unselect &quot;anon only&quot;... we want full, indefinite blocks. Try doing one through [[m:WM:OP/B]] first, and copy the contents of the comment field so you can add that to the ones you're doing from the wikiversity lists, since this allows maintenance bots from meta to check through it (sometimes an open proxy gets closed, and needs to be freed up again). 
:Yes, keep that user blocked. The clean slate does not apply to this particular user, as she has caused enormous problems on many wikis. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:15, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

== Checkuser when you are on please ==

Willy with a bag of Mumfum occured to be using zombie/OP IP (as Wikipedia says). I think it's worth reporting every IP used by mumfum vandal, as he tends to re-use them.

== Mumfum Vandalism, mailiing list ==

I sent a message to the checkuser-l mailinglist about the Mumfum vandals, and this is the reply I got:

:Well, annoying as it might be, if they are using confirmed proxies, it may actually end up better in the long run to let them go at it for a while and just revert quietly, while they bring you a convenient list of open proxies to block, avoiding potential later abuses. What I've seen happen over the last couple months on en.wp in these situations is that they just add whatever the word of the day is to the anti-vandal bots and let them do the reverting, while we sit back and block the proxies. --Essjay

On one hand, we are collecting a list of IP addresses (whether they are open proxies or not I dont know). Also, we don't have any anti-vandal bots. You used to be a wikipedian, do you know of a good anti-vandalism bot that we could get a copy of? something that would just find and destroy instances of the word &quot;mumfum&quot; would save us all alot of work. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:56, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

Also, I was chating with someone on IRC yesterday, and apparently the last time checkusers were approved a &quot;talk page spamming&quot; campaign was undertaken to bring the votes to 25+ (it's of course hard to get 25+ people to vote on anything around here :).

Thanks for the explanation on the Checkuser stuff.  BTW, I asked my contributors to vote in the RFA, and two did.  They were all for anti-vandalism empowerment.  [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 15:33, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

== Checkuser vote ==

There is one other thing thats minor, that I didn't mention since its not something I would necessary use to vote against somone I don't think. I sometimes have a hard time understanding your reasons for blocking from the reasons you give in the block. The ones that have come to mind are the ones that say something along the lines of 'DNSstuff unknown &quot;writer&quot;'. I had to have someone explain to me that it was referring to the unknown vandal. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:10, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

:Meant to say but I've appreciated your help in the past (&amp; hope it will continue!).  The DNS stuff - ok, first block I did I got told off by Derbeth (no but you know what I mean) because I was too lenient.

'DNSstuff unknown &quot;writer&quot;' didn't really explain in my mind the reason for the block was due to 1) being the unknown vandal and 2) came up as potential compromised/spam server. I probably would of said &quot;vandal with compromised/spam server according to DNSstuff.com's spam search&quot;, to try to be clear, but I know I'm not always clear myself, like I'm not always sure what to put in the summery field for most of my edits. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:27, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Herby, I keep meaning to mention that to you. I use &quot;nice site vandal&quot; when blocking those IPs.

You should have received that flag setting already, but now I granted it and got to use my new supercool bureaucrat powers. There is &quot;Category:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter&quot; which should provide a filter for all pages to apply the change to. Anything not in that category we can deal with on our own (and might be garbage anyway). Go try out your new bot.

Steal away. I've sort of hacked my main en.wiki user page down, since I'm having a lot of persona problems and I don't want to deal with Wikipedia right now, but you can glance over it in the history.

== Sounds good ==

Sounds good, do you think I should be more conservative with my tagging? And is &quot;unused fair use image&quot; an OK reason to speedy, because come to think of it no mention of it is made on the help page concerning it. If it is there's plenty more of those where that came from, all of those came right off the &quot;unused images&quot; list, many of those also don't have tags (I presume because it's before we HAD the proper tags, since many such pages still list what the licence is, just without the tag).

== Good Saturday morning to you! ==

Good morning, Herby! I just saw your recent edits and thought I'd say hello. I'll be going to bed now as I'm many time zones behind you, and it is late into the night for me. If you celebrate the holidays, have a wonderful holiday season; if you don't, then have a wonderful weekend! Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 10:25, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

== Hi ==

Most people who create an account never make any edits at all. So I'm reluctant to do or say anything at present. I have sometimes blocked new accounts before they have edited, but that's only when the name is clearly abusive or is almost certainly created by a vandal (eg the name is very similar to that recently used by a set of accounts to vandalise). In the instance you quote, I don't think that's the case. I do agree with you though that it would be prudent for that person, if they do become a regular contributor, to change their username. If that is the case, we can deal with it easily enough later. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:22, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

== Barnstars, etc ==

there have been a few barnstars flying around here and there recently, but unfortunately wikibooks just doesnt have the barnstar infrastructure that wikipedia has. Maybe we should start creating such an infrastructure?  We could upload all the necessary pictures, and create templates, and all that stuff. If i could get the whole &quot;wikiprojects&quot; thing set up, we could do it as a wikiproject too. So many things need to get done around here... --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:48, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

== Thanks for the Barnstar == 

I have been busy at [http://dmoz.org dmoz] recently what with the servers being opened back up, so my editing at Wikijunior has really dropped off. You can see some of what I have been working on over there at the [http://www.miscellanea.de/newsletter/2006Winter/interview_rdkeating25.html ODP Newsletter]. That's really the only reason for my activity dropping off on Wikijunior. I still have personal goals related to Wikijunior though, and am looking forward to launching &quot;Wikijunior Bugs&quot; (crosses fingers) at the first of the year. 8) (belated signature) --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 23:18, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
: It's funny you should say that. There's a couple of Wikipedia related projects going on at dmoz now. There's a knowledge-mapping project to place Wikipedia articles within the dmoz taxonomy, and there's a project to mine links from Wikipedia articles listed as having too many links and brush up the related categories so they are good resources for Wikipedia to link to. 

: I'm not one of those who defends dmoz in all situations, but we are pretty good at recognizing search engine spam. 

: I'm not sure what I could do with admin privileges that I can't already and if I'd want to do those things even if I could. ;-) --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 13:36, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

== [[Urantia United - The Universal Father]] ==

Hi Kkawohl,

The [[Urantia United - The Universal Father]] book looks like it was copied from some other work. Please be aware that [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_for_source_texts|source texts]] are inapproriate at Wikibooks without proper [[Wikibooks:Annotated_texts|annotation]].

Because the topic is on theology, I'd furthermore advise you to read the [[WB:NPOV|Neutral Point of View]] policy carefully since such subject matters have proven difficult to handle well. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:03, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

: Thank you for your advise. I've moved Urantia United to WikiSource.  [[User:Kkawohl|Kkawohl]]

[http://rake.rubyforge.org/ Rake] is a Ruby build tool like make and Ant.

* Rakefiles (rake’s version of Makefiles) are completely defined in standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
* Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.
* Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating file names and paths.
* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier.

Rake can be executed with the following command-line options:

* &lt;tt&gt;--dry-run&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt;: Do a dry run without executing actions
* &lt;tt&gt;--help&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-H&lt;/tt&gt;: Display a help message
* &lt;tt&gt;--libdir=LIBDIR&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-I LIBDIR&lt;/tt&gt;: Include LIBDIR in the search path for required modules
* &lt;tt&gt;--rakelibdir=RAKELIBDIR&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-R RAKELIBDIR&lt;/tt&gt;: Auto-import any .rake files in RAKELIBDIR. (default is 'rakelib')
* &lt;tt&gt;--nosearch&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-N&lt;/tt&gt;: Do not search parent directories for the Rakefile
* &lt;tt&gt;--prereqs&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-P&lt;/tt&gt;: Display the tasks and dependencies, then exit
* &lt;tt&gt;--quiet&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-q&lt;/tt&gt;: Do not log messages to standard output
* &lt;tt&gt;--rakefile=FILE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-f FILE&lt;/tt&gt;: Use FILE as the rakefile
* &lt;tt&gt;--require=MODULE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-r MODULE&lt;/tt&gt;: Require MODULE before executing rakefile
* &lt;tt&gt;--silent&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-s&lt;/tt&gt;: Like &lt;tt&gt;--quiet&lt;/tt&gt;, but also suppresses the 'in directory' announcement
* &lt;tt&gt;--tasks[=PATTERN]&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-T [PATTERN]&lt;/tt&gt;: Display the tasks (matching optional PATTERN) with descriptions, then exit
* &lt;tt&gt;--trace&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-t&lt;/tt&gt;: Turn on invoke/execute tracing, enable full backtrace
* &lt;tt&gt;--usage&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-h&lt;/tt&gt;: Display usage
* &lt;tt&gt;--verbose&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-v&lt;/tt&gt;: Log message to standard output (default)
* &lt;tt&gt;--version&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-V&lt;/tt&gt;: Display the program version
* &lt;tt&gt;--classic-namespace&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-C&lt;/tt&gt;: Put Task and FileTask in the top level namespace

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a wide variety of documentation sources for Rails, including books, websites, weblogs and much more.

==Plugins==
* [http://github.com/search?q=rails Github]
:Github offers loads of plug-ins. Rails itself is also hosted there. Be sure to take a good look at them when searching for a specific plug-in or gem.
* [http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/#popular_plugins Popular Plugins]
:Take at look at this list with pretty popular Rails plug-ins when searching for more common tasks

A large portion of the power of Rails comes from the wide range of plugins which are available for download.

== Websites ==

* [http://api.rubyonrails.com/ Rails API Documentation]
* [http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/ Rails Wiki]
:The official wiki for Rails, not yet complete, but it gets better all the time
* [http://www.railslodge.com/ Ruby on Rails plugin directory]
* [http://www.yoyobrain.com/cardboxes/preview/863 Learning Ruby on Rails]
* [http://rubyonrails.org/documentation Rails Documentation]
:The official Rails site with everything you need to get started: guides, wikis and the very well documented API
* [http://railscasts.com/ Videocasts for Rails]
:Very popular site with advanced and many in-sight video casts. Be sure to check this site out. It offers great content and well presented videos!
* [http://railsforphp.com/ Rails for PHP]
:If you have problems wrapping your mind around some of the Ruby commands and have experience in PHP, this site will feel like heaven. Most of the most often used PHP functions are listed there with the proper Ruby/Ruby on Rails equivalent

== Books ==
* Agile Web Development with Ruby on Rails

==Development Tools==
* [http://e-texteditor.com/ Rails Editor]
:Are you jealous of the great editor used on Railscasts? Not working an a Mac? This is the program for you: features the same functionality, look&amp;feel and provides excellent Rails support. [Commercial - Windows]
* [http://aptana.com/rails Open Source Development Suite Aptana]
:comes with nice but complex Rails support, all Rake tasks are integrated into this IDE and you can easily switch between matching [Open Source and Commercial - All platforms]
* [http://www.jetbrains.com/ Editor for Rails]
:Highly featured editor with rather new Rails support [Commercial - All plattforms]
* [http://www.netbeans.org/features/ruby/index.html All-in-one IDE NetBeans]
:offers Rails support out of the box. Support for many other languages and many plug-ins [Free - All Platforms]
* [http://radrails.sourceforge.net/ Rails and Eclipse]
:If you want to work with eclipse, get RadRails. Note that the last update was submitted 2006. If you need an eclipse-like environment, try Aptana. It is built upon the eclipse platform.

== Weblogs ==
Weblogs are one of the best ways to find out what you can do with rails - and if you know what you're looking for google can help you find them. That said, there are quite a few that are worth reading regularly.

* [http://ryandaigle.com/ Ryan's Scraps]
:Insights into the framework from a core team member. Covers features that are new in edge.
* [http://nubyonrails.com/ Nuby on Rails]
:Centers on the web design aspects of rails.

== Mailing List ==
The Ruby on Rails Talk mailing list is a good place to ask questions: [http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk RubyOnRails-Talk Mailing List]

== Freenode ROR Channel ==
The Freenode IRC channel for Ruby on Rails is a good place to talk Rails with other developers. Please try to keep the signal-to-noise ratio at a minimum though: [irc://irc.freenode.net/rubyonrails RubyOnRails IRC Channel]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The migration system have a lot of helpers you can use to do the stuff you want to do. Sometimes you need to do stuff that's not covered by these helpers, though. That's where the &lt;tt&gt;execute&lt;/tt&gt; helper comes in.

== The execute helper ==

The execute helper is a method for use in migrations that takes one attribute - a SQL command, as a string, and will execute the SQL just like any other migration. It will also break the migration process (like the migration helpers do) if the SQL server returned an error when executing the command.

== Usefull queries ==

=== Add a default value to a column ===

&lt;pre&gt;
def self.up
  execute &quot;ALTER TABLE items ALTER parent_id SET DEFAULT 0&quot;
end

def self.down
  execute &quot;ALTER TABLE items ALTER parent_id DROP DEFAULT&quot;
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Add a primary key ===

&lt;pre&gt;
def self.up
  execute &quot;ALTER TABLE taggings ADD id int(11) DEFAULT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY&quot;
end

def self.down
  remove_column :taggings, :id
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

I'm a Wikipedian, I often see content in Wikipedia that I think would benefit Wikibooks. So I opened an account here to move stuff across. But now I fear I've taken up another habit that will sap my time (they don't call us &quot;users&quot; for no reason) ;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Layout Files ==
In the previous chapter you learned how to render output to the default layout or to a special layout provided by you. You may have already looked inside such a layout file. Its default content will be similar to
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Products: &lt;%= controller.action_name %&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag 'scaffold' %&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color: green&quot;&gt;&lt;%= flash[:notice] %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

So you now notice some things that are typical for a layout: the head section has an embedded tag for a stylesheet and the complete content is represented using a yield-tag

===Asset tags===
All asset tags, such as the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;stylesheet_link_tag&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; are little helpers that generate the proper HTML for you. You can use this tags to embed CSS, Java Script and images or to provide RSS-feeds.

To embedded Javascript or CSS, you can use the according helpers:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= javascript_include_tag &quot;my_javascript&quot; %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
or if you want to include CSS
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &quot;my_css&quot; %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

All these files are located in the public directory &lt;tt&gt;public/javascripts&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;public/stylesheets&lt;/tt&gt;. There is no need to provide the extension as Rails will handle it automatically. If you want to include multiple files just provide all the file names inside the tags:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &quot;my_css&quot;, &quot;my_other_css&quot; %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Of course these files can be placed anywhere in your application, just be sure to provide the proper path:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &quot;my_css&quot;, &quot;files/stylesheet&quot; %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

To load all files inside your &lt;tt&gt;public/javascripts&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;public/styleheets&lt;/tt&gt; use the appropriate tag with &lt;tt&gt;:all&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= javascript_include_tag :all %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

When embedding CSS you can specify the media attribute inside the tag:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &quot;my_print&quot;, media =&gt; &quot;print&quot; %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

No modern web site is complete without using pictures and graphices so Rails provides you with its own image tag:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= image_tag &quot;my_image&quot; %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
As with JavaScript or CSS the Rails will look into &lt;tt&gt;public/images&lt;/tt&gt; by default to find the proper picture. '''Note:''' that you do not need to tell Rails if you use .jpg, .gif or .png!
You can also provide a custom path and HTML attributes
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= image_tag &quot;images/my_image&quot;, :height =&gt; 50, :width =&gt; 50, :alt =&gt; &quot;This is my image&quot; %&gt;&lt;/source&gt; 

===Yield===
Whenever you come across &quot;yield&quot; you will know that this is sort of a placeholder for the view that will be displayed inside your layout, but you are not limited to using a single yield:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;%= yield :header %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

To get access to the &lt;tt&gt;:header&lt;/tt&gt; you can use the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;content_for&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; method. So with the above example, that might be:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;% content_for :header do %&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Hello Rails - This is my header&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
Named yields can be used for menus, footers or sidebars to ease up maintainance. Just put them in your code and they will be placed in the right place.

===Partials===
It is time for a little more DRY. If you have a lot of HTML code that repeats itself in many different views (such as [[Ruby on Rails/ActionView/Forms|forms]], dynamic menus,...) you might want to consider using partials: With partials, you just move the code that you use often into a separate file and place a link inside the files that should use your partials
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; &quot;form&quot; %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
This will look inside the folder from where the partial gets called for a file named &lt;tt&gt;_form.html.erb&lt;/tt&gt;. Keep in mind to use an underscore in your filename to tell Rails that it is a partial.

To move your partial to a seperate folder use
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; &quot;partials/form&quot; %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
will look in &quot;partials&quot; for a file called &lt;tt&gt;_form.html.erb&lt;/tt&gt;

Overall partials are a very good way to minimize the effort of copying the same code over and over, but to keep the needed code in single files that can be altered easily and used as often as you want to.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ERb (Embedded Ruby) is the default template language included with Rails. It is very similar to PHP, JSP and ASP.


== Tags for Embedding Ruby ==

* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;%= %&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will render the result returned from the embedded Ruby expression as text
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;% %&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will execute the embedded expression without rendering the result
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;% -%&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will execute the embedded expression without rendering the result and will suppress trailing whitespace
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;%- %&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will execute the embedded expression without rendering the result and will suppress leading whitespace
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;%# %&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will cause the embedded expression to be parsed as a comment

== ERb Utility Methods ==

There are a couple utility methods which are part of ERb that you may encounter when developing Rails applications:

* &lt;tt&gt;h(s)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;html_escape(s)&lt;/tt&gt; - A utility method for escaping HTML tag characters in the supplied String &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;u(s)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;url_encode(s)&lt;/tt&gt; - A utility method for encoding the String &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt; as a URL

== Example ==

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;People&lt;/h1&gt;
    
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;% @people.each do |person| -%&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= person.first_name %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;% end -%&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

If @people contained an array of Person instances, this would render something like the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;People&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Bob&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Joe&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Tips ==

* While it is possible to put business logic in the view this should be avoided. Business logic belongs in the model where it can be easily tested and reused.
* The line &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%= render :partial =&amp;gt; '/layouts/menu' %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will render a the partial &lt;tt&gt;app/views/layouts/_menu&lt;/tt&gt;.

name=Mirror of Erised|
type=Magical device|
features=mirror|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]}}

== Overview ==
The '''''Mirror of Erised''''' is a mirror that shows the user his or her heart's deepest desire. There is &quot;an inscription carved around the top&quot;:
:''Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi''

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] stumbles upon this mirror when, attempting to evade capture by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] after starting a book screaming in the Restricted section of the library, Harry retreats through an open door. In the Mirror, he sees himself and his father and mother, standing behind him, and all his extended family behind them. Harry then brings [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] to the mirror to show Ron his family; Ron, instead, sees himself as Head Boy holding the Quidditch cup.

Harry revisits the Mirror several times during Christmas vacation, until he is surprised there one night by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. Dumbledore tells Harry that the mirror is very dangerous, that people have starved to death sitting in front of it, but that he is glad Harry found it and so now somewhat understands its power. Dumbledore goes on to say that he will now move the mirror to a new hiding place, and asks Harry to not go looking for it. Harry impulsively asks Dumbledore what he sees in the mirror, and Dumbledore replies that he sees himself holding a pair of warm, woolly socks. He goes on to explain that he always seems to be given books as gifts, and never has enough socks. Later, Harry thinks to himself that this had been an awfully intrusive question.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|final chamber]] under the trap door, Harry finds the mirror once again. This time, Harry, forced to look into it, sees himself with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] in his pocket. As he sees this, the stone itself appears in his pocket.

Later, recovering in the Hospital Wing, he speaks with Professor Dumbledore concerning the mirror. Dumbledore says that he was rather proud of the enchantment that placed the Stone within the mirror. The only person who could retrieve the Stone would be one who dearly wanted the Stone but did not want to use it.

In the final book in the series, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Harry thinks back to the Mirror of Erised, and wonders again about his question to Dumbledore: was Dumbledore entirely truthful when he told Harry what he saw in the Mirror? Could it be that Dumbledore, like Harry, saw his family standing behind him?

== Analysis ==

The inscription over the mirror, when reversed, reads:

:''ishow no tyo urfac ebu tyo urhe arts desire''

Which, by changing the spacing and punctuation, reveals:
 
:''I show, not your face, but your heart's desire''

Thus, the inscription does describe exactly what it does, and many readers, seeing what is clearly reversed text, have deciphered the text quickly. Why Harry does not do so is uncertain, as he is clearly aware of it. It is possible that Harry has been exposed to so much in the way of apparently nonsensical text, with the spell incantations and other writings being often almost nonsense words, that he no longer automatically tries to decipher writings that he does not immediately understand.

One must wonder somewhat about the nature of the enchantment protecting the Stone. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] says that he sees himself holding the Stone and presenting it to his Master; by the letter of the enchantment, the Mirror should have surrendered the Stone to him as he was not planning to use it himself, only to give it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Two possibilities appear to account for its failure to release the Stone. One is that, as Voldemort was at that point riding the back of Quirrell's head, and was in some manner sharing life force with Quirrell, the Mirror might not have been able to distinguish Quirrell from Voldemort, and Voldemort certainly wanted to use the Stone. Alternately, and more likely given the individuals involved, Quirrell could have simply been lying about not having any desire to use the Stone himself, and thus lying about what he saw in the Mirror.

There is a very large question that remains unanswered concerning this mirror. Clearly it has some ability to read minds, it must in order to know what one's &quot;heart's desire&quot; is. But Harry has no conscious memory of what his parents look like. Yet, the Mirror is able to show them to him. We know that the Mirror's depiction is accurate because, in later books, and later in this book, Harry will find artifacts that show his parents and will not discover that the Mirror got it wrong. How can the Mirror know something that Harry himself does not? Similarly, neither Harry nor Quirrell has seen the Stone. How can the Mirror show it to them, if they don't know what it looks like? In this latter case, the Mirror could present the mental image each had of the Stone; it is enough to show something that the individual recognizes as &quot;the Philosopher's Stone,&quot; even if it does not match the reality of what the Stone looks like.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
#What does Harry's vision in the Mirror of Erised say about his character?
#What do you think other characters would see in the Mirror of Erised?
#What parallels can we draw between the Mirror of Erised and the effects of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggarts]]?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Given that the mirror can read minds to some limited extent, there are two possible explanations for the mirror being able to show Harry his parents. The first, obviously, is that the mirror may be able to see more of Harry's memories than Harry can himself; we do retain memories from infancy, though we often cannot access them, and the Mirror, being magical, may be able to reach those memories that Harry cannot. Additionally, it is possible that the mirror could have seen what Harry's parents look like through his scar, which we find out in the final book is an indicator of the soul shard of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s that remains in Harry. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we find out that Voldemort recalls both Harry's parents and their appearance, and so presumably that information is available through the linkage between their souls.

One interesting fact from [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=11 the author's web site]: The author herself was offered the role of Harry's mother in the Mirror Erised scene of the first Harry Potter film, and turned it down. The reason she gives for her refusal seems somewhat contrived, making it probable that there are other reasons, perhaps some that she did not want to go into at that point in the series. One strong possibility is that even at this early point in the writing of the series, the author was aware that Harry's mother was going to have a larger role in the series than could be expected, given that she had died before the first book. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]] would not, as one would suppose from the first book, be restricted to roles in which she simply smiled and waved, in the Mirror and in Wizard photographs. More than that, she would have a speaking role in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|duel in the Cemetery]], and would appear three times in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]: once in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] memory of the night of her death, extensively in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape's]] memories, and finally when summoned by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]]. It is entirely possible that, knowing her own limitation as an actress, and knowing the role Lily played in the series as a whole, the author believed the role in the context of the entire series would be beyond her capabilities, and elected to stay with what she could do well.

* Type &lt;tt&gt;rake&lt;/tt&gt; and the Rails application's tests should run
** ''Will they work out of the box?  What is the expected output?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes things just go wrong. Here are some common errors and potential ways to fix them.

== Missing Socket File ==

If you see the following error:

  No such file or directory - /tmp/mysql.sock

It means that Rails is looking for the default /tmp/mysql.sock which may not exist. There are several options to fix this:

* Find the correct location of the mysql.sock file and add a socket: option to the database.yml
* Find the correct location of the mysql.sock file and add a symlink from /tmp/mysql.sock
* If you cannot find the mysql.sock file then perhaps MySQL is not running or is installed incorrectly.

You can find out what tasks are currently available to Rake with the &lt;tt&gt;rake -T&lt;/tt&gt; command. The tasks below are common and used on regular basis.

== Database Tasks ==

* &lt;tt&gt;rake db:migrate [VERSION=x]&lt;/tt&gt;: Execute the migrations to the specified version. If the version is omitted then it will migrate to the highest version possible.
* &lt;tt&gt;rake db:sessions:clear&lt;/tt&gt;: Clear all of the sessions in the database.

== Test Tasks ==

* &lt;tt&gt;rake test:units&lt;/tt&gt;: Execute unit tests

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structure ==

How should we structure this page? When I started this, I didn't think of printing usability at all, and broke everything into tiny bits and pieces. But making it usable for print makes it less usable for web. And in my opinion, web usability is way more important than print usability in a programmers book. Programmers is most likely online, and will most likely prefer to use the browser. I don't see the value of being able to print the entire book and make it look book-like when it's printed. --[[User:Leethal|Leethal]] 19:00, 30 December 2006 (UTC)


And I disagree (of course) :-) I know there will be people who want to print it and read it. We talked about a PDF version - any luck on figuring out how to make that happen? --[[User:Aeden|Aeden]] 02:16, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

There is a similar process for creating PDFs and printed books put together by PediaPress, and now available with very little effort on Wikipedia. I've used the PediaPress to edit a book from Wikipedia articles, and you get back a beautiful well-made thick paperback with ample footnotes and a good index. I recommend them highly. -- [[User:WillWare|WillWare]] ([[User talk:WillWare|talk]]) 14:06, 14 March 2010 (UTC)

== Might want to cull &quot;culled&quot; ==

You might want to reconsider this wording:

: The content in this WikiBook has been culled together from a variety of sources . . .

&quot;Cull&quot; means: &quot;Something picked out from others, especially something rejected because of inferior quality.&quot; (American Heritage Dictionary, 3rd edition)

{{Rquote|right|Peer learning has been suggested by many as an educational innovation that can transform students’ learning experiences.|Blumenfeld, Krajcik, Marx, and Soloway, 1996}}  

Multiple studies have demonstrated the success of working in groups for the benefit of the student.  Group work to be effective has to be integrated into the classroom on an everyday basis.  (Chowne, Baines, Basset, Blatchford, and Rubie-Davies).  The idea of group work arises from a general movement toward student-centered learning and partly from the recommendations of social constructivist research whereas it is becoming important to provide students with an opportunity to articulate and reflect their own ideas.  (Bennett, Campbell, Hogarth, Lubben, and Robinson, 2005).  Lectures are no longer considered a sufficient means to instruct students.  Although group work is important in the classroom, it should be considered a part of the instructional method...not a replacement.  Student to student interaction helps improve attitudes toward school, develop thinking skills, foster achievement, and assist in improving relationship skills.  (Blumenfeld, Krajcik, Marx, and Soloway, 1996).

==Collaborative Learning==
Collaborative learning is a method in which students are organized together to explore a question or create a project.  It can happen anywhere or at anytime when a group of students work together.  There are numerous ways to structure group work even though the end goal is academics and/or improved people skills.  The activities can range from highly structured when the students learn skills and definitions to open-ended when the students have to synthesize a question or identify a problem and then solve the question.  Ultimately, the activities &quot;center on the students' exploration or application of the course material, not just the teacher's presentation, or explication of it.”  (Smith and MacGregor, 1992).

Collaborative learning is based on assumptions about the learners and the learning process.  Whereas learning is an active, constructive process that requires the student to work actively and integrate new information with what they already know.  They are synthesizing something new with the information and ideas.  Learning depends on contexts in which activities begin with problems that the students must gather facts and ideas to solve.  This technique challenges the students &quot;to practice and develop higher order reasoning and problem solving skills.”  (Smith and MacGregor, 1992).  Learners are diverse and each student has a different perspective to bring to the classroom based on their backgrounds, learning style, experiences, and aspirations.  Lastly, learning is inherently social.  Student interaction stimulates new thought and feedback that often leads to a better understanding of the subject for the students.

The benefits to small group learning can include celebration of diversity, acknowledgement of individual differences, interpersonal development, actively involving the students in the learning process, and the opportunities for more feedback.  (Thirteen Ed online).

===Cooperative Learning===
Cooperative learning is a specific type of collaborative learning in which students work together in groups on a guided structured activity assigned by the teacher that improve their understanding of the topics explored.  Three conditions are necessary for cooperative learning to work a) students feel safe and challenged; b) groups need to be small enough so that everyone can contribute; and the tasks assigned must be clearly defined.  (Thirteen Ed online).

The characteristics of cooperative learning are:
# Learners actively participate
# Teachers learn and learner’s sometimes teach
# Respect is given to every member
# Projects and questions interest and challenge students
# Diversity is celebrated, and all contributions are valued
# Students learn skill for resolving conflicts when they arise
# Members draw on past experience and knowledge
# Goals are clearly defined and used as a ''guide''
# Research tools like the internet are valued
# Students are inverted in their own learning. (Smith, and MacGregor, 1992)

====Elements of Cooperative Learning====
It is under these conditions that cooperative efforts may be more productive than individually.

# Positive interdependence means that each member's participation is required.  Each member has a unique contribution to make an effort because of his/her resources and/or role and task responsibilities.
# Face to face interaction is important for the concept of teaching each other's knowledge to the other, discussion of the concepts, checking for comprehension of the topic, and the ability to orally explain how to solve problems.
# Individual and group accountability means that no one student has to do all the work.  The intention of this condition is that groups are kept small intentionally to maximize group accountability.  Additionally, each member may be required to present their groups work in front of the class.  Members may also be observed and recorded with the frequency of his/her contributions to the group.   
# Interpersonal and small-group skills are important to develop the social skills or leadership, decision -making, trust building, communication, and conflict management.
# Group processing is the final step when members discuss how well they are achieving the goals set and maintaining equal partnership in the group.  If they see unequal distribution of the workload now would be the time to make a decision about what could change or continue. (Kennesaw State University)

====Examples of Cooperative Learning====
According to Prince George County Public Schools, there are many examples to get a teacher ready to use cooperative learning in the classroom. These examples are listed below.

;Think-Pair-Share
:Students listen to a proposed question. They then think of a response to the question. Next they pair to discuss the response and then share their responses with the rest of the class.

;Three-Step Interview
:Students pair up in groups and one person is the interviewee and the other is the interviewer. Then students switch roles. They can then share with the class what their partners had to say about their interview topic.

;Roundtable
:Students get in groups of three or more. They are then given a question to answer and a piece of paper is passed around the table until time is up. Once time is up, the group with the most correct responses wins.

;Numbered Heads Together
:Students are all given numbers in a group, and then they are given a question to answer. Once time is up the teacher calls a number and only that number can answer the given question.

;Pairs Check
:Students work in pairs to answer questions on a given worksheet. They then work together with another pair of students to check the answers. Answers are checked to make sure that everyone in both pairs agrees.

;Send a Problem
:Each team writes review questions on flash cards. After everyone in the team agrees on an answer to the question, they write the answer on the back of the card. They then pass the groups of cards onto another group. If a group doesn’t agree with an answer then they write down the alternative answers. At the end of the discussion, students can discuss the alternative answers that were given.

===Project-based Learning===
{{Rquote|right|Researchers report that, regardless of the subject matter, students working in small groups tend to learn more of what is taught and retain it longer than when the same content is presented in other instructional formats.|Barbara Gross Davis|''Tools for teaching''}}

Project-based learning (PBL) is an instructional method in which students collaborate.  PBL differs from the inquiry-based cooperative learning because it requires the students to actively think.  Students instead of answering a predetermined question are required to ask their own inquiry and then research the answer that they perceive from what they already know. 

Students pursue solutions to problems by asking and refining questions; debating ideas; making predictions; designing plans and/or experiments; collecting and analyzing data; drawing conclusions; communicating their ideas and findings to others; asking new questions; and creating models/concrete evidence.  (Global SchoolNet Foundation).

Four features that facilitate the use of project-based instruction in K-12 classrooms are:
# A “driving question” that deals with a real-world problem and encompasses multiple content areas.
# Allows students to research in order to learn concepts, apply information, and represent their knowledge
# Collaboration between students, teachers, and others outside of the classroom so knowledge is diffuse into the “learning community”
# Use of technological tools in the learning environment that support student’s representation of ideas: computer laboratories, hypermedia, graphing applications, and telecommunications.

==How Groups Work==
The art of cooperation is established when the teacher organizes the groups and then assigns role.  The group is held accountable for learning all the information they find within the group and any additional information that may be presented by the other groups.  Overall, students will be graded both as a group and individually.  This type of grading addresses the concerns that both the student and the parent have about working in groups.  The students’ grade will not be pulled down because of the group they were in.

Research has shown that successful groups promote(a) student exchanges that enhance reasoning and higher thinking;(b) cognitive processing such as rehearsing, organizing, and integrating information;(c) perspective-taking and accommodation to others' ideas; and(d) acceptance and encouragement among those involved with work.  (Bossert, 1988-1989).

The teacher is a facilitator for group work.  The idea of group work is not the replacement of the teacher, but rather integrating this instructional method into the classroom to assist in demonstrating ideas.  For group work to succeed ultimately, teachers need to consider 1) norms, 2) tasks, 3) help giving and seeking, 4) accountability, and 5) group composition.  (Blumenfeld, Krajcik, Marx, and Soloway, 1996).

===Norms===
Group norms have to be established in order for there to be effective group work.  Students need to have guidelines stated that will promote the sharing of ideas, taking risks, disagreeing with and listening to others, and generating and reconciling points of view.  Since students are used to working by themselves, it is difficult to know if they will actually cooperate with one another.  Problems such as a member not participating and leaving the work to the others while still earning the same goal should be prevented along with the domination or rejection of group members.  It is up to the teacher to promote positive norms that include teaching the concept of cooperation including the art of listening and resolving conflicts, teaching students to appreciate the skills and abilities of others and using incentives that promote interdependency.

===Tasks===
Tasks assigned by the teacher need to be problem-solving ones that may have more than one right answer.  Students connect with each other to explain their solutions and discussion will lead to more elaborate responses to help others understand the perspectives taken.  These types of tasks promote student interchanges and the possibility for learning which in turn results in the sharing of ideas, accommodation of others’ perspectives, and the giving and taking of help.  It is the teacher’s job to facilitate the process of argumentation and consider other alternatives not yet thought.

===Giving and Seeking Help===
The giving and seeking of help are the main purpose of group work.  Help giving and seeking is only useful if it is timely, elaborated, comprehensible, logical, and correct to avoid erroneous beliefs.  Students may need assistance to elaborate their thinking and teachers can help the students create good explanations with giving examples, creating analogies, and using multiple representations.  The troubling problem is that some students will not or cannot recognize that they have difficulties because they do not know how to ask or if they do ask for help it may be misconstrued as incompetence.  A teacher needs to foster in the classroom an environment that students can come to each other for help.

===Accountability===
Incentives can influence group interaction, and whether or not there is cooperation among student groups.  Evaluation needs to be based on both individual performance and group performance.  Individual accountability means that no one person will do the whole groups work.  However, giving the group one grade means that the members have to cooperate with each other.  The downside to individual grading is that the student will perceive participation in the group as wasteful and will not interact.  Furthermore, giving the group a single grade can translate into the blame game and ill will toward other members who did not work as hard.  Therefore, combining the two will result in the greatest possible outcome that high achieving students will not get a bad grade as a result of the group, and low-achieving students may get a confidence boost with a higher grade than usual.

===Composition===
The composition of a group is important to its performance overall.  The variety of achievement levels, race and ethnicity, and gender has an impact on how students interact, who benefits, and whether or not students engage in serious thought.  Low achievers and special education students are stigmatized in some groups; high-achieving students may dominate; and low-ability students may lack skills and misinterpret the task.  The function of a group is successful when members are drawn from either high and middle or low and middle achievement levels.  The mix affects peer acceptance, encouragement and interaction.  It is prudent for the teacher to address the issues prior to creating groups by using techniques like having a low-achievement or minority student teach a concept they received prior instruction on to high-achievement or majority students and using tasks that require multiple abilities/skills so that all students can contribute (Blumenfeld, Krajcik, Marx, and Soloway, 1996).

===Assessment=== 
Assessing students in cooperative learning activities can be challenging, especially when there are many groups in a classroom. According to Regina Public Schools and Saskatchewan Learning(2003), there are different ways to assess students in a cooperative learning group.

;Reflection Journals: These can be used during the closing of a lesson or activity period to allow students to reflect on their experiences, understandings and group work. The journals provide a record of accomplishments and one more resource for evaluation and assessment.

;Group and Peer Assessment: Prior to the activity or project, a list of descriptors is provided for or brainstormed by the large group. Throughout the activity or at the end of the activity, each member of the group provides an assessment of their effort in the assigned task. A rating scale or mark is accompanied by the student's explanation for the rating. Group members can also provide a rating for another group member and give a reason for the rating.

==Conclusion==
{{Rquote|right|The things taught in schools and colleges are not an education, but the means of education.|Ralph Waldo Emerson|''Journal, 1831''}}

Group work is an integral part of the instructional method.  Teachers need to embrace this concept and understand the advantages to it.  Group work allows the student to play an active role in the learning process instead of just being passive.  It has been proven that students learn more if they participate in an activity rather than a lecture.  Additionally, group work motivates students who are otherwise low-achievers.  The diffusion of ideas allows the students to better understand the concepts that are being taught.  After all one way of explaining an idea might not be as good as another way of explaining.

Teachers need to recognize that they need to make conscious decisions about how to promote group norms, help students develop skill and habits to learn with peers design and select tasks and group students in a way that promotes learning and determining ways to hold students accountable.

The skills that students will acquire in group work should serve them as adults.  In the workplace, it is essential for workers to be able to cooperate on projects, just as it is essential for students to learn the skills in school.

{{question-answer|question=How would you implement group work into a classroom and why? 
|answer=Project-based learning is a great tool for the classroom.  Students are organized into groups and have to synthesize a question within the parameters of the module.  For example, World War II, the students could synthesize numerous questions.  The goal of the group is to create a question and then with their shared knowledge come up with and answer.  The next step would be that they research the question they have and see what information might confirm or disprove the group’s conclusion.

The teacher would grade the student as an individual and as a group; the group could grade each other on participation.  The individual student needs to be able to report to his/her group and then the group has to understand the individual well enough to present to the class.  Accountability is everything within a group and if students feel that they will not be brought down by the group, cooperation is maximized.   

Instruction is evolving with technological advancements and with the availability of the internet, information has become easier to find.  Students do not have to gather information just from the teacher; now the student can explore topics and subjects of importance on his/her own.  Moreover, students need to learn these skills now in order for them to function in the real world.
----
In a high school math class I would use group work to give the students a chance to have a better understanding of what they are learning. I think the students will need a little bit of time to process the information they just learned on their own, first. After teaching a new subject I could first assign homework on it to let the students try it on their own. The next day in class I would put the students into small groups of maybe 4 and have each student, one at a time, explain to the rest of the group how to work a problem. By saying the process out loud the students are more likely to retain the information. When you talk out loud about what you have done to solve a problem, you are reinforcing the information and maybe even getting a deeper understanding of it. The students in the group who are listening to the speaker may have questions. By thinking about these questions the speaker will be forced to think of something that he or she had may not have thought of when working the problem by his/herself. Everybody in the group benefits by having a deeper understanding of the topic than they did before the group work.
You have to be careful using group work with younger high school students. They are more likely than, say, the seniors to get off the topic and turn group work into socializing. Group work can still work for these younger students, you just have to watch them more carefully to make sure they are staying on track. &amp;mdash;Vanessa White
----
The reason I would implement group work is to give children an opportunity to learn in a different way, to communicate with others, and to solve problems with their peers.  I don’t think it is reasonable to expect a child to sit quiet and work independently on lectures or practice day after day.  I think there is a lot of benefit to group work in the classroom, for the student and the teacher if implemented well.  

I am a first year teacher, moving into my 8th week of teaching, so my credibility is limited.  However, my traditional setup in the classroom is to have peer to peer practice on a regular basis.  I find I lose some control in full group situations, but pairing works really well and is much easier to maintain a civil environment. A traditional day in class would include a session of note-taking and class discussion, followed by a quick lab (if I have one, which is not too often right now), and then they pair up and practice.  We have had some opportunities where the children wrote notes on flash cards instead of paper, and they practiced with those.  I have been experimenting with the children writing their own questions (about 5) and then pairing up to ask those questions.  If we have more time, I let them switch to a new partner.  

During this time, I walk around and give suggestions for how to recall or understand a concept, I listen to make sure they are on task and trying, and finally I assign a grade right then and there for class work. No additional paperwork or late night grading required.  The students give me a lot of positive feedback on being able to talk and work together.  This setup seems to work especially well in my inclusion classes with special education children. &amp;mdash;Stephen Edwards

I believe students should work in small groups at least three to four times a week.  My teaching experience has been in Reading, Writing, and Science.  Students often read in groups or with partners.  This can be helpful for some students simply because it is different from silent reading and the teacher reading to the class aloud.  When students have a writing assignment, peer editing can be a wonderful example of group work.  Students need to learn to give and get feedback from their peers. As they further in their education, constructive criticism will play a major role.  In a Science classroom students working in groups may be more familiar for both students and teachers.  Students perform scientific experiments, collect data, and make predictions.  When I taught Science, I remember how engaged students became while doing experiments on friction and electricity.  Not only were these activities fun for the students, but it also kept each student wanting to participate.
 
Teachers should consider collaborative and cooperative learning in every content area.  Students working and creating together can be a great learning experience.  When students work together each group member can contribute something both different and helpful.  While working in groups children can learn to respect one another as they combine multiple ideas and opinions to form one product.  It's important to remember that grouping students of different learning styles together can be difficult at first, but as the students become comfortable expressing their own ideas and accepting of their peers' ideas they will thrive.  The positive aspects of students working in groups will outshine any negative aspects. &amp;mdash;Amanda Foster
----
Group work in the classroom is an efficient way to reach all students regardless of their learning type.  Group Work cultivates a more active learning process, through exposing students to different techniques and ways of thinking, while learning to work with other students.  When working in groups, students can feel a sense of belonging, and this gives students an opportunity to learn and teach one another.  Research and experience shows that students’ often learn better from each other than they do from a teacher.  That is why as educators we should utilize group work in the classroom, keeping in mind certain guidelines.

There are different learning goals that one can achieve through having students work together in small groups or pairs. I would put the students in small groups so they can review problems for exams, compare and contrast ideas, solve problems, and summarize main points.  Consider what your goals are for the activity and what you want the students to get out from the activity.  You can structure these groups either by assigning them, randomly, or once you know your students pair them up accordingly (weak students with a strong student) and so fourth.   
     
As the teacher I would respond through involving all members of a group in hands-on learning activities where students are assigned roles.  For instance one student could be the recorder, another in charge of materials, and one could perform the activity.  These roles should rotate so that each student is involved in every part of the process and has a chance to play different roles.

The reason group work is important is because students are observing and also contributing to the task.  Students can learn from each other in the group. Students will learn to work together and to contribute to the group success, and how to express their opinions and accept their peers’ opinions. &amp;mdash;Christine Murray
----
I would implement group work in the classroom to create a workable environment for my students. By having the input of their peers, they will be more alert and open to other ideas and viewpoints. It was interesting learning about Project based learning activities. I love doing projects and I definitely plan on bringing them into my future classroom. I will put them into groups and have them work on something interesting. In my classroom, I would have them pair up into groups on a weekly or daily basis and mix up the groups’ every time. I think by mixing up the groups, they are less likely to form clicks. In the groups I’d assign each person to a different role. For example, there would be a leader, recorder, writer and researcher. They eventually would take turns by changing roles. By changing roles, the students will learn a little more about the assignment from a different angle and promote interdependency. With group work, the students will be forced to actively participate and contribute the group at some point. Every classroom should be organized into groups at all times. Throughout the school year, I would rotate the groups to ensure that everyone works together at some point. &amp;mdash;Maxine Sharpe
----								
To implement group learning in my classroom I would begin by organizing my students into groups.  The groups would be balanced based on the strengths and weaknesses of my individual students.  For example, the highest achievers would be with the lowest achievers, and in the middle areas students would be grouped based on other determining factors.  Each student would have a role within the group, and each project I assigned would make sure that each student’s role was utilized so that each student made meaningful contributions to the project.

The projects would vary in their objectives.  Some would be open ended and have the students make their own investigations and discoveries and present their final viewpoints to the class.  Some projects would require a more concrete and determined result.  No matter what the project the objectives would be clearly stated and understood via a rubric, so that the students could gauge whether their work has been done to the necessary standards for completion.

Grading would be both individual and group based.  The students would receive two grades per project, one for individual participation and one for the group’s final result.  The students would provide each other’s grade for individual participation – there would be a grade sheet each student would turn in that would be filled out by each teammate.  This would also weigh in with teacher observations of participation to prevent unsatisfactory grading based on attitudes or personal issue between students.  The group grade would be assesses based on performance as guided by the rubric for each project.

Having students complete projects in group learning situations will foster social interaction skills and allow them to see different perspectives aligning towards achieving the same goal. &amp;mdash;Michelle Wood}}

#Place the tie around the collar the wrong way visible (i.e. the seams and label visible).  The relative length of the narrow and wide ends can be adjusted with practice so that the tie is the desired length.  A good starting guide is to have the wide end 30 cm or 12 inches lower than the narrow end.
#Place the narrow end of the tie across the front of the wide end about 12 cm or 5 inches from the collar.
#Wrap the wide end across the narrow end so it is now the right way on the outside of the knot.
#Put the wide end through the back of the large loop (which is around the neck).
#Push through the same (wide) end through the smaller loop (around the tie) and pull it through carefully.  Pull it until it forms a knot with a pleasing shape.
#Pull the thin end carefully and push the bottom of the knot gently, to move the knot closer to your collar.
#Make small adjustments until you are happy with the knot.
#To take the tie off:
##Pull the free end of the knot around the neck whilst holding the knot and it should loosen.
##Pull until there is no longer a loop around the neck.
##Untie the knot left in the tie.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Four basic knots exist for tying a tie: the ''Four-In-Hand'', the ''Half-Windsor'', the ''Windsor'', and the ''Pratt knot''. 

The Windsor or Half-Windsor knots are more commonly used for interviews or other formal occasions. Their heftiness and symmetry will convey an air of confidence.

The Four-In-Hand are usually used in more casual scenarios.

[[Image:Oriental tie knot.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The Oriental or Small Knot]]
=== Oriental or Small Knot ===
The most basic knot.  It forms an asymmetric knot with a wider base than the Four-in-Hand. It is not worn very often, possibly because it is not self-releasing.

[[Image:Four-In-Hand tie knot.JPG|thumb|right|100px|The Four-In-Hand knot]]

=== Four-In-Hand ===
The Four-In-Hand is a basic knot worn frequently in the West. It is also the easiest and fastest knot to tie. The knot produced by this method is on the narrow side, slightly asymmetric, and appropriate for all occasions.

=== Half Windsor ===
[[Image:Necktie Half-Windsor knot.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Half-Winsdor knot]]
The Half Windsor is for situations of moderate formality. It is luxury without pretense. It requires a little bit more time and practice than the Four, but the results are worth it. It is considered a simpler version of the Windsor knot, and gives a neat, triangular knot. The size of this knot falls in between the four-in-hand and the Windsor knots. It works particularly well with lighter fabrics.

=== Windsor ===
[[Image:Necktie Windsor knot.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Windsor knot]]
The [[w:Windsor knot|Windsor knot]] is generally perceived as the most formal and &quot;upper-class&quot; of the necktie realm. It is sometimes referred to as a full Windsor, to distinguish it from the half-Windsor. It produces a wide triangular knot. The knot is named after the Duke of Windsor (Edward VIII after abdication), who preferred a wide knot and had his ties specially made with thicker cloth in order to produce a wider knot when tied with the conventional four in hand knot. In Ian Fleming's James Bond series, the British spy remarked that the Windsor knot was &quot;the mark of a cad.&quot; Its broad loop and wide knot are unmistakable. However, wearers of the Windsor knot may be marked as arrogant, especially as the current fashion is for smaller knots.

=== Pratt / Shelby / Shelby-Pratt ===
The Pratt offers a good balance between simplicity and class.  Once learned, it's quite easy to tie. For the Pratt knot, the starting position is 'reverse side out'. It uses less length than the Half Windsor or Windsor knots, and so is well suited to shorter ties. Unlike the Four in Hand knot, the Pratt method produces a symmetrical knot. It is of medium thickness.  Its one disadvantage is that the tie occasionally comes a little loose around the neck with extended wear, but a simple tug is all that's needed to refresh it.  It shapes itself naturally, requires almost no adjustment, forms its own dimples, and is very easy to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* '''Check for symmetry'''. Adjust the knot so that you achieve optimal bilateral symmetry. Re-tie or upgrade to the Windsor if necessary. A slightly leaning knot can be wriggled with so it looks OK, but a seriously cockeyed knot will have the tie falling down your lapel and just look terrible. There are exceptions to this rule. Some knots are meant to be asymmetrical (often worn in Italy, for example). 
* '''Keep it tight'''. A properly tied tie will, unfortunately for the wearer, need to be pulled extremely tight against the neck. A tie too loose may convey unprofessionalism.
* '''The Vicious V'''. According to the film, ''Outside Providence'', a properly tied tie must possess the Vicious V. This is the sharp V formed by the scruching of the tie where it exits the knot.
* '''For the tall'''. Tall people will find that the knot sometimes will end up way &quot;up&quot; on the tie where it is narrow resulting in a small unflattering knot. You may want to look for specially made ties for tall people that will solve this problem.
* '''Be sure to dimple'''. Where the wider end of the tie exits the bottom of the knot there should be a clean symmetrical dimple.
* '''Untie your tie'''. Untie your tie after you are through wearing it, also untie it the same way you tied it. Your tie will last longer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the importance of early intervention in reading performance?}}

==The Reading Crisis==
{{Rquote|right|The reading crisis will impact our nation for decades to come.|Mathes, 2005}}

For some children, learning to read can be difficult. Research indicates that when a pattern of academic failure starts early, it will persist throughout a child’s education. Long-term studies have shown that there is almost a 90% chance that a child who reads poorly at the end of the first grade will be a poor reader in the fourth grade (Stickland, 2002). “The National Center for Educational Statistics reported in 2002 that 36% of fourth graders couldn’t read and understand even a short paragraph like those in children’s books.&quot; (Mathes, 2005)

Over the past 20 years, there has been remarkable growth in understanding how to predict reading problems. The following literacy skills are predictors of children who are at risk for reading failure:
*Phonemic awareness (the ability to search the individual sounds within words)
*Knowledge of letter names and sounds
*Speed of lexical retrieval (meaning of the words) (Mathes, 2005)

Scientists estimate that 95% of children can be taught to read. However, the reality is that a high percentage of students are below their grade level (Scola, 2002). Attempting to solve this crisis, early intervention reading programs have proven to be effective as evidenced by improved test scores.

==What is Early Intervention?==
{{Rquote|right|The latest research points to a critical truth: Early intervention in the primary grades can prevent reading problems for most children and significantly reduce reading disabilities. Early intervention allows students to get help before reading problems become entrenched and complicated by self-concept issues. It can impact how children think, how they learn, and who they are, changing the lives of tens of millions.|Mathes, 2005}}

Early intervention is designed to positively influence language and literacy development in children age zero through eight. Special emphasis is placed on reading comprehension, word recognition (including phonics), fluency, and writing. Intervention services must be in addition to and cannot replace instruction that the child is receiving. Options for early intervention program delivery may include the use of reading teachers, trained aides, volunteer tutors under the supervision of a trained teacher, or extended instructional time during the school day or year for the targeted students.

The importance of early intervention in Reading Performance is extremely crucial in children becoming successful readers.  We wonder why others are more successful than others is because reading was introduced to them at an early age.  Children need to be taught these skills early.  For example, letter recognition-letter sound correspondences, phonemic segmentation, and aquistion of sight words. These skills correlate with becoming a successful reader. Other basic components of early literacy will be their language-talking about ideas or events in distant time or place. Another fundamental component would be to teach children that words are powerful and important, that books are sources of pleasure and information.  So, the motivation to teach children early is crucial. Children must be taught these skills through hard work to master letters and sounds, developing a spoken language, and should be exposed to print early in life and their settings should be positive, and affectionate.

Children should be read to everyday for at least 15 minutes. This will help children to develop their vocabulary, become confident early readers, and encourage them to ask questions about what they heard. Many parents may not know the importance of reading to their child everyday. According to The Developing Person through the Lifespan, &quot;In early childhood, vocabulary increases exponentially, from about 500 words at age 2 to more than 100,000 at age 6. One scholar says that 2- to 6-year-olds learn an average of 10 words a day...but all agree that the most rapid vocabulary expansion usually occurs before age 7&quot; (p.226). In addition to this, children should participate in reading programs such as &quot;Read to Rover&quot;, book clubs, and group readings.  Another interesting and speedy way that children develop vocabulary is through fast mapping.  This is when a child “acquires new words by mentally ‘charting’ new words into interconnected categories; parents should have frequent and elaborate conversations with their children” (p.227). The development of literacy is very vital to the child's success to become a early reader. 

==Examples of Early Intervention Programs==
There are many different early intervention reading programs used today. Here are just a few examples:

Prekindergarten and Kindergarten Programs:
* '''Head Start''' is the most widely known early intervention program for economically disadvantaged children.
* '''High Scope''' is a preschool program that focuses on language development.
* '''Whitehurst’s Emergent Literacy Intervention''' is an early intervention program for preschool and kindergarten, consisting of dialogic and phonemic awareness.
Primary Grade Programs (Grades 1-3): 
*  '''Early Reading Intervention (ERI)''' is a tutoring program for first and second graders who are at risk for failure to read. The program allows a small group of students to work with their teacher 15 to 20 minutes a day, three times a week. This program also has the children read individually for five minutes a day.
*  '''First Steps''' is a one-on-one 30-minute tutoring program consisting of a series of leveled books.
*  '''Reading Recovery''' is the most researched intervention program. This program is designed for first graders, who receive one-on-one tutoring by well-trained teachers. This reading intervention is commonly used for the lowest achieving 20% of students in the first grade. (Strickland, 2002)

==Criteria for Early Intervention Programs==
With the large number of programs available, The American Federation of Teachers developed a list of criteria for early intervention programs. The program should show evidence of:
* '''High Standards''' – helps students acquire the skills and/or knowledge to meet high academic standards
* '''Effectiveness''' – proven to be effective in raising academic achievements
* '''Replicability''' – implement the program at other schools
* '''Support Structures''' – including professional development (Scola, 2002)

==Program Success==
Several characteristics make early intervention programs successful. One-on-one and small group tutoring, instruction that is congruent with the regular classroom instruction, and highly skilled personnel are all characteristics of successful programs. 

Much research has also been completed to determine the best instructional practices. Successful interventions should include the following:
# Letter-sound relationships and word identification strategies, including phonological awareness, letters, words, and word patterns
# Repeated exposures to words
# Strategies for understanding text and monitoring comprehension
# Fluency through repeated reading of connected texts (Quatroche, 1999)

According to the Virginia Department of Education, the anticipated benefits from early intervention programs include: improved primary reading programs, improved reading skills, a higher percentage of students passing the third grade Virginia Standards of Learning Reading Test, a reduction in the number of special education referrals, and a higher percentage of children being promoted in the primary grades. (Virginia Department of Education, 1998)

==Success Stories==
Murray Elementary School, in Kentucky, uses early intervention programs to identify students with reading and language difficulties and supplement their learning through computerized exercises. Reading Recovery is used to accelerate learning so that children can catch up with others at their grade level. “I can read a little bit faster, and I like telling my friends about what I can read”, said Beau Maness, eight years old (Saunders, 2007).

In Tallahassee, Florida, a two-year study was conducted, involving five schools in Leon County. The study included students who were most at risk for reading failure, based on their performance on screening tests. On a measure of reading accuracy, the groups improved from the 9th percentile in the fall to the 64th percentile in May, as a result of early intervention (Mathes, 2005).

A Case Study was conducted to find the effects of a supplemental reading intervention program on a student at risk. Ryan, a kindergarten student who was non-responsive to a school-wide literacy program, was tutored in small groups during the course of a traditional school day. Results indicated that improvements in phonemic awareness were also associated with better behavior in the classroom. Ryan said that he liked “practicing the sounds” and he wished the program could have lasted “a little longer” (Lane, Menzies, Munton, 2005).

{{question-answer|question=What is an early intervention program and how is the success of the intervention measured?
|answer=Early intervention programs are designed to positively influence literacy development in children up to the third grade. Instruction includes special emphasis on reading comprehension, word recognition (including phonics), fluency, and writing. Intervention should be used in conjunction with the standard literacy instruction students are receiving in the classroom. Instruction may be delivered by reading teachers, trained aides, or volunteer tutors under the supervision of a trained teacher. An early intervention reading program should have high standards, effectiveness, replicability, and support structures. It is imperative to have highly skilled and trained professionals conduct early intervention programs.

The best measure of success for early intervention programs are through test scores. One of the most common tests is the Standard of Learning (SOL) Reading test. Scores can be measured and monitored from year to year to see if targeted students have had an increase in their scores. Overall success can be determined from the number of children being promoted to a higher grade. The program is also successful when there is a reduction in the number of special education referrals. Another way to determine the success of the intervention is to ask the students, themselves. When students say that they can read faster, understand the material better, and actually enjoy reading, you know that the program is successful!}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What role does technology play?}}

With every passing year technology gets more and more sophisticated.  The abilities of computers are ever expanding and education systems in the United States, and in fact worldwide, cannot keep up.  The problem is not only the advancing technology and the inability of teachers to keep up, but the way educational curriculum is setup.  Currently, individual learning is the staple in the United States.  Children are educated on the basis of generalized ideas and cold, hard facts divided into discrete subjects.  While computers may sometimes be used to write a paper or create a presentation, children are still tested independently and success is measured by sequential grades and standardized tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;kozma&quot;&gt;Kozma, R., Schank, P. (1998). Connecting with the 21st Century: Technology in Support of Educational Reform. Yearbook (Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development), 3-27. Retrieved September 16, 2006 from http://tappedin.org/tappedin/web/papers/1998/21stCenturyASCD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advances are beginning to make this method of education obsolete and soon a dramatic shift to a different curriculum will be needed, one that will emphasize problem solving and collaboration over independent study.  In light of this revolution in learning style, students will need to set aside the methods they usually use to learn and instead undertake learning an entirely new set of skills oriented around technology.  This would include such skills as efficient ways to search, sort, generate, and analyze data.  In order to succeed in this transition, teachers will need to pick up some of the slack, acquiring new skills themselves and using them to teach in an entirely different fashion.  Therefore, to create a future for education that will thrive with technological advancement a change of this magnitude to curriculum and teaching must not only occur but the change must connect the elements together as to not leave anyone behind.

==Curriculum==
Computers promise to create an environment that, rather than emphasizing facts and ideas, emphasizes thinking.  A student will be able to apply ideas to the real world and in doing so find new meanings.  Learning in this fashion can be accomplished with three methods; project based learning, collaborative problem solving, and scaffolding, all of which will be made easy by technological advancements.  

In project based learning the students become the teachers.  This form of learning begins by creating a problem, goal, or coming up with a topic of interest within a group.  Students would then debate, collect data, analyze, design experiments/plans, and draw conclusions.&lt;ref name=&quot;kozma&quot; /&gt;  Educating in this way should prove more effective than traditional methods because the students actually create their own assignment through a real life situation that interests them and therefore will motivate them to find a solution.  For example, the seeds of this method have already been sewn at Virginia Polytechnic and State University’s Math Emporium.  Here, entry level mathematics has been redefined.  Five hundred workstations are present and are used to teach more than ten thousand students.  High speed networks are in place and learning modules and online quizzes are utilized to aid students in learning mathematics.  Most importantly, students can work at their own pace and be provided help by on-site teachers who assess learning and can alert appropriate faculty of specific areas of study that are giving each individual student the most difficulty.&lt;ref name=&quot;barone&quot;&gt;Barone, C., Luker, A. (1999). The Role of Advanced Networks in the Education of the Future. Retrieved September 16, 2006 from http://www.educase.edu/ir/library/html/erm/erm99/erm9968.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While project based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond.  Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals whom are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or beginning a new project.&lt;ref name=&quot;kozma&quot; /&gt;  Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.  Virtual Scaffolds are internalized in the software and are meant to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been to challenging for the student to handle alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;kozma&quot; /&gt;  

Much like project based learning, collaborative problem solving works on the premise that application of knowledge is much more important than memorizing facts and ideas.  In addition, collaborative problem solving helps students realize that complex real world issues are not solved by individuals but rather by a team working together.&lt;ref name=&quot;herdman&quot;&gt;Herdman, R. (1995). Education and Technology: Future Visions. Workshop. Retrieved September 16, 2006 from http://www.wws.princeton.edu/ota/disk1/1995/9522_n.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Technology can be used for this purpose.  Several technologies are under development that will have this collaborative capability, one such technology is the computer-supported intentional learning environment (CSILE) where the computer takes a students topic of interest and creates a textual and graphical database.&lt;ref name=&quot;herdman&quot; /&gt;   To create this database students have to communicate with each other sharing their knowledge and posing problems as well as solutions to those problems.

Many of the most successful teachers are using different forms of collaboration learning in their classrooms including the jigsaw puzzle concept. This includes having the students in groups learn a new idea or concept and then teach it to the rest of the group. Each child teaches his or her group what they have learned. Many cases this helps to promote self confidence in the students and lessens the racial and social barriers that children sometimes face. They are forced to listen to each other and respect what they have to say. Many times teachers will use the computer or research information for this type of learning. Students will have to find the information in numerous places often looking to technology for this purpose. 

The only downside to collaborative learning is that this has not been tested at the college level. Many studies have been done to see the effects at the elementary and secondary levels and how it is working. Many college students are already using technology for the learning purpose. However when does learning turn to “goofing” off on the internet instead of studying (Collaborative learning)?

==New Technologies==
In technology and education there are two problems we face.  One, as mentioned previously, is keeping up with the continued advancements of technology.  The other is integrating different forms of technology to make life easier for everyone.  The first difficulty is solved by simply knowing what technologies are out there and how they can aid in teaching.  The future of education will employ more sophisticated forms of many present technologies and many others that are not yet in use.  Among these technologies are interactive digital video, virtual reality, advanced internet, networking, and PDAs.  Presently the majority of our digital media are in asynchronous forms, meaning communication is one way (not real time).&lt;ref name=&quot;barone&quot; /&gt;   A shift is beginning to create forms of communication such as the ones previously stated that will provide synchronous communication meaning network based communication on which people are able to talk to each other live.&lt;ref name=&quot;barone&quot; /&gt;   Advanced internet is a good beginning to this objective and in the future with advanced networking will become affordable for all users.  

In advanced networking rather than simple asynchronous communication people will be able to speak over the computer face to face.  This type of communication is an improvement over the present allowing for richer interaction, allowing one another to interpret not only words but tones, expressions, and emotions.&lt;ref name=&quot;barone&quot; /&gt;  Advanced internet is in its early stages in forms such as video conferencing which remains expensive and therefore has not become widely used.  In addition, networks such as Internet2 are appearing which allow for synchronous communication with advanced network connectivity.  These networks are connecting K-12 students to information and research in half of the United States’ colleges at a speed hundreds of times faster than the current public networks.

Other technologies such as virtual reality will also improve education in the future.  This technology will allow students to explore virtual environments that otherwise they would never be able to explore, such as spill sites, galaxies, and DNA molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;kozma&quot; /&gt;  Using these virtual environments teachers and students will be able to conduct activities and in doing so evolve a better understanding of the world we live in.  By integrating this virtual reality with “smart objects” from a design template, students can interact with their virtual environment allowing for sample collection and analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;kozma&quot; /&gt;  

The last three technological advancements, PDAs, interactive digital video, and advanced networks are really the reason many people envision the future without a concrete classroom structure, but rather a mobile, interactive, virtual environment where the student works opportunistically.&lt;ref name=&quot;herdman&quot; /&gt;  

PDAs (personal digital assistants) are already a reality.  In the future, however, they will become much more available to everyone because of price drops.  PDAs will allow for the mobility previously mentioned, allowing students to work on projects at any location.&lt;ref name=&quot;herdman&quot; /&gt;   Students will be able to communicate with each other and access computer processing functions whenever and wherever they need.  Interactive digital video like PDAs will prevent the need for a physical classroom.  A student will be able to watch TV, access the internet, and watch a telecourse right on their own television.&lt;ref name=&quot;herdman&quot; /&gt;  Interactive digital video has already begun to be used for basic functions in hotels, allowing people to use the internet or watch a video-on-demand without leaving their rooms.  The only task left to do is build the required video servers and networks needed to connect the student with the outside world.

Networks are perhaps the most important aspect of education’s digital future, allowing computers worldwide to connect with each other and share information.  As time passes these networks will connect more electronic devices and will do it faster than ever before.  Here in lies the problem.  Exchanging information currently is limited because barriers exist between technologies which prevent communications.  For example, a person uses an AOL service provider for internet but other information/voice services such as a cell phone uses an alternate service.&lt;ref name=&quot;kozma&quot; /&gt;  Connection of technology at this scale will require companies to increase infrastructure capabilities and allow integration of their services with all others through networks of fiber, coaxial cables and wireless communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;kozma&quot; /&gt;  In this way not only students but everyone will be able to enjoy “ubiquitous computing” communication 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;hopkins&quot;&gt;Hopkins, J. (1996). The Role of Technology in International Education: Changing Identities in a Digital World. CIEE 48th International Conference on Educational Exchange. Retrieved September, 16 2006 from http://www.uta.fi/FAST/JH/ciee.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning from a person’s personal computer sending or receiving almost any form of communication is possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;hopkins&quot; /&gt;  

==Teaching==
The students are not the only ones that will need to be able to master the technology, teachers will have a new role to play and it will center on understanding current technology.  To be able to do this, teachers must first and foremost lose the perception that technology is just an add-on or bonus when it is used in the classroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobsen&quot;&gt;Jacobsen, D., Lock, J. (2004). Technology And Teacher Education For A Knowledge Era: Mentoring For Student Futures, Not Our Past. Journal of Technology and Teacher Education, 12(1), 75-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  In their new role teachers will have to be more flexible than ever before, acting as mentors and managers rather than the tradition dispenser of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;labbo&quot;&gt;Labbo, L. (1996). Toward a Vision of the Future Role of Technology in Literacy Education. Retrieved September 16, 2006 from http://www.air.org/forum/abLabbo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers will need to attend more in-services and conventions in order to learn the technology, and they must be given the time to do so by administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;labbo&quot; /&gt;  To teach the student, teachers need to share ideas and organize activities based on what they learn and based upon student interests.  Organizing these activities in light of increasing technological advances and integration introduces a broader range of resources to use, and teachers need the flexibility and know-how to use them.  In addition to the time required to organize detailed problem solving or project based activities, teachers will need to mentor children, opening their eyes to different ways of completing a given task and assuring students meet their goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;bennett&quot;&gt;Bennett, F. (2002). The future of computer technology in K-12 education. Phi Delta Kappan, 83(8). Retrieved September 16, 2006 from www.cris.com/~faben1/phidel~1.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, teachers will no longer be teaching a specific subject but instead will be interdisciplinary.  Due to the infrastructure of the new founded curriculum teachers will have to be able to apply their specialty to other fields and ideas.

==Conclusion==
There is obviously much work that needs to be done before education can be revolutionized.  Curriculum, teaching role changes, and technology integration are just a few of the problems the future will face.  There are cultural, economic, and social issues that will also have to be dealt with.  Culturally the ease of communicating with friends of your culture may very well reduce a person’s need to go out and make new friends of other cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobsen&quot; /&gt;  In addition, this ease in communicating virtually may reduce people’s healthy psychological need for in-person contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;barone&quot; /&gt;    Finally, with advancing technology will the economic divide between rich and poor widen or narrow?  Costs of obtaining technology will decrease over time but price for the ongoing training and tools needed to use it will not.&lt;ref name=&quot;barone&quot; /&gt;    The change in education due to technology is a necessity; the difficulty in dealing with these factors is what will determine how long the transition will take.

{{question-answer|question=Assuming in the future curricula do change to the point where learning is based on project and problem solving activities how will classes be structured?  Will there be grade levels, subject based classes (biology, chemistry etc)?  Will the physical structure of schools remain, will there even be a need for them, or will schools go 100% virtual?
|answer=Curricula will change in the future whether we are ready for it or not.  Classrooms will be structured around problem and project based learning because we are seeing the benefits of these types of classrooms right now.  These techniques and new technologies in the classroom will spread like wildfire through the United States.  Technology is the best thing to happen to education since sliced bread.  I believe that there will still be grade levels mainly because kids need to be around people their own age.  It would make no sense whatsoever for a fourteen year old to be in the same classroom and learning the same things as a ten year old.  Many problems can arise from this.  Further, I believe that classes will still be subject based mainly because it would be highly confusing if they were not.  When a student is in a class I think it is best if they are locked into one particular mode of thinking, like mathematics for example, instead of several disciplines at once, for example switching constantly from math to English.  There still has to be structure in classrooms in the future.  However, due to problem and project based learning activities the traditional classroom will be transformed.  It will no longer center around teachers lecturing in front of the class but around students.  Students will be more in control of their education than they are today.  Teachers will serve merely as guides, tutors, and evaluators.  Students will be 100% interactive in the classroom at all times instead of listening to someone talk the entire time.  The need for the physical structure of schools will remain.  While having many virtual aspects of education is incredible it can never take the place of a flesh and blood person standing in front of you when you are learning.  Sometimes there are things a teacher’s physical presence is needed for that virtual technology cannot appease.  Also, many things can go wrong with technology, so being solely dependent on it can be dangerous.  Having a tangible center for this physical need in education, i.e. schools, will have to remain in the future, but an new 100% interactive structure in classrooms is a welcome change. &amp;mdash;Heather Smith
----
In the near future, technology in the classroom is not only inevitable, but will soon become required for the success of students and teachers alike. As an educator, I hope that technology will not overtake lecture and classroom experiences that children need to grow and excel in the outside world. If future curriculum does “change to the point where learning is based on project and problem solving activities”, classes will have to be structured differently. The teacher may become more of a guide than the primary information provider. Educators will have to become more technologically advanced and be able to incorporate this technology in lessons that make sense and follow the curriculum required for successful scores in the Standards of Learning tests.    

One problem that schools face with incorporating new technology in the classroom is the primary expenses to purchase and provide equal opportunity for teachers to use and have access to laptops, Smartboards, LCD projectors, etc. If funding is available to each and every school to purchase these new technologies, the future of advanced technology will be a tremendous benefit to everyone involved.  

The physical structure of schools will have to change with the times. Classrooms will have to be stocked with all the previous mentioned technologies and each will have to have sufficient space to protect these expensive machines. Smaller schools, with less funding, have small classroom space today and they do not provide a safe environment for the students and teachers to be able to move around freely without the fear of breaking or knocking into an expensive piece of equipment. The layout of classrooms would have to be re-evaluated and some changes will have to be made before such an expensive teaching tools can be placed in each school.  

New technology is a wonderful and exciting aide to bring to students and educators. As information and inventions grow, so will the knowledge and futures of the most important elements in our school systems... the children! &amp;mdash;Carla S. Corvin}}

\begin{abstract}
In this article, I shall discuss some of the fundamental topics in
producing a structured document.  This document itself does not go into
much depth, but is instead the output of an example of how to implement
structure. Its \LaTeX{} source, when in used with my tutorial
(http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/andyr/misc/latex/\-latextutorial2.html)
provides all the relevant information.  \end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
This small document is designed to illustrate how easy it is to create a
well structured document within \LaTeX\cite{lamport94}.  You should quickly be able to
see how the article looks very professional, despite the content being
far from academic.  Titles, section headings, justified text, text
formatting etc., is all there, and you would be surprised when you see
just how little markup was required to get this output.

\section{Structure}
One of the great advantages of \LaTeX{} is that all it needs to know is
the structure of a document, and then it will take care of the layout
and presentation itself.  So, here we shall begin looking at how exactly
you tell \LaTeX{} what it needs to know about your document.

\subsection{Top Matter}
The first thing you normally have is a title of the document, as well as
information about the author and date of publication.  In \LaTeX{} terms,
this is all generally referred to as \emph{top matter}.

\subsubsection{Article Information}
%Set up an 'itemize' environment to start a bulleted list.  Each
%individual item begins with the \item command.  Also note in this list
%that it has two levels, with a list embedded in one of the list items.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{\textbackslash title\{\emph{title}\}} - The title of the article.
	\item \texttt{\textbackslash date} - The date. Use:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \texttt{\textbackslash date\{\textbackslash today\}} - to get the
			date that the document is typeset.
			\item \texttt{\textbackslash date\{\emph{date}\}} - for a  %\emph{} emphasises the specified text.  Italics by default.
			specific date.
			\item \texttt{\textbackslash date\{\}} - for no date.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Author Information}
The basic article class only provides the one command:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{\textbackslash author} - The author of the document.
\end{itemize}

It is common to not only include the author name, but to insert new
lines (\texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash}) after and add things such
as address and email details.  For a slightly more logical approach, use
the AMS article class (\texttt{amsart}) and you have the following extra
commands:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{\textbackslash address} - The author's address.  Use
	the new line command (\texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash}) for
	line breaks.
	\item \texttt{\textbackslash thanks} - Where you put any acknowledgments.
	\item \texttt{\textbackslash email} - The author's email address.
	\item \texttt{\textbackslash urladdr} - The URL for the author's web page.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sectioning Commands}
The commands for inserting sections are fairly intuitive.  Of course,
certain commands are appropriate to different document classes.
For example, a book has chapters but a article doesn't.

%A simple table.  The center environment is first set up, otherwise the
%table is left aligned.  The tabular environment is what tells Latex
%that the data within is data for the table.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| l | l |} 
	%The tabular environment is what tells Latex that the data within is
	%data for the table.  The arguments say that there will be two
	%columns, both left justified (indicated by the 'l', you could also
	%have 'c' or 'r'.  The bars '|' indicate vertical lines throughout
	%the table.

		\hline  % Print horizontal line
		Command &amp; Level \\ \hline  % Columns are delimited by '&amp;'.  And
                                   %rows are delimited by '\\'
		\texttt{\textbackslash part\{\emph{part}\}} &amp; -1 \\
		\texttt{\textbackslash chapter\{\emph{chapter}\}} &amp; 0 \\
		\texttt{\textbackslash section\{\emph{section}\}} &amp; 1 \\
		\texttt{\textbackslash subsection\{\emph{subsection}\}} &amp; 2 \\
		\texttt{\textbackslash subsubsection\{\emph{subsubsection}\}} &amp; 3 \\
		\texttt{\textbackslash paragraph\{\emph{paragraph}\}} &amp; 4 \\
		\texttt{\textbackslash subparagraph\{\emph{subparagraph}\}} &amp; 5 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Numbering of the sections is performed automatically by \LaTeX{}, so don't
bother adding them explicitly, just insert the heading you want between
the curly braces.  If you don't want sections number, then add an asterisk (*) after the
section command, but before the first curly brace, e.g., \texttt{\textbackslash
section*\{A Title Without Numbers\}}.

%Create the environment for the bibliography.  Since there is only one
%reference, set the label width to be one character (I shall follow
%convention as use the number '9'.  This is because it helps to remind
%that it is the maximum number of refs that is now permitted by that
%width).
\begin{thebibliography}{9}
%The \bibitem is to start a new reference.  Ensure that the cite_key is
%unique.  You don't need to put each element on a new line, but I did
%simply for readability.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Pratt is not a poor cousin... ==

I prefer the Pratt because it is symmetrical without the bulk of the Windsor. I think it is more elegant and streamlined. Some ties with thicker linings are almost untieable with the Windsor, but look quite good with a Pratt. Many of my friends wonder why I have to untie my tie after I take it off, I explain, and most of them have adopted it themselves. Please give the Pratt its due. It was only discovered in the 1980's, so it is not mainstream, but it certainly is not analogous with a VW. Try it before you dismiss it as &quot;commie&quot; garb. The Four-in-Hand would be at the bottom of my list just behind the Half-Windsor.
:Peasant.  I suppose you also think that knots the size of a man's fist are the current trend, eh??  WRONG.––[[User:193.118.203.3|193.118.203.3]] 08:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

== Pratt knott's uniqueness ==

I have amended the line on the Pratt knott being unique in starting revere side side out.  Many other knots (e.g. the oriental knot) start like this.

== Self-releasing ==

Currently the oriental knot is described as &quot;self-releasing&quot;.  In terms of neckties, what does this phrase mean? [[User:Arbitrarily0|&lt;span style='color:black'&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt;rbitrarily&lt;big&gt;0&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;([[User talk:Arbitrarily0|&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; color:#FF4500;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:56, 11 September 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Feedback ==
=== Four-In-Hand (feedback) ===
I have just put a step by step guide up from tying my own tie several times.  I have checked it from starting either way round and find the narrow to my (biological/medical) right to be easiest starting position, but this is because I always tie it that way.  They both give the same knot.  

I am unsure if it is affected by handedness, I am right handed.  

If '''anyone who doesn't know how to tie a tie''' would like to post a message if they cannot follow the instructions let me know so I can improve the instructions.  Please let me know where it all started to go wrong if you have an idea.  If you know exactly where the instructions make you tie it wrong, change them if you wish.  This is to make the instrucitions better so ''please do not send me messages of panic'', as I am unable to be able to answer them fast enough and will feel bad at not being able to help you in time.

I have also added the oriental instructions for people to try. &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User:Ksbrown|Ksbrown]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ksbrown|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 10:29, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

Just added to test drive, probably will need some clarification.

I put some images in. This might make things much clearer. However, I'm not a native English speaker, so I didn't add instructions. A comprehensive list of knot diagrams can be found on [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krawattenknoten de.wikipedia].

== Editing ==

Hello...we are getting ready for the next semester's class, and I'm going through and editing out all of the rating scripts from any material that was designated as &quot;supplimental&quot; from the first edition.  This will allow for the content to be created in the second edition to have those ratings.  

Any page that doesn't have any content except for the rating script, I'm blanking out.  If there's some way that I'm supposed to be doing this, I'm happy to do so.

If the pages is not needed any more, instead of blanking a page, a page should be requested for deletion. I would normally suggest adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{vfd}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the top of the page and explaining why on [[WB:VFD]] on votes for deletion and give it a vote, but since this is a class project it may be better to tag it with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|reason why the page should be deleted}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to let admins know the page should be deleted and why. If I'm incorrect someone will turn it into a vote for deletion. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:37, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note:''' The following documentation was taken directly from the [http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html Rails API documentation]

ActionMailer allows you to send email from your application using a mailer model and views.

== Model ==

To use ActionMailer, you need to create a mailer model.

&lt;pre&gt;script/generate mailer Notifier&lt;/pre&gt;

The generated model inherits from &lt;tt&gt;ActionMailer::Base&lt;/tt&gt;. Emails are defined by creating methods within the model which are then used to set variables to be used in the mail template to change options on the mail, or to add attachments.

Examples:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt; class Notifier &lt; ActionMailer::Base
   def signup_notification(recipient)
     recipients recipient.email_address_with_name
     from       &quot;system@example.com&quot;
     subject    &quot;New account information&quot;
     body       &quot;account&quot; =&gt; recipient
   end
 end&lt;/source&gt;

Mailer methods have the following configuration methods available.

* &lt;tt&gt;recipients:&lt;/tt&gt; Takes one or more email addresses. These addresses are where your email will be delivered to. Sets the To: header.
* &lt;tt&gt;subject:&lt;/tt&gt; The subject of your email. Sets the Subject: header.
* &lt;tt&gt;from:&lt;/tt&gt; Who the email you are sending is from. Sets the From: header.
* &lt;tt&gt;cc:&lt;/tt&gt;Takes one or more email addresses. These addresses will receive a carbon copy of your email. Sets the Cc: header.
* &lt;tt&gt;bcc:&lt;/tt&gt; Takes one or more email address. These addresses will receive a blind carbon copy of your email. Sets the Bcc: header.
* &lt;tt&gt;sent_on:&lt;/tt&gt; The date on which the message was sent. If not set, the header wil be set by the delivery agent.
* &lt;tt&gt;content_type:&lt;/tt&gt; Specify the content type of the message. Defaults to text/plain.
* &lt;tt&gt;headers:&lt;/tt&gt; Specify additional headers to be set for the message, e.g. headers ‘X-Mail-Count’ =&gt; 107370.

The body method has special behavior. It takes a hash which generates an instance variable named after each key in the hash containing the value that the key points do.

So, for example, body &quot;account&quot; =&gt; recipient would result in an instance variable @account with the value of recipient being accessible in the view.

== Mailer Views ==

Like ActionController, each mailer class has a corresponding view directory in which each method of the class looks for a template with its name. To define a template to be used with a mailing, create an .rhtml file with the same name as the method in your mailer model. For example, in the mailer defined above, the template at &lt;pre&gt;app/views/notifier/signup_notification.rhtml&lt;/pre&gt; would be used to generate the email.

Variables defined in the model are accessible as instance variables in the view.

Emails by default are sent in plain text, so a sample view for our model example might look like this:

  Hi &lt;%= @account.name %&gt;,
  Thanks for joining our service! Please check back often.


== Sending HTML Mail ==

To send mail as HTML, make sure your view (the .rhtml file) generates HTML and set the content type to html.

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;class MyMailer &lt; ActionMailer::Base
    def signup_notification(recipient)
      recipients recipient.email_address_with_name
      subject    &quot;New account information&quot;
      body       &quot;account&quot; =&gt; recipient
      from       &quot;system@example.com&quot;
      content_type &quot;text/html&quot;   #Here's where the magic happens
    end
  end&lt;/source&gt;

== Multipart Mail ==
You can explicitly specify multipart messages:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;class ApplicationMailer &lt; ActionMailer::Base
    def signup_notification(recipient)
      recipients      recipient.email_address_with_name
      subject         &quot;New account information&quot;
      from            &quot;system@example.com&quot;

      part :content_type =&gt; &quot;text/html&quot;,
        :body =&gt; render_message(&quot;signup-as-html&quot;, :account =&gt; recipient)

      part &quot;text/plain&quot; do |p|
        p.body = render_message(&quot;signup-as-plain&quot;, :account =&gt; recipient)
        p.transfer_encoding = &quot;base64&quot;
      end
    end
  end&lt;/source&gt;

Multipart messages can also be used implicitly because ActionMailer will automatically detect and use multipart templates where each template is named after the name of the action, followed by the content type. Each such detected template will be added as separate part to the message.

For example, if the following templates existed:

* &lt;tt&gt;signup_notification.text.plain.rhtml&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;signup_notification.text.html.rhtml&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;signup_notification.text.xml.rxml&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;signup_notification.text.x-yaml.rhtml&lt;/tt&gt;

Each would be rendered and added as a separate part to the message, with the corresponding content type. The same body hash is passed to each template.

== Attachments ==
Attachments can be added by using the attachment method.

Example:

  &lt;source lang=rails&gt;class ApplicationMailer &lt; ActionMailer::Base
    # attachments
    def signup_notification(recipient)
      recipients      recipient.email_address_with_name
      subject         &quot;New account information&quot;
      from            &quot;system@example.com&quot;

      attachment :content_type =&gt; &quot;image/jpeg&quot;,
        :body =&gt; File.read(&quot;an-image.jpg&quot;)

      attachment &quot;application/pdf&quot; do |a|
        a.body = generate_your_pdf_here()
      end
    end
  end&lt;/source&gt;

== Configuration Options ==
These options are specified on the class level, like ActionMailer::Base.template_root = &quot;/my/templates&quot;

* &lt;tt&gt;template_root:&lt;/tt&gt; template root determines the base from which template references will be made.
* &lt;tt&gt;logger:&lt;/tt&gt; the logger is used for generating information on the mailing run if available. Can be set to nil for no logging. Compatible with both Ruby’s own Logger and Log4r loggers.
* &lt;tt&gt;server_settings:&lt;/tt&gt; Allows detailed configuration of the server:
** &lt;tt&gt;:address&lt;/tt&gt; Allows you to use a remote mail server. Just change it from its default &quot;localhost&quot; setting.
** &lt;tt&gt;:port&lt;/tt&gt; On the off chance that your mail server doesn’t run on port 25, you can change it.
** &lt;tt&gt;:domain&lt;/tt&gt; If you need to specify a HELO domain you can do it here.
** &lt;tt&gt;:user_name&lt;/tt&gt; If your mail server requires authentication, set the username in this setting.
** &lt;tt&gt;:password&lt;/tt&gt; If your mail server requires authentication, set the password in this setting.
** &lt;tt&gt;:authentication&lt;/tt&gt; If your mail server requires authentication you need to specify the authentication type here. This is a symbol and one of :plain, :login, :cram_md5
* &lt;tt&gt;raise_delivery_errors:&lt;/tt&gt; whether or not errors should be raised if the email fails to be delivered.
* &lt;tt&gt;delivery_method:&lt;/tt&gt; Defines a delivery method. Possible values are :smtp (default), :sendmail, and :test. Sendmail is assumed to be present at &quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;.
* &lt;tt&gt;perform_deliveries:&lt;/tt&gt; Determines whether deliver_* methods are actually carried out. By default they are, but this can be turned off to help functional testing.
* &lt;tt&gt;deliveries:&lt;/tt&gt; Keeps an array of all the emails sent out through the Action Mailer with delivery_method :test. Most useful for unit and functional testing.
* &lt;tt&gt;default_charset:&lt;/tt&gt; The default charset used for the body and to encode the subject. Defaults to UTF-8. You can also pick a different charset from inside a method with @charset.
* &lt;tt&gt;default_content_type:&lt;/tt&gt; The default content type used for the main part of the message. Defaults to &quot;text/plain&quot;. You can also pick a different content type from inside a method with @content_type.
* &lt;tt&gt;default_mime_version:&lt;/tt&gt; The default mime version used for the message. Defaults to nil. You can also pick a different value from inside a method with @mime_version. When multipart messages are in use, @mime_version will be set to &quot;1.0&quot; if it is not set inside a method.
* &lt;tt&gt;default_implicit_parts_order:&lt;/tt&gt; When a message is built implicitly (i.e. multiple parts are assembled from templates which specify the content type in their filenames) this variable controls how the parts are ordered. Defaults to [&quot;text/html&quot;, &quot;text/enriched&quot;, &quot;text/plain&quot;]. Items that appear first in the array have higher priority in the mail client and appear last in the mime encoded message. You can also pick a different order from inside a method with @implicit_parts_order.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An anonymous editor renumbered some of the requirements, presumably to match the numbering as adopted in his or her division.  If this is the case, it would be better to make two versions of the honor and create a disambiguation page.

I would do this myself, but I need to know which division numbers them differently.  I checked the South Pacific Division, and though the wording of the requirements are slighty different, the order is the same as in the North American Division and the General Conference edition.

* Veggie burgers

Baked potatoes, corn on the cob, and veggie burgers can all be baked by wrapping them in aluminum foil and covering them with hot coals.  Veggie burgers can have onions, carrots, and thin potato slices added to them and cooked in the same package.  Delicious!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Weekend campout are a lot of fun, especially if the campers have some knowledge of camping!  Once every five years, Seventh-day Adventist Divisions hold a division-wide camporee, where people from all over their division attend.  Many clubs from outside the division also attend.  In 2009, the North American Division held a camporee in Oshkosh Wisconsin, and it was attended by 33,000 Pathfinders!  The NAD also held camporees in Oshkosh in 1999 and in 2004, and at other locations prior to that.  

Within the Divisions are Unions, and many of them hold camporees every five years as well.  Union Camporees are held between Division Camporees.  Divisions are made up of local Conferences.  Many Pathfinder clubs attend Conference Camporees every year - and some conferences have camporees twice a year (once in the fall, and again in the spring).  In addition to these camporees, some clubs go camping by themselves as a club.  This is a special bonding time for members of the local Pathfinder club.  Of course, Pathfinders also like to camp with their friends and families, and those trips can also be used to meet this requirement.  Remember, the more you know about camping, the more fun it is!

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|Ruby on Rails|Built-In Rails Tools/Convenient Rake tasks|Built-In Rails Tools/Command-Line Reference}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
You can make your own rake task by creating a file in the &lt;tt&gt;lib/tasks&lt;/tt&gt; directory of your Rails application and adding the Rake tasks to it. For example, adding the following to &lt;tt&gt;lib/tasks/database.rake&lt;/tt&gt; will make the &lt;tt&gt;db:recreate&lt;tt&gt; task available to your Rails application:
&lt;source lang='rails'&gt;
  namespace :db do
    desc &quot;Drop and create the current database&quot;
    task :recreate =&gt; :environment do
      abcs = ActiveRecord::Base.configurations
      ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(abcs[RAILS_ENV])
      ActiveRecord::Base.connection.recreate_database(ActiveRecord::Base.connection.current_database)
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

The namespace method puts the contents of the block in the specified namespace. You can nest namespaces as deep as you want although usually one or two nestings is sufficient.

This task can now be executed with

&lt;pre&gt;rake db:recreate&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can teachers be flexible in an era of accountability?}}
{{Rquote|right|Our children ... deserve an education worthy of this great nation. Together we will make sure that every child learns and no child is left behind.|George W. Bush}}

Teachers have always felt the need to be accountable for the students they teach.  They grow attached to their students and they want them to succeed. According to the Education Commission of the State website, accountability means holding key individuals and groups responsible for student achievement through the systematic collection, analysis, use and reporting of valid and reliable information. Accountability systems assume that educators, policymakers and others know how to act on the information to improve education.”  Ever since the federal law, &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; (NCLB), came into play in 2002 the era in which teachers teach has become more scrutinized than ever before.  &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; reauthorizes a number of federal programs that aim to improve the performances of the United States primary and secondary schools by increasing the standards of accountability for states, school districts and schools, as well as providing parents more flexibility in choosing which school their child attends.  (No Child Left Behind) This act requires that by the end of the 2005-2006 school year that all teachers will be &quot;highly qualified&quot;.  To be considered a &quot;highly qualified&quot; teacher, new teachers must hold a bachelor's degree and must be able to pass a state test demonstrating their subject knowledge and teaching skills in all core content areas for elementary level, and for middle and higher level, they must pass a state test in each academic subject area they teach, plus have an undergraduate major, graduate degree, or coursework equivalent to an undergraduate major or an advanced certification or credentialing. (No Child Left Behind)  These standards become very hard to implement in various places around the country due to small communities with small schools.  In an interview with Kathleen Rowe, an instructional aide for the Buchanan County Public Schools, Rowe stated, “In rural areas, we are often times faced with choosing anyone willing to work with the students.  We face that problem in this county because we’ve hired all the known qualified people in the area and we are still lacking.” (Rowe)  

==Becoming Flexible==
Teachers not only have to recertify themselves every now and then, and teachers must always be striving toward making their resume of education better, teachers also take this accountability idea personally.  This is where flexibility comes in to play.  Teachers need to move into mentorship, coaching, and ongoing professional development in order to stay accountable.  Teachers must always be aware of the content they are teaching because ultimately assessment leads back to the content taught. (Jackson)Teachers and administrators must always be checking themselves to make sure that all state standards are being met and carried out in the way they were intended.  In order for all of this to be done, teachers must remain flexible.  Teachers must be willing to put forth the extra effort to help his/her students in anyway possible. In order to make sure that no child is left behind, teachers need to always be on the look out for new ways to interest students in their studies and to always present the content is a easy manner for all to be able to understand.  Teachers can remain flexible by speaking one-on-one with the students and finding out how the child learns best.  With a classroom full of children, no one child is the same, so teachers must be flexible in dealing with the opportunity to teach in various ways for the many types of different learners she encounters. Without this flexibility, teachers would be denying their students a quality education. A loving, stress free learning environment is best for children to retain the information needed to be known for standardized testing. Currently, most states are so focused on standardized testing that this way of evaluation and assessment has become the norm.  (Zimmerman)  Students and teachers alike feel like they must master the art of taking a test in order to pass, but they do not really focus on the material being taught. Teachers should be able to help their students learn how take the tests in the easiest way possible, with the least amount of stress involved.   As you can see, students, teachers, and parents all live in an age of accountability.  Students are pushed to their breaking points to learn certain standards and teachers are held accountable for the student’s results. (Gusky) In order for students to want to learn, incentives may need to be offered to help students stay motivated.  

==Getting Help==
In March of 2004, the Department of Education provided three new ways of flexibility for rural school teachers, science school teachers, and those teachers that teach more than one subject.  For teachers in rural areas, they are often faced with the task of teaching a subject that they may not be certified in.  The Department gave those teachers 3 years to become highly qualified in the additional subject they teach.  They were also to be provided with professional development and supervision to becoming highly qualified in these subjects.  Science teachers are a lot like rural teachers.  They are often called upon to teach more than one area of science.  The Department provided flexibility by leaving it up to the state to determine, based upon their qualifications, if they are highly qualified in a “broad” field of science or in just one particular subject.  For teachers who are current and are teaching more than one subject, there were required to go through the HOUSSE (High, Objective, Uniform State Standard of Evaluation) program to become highly qualified in each subject taught.  This process often times became very repetitive.  In the new guidelines, states may bring these evaluations together for current, multi-subject teachers to be able to show that they are highly qualified in all subjects at one time.  (ECS)

New teachers are also given the flexibility to have “alternative ways of certification”.  This could be one of two ways, such as allowing a candidate to teach while they are obtaining their state certification or the state itself can adopt new routes to certification, like have an all around assessment for candidates instead of relying on their course work in education school courses.  (ECS)

==Conclusion==
We’ve seen that there are many requirements that the “No Child Left Behind Act” states for current and future educators, but there is room to be flexible.  The Department of Education has been flexible in allowing educators many ways to become highly qualified, while teachers have personally become flexible in making sure that all of their students can learn the material in their own way for the standardized assessments

In order to do this, I will assess each student on what they learned and how they learned the material.  To help all students in their own way, I will show different ways one can learn the same topic.  I will motivate my students by making the material interesting and easy to comprehend.  In order to keep my students motivated, I will offer incentives for work well done.  To be flexible, I will continue to participate in professional development activities by attending meetings and seminars to learn more about the latest information on the state standards, I will continue to recertify myself when needed and always use the criticism of others to help me provide the best quality of education I can to my students, so no child will be left behind.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What makes NCLB an enemy of quality education?}}
{{Rquote|right|It may be time to reflect on the possibility that a nation of good test-takers is not necessarily a well-educated nation.|Diane Ravitch|Huffington Post, 9/4/07}}

The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB as it is also known), was proposed by President Bush in 2001 and signed into law on January 8, 2002. NCLB reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the main federal law affecting education from kindergarten through high school (ed.gov). NCLB was intended to revamp the education system, and has been built on several principles such as providing academic standards, increased accountability and more school choices for parents. Each state is required to set academic standards in reading and math. The school districts and schools are held accountable for their students in meeting those standards. If students are attending schools that are failing to meet the academic standards, the parents are to be given choices to obtain free supplemental tutoring or to send their children to other schools. On paper NCLB may seem like a great idea, but in reality it is destroying our education system. The principles for which NCLB claims to stand will be challenged in this article so that one can see that the NCLB Act truly is the enemy of quality education.

==Teaching to the Test==
{{Rquote|right|NCLB is the main reason that I left the classroom (I taught science and math) because I was unable to be the kind of teacher that I wanted to be. Instead of teaching my students to think, I was required to drill them endlessly, filling their heads with information that has little meaning in order to perform well on tests that they did not respect.|Elisheva H. Levin|New Mexico}}

Under NCLB, all public schools are to annually test students in grades 3-8 in reading and math, and once again during high school. The tests are intended to help the parents, students and teachers to know just what the students are learning throughout the year and whether or not the students may need help in certain areas. This one-size-fits-all theory limits our teachers and eliminates other content areas and activities. Teachers are required to teach the material that is covered on the   standardized tests, thereby depressing the efforts of providing high quality education to the students. Many teachers find that a steady stream of standardized tests is taking too much time away from classroom instruction, undermining their efforts to provide a developmentally appropriate program that meets the needs of all students and truly helps them to learn (Odland). Content areas such as the arts, enrichment, gifted programs, and special education have been affected by either being changed or eliminated in order to ensure proficient academic performance. Students have different learning styles and levels at which they learn. They come from different backgrounds, with different experiences and skills. We cannot expect them to be same. We can give them the same education, but what they do with it, how they learn and grow from it will be different with each student, standardized tests will not change that. With so much time being spent on “teaching to the test”, there is less time for individual instruction to reach those with different learning styles and levels. To expect each student to be the same defies the ability to cultivate individual students and to help them to reach their fullest potential. 

==Accountability==
{{Rquote|right|I became a teacher because I want to serve struggling students who need a little extra motivation and exposure to rich learning experiences. But my options are being narrowed down by a restrictive curriculum and a scripted phonics-limited reading program. I feel as though I am becoming a learning technician instead of a teacher.|Joe Navarro|first grade teacher}}

According to the US Department of Education, the NCLB Act will give accountability for results (Ed.gov), but to whom are the schools being held accountable? The US Department of Education would have one believe that the schools are accountable to the parents, educators and local communities. Rep. Scott Garrett (R) from New Jersey disagrees stating, “NCLB entirely missed the mark.  It centralized accountability in Washington with the bureaucrats and appointees at the U.S. Department of Education, completely bypassing the legislators in 50 state capitals, countless township school boards and local elected officials, and -- most importantly -- administrators, educators, and parents all across the nation” (Garrett). Under NCLB, each state is required to define the adequate yearly progress (AYP) for school districts and schools, within the parameters set by Title I. The schools not meeting the AYP for two consecutive years are identified as needing improvement. After four years of failing to meet adequate progress, the district must implement corrective actions to improve the school, such as replacing staff members or fully implementing a new curriculum (Ed.gov). Although it may seem this system would hold inadequate schools accountable, it is still misleading. Rep. Garrett gives an example about a school in his district in the State of New Jersey, “every year, nearly 100% of the students graduate and go on to attend college and the school’s average combined SAT score hovers at 1100.  This is a school bursting at the seams with motivated teachers, students, and parents.  But, it was put on the warning list because one student did not meet NCLB’s requirement for what they deemed was “adequate performance” (Garrett). Another example is Amelia Earhart Elementary School in Provo, Utah which failed to meet the No Child benchmarks because of low scores by just three students with disabilities (Ripley). This shows how the federal government is using NCLB to hold back schools and their students. The teachers are required to teach on a lower level or slow down for a few students so that they may do well on the standardized tests, therefore increasing the AYP levels for the schools. This causes the remaining students to receive a watered down curriculum, increasing the odds of the losing interest or not working to the best of their ability. If the only school requirement is to pass the standardized tests, then why should they put more effort into their education? Quality schools are more than just test scores. A quality school provides an atmosphere where students and teachers are excited about education and learning new material, challenging each person to go that extra mile, where the adults care about the individual students and their gains in education, and where students have an “I can” attitude and not one of dread.

==Choices==
Along with the federal requirements that states implement the AYP guides in all schools and districts, they are also required to give the parents choices. In his speech at the University of New Hampshire in January 2002, President Bush stated, “If a school can't change, if a school can't show the parents and community leaders that they can teach the basics, something else has to take place. In order for there to be accountability, there has [sic] to be consequences. And the consequence in this bill is that after a period of time, if a parent is tired of their child being trapped into [sic] a failed school, that parent will have different options, public school choice, charter, and private tutoring.&quot; (Snell). The problem with this is that many parents of students in failing schools are not aware of the right to transfer their children. School districts have not made the effort to inform their communities of their public school choice. When a parent does request a transfer, the “choice” of schools they are offered are usually to other Title 1 schools that may be just as low-performing as the school in which they are transferring from. Another detail not known to most parents is that school districts decide which schools the parents will be allowed to “choose” from. Causing further confusion, under NCLB the Title 1 federal funding, money used to provide extra educational services to disadvantaged students in high poverty schools, does not follow the student to the better performing, non-Title 1 schools. Therefore, those schools that are performing better, that a parent may want to transfer their child into, have no financial incentive to admit low-performing students. In Richmond, Virginia during the 2002-03 school year, there were 120 requests for transfer out of 8,000 eligible children. Only 30 of those were honored by the district (Snell). If the NCLB is supposed to give parents choices, they should not be denied their choice because the federal government will not allow the proper financing. The parents and students are in a sense trapped. Once again, this shows that many of the ideas that look good to those in Washington do not work in the thousands of school districts across the United States.

==Conclusion==
{{Rquote|right|Get rid of NCLB. Perhaps we should have a No Person of Federal Government Left Behind act and test our legislators according to standards. If they don't pass, they should be replaced immediately.|Mary L|former teacher, Pennington, IL}}

The No Child Left Behind Act is not the way to make sure that our children are educated properly. It is the responsibility of the parents, schools, local communities and each of the 50 states to ensure that children are receiving the quality education they are entitled to. It is not the responsibility of the federal government. Those who work at the federal level in Washington, D.C., cannot know how to educate children in a particular school or classroom better than those working with the children on a daily basis. Schools should not be penalized because a few students were not able to pass a standardized test, especially when those students may have disabilities that those in Washington do not understand or did not take into account when this law was passed. There is much more to education than what is covered in the standardized testing material. As Paul Houston has stated, “If we put too much emphasis on a lower, common denominator, we will be sacrificing higher possibilities for our children.” The concern of NCLB is comparative group scores. Shouldn’t the concern for our children be for their individual growth? We need to know where each and every student started in their educational learning and how far we as parents and educators can take them.

{{question-answer|question=After reading this article, do you believe that the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is the enemy of quality of education? Why or why not?
|answer=No Child Left Behind is the enemy of quality education. This education act is actually hurting the efforts to improve the quality of education by assuming that all of our schools and teachers are in need of the federal government’s help in teaching our children. Nothing can be further from the truth.

The federal government is dictating not only what our teachers can teach, but also how they should teach. The teachers are essentially being treated as though they are unskilled workers, who need to be told exactly what to do and when to do it and for how long. To make matters worse, there are penalties for the teachers and schools that buck the system. The federal government will no longer give funding to those schools that do not play by their rules. What those at the federal level seem to misunderstand is they cannot know how to educate our children better than the teachers who are with them on a daily basis, working at the children’s level. 

The NCLB focuses on reading and math proficiency so as to narrow the gap in those areas, however content areas such as history, science, art, music and physical education are being narrowed or even left out of some curricula. This is telling our children that the only important part of school is what is going to be tested on, and they do not need to worry about the other aspects of education. This is the wrong message, in order for our children to become productive members in our society; we need them to be well educated in ALL content areas, not just reading and math. Learning activities in these content areas help to develop citizenship, social responsibility, cooperative behavior, critical thinking and problem solving skills.

If teachers are given the opportunity to do their jobs, without the interference of the federal government, our children would be better educated individuals with the skills necessary to function in our society. Teachers will become excited about their jobs once again and will pass that excitement along to their students. They can challenge the students to go further and do their best in all areas, not just in the areas that the government says they have to pass a on a test. The truth of the matter is, education is more than just scores on a test. The No Child Left Behind Act is teaching the wrong lesson.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should teachers teach ethics?}}
{{Cquote|To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.|||Robert Waldo Emerson|Ryan &amp; Bohlin, 1999}}

==What are Ethics?==
===Definitions===
Before we can begin this philosophical journey of education, we need to define the word itself.  What are ethics? 
Ethics deal with a human philosophy, with respect to what is right and wrong, good and bad, and the motives behind those actions (Dictionary.com). 

As I looked into this subject I had to define morals, values, and character because they all flow evenly through each other and build upon one another.  
*  Morals are the principles or habits with respect to right and wrong conduct 
*  Values are the beliefs of a person or social group in which they have an emotional investment (either for or against something)
*  Character is a moral or ethical quality in respect to honesty, courage, or integrity (Dictionary.com).

===History===
{{Rquote|right|It is not the brains that matter most, but that which guides them- the character, the heart, generous qualities, progressive ideas.|Fyodor Mikhaylovich Dostoyevsky|Ryan &amp; Bohlin}}
Throughout history there have been varying thoughts on the purpose of teaching.  Plato debated whether teaching was to provide students with practical skills or to make them virtuous people.  Today, “teaching is essentially a moral endeavor, in that the purposes of teaching - to make people more knowledgeable, more skillful, more thoughtful – mean making them better than they were before,” (Hansen, 1993).

===Social Need===
The purpose of ethics is to rationalize morality.  This forefront of values and rules, guide the choices and actions of individuals within a larger community (Ethics and Policy Integration Centre, 2003).  Schools can contribute to this development by first expanding our children's knowledge of personalities. During school, children are able to interact with people whose families differ from their own.  Secondly, they are exposed to new group norms and institutional practices (Thorkildsen &amp; Walberg, 2004).

==Implementing Ethics in the Classroom== 

Sometimes we teach one specific subject, and the results of our teaching are unintended.  Many morals that are taught are unanticipated.  For example, an act as simple and common as raising one’s hand establishes order and teaches us to take turns (Hansen, 1993).  You do not have to write a lecture in order to teach ethics.  There is no VA-SOL curriculum to follow.  Ethics are all around us, everyday.  It is up to teachers to develop their own philosophy of ethics and determine the best way to introduce them into their classroom.  There is no question; teachers can teach ethics through the application of our daily school requirements and routines.

===The Teacher's Role===
If we as teachers are going to be responsible for teaching ethics, it is important be aware of our personal beliefs, what we value and treasure in human nature.  It may be helpful to define a teaching philosophy or character guidelines that you want to be the foundation of your classroom.  It is important to be aware of our values and biases, and it is our duty as teachers to present both sides of the spectrum and not to reflect all of our personal beliefs onto our students.  Only then can we truly guide our students to define their own. 

===Religion===
In the American school system, there is established distinction between morality and religious dogma.  The idea of teaching religion and morals in public schools causes many teachers and administrators to feel uneasy.  Because many moral convictions are common to popular faiths, some social scientists believe that teaching morals is to promote the establishment of religion.  On the other hand, some church leaders conclude that ethical behavior will disappear if religious beliefs are not taught to all young people (Zakariya, 1987).  The battle between religion and moral principles does not need to deter teachers from providing our nation's youth with positive character traits.

===The Building Blocks of Character===
{{Rquote|right|Treat others the way you want to be treated.|The Golden Rule}}
When I think of this topic, a title of a book continues to echo in my head.  Robert Fulgram wrote the book, ''All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten''.  As I pondered all the ways in which teachers regularly teach ethics, I decided that ethics, like all other subjects, begins in kindergarten and we elaborate on them each year.  There are 5 character traits that we learn early in school and build upon for the rest of our lives:

1. Honesty – “Did you hit Johnny?” This is a common kindergarten question, which challenges children's first instincts to lie to their teachers.  This is why we create consequences, like the loss of privileges.  These same choices will continue through life, only the loss of playground time could turn into jail time.

2. Responsibility – “It is your job to feed the hamster every morning this week.”  In the first years of school we are taught that animals, plants, and people need each other.  Even being the line leader gives us the feeling that our class might not make to art without us.  In a sense, it is our first feeling that society depends on our help.

3. Sharing – “Can you share the doll with Sally?”  Giving something that belongs to you, or that you initially possessed, is a challenge for children and even many adults.  We teach that life isn’t fair, and quickly learn that if we share with someone then they might share with us.  As children grow, the scope of their sharing becomes larger, and we encourage our students to collect food for the homeless or volunteer for an organization.  Learning to help those less fortunate is a fundamental characteristic of our society. 

4. Respect – “It is not nice to tease people; please stop.”  It is necessary for teachers to create a safe, comfortable environment for all of their students.  This entails role modeling acceptance and tolerance for all races, ethnicities, religions, and genders.  It is important that students know that they are an important part of the class; they learn respect for themselves.  “Please do not write on the desks.”  This is the beginning of respecting others people's property.  

5. Success – “Tommy, that is a wonderful picture you have drawn.”  From the beginning of our lives we need to be nurtured.  As we become little people, we begin to have a desire to be praised.  And quickly this feeling forms into an aspiration to succeed.  We continue through life with this desire.  We wouldn’t be here without it.   

As we aim to become the best teachers that we can be, it is important to define our moral ground.  Our students will need our guidance and direction when it comes to the skills they acquire and the people they become. We cannot control the decisions of our children, for that is human nature.  We can provide them with all the information they need to become the remarkable members of our captivating society.

{{question-answer|question=If you were the speaker at a high school graduation, what 5 character traits would you want to impart upon the students? Explain why.
|answer=High school seniors are ending one large portion of their lives and preparing to embark on a sometimes scary journey into the &quot;real world.&quot;  If I were to leave them with 5 character traits that would help them on their expedition I would choose trust, responsibility, success, forgiveness, and respect.  

Trust is an important trait that people should acknowledge.  These young adults should remember that you cannot trust everyone, but allow everyone to trust you.  Knowing that someone can depend on you is one of the most valuable assets in the workforce.   
This leads into responsibility.  I am sure that this word has echoed in the heads of all of these students for the past 12 years.  &quot;Don't forget your homework! It is your responsibility!&quot;  Well now, it is your life that you are responsible for, and that may seem scary.  You all have taken responsibility to make it this far.  Continue on this path, you hold this in your hands.  Hopefully your parents and teachers have guided you in the right direction.  

Next we have success because without the desire to succeed, no one would ever amount to anything.  None of you would be here, including your parents and teachers.  This is something that is innate, you are born with. Don't be scared because you will be amazed on how your instincts will kick in! 

We also need to have forgiveness.  I want to pass this trait onto you because you should always remember, we are all human.  This means we are imperfect.  We will not succeed at everything and someone you love will disappoint you.  The most important thing to remember is to forgive yourself and forgive your loved ones.  Life is too short to waste your time hating people, including yourselves.  

Last but not least I want to leave you with respect.  Never let someone take advantage of you, respect yourself.  But make sure that you are respectful when asserting respect for yourself.  Don't burn bridges that you may want to cross later.

Having the responsibility to speak at graduation is a grave one that is often not taken seriously.  Not only do you have to worry about stand in front of a group of your peers and their families, but you also have to think of something to say that will be uplifting without sounding too cliché.  There are many aspects that you want to convey about going into the future, however you yourself can only guess what the future will be like.  If I were giving the speech, I would want to convey the characteristics of honesty, responsibility, sharing, respect, and success.  These lessons are learned at an early age, and just grow as we do.  

Honesty is one of the most important ones.  We must be honest with ourselves to get were we want to go in life.  Although it seems that we live in a some what corrupt world, it is important to carry the trait of honesty.  It makes the quality of life better.  If you live an honest life, you are more likely to succeed in your every endeavor.  

The next would be responsibility.  This too is a very important part of life.  Now that one is out of high school, they are beginning a new life that Mom and Dad are less in control of.  If you get a bad grade, you have to deal with your teacher.  If you get thrown in jail, it’s on your record for life.  Al; of your actions from this point on you are responsible for.  It’s time to step up to the plate!  

Third, sharing, is often forgotten now a days.  People are so consumed with self that they forget to think of others.  It can be something as easy as sharing the sugar with a next door neighbor, or something larger like helping people less fortunate than yourself.  It is important to remember that we do not exist in the world alone, and to co-exist harmoniously, we must appreciate and share with each other.

Respect is a very important issue that is a necessity in our society.  It goes along with sharing.  We must all learn to respect each other in order for us to live the best way.  Finally, success.  I believe that if you have all four characteristics above, you will be successful.  Its important to know success is not defined by money or what you have but instead by what you accomplish.  Stay humble! &amp;mdash;Jamie LaCava
----
I thought that the concept of the question was quite good, however when I think of character traits that I would desire to impart upon the young people of tomorrow, I thought about five entirely different traits.  I determined that being a graduate about 8 years ago, and being a graduate in the years to come will be an entirely different journey for young students to embark on.  With that in mind, I chose perseverance, awareness, focus, strength, and lastly assertiveness.  Now while some of the traits could possibly be interchangeable, I felt that the overall sense of what our children will need is strength.  I did not feel that the traits listed in the above essay were necessarily character traits.   

Essentially I agree with your thought that this world is not all peaches and cream, however if you really want them to make their mark, they will have to assert that mark.  Privileges are not being handed out, and an individual with a lot of resolve will go a long way.  Ultimately I feel that we can hope to assert all of these personality traits in our students while they are in out class, but ultimately we can also guide them academically and make them deferential, and intellectual beings.}}

      <comment>/* Competing against the global workforce */ formatting</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we train Americans to compete in a constantly changing world work force?}}

In November 2000, Condoleezza Rice stated: The growing international trend toward democracy and market economies will only be positive for the United States if our job structure in the New Economy matches our workers’ skill sets. There is a growing gap between the knowledge-based,
technology-intensive jobs that are driving the U.S. economy and the skills of American workers. Education is the top national security issue of the 21st century. 

Since then, we have obviously shifted our security concerns in response to Sep.11, but the competitiveness of our national workforce is still a top concern.  The United States ranks 10th in adult literacy among 17 high-income countries. Our nation has the largest gap between highly educated and poorly educated adults. The young adults in our country are the most shocking. We perform worse compared to our peers in other countries from ages 16-25. Individuals have the responsibility to learn the necessary skills to compete in the workforce. We need to improve our education system at all levels to make a change.

== Competing Against the Global Workforce ==
{{Rquote|right|For the United States to remain competitive in the knowledge based global economy it is critical that we create and maintain a world-class education system that prepares our workforce with world-class skills.|President George W. Bush}}
In his State Of The Union Address, President Bush announced The American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) to encourage American innovation and strengthen our nation's ability to compete in the global economy (January 31, 2006, Office of the Press Secretary). To compete more effectively in the global marketplace, the American Competitiveness Initiative proposes $380 million in new Federal support to improve the quality of math, science, and technological education in our K-12 schools and engage every child in rigorous courses that teach important analytical, technical, and problem-solving skills (January 31, 2006, Office of the Press Secretary). Under the ACI, we are training 70,000 teachers over five years to teach Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate math and science classes. We are also trying to bring in math and science professionals to teach high school. At the early level there is a program called Math Now for elementary and middle school students. Thirty years ago, the United States had thirty percent of the world’s college students. Now, that number has fallen to fourteen percent and is falling. Countries like India and China are providing more educated workers for less pay. Indian Engineers make $7,500 compared to $45,000 for an American with the same qualifications.

== Education System ==
Our education system was designed for jobs that required a less technical background. Most of our teachers come from the bottom third of college graduates. The main problem is the pay a teacher makes is considerably lower than other professions. We must educate the future generation with more qualified teachers. Other countries send their kids to college at sixteen. We need to look at how we can modify our system so it is always improving and we can continue competing. Perhaps our high schools should be more like college where students can choose a concentration of study their freshman year. We should provide more specialized schools early on for students interested in vocational studies. Now, as the world is growing more and more technologically advanced, we need to look at improving the system to fit the new demands of the global labor force.

==Adult Education Programs==
Although emphasis is placed mainly on the K-12 student population learning job related skills, adult education programs are becoming more and more important in the U.S.  “Either through choice or necessity, more and more adults are seeking career assistance, and in order to address career or job concerns, are frequently enrolling in educational programs” (Keierleber and Sundal-Hansen, 1985).   Layoffs have disrupted the lives of millions of Americans over the last 25 years. We as a nation must offer these displaced workers retraining and more education so they may find new and better-paying careers.  Adult Education can provide adult courses in math, in English as a second language and in preparing for a high school diploma.  It provides job-hunting assistance, with help in conducting interviews, filling out applications, and writing resumes.   It also steers workers into on-the-job training with future employers.  There are may Hispanics living in our country today who have never had to communicate in English and about 50 percent who are high school graduates but functioning at a fifth- or sixth-grade level.  Therefore, adult programs are needed to meet the increased demand of adult education and training to provide qualified workers for a growing economy.

== Mississippi Board of Education ==
Changes in our education system are already starting. The Mississippi Board of Education has a five step outline to improving their school system and the 26.6 percent dropout rate. They are making the curriculum more challenging, improving on quality and quantity of teachers, improving the quality and quantity of school leaders, create a culture in Mississippi that values education, and redesigning their education system for the 21st century workforce.

== U.S. Secretary of Education ==
&quot;We cannot prepare students for the global economy if we don't get them to grade level first.&quot;( Secretary Margaret Spellings). She supports the No Child Left Behind Act, which says our schools must bring our students up to grade level in reading and math by 2014. As a result of this act, test scores have risen and achievement gaps have shrunk in states across the country.  Secretary Spellings believes we must not retreat from the world in the face of increased competition(U.S. Secretary of Education—Biography).

== A Vulnerable American Economy ==
The report is based on an detailed survey of 431 human resource officials that was conducted in April and May 2006 by The Conference Board, Corporate Voices for Working Families, the Partnership for 21st Century Skills, and the Society for Human Resource Management(The Conference Board, Oct. 2, 2006). The interviewed employers said more than forty percent of high school graduate entry level positions are not qualified. They also said that forty seven percent of two-year and four-year college graduates were lacking in writing skills. &quot;One message of this study to educators, policy makers and those concerned with U.S. economic competitiveness is that new entrants to the U.S. workforce are not demonstrating levels of excellence necessary to compete successfully in the face of rising global labor market challenges,&quot; says Susan R. Meisinger, President and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management(The Conference Board, Oct. 2, 2006). &quot;It is clear from the report that greater communication and collaboration between the business sector and educators is critical to ensure that young people are prepared to enter the workplace of the 21st century,&quot; says Richard Cavanagh, President and CEO of The Conference Board. &quot;Less than intense preparation in critical skills can lead to unsuccessful futures for America's youth, as well as a less competitive U.S. workforce. This ultimately makes the U.S. economy more vulnerable in the global marketplace.&quot;(The Conference Board, Oct. 2, 2006).

== Conclusion ==
The challenge we now face is to answer the question, “How do we reform our out dated educational system to meet the demands of a constantly changing global market?” We have proposed solutions and have instituted action. The competition for the U.S. economy to ever adapt and improve is here. We must start early at the education level and raise our standards to meet and surpass the rest of the world. With a more educated workforce, we can provide higher quality products and innovative ideas to keep us ahead in the global economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Why are all subjects are essential to be taught?}}

All throughout the course of a child’s education, many things change. They go to different schools as they get older, have different friends, and acquire new teachers. Their interests change from playing with friends after school to sports ,and members of the opposite sex. The one thing that remains constant is the subject matter that is being taught in schools. Regardless of what school a student goes to, the same basic subjects will be taught and all of them are important as they contribute to the development of a student’s mind. While some subjects may be more valuable to students than others, they all shape the way a person thinks. Often times, students may ask, “When am I ever going to use this stuff?” What they don’t see is that they use it every single day whether they realize it or not. 

==Reading, Writing, and Speaking==
Reading, writing, and speaking are essential for everyone to function on an every day basis. While reading is an activity that almost all children learn to do at a very young age, comprehension is a totally different story. Just teaching a student to read is not enough. They must be able to understand what they are reading. There are a few good skills that must be practiced while learning to comprehend what is being read (Colorado). Comparing and contrasting is a great way to get a student thinking about more than just what the story says at the surface level. Also, getting a student to try and figure out the theme to stories and solve the problems that may exist in the story is a great way to make them use their mind for deeper thinking (Colorado). 
Research now shows that low reading achievement more than any other factor, is the root cause for lower performing schools. Reading is considered to be the fundamental skill upon which all formal education depends on. Any child that does not acquire the necessary skills to read, will be at a disadvantage academically in all fields, however because of recent scientific research and the newly discovered learning disabled program in the Special Education department, new instruction has been developed to help these children read at level once the instruction is delivered by the proper skilled/ trained teacher (AFT Union of Professionals,2007).

The ability to write is an essential tool that students must be possess if they are going to be successful in school and in life. There are several areas in which writing is used in every day life. In the most basic way, people use this skill when doing something as simple as writing down a note ([http://www.ed.gov/pubs/parents/Writing/index.html]). Writing will be used in almost every profession imaginable in one way or another. Whether it is writing a letter to someone or just writing down simple calculations, basic writing skill will be used in the workplace ([http://www.ed.gov/pubs/parents/Writing/index.html]). 
According to the Belden Russonello &amp; Stewart research and communications survey, Americans voted that writing skills are essential to get ahead today. Nearly three-quarters of Americans say that it is more important today than it was twenty years ago to possess such a skill (Belden and Russonello,2007)There is a high demand for higher education when trying to obtain employment in today's society as well. Along with higher education comes the responsibility of knowing how to communicate ideas verbally, as well as on paper. Writing enhances the development of many other activities as well. Writing helps build vocabulary, and also helps develop important reading skills.

Speaking is another skill that is kind of lost in the shuffle after elementary school. Public speaking is way too important for this to happen. It is completely irrelevant the knowledge a person may have about a particular subject if they can not verbalize their point. Public speaking is used in almost every profession. Someone can be a great writer but may not be able to present the materials in front of other people. One way for children to develop profound readeing and speaking skills is the use of phonics. &quot;Phonics is a method of teaching reading based on pronounciation&quot; (Leinwand 89). Helping the pronounce the words in order to read them also helps them to be able to say the different words correctly. It also gives them more confidence knowing they all they have to do is take the time to pronounce each syllable. It is harder for employers to find people who can not speak properly credible if it appears that they are unsure or do not have any knowledge as to what they are talking about.

==Mathematics==
Most individuals in today’s society do not realize how much mathematics is involved in their daily lives. A skill as simple as counting is using a math. Every time an individual counts, they are using the basic function of addition. From such a basic skill as counting to designing a computer, math is essential in life (Roman). Engineering is one field that uses math more than others. 

{{Rquote|right|Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.|Albert Einstein}}

Engineering has crossed our paths in one form or another. Engineers designed the cars that are driven to work every day. Engineers designed the highways and bridges that are used for our daily commuting purposes. Without the usage of math, these necessities that we take for granted would not be possible. Almost nothing that we have in the world today could exist without the usage of math (Roman). Students do not care for mathematics because they view math as difficult. That is why it is important for teachers to provide remediation for students who do not understand and make it their point to emphasize the importance of math, not to just teach it.

==Science==
Where did we come from? Why is the sky blue? Why are there clouds in the sky? All of these are questions that most people will ask themselves throughout the course of their lives. That is why science is another important subject in schools today. Without science, these basic questions of life could not have been answered. Science gives people an understanding of the world and why earth functions the way it does. Without science, there would be no way to calculate time. Along with every other subject already discussed, science is used in one way or another in most professions. Without science, how would doctors be able to treat people who are ill? Engineers use science along with math to design the tools that we use on an every day basis. Math and science compliment each other in discovering some of the mysteries of the world. 

==Literature==
Literature is a subject that many students feel is unnecessary in school. They could not be more inaccurate. Literature greatly benefits people. First, it expands the imagination. Great literature can take the reader back in time or to some magical world. Next, literature provides the reader an interpretation of the world from someone else's point of view ([http://www.memorial.ecasd.k12.wi.us/Departments/LangArts/dnelson/amlit/beginyear/amlitwhyreadlit.htm]). Everyone perceives the world in a slightly different way. Literature is a way in which to use the mind to look at the world through someone else’s eyes. Most people just view it as a source of entertainment and of no educational value. When your mind is forced to think in a different way than what it is accustomed to doing, it sharpens the brain and increases the imagination ([http://www.memorial.ecasd.k12.wi.us/Departments/LangArts/dnelson/amlit/beginyear/amlitwhyreadlit.htm]). 

==History==
Most people view history class as being forced to learn a bunch of facts that have no meaning to there life. History is so much more than just learning dates and facts. It is what is done with that information that is important. Instead of just learning that something happened, it needs to be taken into consideration why something happened. It is then that history becomes useful in the world today (Ragland 3). History is useful in today's classrooms because in many cases we have seen that history often repeats itself (Leinwand 77). Even essentialist thinkers believe in a mastery of basic knowledge, a main component being history (79). As we look through all angles, history is a large part of education in all aspects and is one that should not be left out of education. When students know about what has happened in the past, they can use that information to help make decisions. Students can then truly understand history and use it in their lives. 

==The Arts==
The arts are not studied as much in school as the rest of the subjects but it is still very important. Art provides a way through which to communicate to people who may not even speak the same language as the author (Dickinson)! Art can be used to tell a story or just make a statement that everyone can understand regardless of what language someone speaks. Art also makes people think more deeply into it than a lot of other subjects do. When looking at art, it could take a very long time to get what the author is trying to say. This makes the viewer think critically about it (Dickinson). Some schools have taken time and money away from the arts to be able to focus more time on the core subjects.  A study published in 2003 by Graham Wilkins et al surveyed over five hundred elementary schools in the Commonwealth of Virginia and showed that taking time away from the arts may be counterproductive.  Schools that spent more time in the core subjects and less time in the arts did not have significantly higher tests scores than the other schools (Wilkins).  The researchers also found that spending more time in the arts may be related to higher test scores but more studies would need to be done to support that idea (Wilkins). The arts are equally as important in the overall development of students by making them well rounded individuals. Students are typically more active in an art, music, or physical education class, and that activity and break from the typical lecture style class may help increase students' attention and decrease unwanted behavior from some students.  

==Conclusion==
Some of these subjects are going to be more valuable to some than others, but all of them are essential in developing one’s mind. The goal in education is to produce as well rounded of people as possible. Different students will succeed in different areas, but they need to have a general understanding of all the subjects. They are the future of the world and having the privilege of teaching them must not be taken lightly!

{{question-answer|question=Should the subjects that are viewed as less important be focused on in school as much as the major subjects?
|answer=Every subject is extremely important in the development of a students mind. But when it comes down to it, some are more essential to be learned than others. It is important for a student to be shown art and how important it is, but it is not going to be used on as big of a scale as math is. Math is something that every student must learn regardless of what career they choose. Also reading comprehension and good speaking skills are essential to everyone. While the lesser subjects still must be taught, these major ones have to be focused on a little bit more. A student can go on to be a very productive citizen without understanding art, but if they do not understand math or have good reading skills, it will be much harder to be productive. This is not to say that the lesser subjects should not be taught because they should. When it comes down to it, some things are just more valuable to have than others.
----
I believe that every subject we teach in school is important.  As a student and an individual going into the education field I believe that the subjects that are considered less important are actually very important and should be taught in school.  I was not a person who liked art or music when I was in school.  I cannot draw and I did not care to listen to the music that the teachers played for us.  Even though I had these thoughts I believe that these subjects should be taught in school.  Art is important because it helps us build an imagination and express how we feel.  On the other hand music should be taught in school because it helps us learn how it all originated and music is apart of our every day world.  We all listen to some kind of music on the radio.  Physical Education is an important part of the world of education, but I do not feel like it is stressed enough.  Our world is full of obese individuals and it should not be.  If we were to teach the proper information to our students about eating and dieting we would not have such an obese country.  

I believe that some subjects are more important than others.  The four basic subjects math, English, science and history are all key components to life.  We use math in the everyday world whether it is counting or using a checkbook and most all professions use it.  English is used to read, write and communicate and without these skills you could not make it because they are required.  In science we learn where we came from, how things occur and what causes them.  In history we learn about past events and what caused them to happen.  I believe that these four subjects are the most important subjects in the world of education, but every subject should be taught and pushed to learn. &amp;mdash;Ashley Stern
----
The subjects that are less important should focused on just as much as the subjects that are viewed as most important.
Some students excel in the less important subjects more than they do in the more important ones. Focusing on these subjects as well will help give these students a boost of confidence which is very important, because it will help them to feel as if they are just as smart or just as capable. Also the less important subjects should be focused on, because they give the students the skills they need to succeed in the other more important subjects as well as the skills they need to make in their future career choices. Although these skills should be focused on, I think it is important that hey do not test students on this material. Of course, in-class tests are important but standardized tests should not be given. I think that testing students on these subjects would discourage them from wanting to take these classes. I think that it would also discourage students from doing well in these classes. This is because I don’t think that students will be as interested in the material if they know that they have to be tested on the material. The less important subjects are just as important as the more important ones and I don’t think that the information in these classes should be pushed just as much as the information in the other classes. &amp;mdash;Carmen Brown
----
The purpose of school isn’t just to learn and become productive citizens.  School should expose students to many different subjects so that they have a chance to explore new things, develop interests, and become a well-rounded individual.  Music, art, physical/health education, and vocational education should not be given the same amount of focus, but should be given more time than already allotted in most schools.  The secondary subjects give students a chance to apply some of the concepts they learn in the core subjects to more than just experiments in science class or written tests.  If taught in such a manner, the secondary subjects can be a chance for students to see in action what they are learning in their “pointless” math, science, and history class.  Music is opportunity for students to use math while counting rhythms, applying science concepts to pitches and tones, and they may also be able to hear some of the popular music during a time period they are learning about in history class.  In art class students use different materials to make things and science shows us why some materials are better than others, it also tells us why the coffee mug we just made cracked in the kiln.  Physical education uses science and math a lot (I don’t know how else to say it).  Newton’s Laws, calculating heart rate, keeping score, movement in general requires the laws and theories of math and science.  Vocational education, especially at the high school level, uses math and science in everything from calculating the amount of materials needed to build something to determining why an engine isn’t functioning properly.  These secondary subjects should be given more time (in relationship to how much time they are given now) because it not only gives students an opportunity to apply what they’ve learned, they also can help develop interests in subjects that can lead to career choices or hobbies they wouldn’t normally develop. &amp;mdash;Jon Durham}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we improve early childhood education (3- and 4-year-olds) for all?}}
{{Rquote|right|90 percent of the brain has been developed by the time a child is 5 years old.|Unknown}}

Over the past years, time and resources have been invested in order to improve the K-12 education in the United States. These efforts may be in jeopardy if more importance is not given to early education for 3- and 4- year old children. School readiness is an important factor that needs to be considered, in order to benefit the educational progress. Studies are showing  that at risk children are not prepared enough  to enter kindergarten, compared to high income children. One of the greatest setbacks is the lack of cohesiveness among federal and local governments when administering programs. The Good Start, Grow Smart early literacy initiative was launched by the Bush Administration in 2002. This initiative was created in order to improve children's school readiness. To accomplish this the Federal Government intends to broaden the goals of the Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) and their funding (Clearinghouse on International Developments). Taking all these factors into consideration, early childhood education is a critical component in America's effort  to improve education and create a world class workforce. (A Call To Action From the Business Community).

== Supporting Research== 
{{Rquote|right|As states implement the No Child Left Behind Act, designed to ensure that all students are proficient in reading and math by 213-14, we also need to ensure that children enter school ready and able to succeed. Research shows, however, that far too many children enter school ill-prepared.|Corporate Voices for Working Families}}

The National Research Council released  ''From Neurons to Neighborhoods: The Science of Early Childhood Development'', a compilation of current scientific data and knowledge regarding the development of children from birth to age five. Through  this research four important findings were identified. First, it is important to understand that the development of the brain, which is affected by early experience, lays down the foundation for moral development, intelligence and emotional health. Secondly the ability for healthy early development depends on nurturing relationships. Thirdly, school readiness is greatly affected by the way children think and more importantly, how they feel. Lastly,  children's needs are not being met amongst the vastly changing society (From Neurons to Neighborhoods).

It is being discovered that by the time children enter kindergarten at the age of five, there is already a wide gap in their readiness for school. It is known that lower SES children enter kindergarten with poor skills in the major areas of learning and development (Lee and Burkam), compared to the higher SES children which are performing 60 percent higher in achievement tests. This can be attributed to many factors, including lower attendance in programs prior to entering kindergarten (Lee and Burkam).

Typically, children’s abilities are related to their families’ income levels. Yet the quality of early childhood experiences can make a tremendous difference and make a difference regardless of family characteristics. Research has shown that children of both high and low SES, who are involved in high-quality pre kindergarten programs, perform significantly higher on measures of abilities and skills that are vital to their success in school (West, Denton, and Reaney). Not only are these programs critical for low SES children but middle SES children can significantly benefit from early childhood education programs (Lee and Burkam). It is important that the existing gap between low, middle, and high SES children when entering kindergarten be reduced in order to ensure success for all students.

== Principles ==  
In order for there to be a successful early childhood education program, there must be a set of defining principles. Six main principles have been identified and will be used by The Business Roundtable (BRT) and Corporate Voice for Working Families (CVWF) to create policies and evaluate current programs. The six principles include: learning, standards, teachers, parents, accountability, partnership (A Call To Action From the Business Community). 

The first principle is '''learning''' because in order for the system to be successful, children's learning should be the central mission. In order to accomplish this, positive learning experiences are needed to create interconnections between a child's cognitive, social and emotional development(A Call To Action From the Business Community). 

The second principle is '''standards''', which will ensure the quality of early childhood education systems, and alignment with state academic standards. Objective, curriculum, and research are all aspects of creating and maintaining standards of these programs.

The third principle is '''teachers'''; it is vital that teachers and staff possess the skills, attitudes and knowledge to help children enter school prepared and ready to succeed. This can be achieved through the employment of skills teachers with college degrees and adequate knowledge (A Call To Action From the Business Community). 

The fourth principle is '''parents'''; parents are considered children’s first teacher and these parents need to be offered high quality programs for their children to enroll in. It is key to be able to make early childhood programs accessible to all families, regardless of their socio-economic status(A Call To Action From the Business Community). 

The fifth principle is '''accountability'''; a successful early childhood program must be accountable for measurable results. Data collection plays an important role in identifying the best practices, performance and assessment systems (A Call To Action From the Business Community). 

The sixth principle is '''partnerships'''; this principle builds interconnecting partnerships that will govern, finance, sustain and improve the system (A Call To Action From the Business Community). 

== Programs == 
{{Rquote|right|The access of children 3-5 years from ethnic and low- income backgrounds is a serious concern. Only 45% of children from 3-5 years from low-income families are enrolled in pre-school, compared to 75 % among high- income families.}}
There are currently a variety of programs being offered for 3 and 4 year olds. The problem is that high risk children do not have the same accessibility to these enriching programs as other  children. Current programs include: head start, early head start , Pre-K and other smaller programs. 

===Head Start=== 
Head start is a federal program created for children from low-income families. This preschool program is operated by local non-profit organization and are available in most counties throughout the United States (Give Your Child A Head Start). Many other services are provided in conjunction with head start such as medical care and availability to healthy meals. Head start is designed to assist all children in succeeding,  enriched with development activities and parent involvement to ensure progress among the participants. Early head start was created as a predecessor to head start, to further ensure school readiness when children enter preschool and Kindergarten. This program believes that children living in high- risk environments need additional aid and support to ensure healthy development. The gaps found in children’s social and cognitive abilities are present even prior to their entrance into head start programs at the age of four (Early Head Start Works). Thus this program was created for 3 year old children at high- risk, in order to further ready them for head start and other preschool programs. Although this is a high quality program made available to low SES families, less than three percent of these children are being served by the program (Early Head Start Works).

=== Pre- K ===  
Pre-K is a state funded program available to three and four year olds in the U.S. The Pre-K program is equipped with well qualified teachers, and different levels of funding through states. Yet only about 15 percent of children eligible are taking advantage of the Pre- K program (Pre-K Now). Pre-K is a high quality program with many researched benefits. It creates successful students , responsible adults and stronger communities (The Benefits of High-Quality Pre-K). The Chicago Longitudinal Study, has provided data regarding the benefits of  Pre- K programs. The participants of this program have higher high school graduation rates, do better on standardized tests, and have reduced grade repetitions (Chicago Longitudinal Study). 

== Benefit vs. Cost ==  
According to the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), the benefits of providing quality preschool education to 3- and 4- year olds outweighs the cost of providing such services (Cost of Providing Quality Preschool). The estimated return for every dollar invested is $7, based on the reduced costs of remedial education and increased earnings. NIEER estimates that the average benefits will be $25,000 per child,  as the result of  a universally accessible program for 3- and 4-year-olds. The benefits of such a program considerably outnumber the costs of creating and providing  this program.

==Principles to Policy==
{{Rquote|right|In 1990, the nation’s governors and the Administration set as their first National Goal that “ By the year 2000, all children will start school ready to learn.}}
There are many early education programs available, funded through many different sources. Yet these programs are not reaching the children they need to reach. Some programs do not meet the high quality standards, and many programs are simply not as accessible as they should be. Taking into consideration the core principles of a successful early childhood education system, policies need to be implemented in order to see the fruition of these principles. These principles can be used to formulate interconnected state and federal policies, in order to offer a more cohesive early education program for all(A Call To Action From the Business Community).

== Conclusion ==  
Future progress of the current education system in America is dependant on the implementation of an early education program. As research has demonstrated, there are tremendous gaps between the school readiness of children from varying social economic backgrounds. In order for all children to be prepared for kindergarten, there must be a universal accessibility to a proper policy driven early childhood education system.

{{question-answer|question=What is the importance of providing early childhood education for 3- and  4-year-olds?
|answer=There are a vast number of importance's in providing early childhood education for 3- and 4-year-olds. Through research it has been found that many high risk children are not prepared and ready when they enter kindergarten. The consequences of this include, children that fall further and further behind, and children that are never able to catch up to their counterparts. Children develop an enormous amount of knowledge through experiences and interaction. By the time they entire into kindergarten a large part of their development has been established. Thus it is necessary to enroll children in preschool programs at ages 3 and 4. This will ensure school readiness among lower SES children, and will benefit everyone.
----
There are many reasons and issues as to why pre-elementary education is important to three and four year old children's' development. The first key factor for putting a child in an educational program early is to offer them the beginning elements of socialization. Interacting with peers teaches them a multitude of social skills that they will need to develop at some point in their lives. It also exposes them to small doses of diversity at a young, impressionable age. This helps a child learn tolerance early in life so that they do not become too sheltered. Another important advantage to early education programs is that they will be taught critical academic basics earlier on in life than those who may not attend. Teaching young children things like counting, alphabet basics and education based motor-skills early will possibly give them the educational edge they may need to succeed further in life. Moral lessons are also learned earlier in life; things like sharing, right from wrong, and obedience. &amp;mdash;Tiffany Sullivan}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we find other ways to finance American schools?}}

American public schools run on a certain economic equation.  A percentage of tax payer money is used for education.  The amount of money is broken down within the individual school system to determine how much will be spent on each student.  The wealthier an area, the more money the school has to spend on each student.  This can leave many schools at a large disadvantage. School districts also must face the education budget being cut all the time.  Stan Karp discusses the impact of tax reform in a 2003 article.  The fight to give schools enough money and have equal opportunities is virtually impossible through taxes alone.  It costs so much money to run a school, which most areas also come up short. This is why people are always searching for alternative options to help fund schools in America.

==Importance of the Distributions of Funding==
A problem that also goes along with financing American schools is how the funding is distributed. A special report by the Education Trust states that we spend on less in areas that are highly concentrated with low income and minority families.  According to the 2005 analysis, we spend $900 less in poor areas than what is spent in suburban areas which is unfair to the students receiving schooling.  Because of this unequal trend, students that live in suburban areas receive better technological equipment and receive higher grades.  Poor districts have low-quality equipment which discourages the students from learning.  Schools should all receive an ample amount of funding to provide for the needs of its students.  

==Charter Schools==
Charter schools exist in many states; they are both publicly owned and financed.   Margaret Hadderman wrote an article describing exactly how charter schools work and how they are financed from when they began back in 1988.  Although they are “public,” they are not held to many of the public school district’s rules.  Charter schools are set up to achieve some goal, and if they produce results then they are able to be free of many traditional standards.  They are funded by transferring pre-pupil state aid from the school district.  Grants are also issued, and most are on a 3-5 year basis.  Aside from the government funding, charter schools can receive financing from private donors and various foundations.  These schools often have a theme.  Some are based more on science and technology, while others may be more language arts driven.  Peter Schrag has written an article about why these schools are not working financially.  He discusses the teacher unions fight against privatization, and that bidding wars are a result of schools trying to gain more students. 

==School Vouchers==
Andrew Coulson describes school vouchers as a kind of scholarship program.  Instead of giving the money to the public school, they give it to a child’s parents in the form of a voucher.  This voucher gives them the power to decide what school they would like their child to attend.  This idea originated because of the under-performance of many schools.  It is meant to hold schools accountable by taking away funds if a student decides to attend another school. The funding comes from a combination of the government and private organizations.  This is favored by many republican leaders, with the concept originally advocated by Milton Friedman.  Opponents of this idea believe that it is not a fair system because even with a voucher, private schools do not have to accept every student that would like to attend their school.

==Corporate Funding==
Corporate funding is a more controversial option being looked at to help fund American schools. This concept can be as simple as a restaurant hosting a school night one evening, and giving 20% of the profits to the school.  It can be as large as a computer company providing all the funding needed for technology, but in return would make the curriculum more technology based.  In an NPR article, an example of a school who partnered with Pepsi Bottling Group is used to show how this option works.  In order for the school district to receive a potential $8.1 million over five years, they agree to only sell Pepsi products aside from milk and school brand water.  This sounds like an easy way to earn extra money, but the catch is that the money comes from the actual soda sales at the schools.  This upsets many parents, because they see it as the school pushing soda on their children to earn the money.  

Corporate funding can also have a line drawn as it relates to wealthy and poor areas.  A company is not going to want to support a school that does not give them the publicity that they are looking to receive.  Product placement is not very successful, if the families that attend the school cannot afford to buy the product.  Small school districts also lose out on this deal.  Corporations would likely look to large school districts in order to get the largest profit available.

Kevin Bersett wrote about the movement of parents that is building to block corporate funding.  Parents fear that school is becoming more about product placement than it is about learning.  Some even fear that children are being brainwashed to an extent.  Others argue that favoring a particular product is a small price to buy for so much educational financing support. According to the Michigan Education Report, corporations are not disagreeing with the gains they receive from this type of relationship.  They see it as a win-win partnership.  They receive publicity, and schools gain the much needed funding.  Even with the controversy surrounding the issue, many agree that the use of corporate money will likely stay and expand over time.

{{question-answer|question=Thinking about corporate financing as an alternate proposal to help fun American schools, what do you think are the positive and negative sides of the issue?
|answer=I think that public schools could gain from corporate funding because so much money is needed in the school system, and corporate sponsors have the ability to help with much of the burden.  It can  be done through  simple sponsor nights to avoid a large scale burden inside of the schools.  In return, schools have to allow for product placement and advertising.  On the other side, I can see why parents are unhappy with corporate funding.  Parents do not want their children to come second to the product because schools will do anything for the money.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we educate students for creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship?}}
{{Rquote|right|We cannot adopt the way of living that was satisfactory a hundred years ago.  The world in which we live has changed, and we must change with it.|Felix Adler}}

There is an old adage that says “If it is not broken, don’t fix it.” Sadly, this wise saying does not apply to the crisis facing America’s schools.  The system of education in America’s schools is in need of repair.  Since the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), one of the major focuses in America’s schools is raising the test scores of America’s students in order to comply with the NCLB Act.  Many schools have demonstrated with their test scores that they are showing adequate yearly progress (A.Y.P.); a mandate of NCLB Act.  However, many educators and parents are concerned that these objectives do not adequately fix the problems in the current system of education.  

Rather than focus mainly on test accountability, American schools need to also focus on new objectives such as creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. To promote a positive learning environment, it is essential that these three objectives be an integral part of the schools’ curriculum and manifested within every classroom. 

The system of education in America has changed over the years.  However, there is a greater mandate for change in the schools approach to education.  All children do not learn the same.  Therefore, our philosophy in educating students should not be a “one size fits all” mentality.  It is important that our pedagogies reflect changing times.  In order to change and improve our education system, Dennis Littky, cofounder of the Big Picture Company and the director of MET schools in Providence, Rhode Island suggests that, “We must love our children more than we love our current education system and structures” (2004).  Littky and his administration are strong advocates for catalyzing changes in American education in schools across the country.  The MET school’s philosophy is educating “one student at a time.” Since the Metropolitan Regional Center and Technical Center (MET) school’s founding, they have successfully demonstrated a “98 percent college application rate; a 98 percent college rate; 95 percent attendance rate; and a dropout rate of less than 3 percent” (2004).

== Creativity ==
{{Rquote|right|Creativity – and not standardization – may be the driving force behind an effective education system.|Yong Zhao}} 

The concern of many educators is that American schools are sacrificing crucial key objectives within the educational system, which Yong Zhao refers to as “our secret weapon” (2006), due to the pressure to raise test scores.  The “secret weapon” Zhao is referring to is creative thinking.  According to Zhao, our major competitors who already have “test score” driven curriculums are seeking creativity and American schools are fixing the wrong set of problems.  Zhao points out that, “Whereas U.S. schools are now encouraged, even forced, to chase after test scores, China, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan -  all named as major competitors- have started education reforms aimed at fostering more creativity and innovative thinking among their citizens” (2006).

Creativity can be fostered or it can be stifled.  As defined by educator Larry Roberts, “Creativity involves a person’s ability to use imagination or inventiveness to bring something into existence” (2003).  Everyone has the ability to be creative. For some students it is easier than for others.  This is why it is important that schools set up a learning environment that encourages the creativity process.  Many educators feel that creativity and independent thinking are being sacrificed and are looking for ways to bring meaning and joy back into the classroom.  Ron Ritchhart, author and teacher, suggests three ways to help teachers to respond to the pressures of standards and external exams.  (1) ''Creativity and curriculum'' – look at what you are asked to teach with an eye towards shaping it in new and more productive ways, which may involve the teacher finding new topics to explore; (2) ''Creativity and instruction'' – a creative approach to instruction entails finding new ways to accomplish familiar tasks by asking yourself the question, “How can I make this content more engaging and meaningful for my students?”; (3)  ''Creativity and students'' – design open-ended projects and assignments in order to provide many avenues for personalized expression as students think for themselves and develop original response to the curriculum (2004).  

When students are allowed and encouraged to use their imagination and creativity, it enhances and adds excitement to learning, for both teacher and student.  In a truly creative environment, learning is more than rote memorization.  Students become engage and interact with the learning material. They cease to be spectators; hence real learning begins. 

Learning strategies are another way to help engaged students and promote learning.  Howard Gardner’s theory on multiple intelligences (1983) provides teachers with an excellent vehicle to cultivate creativity within the classroom environment.  In Gardner’s theory, the school’s curriculum must appeal to multiple facets of a child’s intelligence recognizing that a child learns in many ways.  Gardner’s multiple intelligence theory was applied in a Multiple Intelligence/Learning for Understanding (MI/LfU) pilot study at a community college.  In the school’s findings, ninety-two percent of students rated their understanding level of academic material at the satisfied to excellent range after completing an M/LfU course (Diaz-Lefebvre, 2004). Put simply, the best way to minimize the “memorization-regurgitation game” (2004), which is the learning process for many students, is to expose them to other methods of learning.  An effective educational system includes creativity in order to better prepare students to become innovate thinkers in the global world.  

== Innovation ==
{{Rquote|right|In teaching, as in business, it is the sizzle that sells the steak.|Rachel Laufer Anderson, teacher}}

Creativity and innovation go hand and hand; both are important objectives needed in schools in America.   Innovative educators teach creatively and make learning relevant to students by utilizing real life experiences in their classrooms.  The authors of “An Entrepreneur in the Classroom: Innovative Teaching,” compare teachers to entrepreneurs, referring to them as “''creative risk takers in the education world''” (Anderson, et.al.1997).  These authors define innovative teaching within the context of entrepreneurship.  “In the same way entrepreneurs recognize skills and talents in those around them and act to capitalize on them: innovative teachers also recognize in their students abilities in varying degrees and seek to provide a conducive environment to develop the child’s individual skills and talents” (1997).  As one teacher put it, “In teaching, as in business, it is the ''sizzle'' that sells the steak” (1997).  

Innovative teachers produce creative students.  Innovation serves to benefit students in many ways.  Educator, Ron Ritchhart has identified four benefits of creative and innovative teaching within the classroom: motivational, social, efficacy, and performance (2004).

The first benefit is '''motivational''' because teachers “foster intellectual passion” among their students; therefore students are motivated to learn (Ritchhart, 2004).  

The second benefit is '''social'''.  Students are encouraged to work together as a team to understand the learning material “building learning communities within the classroom” (Ritchhart, 2004).  

The third benefit is '''efficacy''' which helps students gain “a sense of efficacy as they learn how to learn and develop the habits of mind that support good and productive thinking” (Ritchhart, 2004).  

The fourth benefit is '''performance'''.  Students learn the material not just memorize it increasing their ability to apply what they have learned properly in new situations (Ritchhart, 2004). 

Teachers often use real-world applications to help students to make connections and apply them.  For example, Ward Ellis, an eighth grade physical science teacher at Toano Middle School in Virginia, used hot air balloons rides as an innovative approach to illustrate density to his students.  At the end of the school year, he concludes the chemistry and physics unit by bringing in his truck and dismantled engine to demonstrate how simple machine operation works. In the classroom, his philosophy is “Making what you learn to fit your life” (Ward Ellis, personal communication, September 18, 2007).

== Entrepreneurship ==
{{Rquote|right|To make learning relevant, we must create links between schools and business, between the courses students take and real–life experiences.|Cheryl Carrier}}
{{Rquote|right|While the end goal, to ensure a quality education for all, is worthwhile, we need to be careful that our efforts to ensure across-the-board quality in the educational experience don’t diminish the very excellence we prize, that in our efforts to raise the floor, we don’t revert to lowering the ceiling.|Ron Ritchhart}}

Entrepreneurship as a new objective in schools in America can be accomplished in two ways: First, by the teacher viewing themselves as entrepreneurs realizing that they have a product (education) and the students are the consumers.  Secondly, schools should implement entrepreneurial education within their curriculum in order to teach students to think entrepreneurially.  In an attempt to encourage the development of entrepreneurial thinking among students at the elementary, middle, and high school levels, the American Educational Research Association designed a program called Entrepreneurs in Action!  The entrepreneur education program was combined with curricular context, independent thinking, and problem solving in a business context.  By using a cognitive apprenticeship approach, “Students used knowledge in ways similar to how they would use it in a practical, or “authentic,” setting. For example, if students learn mathematics in authentic settings, such as in setting up a business, they are more likely to begin thinking “like a mathematician,” or to see the world the way a mathematician would see it” (2003).  The most significant outcome of the program was that students learn to think for themselves while learning to explore and discover ideas new to them (2003). 

Entrepreneurial education is effective in using “real-life” contexts to teach students and help them to understand how to problem solve.  As one of the objectives in schools, it can help teach student how to be innovative and develop critical thinking skills.  It serves as an important component in preparing students for future success as business owners and leaders, as well as helping them to compete successfully in a global economy. 

== Conclusion ==
One way to fix the problems plaguing the system of education in American schools is for educators to rethink the role that creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship plays within each school curriculum and classroom.  The purpose of these objectives serves to educate our students, producing students who enjoy learning, as well as teachers who enjoy teaching.  The end result is a successful learning environment where students are motivated, engaged, and excited about the product we sell – education.  

Besides educator Ward Ellis, there are many other teachers using creative and innovative teaching approaches in their class room as a means to inspire and cultivate learning in their classrooms.  For instance, David McDivitt, of Oak Hill High School in Indiana, used a computer game to teach his students about the political and economic causes of World War II.  Also Caroline Faure, of Highland High School in Idaho, brought real-world journalism to her students through live broadcasting.  The broadcasting program was so successful that it broadcast live to the school’s community.  Faure credits the success of the program on the “Three R’s for the next generation: rigor, relevancy, and relationships.  It’s ''rigorous'', incorporating reading, writing, science, and math.  It’s ''relevant'', providing students with content that stresses real-work experiences.  And it’s about ''relationships''” (T.H.E. Journal, 2006).

{{question-answer|question=In light of the recent education reforms mandated by the NCLB Act, how can creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship be integrated in the learning environment of American schools? 
|answer=Although standards and test scores are used as a method or means to assess students learning, they must be kept in proper perspective.  The inclusion of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship in the school’s curriculum is important to foster a joy of learning and to motivate students.  Equally important is instructional approaches used to teach children that recognized the multiple ways students learn.  Therefore, an integrated learning environment must encompass all three objectives to be effective. By keeping “test score accountability” and other mandates in proper perspective, it is possible for schools to enhance their learning environment.  Of course, teachers are an integral part of this combination.  In order for integration to be achieved in the classroom, teachers must focus on the students not on the external mandates, such as being SOL focused.  Teachers who are prepared and passionate about the course they teach find it is easier to be creative and innovative in the classroom.  As a result, students become engage in the learning process making it easy to teach the curriculum and the objectives of the course. Thus, the learning environment is enriched because students are doing more than rote memorization.  In classrooms that integrate creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, students learn to become critical thinkers and life long learners.}}

According to Merriam-Webster, labor unions are defined as organizations usually consisting of workers of the same trade that are formed for the purpose of advancing its members’ interests (as through collective bargaining) in respect to wages, benefits, and working conditions. Union formation has brought about many improvements in the labor system of the United States.  They protect the rights of workers and the conditions of their employment. The teacher’s union is by far the largest organization of unionized workers.  With over 3 million members, which account for 80% of all teachers, they are a powerful force. In contrast only 11% of the private sector is unionized.

==History==
Teachers in the 1800s were limited in their ability to communicate with other teachers.  Fifteen states had formed education associations in hopes of improving teacher to teacher communication. In 1857, Thomas W. Valentine, president of the New York State Association, called together the other associations to join forces in Philadelphia and form the National Education Association.  Over the next one hundred and fifty years, the NEA has worked to transform education and the teaching profession. The American Teachers Association (ATA) began in 1904 when teachers in black schools were encouraged by John Robert Edward Lee to form a national association. In 1916, in Chicago, their name changed to the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and they became a new national union and later an affiliate of the AFL-CIO.  In 1947, these two organizations began the process of uniting to work on the improvement of the public education system and the teaching profession. After almost twenty years of negotiation, an agreement was forged and in 1966 these two powerful organizations merged (NEA website).

==Pros==
Early educators were treated with bias and discrimination.The women and blacks were paid far less than the white male in the same position.Hours were long and benefits poor.   Establishment of the union led to improved working conditions for teachers.Their implementation has ensured proper salaries and benefits of employment.Teachers are strong supporters of their unions.  A 2003 national survey of teachers by the Public Agenda Foundation showed that 87 percent of veteran teachers and 79 percent of new teachers feel a union is &quot;absolutely essential&quot; or &quot;important&quot;.The same amount of veteran teachers agrees that &quot;without collective bargaining, working conditions and salaries of teachers would be much worse&quot;(Kaboolian,2006). Improving working conditions for teachers has benefited the educational system as a whole.  By providing teachers with a voice, the unions are advocates for students as well. Who better than teachers, to know first hand the necessary improvements needed in the classroom and schools.  Because of unionization and the collective bargaining process teachers are able to voice concerns about the education system that both the government and the school districts must listen to.  Mandated collective bargaining legislation was formed with these basic intents:1) To create a harmonious and cooperative relationship between school corporations and their certified employees,2) To provide school employees the right to organize, and 3) To protect the public from any material interference with the normal educational process (Cochren, 1998).Union bargaining for lowering class size and teacher hours has benefited students everywhere. A breakthrough was made in 2000 when The Harvard Educational Review released a study (as cited in New York State United Teachers [NYSUT],2004)on the issue of unions.  This study revealed a strong positive link between teachers unions and higher academic achievement.  A team of researchers from Indiana University and the University of South Carolina in Columbia examined rates of teacher unionization in each state and compared them with interstate variation in SAT and ACT scores. Even they were surprised when it was concluded that students being taught by unionized teachers scored higher than their counterparts educated by non-unionized faculty.

==Cons== 
Presence of such a strong union constituency has brought marked criticism.The advent of collective bargaining legislation came to public education 40 years ago.In 1975 there were 241 teacher strikes in the United States.That number has steadily declined over the years with 15 walk-outs reported in 2004.This decline is due in part to laws barring teachers from striking, mandating mediation or binding arbitration procedures (Hess &amp; West, 2006).Yet many agree the decline is due to many school boards and superintendents inability to compete with the unions.  Most school board members are volunteers working with the district in a part time capacity.  Administrators, principals, and board members are often more interested in avoiding confrontation and disruption in education.Unions on the other hand provide a large range of services to bring to the bargaining table.The NEA’s UniServ system for example provides guidance to local affiliates on matters such as negotiations and grievance resolution.This nationwide network of 1,650 full-time and 200 part-time employees provided services amounting to $50 million in 2001(Hess &amp; West, 2006).Many union opponents blame unions for the lack of accountability.Although most teachers are effective and dedicated professionals, there are some who should not be in a classroom. With the presence of strong union contracts,removal of a teacher for incompetence is rarely attempted.When it is necessary, the procedure is complex and lengthy. In many cases union contracts are written to allow for seniority to outweigh education.For example, in the Los Angeles Public Schools a strong union allows teachers to determine what they teach based on seniority rather than expertise in the field.A highly qualified teacher in a subject area may not be able to teach in that area because of their lack of seniority.Unfortunately, many principals have no say in department chairs or teachers for specific courses.In some governing councils, principals exist as a non-voting member and the union members make all the decisions (Ouchi, 2003). 

==The New Union==
While it has been a rocky road between unions and administrators, steps are being taken to improve this relationship.In the late 1990's,former president of the NEA, Bob Chase, called for a “new unionism” in which he advocated a change in attitude in which union members that once saw the central office as an adversary can work in collaboration with administrators for the sake of school improvement.  In 1996, a few union leaders formed the network known as Teacher Union Reform Network (TURN) to search for innovative ways to enhance education and involve the unions in bettering education. TURN co-founder Adam Urbanski describes his organization as “therapy” and a “safe environment for thinking out loud.”Many districts around the country are using ideas founded in TURN to develop teacher performance-pay plans and peer-review plans. Tom Blanford, associate director for education policy at the NEA states, “A lot of the locals that are participating in TURN are on the cutting edge of a lot of education reform issues and are really exploring ways in which the union can be a partner in promoting quality education.That is very valuable to us”(Honowar, 2006).

==Conclusion==
The formation of unions was a pivotal point in labor relations in all fields.Overall, the quality of education has improved largely due to the presence of union representation.Plans for resolution of difficulties between teachers and administrators are in place, and must be implemented,so the real goal of education can be achieved.After all, it is the goal of all parties involved to see that every child is provided with the best possible education.

{{question-answer|question=What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of unionization?Do you think this will impact your decision to join a teacher’s union?
|answer=Unionization has improved working conditions for all laborers. In the teaching profession this has led to improved wages, hour, and benefits.  Being a member of a union means having someone to back you in case of injustices. A disadvantage to unions is the fact that some poor performing teachers are protected from dismissal by them.  Another disadvantage I may face is the policy of seniority over qualification. I may be unable to teach something simply because someone else has been there longer.Without a doubt,if given the opportunity I would join the union. The benefits outweigh any negatives and I feel as if the issues facing them are being worked out everyday.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How might technology revolutionize education in the future?}}

&quot;Technology&quot; is a broad term dealing with the use and knowledge of humanity's tools and crafts. (Technology)  Although the term “technology” itself is hard to define, it is easy to see all of the advances that have been made in the technological field in the past decades and their affects on education.  More people are going to school now than ever before and are enriching and continuing their education with the help of many different technological means.  Not only are computers and other electronic devices being used in the classroom, but distance learning and virtual reality are becoming more common as well.  Incorporating new tools provides more ways for teachers to reach their students, and these techniques are making the learning environment more innovative and interactive.  

==Past Technology==
As little as twenty years ago, no one could have imagined the kinds of technology that we readily have available today.  Students from generations ago had to go to class every day, write notes, and use simple function calculators to solve complex math problems.  To learn a foreign language, they had to listen to their teacher and try to have conversations with other students in the new language.  Any visuals in the classroom were most likely posters or drawings on the chalkboard, and to type a paper meant to use a typewriter, or handwrite it if you could not afford one. To gain information, whether for general knowledge or a project, students had to go to the library and search what was available to them, or were taken on limited, costly field trips.

==Technology Today and in the Future==
In today’s society, technology is everywhere, especially in our learning environment.  Many practices from the past are now rarely used or even considered, because there are now faster, more efficient, and interactive ways to complete the same tasks.

==Technology in the Classroom==
[[File:NICE Figure 1.gif|right]][[File:NICE Figure 3.jpg|right|frame|The NICE (Narrative Immersive Constructionist / Collaborative Environments) Project, is a virtual learning project for elementary school students who learn about the environment and take care of a garden all in a virtual world (Johnson).]]

Students in a classroom now take for granted many of the technological advances that have been made in the past few years, because these tools have become so important to the educational world that they are now widely used.  Teachers are incorporating movies and video clips into their lessons with the use of televisions, and many students now have the opportunity to make a video presentation for class projects.  TV is also being used to support the learning process in an innovative program started in 2006 by the National Council of Teachers and Mathematics (NCTM) and Texas Instruments (TI). NCTM and TI teamed up with producers from the show ''Numb3rs'', a hit on the CBS network, which is about a mathematician who helps the FBI by solving complex theories using math problems.  According to Linda Beheler of TI, the purpose of the program is to make math more relevant in students’ daily lives. “’We always get the same question,’ said Beheler. ‘Students always want to know, ‘How are we ever going to use this stuff in the real world?'&quot; And that's the idea behind the ''Numb3rs'' initiative--&quot;to show them how these [concepts] apply to what they do in life’” (Murray).  The classes using this program have turned it into a web quest in which students go onto the program’s website and download different activities to do which correspond with the focus of the episode.  The activities incorporate scientific and graphing calculators, which are also beneficial technological advances, because now complex math problems can be solved by utilizing the right series of the calculators’ functions.

===Computers===
Computers are one of the most important technological improvements that have been made.  What once took up an entire room now can fit on the desk of any teacher or student, and is even made portable in the form of laptops.  Programs such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and the Internet have transformed the world of teaching.  Now teachers can perform slideshows of their lesson using Power Point, with notes, sound, and video clips; this program combines the lesson and the visuals in one, making the presentation seamless and easier for students to follow.  Students and teachers alike can type and edit a paper using Microsoft Word, save it to a flash drive, and bring it somewhere else to continue working.  This program also allows teachers to type up something for their class and print multiple copies instantly, and it allows students to make last minute changes to a paper or project that needs to be turned in – things that could not be done years ago using a typewriter.   The Internet is an amazing resource that is accessed on the computer as well.  While surfing the web, students and teachers have millions of pages of information at their fingertips, plus the Internet provides access to email and websites that lets teachers, parents, and students to communicate easily and more frequently. In addition to communication, the Internet allows for more access to research materials from all over the world and other information that would not otherwise be available.

===SmartBoards===
An up and coming technological innovation for the classroom is the SmartBoard.  This amazing invention permits the teacher to use the computer as easily as a whiteboard.  It is great as a presentation tool, encourages participation in students with limited mobility, appeals to a wide range of learning styles, and enables students to revisit material they did not understand or were not present to receive, including the teacher’s explanation.  The SmartBoard can be used to view movies and share various software applications with the class including Microsoft PowerPoint, Hyper Studio, Excel, Word, and Internet Explorer, just to name a few.  It has many applications that can be used in a variety of classes.  In Language Arts, students can use it to collaborate on a story and illustrate it.  They can use it to highlight parts of speech in a passage, or to edit or proof read a passage.  It can be use in math to demonstrate and practice problem solving before the entire class.  In Science, it can be used to construct models of the solar system or the human cell system.  In History, it can be used to create Jeopardy Review games that the whole class can enjoy.  The SmartBoard makes learning and presenting a blast!

===iPods===
Another tool that is being used to enhance education is the Apple iPod.  This slim mp3 player has been transformed, and now plays a wide range of audio and video files.  While most people today would still consider it something used for entertainment, a group called the iDreamers at Georgia College and State University are becoming leaders in using the iPod to enhance education.  The practice of using iPods to download class lectures is becoming increasingly common in most colleges and even secondary schools; however this group wants to fully utilize the appliance which they think can do so much more for education.  Professors at this university are finding new and innovative ways to incorporate the iPod into their class, such as having students download movies or presentations on their own so they do not have to spend class time watching them.  Other professors have made podcasts of common questions that students have, so that office hours are freed up for more important topics of discussion.  Foreign language classes are using iPods to download conversations to practice understanding and pronunciation (eSchool).  Many schools are trying to include the use of the iPods in their curriculum because they allow teachers to get information to students without using class time. Dorothy Leland, GCSU president said, &quot;The more you free up your classroom for discussion, the more efficient you are” (eSchool).

==Effective Technology Integration==
Although there are many options for technology application in the classroom, the students’ advancement in learning is attributed to the effectiveness of the technology integration into the lessons.  The “5W/ 5E” method described in the article ''Infusing Technology into any Instructional Program'' is an instructional strategy that can be used to effectively integrate technology into any lesson at any grade level/ content area.  The 5W/ 5E model begins with the basic 5 W’s (who, what, when, where, and why) as applicable to the technology being used (Wathers).  Before beginning instruction, the teacher should consider who the target audience will be, what technologies are available and are the most appropriate, when and where the technology integration will take place, and why the technology is being used.  The 5 E’s address the most critical of the 5 W’s; the ''why''.  The model defines the why of technology integration as engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation (Wathers).  If a teacher uses this 5W/ 5E model prior to beginning use of technology for a lesson, the technology integration will occur in an organized and streamlined manner that will enhance student achievement.

==Conclusion==
With the amazing strides that technology has improved, who knows where technology will be in the future?  If we compare how far the integration between technology and education has come, there is no way to tell how much further it will advance in the proceeding years.  Just like twenty years ago when no one could have guessed that computers would be so widely available, we can not really tell what will be the next big thing.  Some things that show our recent progress are distance learning and virtual reality. “Distance learning
applied physical technology and education processes to serve the needs of
students when they are removed from the source of instruction and resources
by either time or distance” (Cavanaugh).  Distance learning has become increasingly popular, to the point where people can now earn degrees online, sitting at home on the computer, while taking classes with students from all over the nation.  In the future this is sure to expand even further, possibly becoming a way to communicate and learn with students from all over the world.  Another new concept that is starting to become incorporated is the use of virtual reality in the classroom.  Students who are in medical school for example, can practice techniques repeatedly and easily through virtual reality before they move on to a human subject.  This learning technique is beneficial for lower level students as well, such as biology students who can virtually dissect animals; and this learning technique is being tested in the NICE Project, where elementary school students interact with a virtual landscape by growing and maintaining a garden (Johnson).   New technology is being created all the time, and over the next few decades the devices and techniques used now will surely be replaced with something even more advanced and efficient.

{{question-answer|question=Using what you know about past and present technology and how it benefited the education system, what do you think is the most important technological tool in classrooms today?
|answer=Since modern technology as we know it has only recently been incorporated into schools systems across America, it is hard to tell what direction it might progress to in the future. However, I believe one of the most beneficial technological tools in the classroom today is the computer because it can do so many things in the educational world.  Computers help teachers in many ways but some important ones are saving time, providing more ways to reach students, and access to practically limitless information.  Teachers use computers to make their time in the classroom more efficient. They can print multiple copies of handouts for students minutes before students arrive in class, and teachers can use computers to post grades or email parents after class without taking up class time.  Computers can help teachers reach students in a multitude of ways, including Microsoft Power Point slideshows, charts in Microsoft Excel, and audio/video files.  These tools allow teachers more flexibility in the way they teach the lesson, instead of being limited to just reciting information to the class.  Computers are also beneficial in that they allow teachers and students alike to find access to vast amounts of information.  The Internet is a popular source of students who are looking up information either for general knowledge or a class assignment, and many teachers tie in information found on websites to their lesson plans.  By having the ability to use computers this way is in our advantage, I believe that the tools it provides will only help to improve the quality of our education, and hopefully new technology in the future will do the same.

As technology integration has increased in curricula, many teachers are beginning to realize how useful it is.  Technology greatly benefits the education system.  There are many technological tools in a classroom; however, the most important technological tool a teacher is able to use are the power points and the videos they may use for teaching.  Teachers can use power points to teach students practically anything.  One major advantage of the use of power points is the fact that it is very easy to use and is teacher friendly.  Both the students and the teachers benefit from power points.  With power points, teachers can add many visual aids as well as little games and videos to enhance their teachings.  Many images and audio aids may also be added.  Also, it is a good way to integrate technology into the curriculum.  Furthermore, videos are another great way to teach the students.  Teachers can find videos about anything on the internet.  Using videos help the students understand key concepts and objectives.  They are a great way to enhance the curriculum as well.  As integration technology grows, I believe that power points and videos will take a major toll into the curriculum.  Many teachers will definitely be using them more in the future as a way to get knowledge across to the students. &amp;mdash;Kathlyn Odango

Technology has greatly impacted the education system. Even though it may seem like forever ago, not to long ago technology wasn’t used within classrooms. In fact the closest thing to technology was the projector and transparencies. In my opinion, technology is important in two major ways in classrooms today. 

First of all, technology is a wonderful way to do research. The internet has an unlimited amount of resources on it and allows it’s viewers to ask just about any question imaginable. Students no longer have to be frustrated with the card catalog that could quite possibly be missing needed research information. Also, students may want to research a specific topic and because of limited resources their school libraries may not have the needed information. However, the internet provides endless amounts of information and allows students to venture on to whatever research and studies that they choose to research.

Second of all, technology has impacted the way in which teachers teach. Teachers now have other options that could better able the students to understand the lessons that are being taught. Technology allows teachers to use Power Points that could possibly contain videos or other visual images that make the lesson more interesting. Also teachers can now incorporate Internet resources as means of sources and information throughout their lessons. Without a doubt, technology provides students with another viewpoint and allows them to use their visual learning skills to learn the information.

The internet by far is the most important piece of technological tool used within classrooms. There are endless ways in which the internet is used in lessons plans, research, various presentations, and possibly other methods that may not be widely known. The internet provides endless information and allows it’s viewers to access any information with the convenience of it being on the screen within a matter of seconds. Moreover, the internet offers various types of material such as journals, newspapers, encyclopedias, and etc that some libraries do not have. Without a doubt, the internet is the gateway to the world and classrooms everywhere! &amp;mdash;Angela Guzman}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Should students write their own textbooks?}}

Many may think having students write their own textbooks is a ridiculous idea. When we were first told of this idea, I have to admit that I did not know what to think of it. Student written textbooks can be seen as a way of collaborative learning. Collaborative learning is a method of instruction in which students of all levels work together in groups (Tao). It isn’t exactly collaborative learning, but it encourages the same concepts of students taking responsibility for their learning, and sharing it with others. 

==Why?==         
Today the world is changing at a rapid pace. Obsolescence is an object's attribute of losing value because the outside world has changed. For example, if a teacher is handing out a textbook which has been being used for thirty-five years its content cannot be up to date, therefore it has lost its value. New technology like the internet has made finding information quick and often times easy. Students are not only using textbooks to learn but television channels such as “Animal Planet” and the “History” channel. Textbooks are usually outdated by a few years due to how lengthy the publication process can be. Textbooks take years sometimes to be published, by then new information has been developed and students are not getting as up to date information as they should. People are coming up with new ideas to engage the minds of today’s generation. The student of today has video games,computers and television to entertain them. As teachers we have to come up with ideas that the students can relate to. 
	
==New Ideas Helping Shape Today’s Education Systems== 
Ideas such as project-based learning which is defined as a systematic teaching method that engages students in learning knowledge and skills through an extended inquiry process structured around complex, authentic questions and carefully designed products and tasks (Project Based). In layman’s terms, it’s a way to get students involved in their learning, so they are not just listening and taking notes. The idea of having students write there own textbooks is a good example of project-based learning. 

Another way of changing the way students are taught today is using technology integration, which is trying to use things such as PowerPoint, videos, internet and other sorts of technology for teaching students. Lets face it the student’s mind of today is always engaged by video games, television, and computers; we have to find ways as teachers to keep their attention. Learning can be entertaining and students can have fun while learning. It is possible for the word learning and the word fun to be used in the same sentence.  By having students write their own text books they are not only experiencing project based learning, but they are also experiencing technology integration.

==Pros and Cons==
Having students write their own textbook can be a risky process.  On the one hand, it could turn out to be a well-written easy to understand book that includes every important topic and adds no unnecessary ‘fluff.’  On the other hand, it could end up being a messy simplistic book that does not do justice to the important topics.  This is where clear guidelines, instructor input and rating/approval options become critical.  Clear guidelines within which the student writers are expected to stay are important to ensure some sense of cohesiveness throughout the entire text- even with a wide range of students with different styles and levels of writing contributing to one project.  The instructor also needs to be very present during the process whether in making suggestions or edits or deciding on the final cut for content and other specifics (Mankiw).  Feedback in any form, whether positive or negative, whether in person or electronically, is helpful for students so that the process is as much of a learning process as is the absorption of the content.  There should also be some sort of rating or approval system in place for the final product of each student.  It can be peer rated, faculty rated, or even a self-reflective checklist.  It could be a very general system that just reflects on the overall quality of each student’s work, or it could be quite specific and consider the style, length, adherence to guidelines, and level of writing of each composition.  The beauty of student written textbooks is that there are no rules.  The process can be completely different for each and every case, and the final product can literally be anything imaginable.  

==How will this affect the student?==
Student-written textbooks makes the student more responsible for his or her learning. By taking responsibility for their own learning, students should be able to not only read information and remember it for a test, but they will have absorbed the information. Also language of an article may be easier to understand if another student wrote it, then coming from a professional who may have many technical names for ideas. In addition, the student will save money for textbooks which we all know is a refreshing thought. 

==Conclusion==
Student-written textbooks although somewhat new will be being used in classrooms. It will allow project based learning for students which will in turn allow a more active role in their learning. It may take some time for students to adapt to this concept but once learned it is pretty easy. This being my first time helping to write a student written textbook; I do not have any complaints. I also feel I have learned more from doing, rather than just reading and taking notes.

{{question-answer|question=Why is it important for education to evolve with today's student?
|answer=It is important for education to be changed for many reasons. First of all the student of today is different than the student of 100 years ago or even 20 years ago. The student of today has so much technology which in turn has his or her mind engaged most of the time. There are many technologies today which include: video games, high definition television, computers, and iPods. Because of these new resources for education, and fun it will be difficult for many student to sit, listen, and take notes while a teacher is in front talking. The project-based learning idea is a great idea because it is involving the students and getting away from the sit, listen, and take notes idea. It is important for today's education to evolve because today's student is not the same as it used to be. If education doesn't change the students will suffer in the long run.
----
There are many reasons why education needs to evolve with today's students.  The obvious reason is that each new generation of students brings with it new social and technological experiences that can possibly be used to better the students education.  If schools had ignored the integration of computers into modern society and just kept using the same methods of teaching that they had in let's say the 80's there would now be a huge gap between the students education experience and real life.  The gap between education and real life is something schools need to be ever vigilant in trying to close.  If students think what they are being taught is obsolete information they won't care about it. The methods that are used to teach students needs to keep evolving too.  I have to admit that if I would have had access to some of the learning software that students today have access to I probably would have been a lot more interested in subjects like math and U.S. history. Educators also need to recognize what social issues are affecting each new generation of students.  Divorce has had a huge impact on today's generation in comparison to 20 years ago. Socially controversial issues will find their way into the classroom and if educators are prepared they can use those topics to help engage their students more in what they are trying to teach them. Tomorrows schools will always be different than today's because of the kids that are filling them, and the education that we want those kids to value needs to evolve as they do. &amp;mdash;Joshua Geimer}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the role of social media in instruction?}}

Emerging technologies have changed the shape of today’s classroom. The question that continues  arise is “What is the best type of the new technology to use with my students?”  The answer to this question is not always a simple one. It depends on availability of resources and also what the teacher is comfortable doing with the classroom. This article will review some of those resources and their positive and negative attributes.

===Threaded Discussions in Education===
{{Rquote|right|It is the relationships and interactions among people through which knowledge is primarily generated.|Rena Palloff and Keith Pratt|''Building Learning Communities in Cyberspace''}}

According to a web teaching article by Dartmouth College, online discussions allow students to interact with classmates outside of class. Students have the freedom to log in at any time from any computer that has Internet access. They can use these discussion areas to clarify issues they encounter with their assignments, discuss topics raised in class, or can start a new discussion with their peers. The positive side of using threaded discussions is that it can save time for the teacher when preparing for daily classes, allow shy students to feel free to discuss topics they may not be able to do in front of the class, and also it allows for topics of a sensitive nature to be talked about without being a face to face discussion.  The negative side of discussion threads are that it can add to a teacher’s workload if the discussion has too much participation. This can lead to many hours of reading and responding for the teacher. On the other hand, there can be too little discussion if the topic does not catch the student’s interest overall. An online discussion can be facilitated by using chat rooms, discussion boards, and instant messaging programs. Teachers can encourage participation by being more involved, giving credit or extra points in that class, allowing anonymity, restricting access (making discussion board or chat only accessible to the students), encouraging collaboration, and being sure to be realistic about the expectations of the topic and discussion board.

===Web 2.0 in Education===
According to the article at [[w:Web 2.0|Web 2.0]], Web 2.0 refers to the improved form of the World Wide Web and new technologies, such as, weblogs, social bookmarking, wikis, podcasts, RSS feeds, social software, and online web services. Some characteristics of Web 2.0 are applications being delivered entirely through a web browser, users owning and exercising control over their own data, an architecture of participation that encourages users to add value to the application as they use it, rich, interactive, user-friendly interface, some social-networking aspects, and enhanced graphical interfaces, such as, gradients and rounded corners (new to Web 2.0).

===Social Networking===
There are many social networking websites available to the public at no cost. They are designed to allow people to network online much as they would in person. The sites have a registration process which asks many questions which will allow their profiles to be matched by queries of other users. These websites include blogs, groups, photos, music and videos. Some examples of social networking websites are MySpace, Facebook, BlackPlanet, Bandwagon, and Friendster, Classmates.com, Flirtomatic, Livejournal, Myyearbook, Passado, and Stumbleupon. MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and has 54 million profiles currently. These websites have gotten a lot of attention, especially in the education setting. There are positive aspects to these websites, which include, being able to easily setup a class page which can include blogs, videos, photos, and other features. This page can easily be accessed by providing just one web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to type in for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling. It can be customized to make it easy to read and also with as much or little color as desired. You can also change the font and put audio with it to make it accessible to students with visual disabilities. There are also many potential negative aspects of social networking to be heavily considered. Because of the nature of the sites and the age of it’s users, there is the potential for sexual predators to surf the personal websites of the students. According to the Howstuffworks website, there has been at least seven non-violent sexual assaults on minors that have been linked to the MySpace website, and also at least one murder has been linked to a MySpace website. There is a rule that you must be at least 14 years old to register for a MySpace webpage, but this is often lied about by both people who want to appear older and also those predators that want to appear younger than 18 years old. Due to these issues, students will need to be advised on the safety issues regarding these websites. They should be informed of ways to stay safe, such as, not giving out personally identifiable information, not meeting in person other MySpace users, unless you know them in person, employing safe surfing techniques that would be used in any blog or chat room type website, and immediately reporting any suspicious communication via a social networking website to someone that the student trusts, such as, a teacher, counselor or parent.

{{question-answer|question=How do you keep students safe while on social networking sites?
|answer=There are many social networking sites on the Web. Some websites have safety features built in to try and safeguard minor children, but many do not. An example of a website that does make an attempt is MySpace who has special filtering built in to try to keep people as honest as possible. They asked questions in the registration process to try to “catch” both those too young and adults lying about their actual age from accessing WebPages on their site. No system is perfect, so it is important for caretakers and educators to teach our children important safety rules when online. These include, not meeting anyone that the student does not know in person. Also, they should not give out personally identifiable information to someone they do not know,and should report any suspicious activity on their websites to an adult they can trust. Suspicious can include messages, photos, videos, etc. that make the student uncomfortable. The students should also be cautioned on sharing their own photos, videos, or any media that shows who they are or how they may be located, such as, a road sign or store sign in the background. They also should not be posting photos that have other minors in the picture, especially, without their knowledge and consent. This can put them at risk, also.
----
Websites created for students are not just accessed by students but predators that can unfortunately be schoolteachers or older students.  The number one thing that I would advise my students to do is not to give out their personal information or post photos of themselves on websites that they just found. Computers should also have updated filters to block out websites that are not safe.  Another thing that could be useful for students that are using the computers in their school is for teachers to make a student webpage or a folder and save it on the desktop.   The student will access their folder or website by putting in their password. The webpage or folder will contain the links to websites tested by school administration.  As a teacher, I would also send home information about keeping their children safe while they use their computer at home. Having a time limit set for students may cut down on surfing the internet and becoming exposed to sites that are not safe.  Socialize networking can be fun and at times informative however, it also needs to be chaperoned by teachers and parents. &amp;mdash;A. Lancaster}}

Education is a state-controlled manufactory of echoes.  ''Norman Douglas''

We are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing.  ''Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-82) U.S. essayist and poet.''

The average schoolmaster is and always must be essentially an ass, for how can one imagine an intelligent man engaging in so puerile an avocation.    ''H. L. Mencken (1880-1956) American editor, critic and writer.''

There is nothing so stupid as an educated man, if you get off the thing that he was educated in.   ''Will Rogers (1879-1935) U.S. actor and humorist.''

Examinations are formidable even to the best prepared, for the greatest fool may ask more than the wisest man can answer.  ''C. C. Colton, Lacon: Reflections, No. 322.''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Assessments of performance and performance appraisals play a major role in the education system today.  These assessments and appraisals are not only being used to measure student performance, they are also being used to evaluate the performance of teachers and administrators.  The topic of performance assessments is considered one of the “hot topics” on the education agenda and with good reason.  Performance assessments provide a closer look at how students are progressing. Also,performance appraisals provide a way to monitor teacher and administrator progress. Assessments and appraisals are powerful levers that help to shape instruction.  While performance assessments and performance appraisals offer many positive results, they also have some negative effects in our schools today.  Throughout this article we will examine some of the ways performance assessments and performance appraisals are used to evaluate students, teachers, and administrators and the effects of these assessments and appraisals.  

Let’s first take a look at performance assessments of students.  Performance assessment is defined as “a measure of assessment based on authentic tasks such as activities, exercises, or problems that require students to show what they can do (article: The Definition of Performance Assessment).  So just how does this work in an actual classroom setting?  First the student(s) are asked to perform a task rather than to “select an answer from a ready-made list.  The types of tasks that the students are required to perform are based on the method that the teacher decides to use.  There are three main types that the teacher will normally use: open-ended, extended, or portfolio.  Open-ended exercises “are questions or other prompts that require the student to explore a topic orally or in writing” (article: Performance Assessment).  Extended tasks consist of “assignments that require sustained attention in a single work area and are carried out over several hours or longer” (article: Performance Assessment).  Portfolios “are selected collections of a variety of performance-based work.”(article: Performance Assessment).  All three types of performance assessments “require that students actively develop approaches to the task under defined conditions” (article: Performance Assessment).  Once the tasks are complete, the students work is evaluated by the teacher based on a set of agreed-upon standards.  From this the teacher can evaluate the students’ knowledge and abilities, as well as the areas of weakness for each student.  Performance assessments help students to engage in active learning and to develop skills in critical thinking that will help them throughout life.

The most common tool used in the education system today to assess student performance is the Standards of Learning or SOL’s (as they are most often called).  These tests are used to measure student performance or “achievement in grades K-12 in English, mathematics, science, history/social science, technology, the fine arts, foreign language, health and physical education, and driver education”(article: Standards of Learning ).  Since implementing the use of these performance assessments within the school system “the earliest years of schooling have become less like a trip to ‘Mister Rogers Neighborhood’ and more like SAT prep.  Kids are “tested, and tested again – some every 10 days or so – to ensure they’re making significant progress” (Tyre, 36).  Testing is necessary in determining the progress of students learning, but do we really need to test students so much and so often?  It has been proven that too much testing creates enormous stress and pressure on children to succeed.  Many children are falling behind and “are getting their first taste of failure before they learn to tie their shoes” (Tyre, 36) because of such rigorous testing.  

Teachers and administrators are also constantly being assessed on their performance because of widespread public pressure for educational accountability and questions about skills, training, and performance of American teachers.  “Teacher training consists of three years of general education and teaching specialization and one year of pedagogical training”(Allen &amp; Cosby, 50) with some technology training.  Administrators undergo more training and schooling before assuming their role as educational leaders. You would think that this would be enough, but it’s not because teachers and administrators are still arriving in schools today “fully certified and wholly untested in terms of real-world performance” (Allen &amp; Cosby, 51).  One reason for this is the strict curriculum our teachers are expected to follow today.  Teachers are told how much time to spend on each subject and what needs to be covered according to state curriculum guidelines.  This “makes it hard for teachers to stay sensitive to the important qualities in children that tests can’t measure- diligence, creativity and potential – or to nurture kids who develop more slowly”(Tyre, 42).  Administrators are also faced with similar problems when it comes to these assessments.  Since the No Child Left Behind Act has been implemented in our school systems, administrators must keep their staff up to par or face stiff penalties.  Many schools risk losing funding or even being shut down, if the students do not progress as the state expects.  This puts great responsibility and stress on the administrators and teachers in the school systems today.  

While performance assessments or appraisals are good for setting guidelines for students, teachers, and administrators, they do not come without a price. Performance assessments are taking away the project-based, hands-on experience that many children need to enhance their learning experience.  One reason being because “performance assessment requires a greater expense of time, planning, and thought from students and teachers” (article: Performance Assessment).    Another problem found in performance assessments is that they “depend heavily on professional judgment” (Linn).  Professional judgment may not always be the same and may not always be fair.  So when the assessments are done, this needs to be taken into consideration.  There needs to be a focus on the technical and equity issues so that all performance assessments are fair to everyone.  Performance assessments and performance appraisals are necessary in keeping our students, teachers, and administrators where they need to be.  However, I do not think that they should be our main focus because they take away so much from the teaching and learning experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we create and monitor high performance schools?}}

High performance schools are schools that utilized advanced designs to be environmentally friendly while producing better studying conditions for students. The idea is to create a relaxing, healthy, and clean environment that will not only optimize resource use and lower energy cost, but also make the school a healthier place to be in. The term “High Performance Schools” refers to the physical school structure and the grounds in which the school resides. (EPA) The whole building is included into the design of a high performance school, and each and every portion of the structure affects the high efficiency and the environmental benefits. 

==Building Environment==
A reach and aim of high performance schools is to improve the environment of the school, community, and the world in general. By taking a conservative approach to maintaining the school, its functions, and its construction, a high performance school can be environmentally beneficial and improve living conditions in the community its self. 

===Building and Construction===
The schools that are built are constructed out of materials that are non-toxic and environmentally friendly. This acts to protect the builders while fitting the building and the students and teachers during occupation of the structure. (NEEP)  Many of the materials required are used from recycled parts as one of the aims of high efficiency schools is protecting the environment as a whole. Over 20% of the schools materials can come from post-consumer recycled content. (CIWMB) This also includes materials used in classrooms and tools used by students. Most of the materials are durable and easy to clean keeping with the idea of providing a healthier environment than at a traditional school.

===Utilities===
{{Rquote|right|Water efficiency can be increased by 30% with a few simple technological adjustments.}}
Another aim of high performance schools is the ability to reduce water usage. Water efficiency can be increased by 30% with a few simple technological adjustments. (NEEP) By utilizing waterless urinals and low-flow fixtures along with automatic shut-off control, water usage is cut back drastically simply by not using extensive amounts of water. Grey water or rain water for flushing toilets can also cut back on the over all use of water in a school. On site waste water treatments by utilizing ‘solar aquatics’ can reduce the cost of sewage treatment and provide improved conditions for the surrounding community as well. 

Along with water, high performance schools focus on reducing energy cost of maintaining the school indoor temperature. “Heating, Ventilation, and Cooling (HVAC) systems are one of the largest consumers of energy in a school and modest improvements in system efficiency can yield relatively large savings in a school operational budget.” (NEEP) Increased savings can be achieved by utilizing better insulation, better building shell, and high efficiency motors and equipment for optimal HVAC performance. 

Electricity conservation is another one of the goals of maintaining a high performance schools. Electric lighting can account for 30-50% of the of a schools power consumption. (NEEP) By boosting efficiency, schools can reduce their power usage vastly. Having high efficiency lights, dimming and occupancy sensors, and well placed outdoor lighting can help maintain lower energy cost and use less electricity for lighting. Also optimizing the number of light fixtures for each of the school applications would improve over all quality of teacher and student performance while conserving energy.

===Natural Environment===
The natural environment is also used in the construction of the school. The grounds are maintained with the natural vegetation in the area, while keeping naturally occurring land formations intact. This helps keep a natural feel about the school and lowers the environmental impact of building a new school. (EPA)

==Student Environment==
{{Rquote|right|Good design also produces more comfortable environments with proper lighting, air temperature, humidity, and noise levels.|EPA}}

A better facility with better lighting, acoustics, and air quality will aid in delivering better student outcomes. (Better Bricks) Not only are the utilities and the construction more efficient, but the aura of the entire school gets a boost when running on a high performance level. 

===Lighting===
A unique characteristic of high performance schools is the lighting hat is provided. Not only are more energy efficient lights used, but light is optimized in each class room for whatever purpose it might serve. The electronic lighting also acts with natural day lighting to help improve student performance. By providing this visual comfort, class room tasks such as reading or following presentations can become easier and more comfortable for students. (EPA) Glare is also minimized by utilizing the natural lighting in combination with the electrical lighting.

===Acoustics===
Another focus of the high performance school is noise pollution. The structure of the buildings is designed to be acoustically sound. Teachers do not need to yell for their students to hear them while the structure minimizes noises coming from outside the room and noise leaving the room. (Better Bricks) The way the ventilation systems are set up effect the noise output in a room as well. Instead of having to hear ventilation systems come on and off, the noise is drastically reduced to increase focus and more attention in the class room. (EPA)

===Air Quality===
For the amount of time that students and teachers spend inside of a class room, keeping the air clean and contaminant free is key to helping better air quality. Contamination is controlled and filtration systems are highly effective and keep moisture accumulation controlled as well. (Better Bricks) Since children are more susceptible to indoor pollutants, air quality control is important inside of any school.

==Benefits ==
It is no doubt beneficial that a school can be highly conservative, energy efficient, and environmentally friendly, but how does this effect the students and how they learn?  The purpose of many of these changes is due to the better results that are yielded because of all the improvements in buildings. 

===Student Effects===
The students are directly affected by many of these changes. Student performance improvement in high performance schools can be attributed to the better air quality, lighting, and noise control. Since the atmosphere inside the school would be a pleasant one to be in, it’s understandable that students would be better able to focus in a high performance school. The atmosphere has lead to an increase in test scores in students who attend high performance schools. (CHPS) These pleasantries can also attribute to an increase in average daily attendance. (Energy) This can help get the school more funds to operate on because of increased government aid due to high attendance rates. 

===Administrative Benefits===
The students are not the only ones who benefit because of the high performance schools. Teachers and faculty both benefit from the use of the building as well. Since the atmosphere is such a pleasant one to work in, teachers are more satisfied in the work place and there is a high retention rate because of this as well. (CHPS) Teachers aren’t the only ones who are happy. Since there is a reduction in operation cost, due to the lack of resources being used, there is more money available for the program rather than maintaining facilities. (CHPS) Liability for poor health conditions in a facility is also eliminated since a facility is in top condition and does not have any hazardous materials involved in its construction. (Energy)

==Maintaining a Facility==

The biggest cost in a school is not the building cost or the program costs, but it’s the long term cost of up keeping the facility and the area around it. (EPA) Since the high performance schools are designed to be efficient and low cost, it is no more difficult to maintain a high performance school than it is a traditional school. While there might be initial higher cost for some portions of the school, over time more money will be saved because of the high efficiency and optimal conditions of the facilities. (NEEP) If a school is going to upgrade something to better its standings, it is cheaper to change it immediately rather then delaying. More money might be spent immediately, but over time savings can easily be more beneficial.

==Monitoring Facilities==
High performance schools are relatively new and there are few ways to rate them as of right now. One organization, The Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS), has come up with a means of rating and monitoring the available high performance schools. They have developed guidelines in a six volume best practice manual that can help guide researchers and developers in creating and maintaining high performance schools. (CHPS)

==Conclusion== 
The over all purpose of these high performance schools is to improve the quality of education by establishing a healthy and non-hazardous environment. By reducing energy use, the amount of non-recycled materials used, and costs of operation, not only are there more resources available to the schools, but the environment and people in it benefit from the unused materials and resources that would have been allocated in the building of a school. Ultimately, the students benefit from a better learning experience in a more secure learning environment.

{{question-answer|question=High performance schools decrease the cost of maintenance and reduce the environmental impact of building a new facility. Based on the information in this article, do you think it should be required for states to start mandating the production of high performance schools?
|answer=State governments should pass legislation to see that more high performance schools are being built. This would not only provide more funding for student programs, but it would allow teachers to be better paid and accommodated for. Natural resources would also be protected and a more conservative lifestyle for people would be provided. 

Since there would be decreased operation cost of facilities, more money could be spent on funding educational programs for students. Rather than using the same text books year after year, it would be more feasible to replace old text books and provide the most up to date information for students. With more funds, newer and more advanced technology could be provided for teacher and student use as well. 

Also, with more funds unused on operational cost, there might be room for teacher pay raises. Instead of teachers getting paid pennies on the dollar, they would be able to be better accommodated. If a pay raise is not feasible then there would be more money available for teacher benefits and bonus payments. If teachers continue to perform better then they would be eligible for a bonus or more benefits in their contract. 

Since there are less resources being used to develop the school its self, the idea of preservation is implanted in people’s minds. Since there are less materials being used, and more recyclable materials being utilized, it would help preserve the environment and benefit more than just the students, but the whole community as well.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is lifelong learning?}}

Walking down the hallway in the school where I work, I was stopped by Hunter, a second grade student.  Holding up three books he had just checked out of the school’s library titled Canada, Alaska, and New Zealand, he said, “I’m learning about geography.”  “Oh, that’s great,” I said.  “So your class is studying about other countries?”  “No, I am just doing it myself,” was his reply.  Hunter’s curiosity is a simple example of the lifelong learning process.  He possesses characteristics that describe the lifelong learner.  Hunter took it upon himself to seek out something that interests him and pursued the drive to act upon it by checking out the books in the library.  His unprompted willingness to share his discoveries also exhibits qualities of a lifelong learner.  

==Definition and History of Lifelong Learning==
{{Rquote|right|Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.  Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.|Chinese Proverb}}

Lifelong learning, a self-explanatory concept, is learning that starts at pre-birth and continues throughout life.  Lifelong learning is a process in which people obtain meaning from interacting with their environment.  This includes both the social and physical environment.  Learning is a natural and ongoing process producing new or deeper understandings of concepts. (Virtue)   To lock into these important concept educators need to look at characteristics that make a lifelong learner.   Lifelong learners are built and what one learns builds on previous life experiences. A person with an obsession to a particular subject could be labeled what psychologists call a “trait curious” person.  This person is &quot;someone with a tendency to delve deeply into subjects that grab his attention, learning more about himself and the world in the process.”  (Psychology Today, October 2006, Cultivating Curiosity by Elizabeth Svoboda. Page 57) The word  “trait curious” person is synonymous with “lifelong learner”. 

In M. K. Smith’s article on lifelong learning he elaborates on the history of lifelong learning by sharing his findings, “The idea of lifelong education was first fully articulated in this century by Basil Yeaxlee (1929)  He along with Eduard Lindeman (1926) provided an intellectual basis for a comprehensive understanding of education as a continuing aspect of everyday life.  In this they touched upon various continental traditions such as the French notion of education permanente and drew upon developments within adult education within Britain and North America.” (Smith)  Today many educators promote lifelong learning by engaging students in activities to fulfill their curiosity and promote learning skills that will produce lifelong learning characteristics. (Virtue)

==Characteristics of A Lifelong Learner==
Life long learners possess a desire to learn.  This characteristic follows the person throughout a lifetime. No matter what level in life they are in, they are searching for purposeful and meaningful activities to promote their need to learn. Characteristics of a lifelong learner include:
*Intrinsically Motivated (World Bank)
*Analytical Thinking Shills (World Bank)
*Ability to Learn and Think Independently (World Bank)
*Creativity (World Bank)
*Problem Solving Skills (World Bank)
*Communication (World Bank)
*Teamwork (World Bank)
*Thoughtful Reflection (Virtue)
*Respectful Skepticism (Virtue)
*Intellectual Curiosity (Virtue)
*Adapting Alternate Perspectives (Virtue)    

==How Teachers Can Build Lifelong Learners==
In a lifelong learning environment teachers focus on learning rather than teaching.  The teacher serves as a facilitator and is a guide to the source of knowledge.  Harry Wong in his book, “How to Be An Effective Teacher” states “that the fact the teacher does most of the work at school explains why there is so little learning in school.  According to research only thirty five percent of the allocated time is devoted to learning.”  Wong went on to emphasize “the reason teachers are so tired at the end of the school day is that they have been working.  If I worked as hard as many teachers do, I’d be tired too.  But have you noticed what happens at 3 o’clock when the students leave?  “Yea, yea, yea!”  Why are they so full of energy?  Because they have been sitting in school all day doing nothing while the teacher is doing all the work.  The person who does the work is the only one doing any learning!” (Wong)

Educators need to look for student’s interest and plan accordingly, with a purpose to engage the students. Wong emphasizes an important fact, “The role of a teacher is not to cover.  The role of a teacher is to UNCOVER.” (Wong) Educators are trying to incorporate NCLB mandates into the classroom and are taking very little time to get to know their student’s interest.  “Learning has nothing to do with what the teacher covers.  Learning has to do with what the student accomplishes.”  (Wong)  Students take control of their individual learning and are motivated to want to learn more.  The concept of lifelong learning relies on the idea that every person can become self-directing and will see the importance of excerising lifelong learning techniques and skills into their everyday lives. (Smith)  David Elkind refers to assembly line learning in his book '''''&quot;The Hurried Child&quot;'''''.  Elkind says “the problem with the factory management system is that it pushes children too much and puts them into a uniform mold and children are being pushed to perform or produce for the sake of the teachers and administrators.  There is a difference between skills and the ability to use those skills.  When skills are learned in isolation the connection between them and their use is tenuous.  Creative teachers prefer to employ various instructional techniques so that children can integrate subject matter into their lives.  Educational theorists have long held that repetitive drill in basic skills not connected to comprehension or composition is the least efficient way to educate and in some instances is even counter productive.”(Elkind)

==Lifelong Learners in the Preschool Classroom==
{{Rquote|right|Teaching is the art of assisting discovery.|Harry Wong}}

If we as educators are going to build lifelong learners for the twenty first century the best place to start is in their early years.  Preschool programs are becoming a must for this day and time.  It is imperative to integrate learning into the lives of our youngest lifelong learners.  During the early years children learn by intense interactions with their immediate environment referred to by some as active learning.  Active learning environments are child friendly and depend on the use of natural and found materials.  Active learning begins as young children manipulate objects, using their five senses to find out about the objects. This action gives the child something real to think about and talk to others about.  Preschool children are very concrete thinkers.  Abstract concepts begin to form through these types of concrete experiences with materials and people.  Children do most of the work of active learning while the teacher gives the needed support.  There are five ingredients for an active learning preschool environment.  These include materials, manipulation, choice, language from the child, and adult support.   Combine interactions with other children and   purposeful, meaningful experiences and the preschooler will have ample opportunities for problem solving, another important characteristic of the life long learner. (Hohamann and Weikart) One of the most important aspects of initiating life long learning in the preschooler is to ignite the “fire for desire” to promote an intrinsic motivation to learn.

==Results of Lifelong Learners==
A lifelong learner is capable of making informed choices about their lives and their society.  Harry Wong suggests that “there are two kinds of people: workers and leaders, each having distinctive characteristics and these characteristics will give a person certain results in life.” (Wong)  Some of the examples Wong gives in recognizing a worker as opposed to a leader include: Workers manage by crisis. Leaders manage by leadership.  Workers are full of excuses.  Leaders have plans, goals, and vision.  Workers dress like laborers.  Leaders dress for success.  Workers complain about other people, places and things.  Leaders compliment people, places and things.  Workers chitchat.  Leaders pay attention.  Workers talk about not getting respect. Leader’s success earns them respect.  Workers are victims.  Leaders have power and are in control.  Victims are people who are suffering because they lack the proper control over their own lives. (Wong)

==Conclusion==
In conclusion one can see the importance of creating a learning environment where lifelong learners are built.  Not only do people learn by doing but also they learn in groups and from one another.  As educators by providing the necessary ingredients for a learning environment that promotes lifelong learning, we can produce not an assembly line type of student but a student with a desire to learn.  Harry Wong leaves with us two important tidbits about initiating a desire to learn,  “Teaching is the art of assisting discovery.  You can teach a lesson for a day but if you teach curiosity, you teach for a lifetime.”  (Wong)

{{question-answer|question=Considering the philosophies of lifelong learning, compare and discuss your thoughts on traditional classroom learning methods and an active learning environment promoting lifelong learning.
|answer=I have worked in a PreK classroom for ten years and have been able to conclude through my observations, that active learning is an essential element in the PreK environment.  During the first few years of the operation of our county program, we were introduced to an active learning curriculum in which we implemented into our classrooms.  Not only were the children exposed to science, literacy and math skills, they were learning lifelong skills such as problem solving, the ability to learn and think independently, and the ability to plan and follow through with those plans.  Now partly because of the NCLB movement and teacher preference we are incorporating more of the traditional learning methods with worksheets, color sheets, and more worksheets. No regard for creativity.  They are not focused very long and a lot of what they are exposed to is not meaningful and purposeful.  Students are able to retain information longer if it has meaning to their everyday life.  I think active learning environments that build lifelong learners are crucial to our student's learning and progress. &amp;mdash;Charlotte Deskins

When I was in third, I was labeled a bad seed.  I was secluded from my class mates I was given an agenda each day, 15 words to look up in the dictionary, define, rhyme, write each in a sentence.  I was to read a book of my choice, I was given 50 math problems, assigned science workbook pages and told to complete each task by the end of the week.  While one would feel overwhelmed and depressed, I enjoyed working this way. I actually requested this type of set up.  I was able to better understand my learning style and my likes and dislikes in any given subject matter.  I was able to go to my teacher and say, I loved this science topic, what else can I learn about it?  By putting the ball in my court,my teacher was better able to teach me.  I was able to say what I liked to learn, and what interested me.  I was able to be interested in learning because I had a say in what and how I learned.  I think empowering students to find what they love to think about will inspire them to be lifelong learners.  If you tell them how easy it is to teach themselves, they will do it for ever. &amp;mdash;Den Barnes}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is service-learning?}}
{{Rquote|right|I hear, I forget; I see, I remember; I do, I understand.|Chinese Proverb}}

Very simply put, service-learning is a way to tie together community service and academics, giving students a way to learn by “doing” something.  It is the integration of meaningful community service, instruction, and personal reflection (National Service).  According to Rudy Crew, a former New York City Public Schools chancellor, the goal of service learning is to provide relevance of the curriculum, a level of rigor in academics, and to build relationships (Learning).  Service-learning is taking place at all levels of education:  K-12 institutions, colleges and universities, and communities in order to produce world-class learners and world-class citizens.  

==Defining Service-Learning and Setting Goals==
{{Rquote|right|Service-learning is a particularly fertile way of involving young people in community service, because it ties helping others to what they are learning in the classroom.  In the process, it provides a compelling answer to the perennial question:  'Why do I need to learn this stuff?'|General Colin Powell, founding chairman of America’s Promise}}

Service learning is a strategy used by educators to help students reach certain academic and social goals.  One set of goals of service-learning is to enhance students’ motivation to learn, increase attendance in schools, and reduce student dropout rates.  As educators we strive to engage our students in activities which will give them a sense of responsibility for their own learning.  This ownership of education will contribute to their academic and social success (Learning).  Another goal of service-learning is to enable students to see the relevance of academic subjects to the real world.  As educators we often run into the question “Why do I need to know this stuff?”  Service-learning gives us the opportunity to open the door of communication to show them through action how studying a wide range of subjects will help them.  Through service-learning, students will be proud of their work; this gives students confidence and builds self-esteem.  Another goal that is often overlooked is the attempt to develop an environment of collegial participation among students, faculty, and the community.

Service-learning has several specific requirements:  a service-learning project must have clearly articulated and authentic learning goals that address the curriculum, give the students an opportunity to make decisions, respond to a genuine community need, and include a personal analytic reflection produced by the students.  In other words, not only are the students encouraged to improve their academic skills by applying what they learn in school to the real world, but they are also reflecting on their experiences to reinforce the connection between their service and the their learning (Learning in Deed).  This will also help to foster the development of empathy, values, beliefs, awareness, self-confidence, and helps to foster a sense of caring for others (Cooper).  These are valuable personal traits that are rarely directly addressed in classroom curriculum.

==Characteristics of Service-Learning==
Now that we know the basic definition, goals, and benefits of service-learning, let us attach some characteristics to service-learning in order to understand what it “looks like.”

|}

==Student Reflection==
One of the large elements of service-learning is student reflection.  According to Aldous Huxley, &quot;experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happened to him.”  This is the point at which students can make their experience personal and draw connections to their own world.  One way in order to enable students to make this connection is by asking them to comment on three levels of reflection: the Mirror Level, the Microscope Level, and the Binoculars Level.    

The first level of reflection is the Mirror Level.  This gives students an opportunity to make a clear reflection of who they are, what their values are, and what they have learned about themselves through the experience.  Students should be encouraged to discover how they had to challenge themselves and their own perceptions of life in order to complete the project.

The second level of reflection is the Microscope Level.  This is when the students’ seemingly small experience becomes very large.  They should describe their experience and explain the impact their actions had on the overall project.  Who did they affect and what did they learn about them?  What else can be done to help the situation?  They should also address how their project complimented or contrasted with the material being taught in class (Cooper).  At this point the students are seeing the “bigger picture” of their experience and who or what they affected.

The third level students should address in their reflection is the Binocular Level.  This is the level that makes what appears distant, seem closer.  In other words, from their experience the students should analyze their future behaviors and attitudes.  Will they be altered or changed from their initial perceptions?  They should also be addressing the overarching issues that influence the original problem they were attempting to solve in the community.  What is the larger political/social problem (Cooper)?

==Service-Learning Statistics==
A survey was given to 580 college and university campuses during the 2005-2006 school year in order to find information on service-learning trends.  According to that survey, 91% of the surveyed campuses offer service-learning courses and 32% of the students attending them engage in these courses.  The 6,566,780 students who participate in service-learning courses performed a total of 317 million hours of service in the academic year of 2005-2006 (Brown).   

==Service-Learning Federal Policy==
Federal policy has grown over the past 20 years in order to support service-learning programs and implement them across the nation.  The original policies are the National and Community Service Act of 1990 and the Community Service Trust Act of 1993.  The National and Community Service Act of 1990 was put into action by President Bush Sr.  The goal of the act was to support and encourage the implementation of service-learning in America through school programs, youth corps, and higher education service programs.  The Community Service Trust Act of 1993 was enlisted during the Clinton administration.  Its main goal was to enhance national service-learning opportunities and to provide service educational awards to people participating in service-learning projects.  The most current legislation is the Generations Invigorating Volunteering and Education (GIVE) Bill, which was accepted in the summer of 2007.  When this bill becomes an act, it will be responsible for recharging, updating, and rejuvenating the 1993 Community Service Trust Act (Corporation).  

U.S. schools are ready now to embrace service-learning as a means of overcoming widespread academic and civic disengagement among American students.  This is our opportunity to raise a generation of youth who will become tomorrow’s leaders and proactive citizens.

{{question-answer|question=Explain how service-learning can be an especially effective teaching strategy for students who are unmotivated and disengaged from learning in a classroom setting. 
|answer=Service-learning can reverse the student disengagement that we see in our American schools.  It works to provide students with a mode of learning that will connect their personal background with the academic subject being taught.  They are able to create a pride in themselves by completing a project and taking responsibility for their own learning.  This gives them confidence to attack the rigor of the classroom work.  The goal is to reinforce and expand upon the standard-based curriculum being taught.  It also helps to give students a purpose for learning the subject matter.  For instance, a student may ask, “why do I need to understand how to test for dissolved oxygen in the water?”  An environmental educator who performs a service-learning project in the field may have the students help local agencies to monitor a stream near the school.  Analyzing the state of the stream would very quickly show a student how important dissolved oxygen content is in the water.  They will be able to reflect upon the theories taught at school with the findings from the stream they monitor.}}

      <comment>/* How Should Teachers Be Held Accountable */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should teachers be held accountable?}}

Accountability is defined as “responsibility to someone or for some activity” (www.thefreedictionary.com).  When considering a teacher’s accountability, we relate it to the teacher’s responsibility for their students and his or her learning progress. Teachers should accept ownership over their student’s performance in their classroom.

Today, teachers live in an age of accountability.  They are constantly being held responsible for the performance of their students. This leads to teachers constantly feeling pressured since their teaching capabilities are being judged on by how their students perform on, for example, a standardized test.  “The No Child Left Behind Act holds schools and school districts accountable for results. Schools are responsible for making sure your child is learning” (ed.gov).  This act increases the responsibility of teachers for their student’s performance and learning achievement.

==Teachers' Responsibility==
When someone decides to become a teacher, they take on the responsibility to educate our nation's youth.  Many people think that within the school system, teachers are ultimately the ones who are accountable for the development and learning progress of students. At one time, principals and teachers could satisfy the demands of accountability simply by working hard and following accepted professional standards. By contrast, the current accountability movement emphasizes results (Lashway). It is the teacher’s responsibility for students to produce good test results. 

It is a teacher’s responsibility to educate our youth; therefore it is the teacher’s responsibility to be well educated.  Students achieve more and progress faster when instructed by a well-educated and well-trained teacher (Carter). Today in our school systems, we are continually raising the standards for students, but at the same time we are lowering the standards for our teachers. Until we address the problems plaguing teacher education institutions, teacher training, and teacher accountability, we cannot adequately address the problems affecting our students (Carter).  The first step of bettering our education system is by holding teachers more accountable for their students. This idea brings up the question on how exactly should teachers be held accountable.

==How Should Teachers Be Held Accountable==
First, teachers need to be held accountable through evaluations and observations. At the end of each year, each teacher needs to be evaluated on his/her performance for that year. Although many schools only perform an annual teacher evaluation, it is necessary for a teacher to be evaluated through out the school year. Teachers should be observed and evaluated through out the year by the schools administration. For instance, a principal or an assistant principal will sit in on a teacher’s class and evaluate her performance.  Listed are some of the criteria a principal should evaluate while observing a teacher: Instructional skills, classroom management, student discipline and attendance patterns, knowledge of subject matter, interest in teaching pupils, and effort towards improvement when needed (wednet.edu). Students progress should also be evaluated every couple of weeks to see if they are improving and how their performance reflects the teacher. 

Another way teachers can be held accountable is by students achieving passing scores on standardized tests.  These test are implemented by the government and teachers are expected to prepare their students for the information that is within these test. In Virginia, SOL is a common term that teachers encounter. The Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools describe the commonwealth's expectations for student learning and achievement in grades K-12 in English, mathematics, science, history/social science, technology, the fine arts, foreign language, health and physical education, and driver education (pen.k12.va.us). The SOL’s of Virginia are a prime example of a state required test that students are required to pass.  These test reflect both the performance of the students and teachers.  Teachers are pressured to teach all of the material that is covered on these standardized test within a limited amount of time.  They need to be flexible in their teaching because they need to allow time to cover each required concept and be assured their students have had time to grasp the concept before moving to a new topic.  When teachers are evaluated on their students test results a few other factors should be taken into consideration.  First, the size of the classroom since there is always a shortage of teachers and second if there are any students with learning disabilities who may perform lower on the test. 

A third way teachers are held accountable is by the No Child Left Behind policy.  The No Child Left Behind is a critical step toward improving the education of American children. 

NCLB sets five performance goals for states:
# All students will reach high standards, at a minimum attaining proficiency or better in reading/language arts and mathematics by 2013-2014.
# All limited English proficient students will become proficient in English and reach high academic standards, at minimum attaining proficiency or better in reading/language arts and mathematics.
# All students will be taught by highly qualified teachers by 2005-2006.
# All students will learn in schools that are safe and drug free. 
# All students will graduate from high school(pen.k12.va.us).

The NCLB not only holds the schools accountable for a student’s education but also the individual teacher. According to the NCLB, the Administration's proposal for preparing, training and recruiting teachers is based upon the basic principle that teacher excellence is vital to achieving improvement in student achievement (whitehouse.gov).  Therefore, all teachers are supposed to be highly qualified in the field that they are teaching.  It makes sense that improving teacher quality is important for student’s success.    The more qualified a teacher is in his/her field the better he/she can educate American children. The No Child Left Behind act holds the state, schools, and individual teachers accountable for the performance of our nations youth.

There are many new ideas in the area of teacher accountability that have yet to be fully explored.  Value-Added Modeling (VAM) is a new concept introduced to develop a better way of  establishing guidelines to help create an effect measuring device. VAM offers a way of statistically analyzing students test scores over a period of years to model a teacher's effectiveness and thus offer a means of accountability (McCaffery et al). This becomes important because statistics offer a way of separating family, financial, and opinion biases from the data and offer an effective breakdown of the teacher and school.  Also this usage of data allows for a prediction of future effectiveness for teachers and can even show the benefit of development programs and even teaching methods (McCaffery et al). So this is just one of the many issues on the forefront of methods to hold teachers accountable. However this is not an issue that many agree upon, VAM and other methods that use test data are being attacked as lacking truth. While no one disputes the results of standards and tests it is the opinion of many that teachers should also be judged upon other factors. The National Education Association (NEA) on their website states that while it is the right of taxpayers and parents to know that their tax dollars and children are getting the best education possible it does hurt the teacher to base that upon standards (NEA). Even recent polling by the NEA suggests that parents agree with this assumption and states that, “Standardized tests should be used to guide instruction by helping identify gaps in learning and groups of students who need the most help. But test scores alone should never be used to punish students, teachers or schools by cutting funding, closing schools or firing teachers” (NEA). So even still a possible solution is already under criticism.

==Conclusion==
Evaluation and observation, standardized testing, and the No Child Left Behind policy are three critical ways to hold teachers accountable.  A teacher’s responsibility is to educate our nations youth.  According to No Child Left Behind all teachers must be highly qualified.  This alone will help enrich children’s education. Standardized testing is also another way of holding teachers accountable.  They will want to teach their students to the best of their ability in hopes that their students will perform well on the test.  Evaluation and observation is also an important way to hold teachers accountable.  If they know that they are being evaluated and observed they will perform better and therefore students will be better instructed.

{{question-answer|question=After reading this article, how do you believe teachers should be held accountable?
|answer=I feel that each of these three forms of accountability are all critical ways of holding teachers accountable.  The No Child Left Behind requires that all teachers be highly qualified and I feel that this is necessary for our children to receive the best education. The more educated our teachers are the more successful students will be. 

I also think that evaluations are a significant way of holding teachers accountable.  I feel that if they performance is constantly being evaluated and critiqued the better they will do their job.  Evaluations also provide feedback, so if there is an area that a teacher needs to improve he or she can do so accordingly.  Evaluation should be throughout the year and not just once at the end of the year. 

I also agree that a percentage of a teacher’s evaluation should be from standardized test scores.  How a student performs reflects how a teacher performs.  However, I feel that a few other things need to be taken into consideration when viewing test scores.  For example, the size of the class the teacher was teaching, if any student had special needs, and other background information of the students. 

A teacher's responsibility is to educate students.  Therefore teachers should be held accountable for the education that American children are receiving.
----
I was born in 1956, and when I attended school (first grade through twelfth) teachers were role models and it was believed then that most teachers were &quot;called&quot; to become teachers just like preachers have been &quot;called&quot; upon by the Lord to preach.  This was the school of thought in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s  This was because teaching salaries were very modest and mostly filled by women who could easily leave teaching for a year or two to get married and have children and then return to teaching when it best suited their families.  During these years of teachers being &quot;called&quot; to teach, students were being tested annually through standardized tests which showed to their parents, teachers, and school authorities how much of the subject matter they were learning and retaining.  This situation has not evolved that much today, because we are still testing the students, but the kicker (punch-line) in today's world is putting the responsibility (accountability) of the student's test scores on teachers and schools versus students.

This evolving of the accountability has changed because the world has changed, and the teaching profession has changed.  The first dramatic change was the need for more and more teachers because of the rising population boom, which in turn lead to a recruitment of teachers.  This is when the profession went from being a &quot;calling&quot; to teach, to a job of teaching.  This is also about the time when teaching salaries began to increase and more and more men (top-bread winners of the family) came into the field of teaching.  I am not saying that there were no men teachers in the 1960s through the 1980s; I am just saying that all of a sudden the increase in salaries was allowing men to enter the profession and provide a nice income for their families.  

My point is that when teaching stopped being a &quot;calling,&quot; some how the accountability of the professional decreased.  With this decrease came the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; and a need for teachers and schools to prove to the American public that the job of teaching our youth was being accomplished to the best of their abilities.  I can not think of a job in the world today where there is no accountability.  The real question concerning holding a teacher and a school accountable for the success of their/its students is; Is this the fair and true manner in which to determine the teacher's job performance and the school's credibility?

My answer to the essay question of &quot;How do you believe teachers should be held accountable?&quot; is that there is no easy answer to this question, but all paying jobs in this world we live today, demand accountability.  Since at the end of the day or year of teaching, a teacher can not give you a concrete product produced, it will always be a subjective resolution.  I personally believe that parents, students, principals, and teachers should be re-evaluating and assessing all of their own responsibilities when it comes to the learning process.  It should be all components that are held accountable. &amp;mdash;Victoria B. Wilson}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should students be held accountable?}}

The sight is a common one in classrooms around the country and the world: Students lolling about while their classmates work to complete an assignment given to them by their teachers. They sit on the periphery, in the corners, heads down, hesitant to participate in discussions or classwork. When class ends, they file out into the hallway and onto buses or into friends’ cars. They arrive home to find themselves, at best, alone; at worst, their parents beat them mercilessly and repeatedly until they bleed uncontrollably. Their nights are spent in front of the TV, channeling the satellite dish or Xbox, or masturbating to internet pornography. The students begin to miss work because they are able to and soon they find themselves falling behind the rest of the class. Teachers call their houses and find parents not home, numbers not in service, no forwarding addresses. Through this series of events, neither the parents nor the child are accountable for the child’s academic progress. 

So how, then, can the school or the educational system at large expect them to be?

== In Loco Parentis ==
Indeed, there seems to be no end in sight for the doctrine of in loco parentis, “in the place of the parent,” a concept borrowed from 18th-Century England to describe the responsibility of teachers and schools to act in children’s best interests when children are in class. Through the doctrine was first applied domestically to American teachers who advocated corporal punishment for students, the doctrine has gradually expanded to a significantly more challenging context Now, schools act in ways once reserved for the home and the community “because other elements of society…seem to be unable or unwilling to continue their historic roles”(Conte, 2000, p. 195). 

Teachers and administrators are just as often the caretakers of students’ psyches as educators of their minds at large. And according to Conte, this does not make teachers entirely uneasy. They see it as a necessary extension of their duties that help promote student trust and accountability.

== How Far Are Teachers Willing to Go? ==

A sample of in-service teachers in New Jersey were asked about activities that may occur in a school setting that they believe require responding as would a parent to:
* Stealing (81.7%)
* Cheating (90%)
* Bullying (88.3%)
* Profanity (90%)

Another question probed whether they would feel comfortable responding as would a parent by utilizing:
* Corporal punishment: 73.3% 
* Detention: 70%
* Removal of privileges: 88.3%

Eighty-three percent of teachers said they would be willing to talk to students about relationships; 36.7% said they could discuss sexual behavior; and 83% said they would talk to students about problems at home (Conte, 2000, p. 195).

== Raising Academic Rigor ==
Kathie F. Nunley, an educational psychologist, author, researcher and speaker living in southern New Hampshire, suggests that raising academic rigor in regard to actual learning is the key to making students accountable by ensuring they learn. Teachers could always have students complete yet another worksheet, which they could easily do with the right people at lunch, or by filling out paperwork while watching television at home. 

“Daily quizzes, either oral or written, are easily administered,” Nunley (2004) writes. “Choose one question at random from the assignment and give a grade based on that assessment. Choose two of their ten vocabulary words and award points on the two words. Write sample math problems on index cards, have the students draw a card, complete the problem and award homework points based on that sample of work.

“In the beginning, students may be shocked, even angry at the change in strategy. But stick to your policy, explain the reason, and eventually your students will actually come to appreciate the fact that you care enough about them to value the time they've spent on learning” (Nunley, 2004).

== The Five Components of an Effective Accountability System ==
Likewise, researchers Carolyn Evertson and Inge Poole of Vanderbilt University’s IRIS Center for Faculty Enhancement point to several paths teachers can take to keep their students’ attention and keep students actively involved in their education. Those teachers must develop and implement strategies that help students complete classwork.

They identified five components of an effective accountability system:

'''Providing content instruction:''' Assuring that all students understand and can apply the content associated with classwork means students make helpful connections between their previous learning experiences, the content, and the assigned classwork.

'''Creating supportive settings:''' Establishing a classroom environment that supports students’ academic efforts requires building a positive and productive tone that is structured to encourage student effort and is inclusive of each student’s cultural traditions and understandings.

'''Modeling desired outcomes:''' Providing a model of both the process and the completed classwork sought from students means that the students have access to tangible examples of the teacher’s expectations. 

'''Assigning appropriate tasks:''' Assuring that tasks are appropriately matched to students’ skills and abilities means carefully assessing students’ understandings to have a clear idea of students’ strengths and weaknesses. 

'''Offering timely feedback:''' Knowledge of the results is a powerful motivator for students. To keep students engaged and focused on their classwork they should receive feedback both in progress and at completion (Evertson &amp; Poole, 2007).

== Attending to Attendance ==
Making students accountable for school success also means making sure they are in school. Officials in Thomasville, Ga., found a way to increase student attendance by giving them the responsibility of keeping attendance records. When the task of keeping attendance records at Thomasville’s Central High School became too much for administration and teachers, a teacher-student panel recommended the measure, which was approved by district leaders. Five absences mean the failure in a course for a quarter and students can appeal to a panel of teachers, administrators and students if there are extenuating circumstances for the absences. The school also notifies students as they approach their fifth absence. The result: the average daily attendance during the program’s first year has increased six percent (Childs, 1979).

== Grades Online ==
Parents who are disconnected from their students’ success because of work have turned to the internet as one of the best ways to engage in their child's educational progress. Many schools today offer online gradebooks as a way for parents to obtain a virtual seat in their child’s classroom. These books also have proven popular with teachers because they can be easily backed up and because they offer computerized formulae for calculating grades precisely. 

Sites like Esembler and mygradebook.com give parents and students the ability to login to a teacher's gradebook to check performance, attendance, upcoming assignments, as well as communicate with teachers. ThinkWave.com offers teachers a customized handout to send along to parents with password information, which allows them access to the teacher's gradebook from home or the office (Nixon, 2002, p. 58).

All this involvement sits surprisingly well with students. Seventy-five percent of middle school students say they would like their parents to be more involved in school activities. In the age of tech-savvy kids, encouraging them to get their parents online can be a major source of motivation. They may be excited to teach their parents how to navigate the sites and parents will be encouraged by their child's interest in school (Nixon, 2002, p. 58).

== Conclusion ==
These are only a few of the methods schools are using to enhance student accountability for their educations. As long as students continue to fall through the cracks – or find ways to crawl through them –  in modern schools, officials will continue to seek new ways of helping them be responsible.

{{question-answer|question=You have been assigned as project leader in an urban school district with high numbers of disenfranchised and disaffected students. Your team’s job is to increase the retention rate of those students. How would you go about holding those students accountable for their academic success?
|answer=If I was given such a task, the first think I would do would be to gather around me a highly qualified and passionate team of teachers, parents and students from a wide range of SES households. .They would be able to provide a perspective on the problems that certain students face that I alone would not. 

One of the areas we would pursue would be academic rigor. My team would work together to make students stakeholders in making our programs tougher and oriented toward knowledge as well as skill acquisition. We would get students involved in determining what they would learn, then with the teaching of this material, and then again draw them into grading their peers’ work. This would serve to enhance their ownership of their own educations by giving them a say on how it is given to them.

Our teachers would be given extra time to teach the units they must cover in their grade level to make sure students understand the information before they are tested on it. Teachers will also work with students to make sure they understand the high expectations that are placed on them. Teachers will work across their disciplines to help students make connections between their previous learning experiences, the content, and the assigned classwork. 

Our classrooms will be collaborative spaces that are the foundations of a positive relationship between the all students, teachers and learning. We will focus on differentiation to make sure that tasks are appropriately matched to students’ skills and abilities. This means carefully assessing students’ understandings to have a clear idea of students’ strengths and weaknesses. Teachers will also provide timely feedback on student progress.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we meet NCLB quality standards?}}

To start off, what exactly does the No Child Left Behind ask of educators and school systems all over the United States? The No child Left Behind (NCLB) is a federal law that was enacted in 2001. The act’s goal is to improve academic skills in math and reading among all elementary and secondary students and hold school districts and states accountable. An assessment is then given to students to evaluate their performances. The NCLB also gives parents more options to where they want their children to receive education. Another regulation of the act requires schools to give contact information of all attending students to military recruiters (Wikipedia).

== How should the standards of NCLB be met? ==
{{Rquote|right|In order to make sure children are not simply shuffled through the system, we must measure. We must determine what needs to be corrected early, before it's too late.|George W. Bush}}
There are many aspects associated with improving education for students today. First we must make sure teachers are fully qualified to meet the state and federal requirements. In schools in metropolitan and low-income areas, students are more likely to be taught by untrained teachers. In result, students do not receive the proper knowledge to compete with students in other areas. Second, we must offer parents more options about where their students receive their education. Next, we need to improve our high schools to give them the proper tools for testing and catching problems early on. Lastly, we must effectively assess students on their knowledge of the material in core classes.

== Qualified Teachers ==
What is being done to ensure teachers are qualified to meet the NCLB standards?  Well some teachers were not qualified to meet standards, so NCLB ordered schools to report the number of teachers who do qualify under the highly qualified teacher standard in the 2002-2003 school year. Funds and grants were given to schools to support teacher development and to schools who were having a tough time adhering to requirements (Safier, K.). Less than half of the states reported that 90 % of their teachers were highly qualified to teach under the NCLB act. To be highly qualified, a teacher must be a college graduate with all certifications and prove knowledge of their content area. Some states measure teacher qualification by college coursework and student progress in the classroom. Another step being taken by President George W. Bush is to offer part-time positions to experts in the fields of math and science so students receive precise information. 

== Parent Options ==
Under the No Child Left Behind Act, parents have more of a say when it comes to the education of their children. In most situations, students are placed in schools based on where they live and how districts are drawn out, which can be a disadvantage for some. Have you or someone you know lied about your address so you could go to a certain school? Perhaps you were not receiving the best education possible. A parent or a child should not have to lie about where they live to receive a better education but instead the best education should be offered to all. According to this act and President Bush, parents will use their options to help their students in troubled schools. President Bush has also projected a Nationwide Opportunity Scholarships Program entitled to help students in struggling schools transfer to schools of their choice to encourage academic success. 

== Improving High Schools ==
To improve high schools, problems during the education process must be caught early on to prevent the continuing of bad habits, which may cause students to fail. Many schools like the school I attended gives students and parents progress reports in the middle of the six or nine weeks of each grading period. Progress reports explain the grades for every subject whether the student is passing or failing.  Another action the President is taking is to train more teachers over a five-year period to teach advanced placement courses. Advanced placement courses will better prepare students who wish to continue their learning after high school.

== Assessments ==
Through NCLB, states are required to test students on grade level content and math and reading standards for grades 3-8 and once for grades 10-12. Schools who fail to make progress are required to make different services available to students to give them the tools they need to score high on tests. Schools may offer tutoring free of charge so they may get the needed extra help. Also states are required to make state goals objectives that are measured annually. In the article’ “20 Ways to Use Authentic Assessment Techniques to Fulfill the Promise of No Child Left Behind” the authors Carol Layton and Robin Lock give educators twenty suggestions on how to assess students. One suggestion is to collect work from students daily to display the progresses of each student. This will verify if the student is performing on or below their grade level on an everyday basis. Another suggestion is to directly observe and record student behavior. This will provide the information concerning skill performance. Assessment also lets educators know what areas students are lacking in and what information needs to be taught in more depth. 

== Recipe for Success ==
In order to make the No Child Left Behind Act a success, all of these aspects must be incorporated. Teachers must have the education and experience to teach effectively. Effective teachers prepare students for what is to come later in their journey of education as well as prepare them for life.  Parents also have more options to where their children go to school to make sure the child is getting the proper attention and education. High schools are being improved to catch problems early on so they do not become permanent problems that cannot be fixed. Lastly, to measure the skills of students, their knowledge must be assessed.

{{question-answer|question=Explain why you think the No Child Behind Act was created. What problems do you think existed in  previous years concerning primary and secondary education?
|answer=I think the NCLB Act was created because so many students were not receiving the proper education to move on to higher learning. Also there is no consistency in education from state to state nor from district to district within the same state. This national law makes schools consistent on the level of assessment and accountability. The law requires teachers to have the knowledge and experience needed to prepare students for the next grade level. A lot of problems in past years were that some students were dropping out of school or not receiving satisfactory scores on tests. Hopefully, NCLB will decrease the amount of drop outs and increase the number of passing scores by making sure teachers are more experienced and providing extra assistance to students.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should society respond to under-performing schools?}}
{{Rquote|right|Of all developed countries, only two systematically have spent less money educating poor children than wealthy children. One is South Africa, and the other is the United States.|Paul Tractenberg|a founder of New Jersey’s Education Law Center (Gross, 1999)}}

Most Americans are armchair critics of our education system and are quick to point out the decline in the quality of education for our nation's children. Wouldn’t it be nice if they stopped complaining and became proactive for the benefit of the students? Who is responsible for the quality of education for our nation’s youth? Yes, the accountability lies partially with teachers and schools. Our education system is certainly far from perfect and we need to personally evaluate our respective state education policies. However the state of our country’s academic achievement is “due more to the conditions of students’ lives outside of school than it is to what takes place within school walls.”(Steinberg, 1996). A large portion of the accountability should be placed on us, the citizens. If our students are failing, it is a reflection of our actions or inactions. The education system that our children have is the one that we have given them. Let us look at the possible causes of under-performance in our schools and how we as a society can contribute to finding a solution.

==Acknowledge the Problem==
The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) gives us a report card on our nation’s educational status. Of the tested fourth grade students in 2005, only 35% were found to be proficient in math, and 30% were proficient in reading (School Matters, 2005). The Kansas Action for Children has come up with six basic red flag conditions to identify students with high risk for underachievement. They are: 
* The head of the household is a high school drop-out
* The children have no health insurance
* The family lives in poverty
* Only one parent lives in the home
* Neither parent works full time
* The family receives welfare benefits

A large portion of failure among students is attributed to their personal attitudes toward the importance of academic success, peer opinions toward academic priorities, media influences, and time spent in leisure and other activities outside school (Steinberg, 1996). Academically many underachieving students credit their failures to causes other than a lack of hard work. Our graduates are among the least educated in the world (Steinberg, 1996).

Laurence Steinberg credits the biggest problem for children as being “the high prevalence of disengaged parents in contemporary America” in his book Beyond the Classroom. Steinberg goes on to say that “one in three parents is seriously disengaged” from their child’s educational performance and only one out of five parents attend school programs and functions on a regular basis (Steinberg, 1996). Parents must make education a priority not only to themselves, but instill an importance of educational success in our homes. “Students need to believe that their performance in school genuinely matters in order to do well in the classroom,” (Steinberg, 1996). We can also enforce good time management skills which will benefit our children not simply through school but as an essential asset in life (Friedman, 2005). We must become involved in our children’s lives, regardless of the demands on our own. Our children must be our top priority! Lack of parental involvement is a predictor for “drug and alcohol abuse, delinquency and violence, suicide, and sexual precocity.” (Steinberg, 1996). We must carefully guard our children’s activities, the amount of time they spend in leisure activities, the content of the media that they view, and even the quality of people surrounding them (Steinberg, 1996). “Nearly one-fifth of all students say they do not try as hard as they can in school because they are worried about what their friends might think.” (Steinberg, 1996).

==Generate Interest==
This information is intimidating to a society seeking to help. We must formulate a plan of action for helping our nation’s students. As a whole we need to become interested in the future of our schools and recognize ourselves as being accountable to our nation’s youth for enforcing a response proportionate to their need (Meier, 2004). Apathetic attitudes and ignorance must not be accepted. We must generate awareness and interest in the academic situation (Popham, 2004). We must ask ourselves a few key questions about our communities, such as how we should judge the condition of the schools closest to us, whether they well maintained, if the areas they are in are high in crime or violence, what type of role models or mentors we think the children in our neighborhoods see, if the school in a low income area, and how these factors contribute to an environment conducive to learning and social behaviors desirable for our youth (Eighmey). We need to evaluate our schools on the basis of where we live before we begin to assess how we can best help.

==Becoming Informed==
Evaluating our schools accurately requires that we ask the right people the right questions. We must dig for telling facts and not simply be satisfied with the “everything is fine” educational bureaucratic glaze (Popham, 2004). On a national and local level we can search for information on the schools near us and state wide through the local department of education website as well as other sites that gathers and publishes information from the various states. We can also contact our Representatives, local board of education, and even specific principals (Popham, 2004). A few of the questions we need answered are:
* What tests are used in our state to satisfy the provisions of the NCLB (No Child Left Behind Act)? 
* Do they help our state’s teachers in their efforts to promote students’ progress?
* How many content standards do our state’s NCLB tests attempt to assess?
* What increase is required each year in the proportion of a school’s students who must score at a proficient-or-above level on our state’s NCLB- required tests?
* What are our state’s academic achievement standards?
* Does our state’s assessment test accurately represent the education our students are receiving? (Popham, 2004) 

This last question is especially important. Schools where testing is not difficult enough will reflect inflated, unrealistic scores (Steinberg, 1996). The more dangerous alternative is that the state adopted achievement tests are too difficult and therefore create tendencies for teachers to teach the students just the sampling of information on the standardized testing instead of giving them a well rounded education (Popham, 2004).

==Getting Involved==
If we as individuals find the necessary answers to these questions and are dissatisfied with the results, then we are obligated to take action. We must speak out against faulty systems when educators cannot for fear of professional backlash (Meier, 2004). Those of us outside the schools can take action by supporting organizations of change like the Children’s Defense Fund (Steinberg, 1996), promoting awareness through local media (Karp,2003), telling other concerned citizens you know (Wood, 1992), and supporting media which promotes education and disassociates from poor role model images and messages of glorified violence (Steinberg, 1996). 

As a community we need to welcome the opportunities to interact with schools, not view them as institutions to occupy children by contacting state and local policy makers, becoming a community activist, becoming a program, teacher, and child advocate, making sure we are voting and researching the history of candidates in relation to education issues (Karp, 2003), and supporting legislation to equalize the amount spent per student regardless of community incomes (Wood, 1992). We can volunteer at schools or seek to open free tutoring and assistance centers (Friedman, 2005). One wonderful example of community involvement in education is a church in Hampton, Virginia, called Six House.  Six House runs a three-day-a-week after school homework club. Local citizens and high school students volunteer to work to help children. Businesses can help to support schools through training programs and donations. We must all try to play a part to create a community that nurtures education. As parents, or those who care for children, we bear a great responsibility for the performance level of our children. Parent involvement is essential for the success of a child’s academic career (Steinberg, 1996).

== Conclusion ==	
Clearly the responsibility of the state of our nation’s education belongs not simply to the teachers, administrators, and politicians, but to every citizen. If we become participants in education through the discovery of relevant facts, active as individuals doing our part, and a community seeking to take pride in our children, then we might say we have fulfilled our obligation to the students. We must provide our children with the opportunity to succeed by doing what we can as a society. It is then and only then that we can pretend to assign blame to teachers or programs. The actions that we take or choose to ignore will predict our path as a future nation. “Solving America’s achievement problem will require a national effort that involves not only schools, but parents, employers, the mass media, and ultimately students themselves.” (Steinberg 1996).

{{question-answer|question=In your opinion what might be the reasoning for a teacher to only teach test required material?  Do you agree or disagree?
|answer=The simple idea of a teacher only teaching material related to one test is contradictory to the concept of education itself!  Teachers do this in order to meet demands of administrations, of school boards, and even of Washington.  If the students do not make their score goals, there are penalties.  These penalties are almost more for teachers and schools.  So these schools are not pursuing achievement solely for the benefit of the students, but as a defense mechanism for themselves.  

As educators, our main concern should be the children above all else.  They need a well rounded education, not cliff notes for the SOLs.  How can we assign so much weight to one test as to allow it to pass or fail and entire grade level?  Children do not complete an entire grade through one test; let’s not fail them in one.  This is the system we have put into place. 	We have become so test-crazed that we are teaching students the answers instead of the questions.  Let’s not make learning about the tests, but about the pursuit of knowledge and individual growth.  Our students are the ones that are being failed by the very system that was designed to help them.  A veteran teacher said &quot;Students are learning a little bit of everything and a whole lot of nothing&quot;.  I know as an educator I want to be part of a change to do better by our schools and students.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should society reward outstanding schools and teachers?}}

How should society reward outstanding schools and teachers?  Rewarding schools and teachers is absolutely important to ensure that students and teachers reach their maximum learning limits.  Victor Lavy a professor for economics states “improve the current education system by clarifying teacher goals and by attracting and retaining the most productive teachers.” In the United States most college graduates with a master degree do not pursue teaching because pay is not high enough.  Many graduates with the same degree make more money. Is money the only motivating factor for schools systems and teachers?  It is debatable and unfortunately there is no simple solution.  Teaching is one of the most valuable professions for a society and it is a shame that we do not have “brightest” teaching our children.  As a teacher states from Florida “Money shouldn’t be the only reason why your in it, the time is not equal to the money received” (Freeman, 2006) I think teachers need to be rewarded yearly with rewards for achievements made throughout the year.  Research indicates that reward systems can be counter active and create bad morale (Dee &amp; Keys 2004).   All teacher unions look down upon performance based pay.  The main reason is because it is very hard and expensive to accurately evaluate student teacher progress (Lavy, 2007). Throughout the research it was very difficult to find information on rewarding schools and teachers.  I find this hard to believe but maybe because it is not done enough.   Currently teachers are rewarded by their years of service and education.  

==Performance-based Pay== 
{{Rquote|right|On the matter of retaining and rewarding teachers basing teachers' pay on what administration deem good teaching leads to charges of favoritism and causes tension and morale problems. If salary is to be determined by results like higher test scores, those who teach deprived areas would themselves be financially deprived.|Morris Finder|Letter to the New York Times in response to &quot;How to pay teachers&quot;}}

Performance based pay is a way to reward teachers individually and/or as a team for different goals that are set forth.  Research varies when it comes down on what should be done to reward schools.  It seems the operative word is performance.  “What type of performance is the school system looking for?”  Performance based pay can be many things to include “… attendance, grade retention, drop out rates, or performance based on tests.”(Lavy 2007)  There is indication in the research that teachers do not want to be rated in this way. 

Some teachers fear that the impact of socio-economic status on test scores will prevent them from getting a bonus.  There was a study done in 1946, 1981 and 1995 that opposes the concern of money. When  teachers were asked what motivates them the reply was “interesting work” and not “money” (Diamantes 2004)  Performance based pay only pays for improvements and nothing “below threshold performance”  (Lavy, 2007)  In other studies performance based pay is also called merit pay (Dee &amp; Keys, 2004).  “Merit based pay which is defined broadly here as any systems of teachers’ compensation that explicitly reward better performance, has been perceived as a potential remedy for the flaws of the single salary system” (Dee&amp; Keys 2004)  These pay systems do not last long mainly because of the opposition of them.  “…failure of merit pay is mainly due to teacher and union oppositions”(Dee &amp; Keys 2004)  In Dee and Key’s research it states students with merit pay teachers should have higher gain scores.  However again there is criticism that this will make teachers not work together as a team and not share ideas.  Education Commissioner John Wynn states “As it is with any other profession, compensation for teachers should be based in part, on their results, talent and expertise.” (Freeman 2006) Private schools are 35% more likely to use merit reward systems where public schools use a merit systems only 5% of the time. (Lavy, 2007)  Lavy implies that this is because public schools have to prove their scores because students have to pay to go there.  In public schools it is different because where you live is usually where you go to school there is not too much choice involved.

==Evaluation Processes==
The biggest problem with rewards and incentives for teachers is the evaluation process.  In Tennessee they launched a “Career Ladder Program”.  In this program the teachers' pay was based on different criteria.  The “program blended salary rewards with professional responsibilities” (Dee &amp; Keys, 2004). It was geared toward increasing employee morale in that it did not place a cap on the amount of rewards that could be given out (Dee &amp; Keys, 2004). This makes it so all teachers are striving to do better and meet current goals.  This is not a program that is geared to the top 1% or one teacher of the year. The only problem was that the principal was responsible for ensuring that the teachers got certification according to the state board and they only had a few hours of training on evaluating the teachers (Dee &amp; Keys,2004). Due to evaluation being subject the teachers argued that there is room for bias.  Another problem with incentive-based programs is that there are so many goals in education.  Not just in academics but drop-out rates, violence, and so on.  It is very hard to get all parties to agree on goals (Lavy, 2007). The evaluation process is extremely difficult to do well because all things must be considered.  

==Rewards Based on Experience and Training==
The current reward for teaching now is years of service and the amount of education that the teacher has.  Rewards now include a small annual increase for each year of service.  I do mean small.  Mostly they pay you a little more for what type of degree you have bachelors, master doctorate.  Dee &amp; Keys states that “… the ‘single salary approach’ was widely adopted in the first half of the century, partly as a response of capriciousness and out right discrimination that had existed under more discretionary forms of compensation.
It is very hard to reward teachers because of the continued pattern that was started with equal rights and equal pay.   Unfortunately in research voters are not giving raises to teachers due to low over all academic performance on standardized tests (Lavy, 2007).   It is believed that voters would vote in favor for incentive money for schools and teachers that are performing above average (Lavy, 2007).  
 
==Conclusion==
In conclusion, it is important to reward teachers.  Hopefully one day all teachers, administrators, school systems, and voters will come up with an amiable solution.  Unfortunately teachers and school systems are stuck with minimal rewards.  Society needs to take a more active approach in increasing rewards. Public schools need qualified teachers and this is directly related to the reward system.  There has got to be a better equation for Performance based pay.  The pay should be calculated by many factors including individual goals.    Hopefully everyone will take the time an evaluate what is most important.  The United States needs to step it up a notch and put education first with funding.  Rewards are important to recruiting qualified staff for schools.

{{question-answer|question=What are the problems with rewards systems and briefly what do you think will fix this?
|answer=There are many problems with rewards for teachers. There are many different ways you can reward a teacher.  You can reward a teacher by testing scores, reduced violence, teacher certifications and goals etc.  It is hard to have everybody agree upon the same goals to reward on.  However it is the teacher unions that mainly end up kicking out most of the monetary rewards for excellent performance.   They are dedicated to equality and believe there is no way you can adequately measure how much effort a teacher puts in.  On the flip side I would think something is better than nothing. Due to teacher unions most rewards for teaching are ended after a couple years.   They believe that giving monetary rewards to certain teachers creates bad morale and prohibits team work.  I would fix the reward system by having group goals and individual goals.  This means the school together needs to increase current academic performance by a percentage.  There would also be individual goals where you increase your classroom percentage by a certain amount.  I would also put no limits on the rewards.  I believe by making attainable goals and money available one can obtain the best rewards for teachers and students.
----
The problem with reward systems is that there are so many levels that teachers are evaluated on. There are so many goals that we all want met when we send our children to school. For example we want our tests scores higher, violence lower, and drop out rates lower. These goals are all supported but which are we to focus on more than the others? This is one of the biggest problems with setting specific goals for teachers to earn rewards. They may become focused on winning and not really on the wellbeing of their class. This is one of the main issues seem by people today and this is usually where unions step in saying that it promotes unequal pay rates. Yet the unequal pay rate is exactly what they are going for with rewarding teachers for doing their jobs better. 
I feel that a reward system would be a good idea but I don’t think that one principal should judge it. I feel that it should be a committee from the community that sitting in and listen to the rates of the top teachers chosen by the school board. The rates being how they improved their schools rating on violence drop out rate, and standardized test scores. This I feel would be a more favorable way of judging because it would give some distances from the teachers in their everyday lives and it wouldn’t just be principal’s favorite teachers all the time. &amp;mdash;Katharine Bratton}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What makes NCLB the savior of quality education?}}

Education is a vital tool for success in this country for today’s generation.  There can be no growth or expansion unless society as a whole becomes more educated and better trained.  In the past it was acceptable to graduate high school and find a job, but now that will not get you very far in life.  Children today have to be better, brighter, and more knowledgeable than ever before if they hope to make it into college and make something of themselves in the world.  Due to these high stakes for the growing youth in America, the nation had to develop a strategy to guarantee success.  This is where No Child Left Behind entered the picture.  The schools around the country were not meeting the standards and expectations set for them in order for children to have the most beneficial opportunities.  Teachers and other school staff did not have the qualifications, skills, or concern to help the students get the best out of the public school system.  After seeing these results and having great concern about the future of children, the national government decided to step in and make a difference.  With their guidance and enthusiasm, NCLB has made great strides in raising the bar of education in this great nation.  Now teachers must be highly qualified in order to give students the best instruction for learning.  This law also made schools and states more accountable for education and performance.  Throughout the regulations of this education safeguard, parents are more involved, technology is better incorporated into the learning process, and all minority and disabled students are taught with higher skills and importance.

==Highly Qualified Teachers==
Education growth and development has made teacher qualifications a high concern of schools across the nation.  These professionals need the experience, knowledge, and skills to lead the younger generation on the pathway to education.  With this in mind, NCLB targeted teachers to make sure they met the necessary requirements.  To be deemed highly qualified, teachers must have a bachelor’s degree, certification or licensure from the state, and show mastery of the subjects they teach (NCLB Flexibility, 2004). All teachers were required to maintain the highly qualified status by the 2005-2006 school year.  It is important that teachers become highly qualified in each subject they teach.  Due to the demand for teachers, the Education Department has made flexibilities to give teachers considered qualified in one subject time to receive that qualification in other subjects. This is an important flexibility for teachers that are teaching many subjects.   Another key alternative for current teachers is the HOUSSE (High, Objective, Uniform State Standard of Evaluation) evaluation process.  This allows teachers to prove their mastery of the subject or subjects they teach without having to return to school (NCLB Flexibility, 2004).  It is also now important to properly train teachers who were entering the schools so they can provide the best education to students.  This law also targeted teacher recruitment so that school officials could hire the most skilled person for the job.  With qualified teachers in the smaller classrooms, students would be able to learn more information and meet state requirements (Whitehouse, n.d.).  

==Accountability==
{{Rquote|right|In states where the law (NCLB) has been embraced, it is working. Teachers, principals, superintendents, parents and children have all chosen to roll up their sleeves and meet the challenge. As a result, children are achieving, and the achievement gap in the early grades is closing. In those states, public confidence in public education is soaring.|Dennis W. Redovich|''The Nonsense of the NCLB Act and High School Reform''}}

Schools and states are now being held accountable for children learning the necessary material.  The schools must measure each student’s annual yearly progress, AYP, in math and reading.  Each student must also test proficient on state tests by the 2013-2014 school term.  Then the school must keep the parents informed about how it is performing.  Each child should be meeting the AYP goal for the year in at least a proficient score or the school is not doing its job.  The school is also responsible for letting parents know when a person that is not a highly qualified teacher is instructing their child.    The major accountability test for each school is the standardized tests.  If schools are unable to pass these tests with the children scoring proficient then that school is not meeting its obligations.  With the schools being held more accountable, they are making greater efforts to teach chidren.  Not surprisingly, it is working.  Everyone is getting involved and trying to overcome any obstacle in the path of education. NCLB has set the margins of excellence and it is making sure that all schools can meet these requirements.  This is a positive effect for every parent because then the children will be getting the best education possible (No Child Left behind Act: Wikipedia, n.d.).

==Parental Involvement==
Getting parents involved with the school is a major goal of the NCLB.  It is important for parents to understand how the schools should be performing.  Then they must make every effort to evaluate the education their child is getting compared to the set standards.  NCLB has many refreshing ideas about getting parents involved.  Some of these rules include annual meetings with parents, notifying parents of teachers that are not certified as highly qualified, and distributing an annual report card on how the school is performing.  Still, it is the schools responsibility to inform parents on how their child is progressing and what they can do to help.  The most important aspect of this parental involvement occurs when a school is not performing to meet standards.  Then the school must notify the parents with options of transferring to other schools that are performing up to standards.  The child is also eligible for free tutoring.  Overall this should be a relationship of constant communication between the parents and the school.  The parents need to know how the child is performing, as well as how the school is meeting its requirements.  It is the parents’ obligation to make sure their child is receiving an appropriate education and it is the schools responsibility to provide this useful information to the parent (NCLB Rules, 2007).

==Incorporating Technology into Education==
Another major goal of NCLB is to incorporate technology into learning.  This would enhance the educational opportunity of the child.  There are many schools that do not use technology when teaching.  The students are missing out on learning about tools they will use in the future, and it is putting them further behind after they exit the public school.  Technology is also a useful tool to get children interested in what they are learning.  This is why the government finds it so important to use technology when teaching.  By incorporating this technology, students are learning the necessary material while becoming familiar with devices they will use later in life.  This is also a way for schools to receive more money.  A school can receive extra funding for new devices.  This will help the schools that do not have enough money to purchase computers and other materials.  Some teachers are finding this new incorporation useful because it reduces the paperwork and makes lessons more flexible (Whitehouse, n.d.).  

==Minority and Disabled Students==
NCLB has made great strides in increasing the educational benefit of minority and disabled students.  Before, these students did not get the attention or recognition they deserved.  Many schools would not focus on these groups because they were not the majority of students.  Through NCLB, these groups are getting greater attention.  This act has shifted the attention to minimizing the gaps in performance between groups based on class or race.  Every student has the same expectations and requirements whether they are black, white, rich, or poor.  This has made schools focus on groups, such as Latinos or low-income students, that were previously forgotten due to status or financial label (No Child Left Behind Act: Wikipedia, n.d.).  These groups are now receiving their appropriate education.  Disabled students were also ignored in the past.  There were no high expectations of these students so many schools shifted attention away to the larger groups.  NCLB changed all of this by requiring disabled students to also meet strict requirements of AYP.  This forced schools and teachers to refocus attention to these students so they could pass state tests.  This gave disabled students a better chance of learning in the general education classroom and becoming productive members of their school and society (Nagle, Yunker, &amp; Malmgren, 2006).  

==Limited English Proficiency Students==
“All limited English proficient students will become proficient in English and reach high academic standards, at a minimum attaining proficiency or better in reading/language arts and mathematics”(ED.gov). The Virginia Board of Education adopted English Language Proficiency Standards of Learning in November 2002. “Section 1111 (b)(7) of the NCLB Act requires each state to ensure that all school divisions, will provide for an annual assessment of English language proficiency  of all LEP students”(ED.gov).The assessment measures an individual’s oral language, reading, and writing skills in English. A LEP student who is at the lowest levels of achievement in the grades third through eighth has the option of taking the state test as proxy for the English/reading Standards of Learning test with up to three years. Whereas the students who maintain the higher levels of proficiency take the regular Standards of Learning tests. Through this testing, LEP students will get a chance to achieve at their very highest upbringing. The No Child Left Behind Act does not penalize for their level, instead each child gets a chance.  

==Conclusion==
Although NCLB may have caused drastic changes in school across the country, it was a positive effect for the children.  Without this legislation, many children would have continued to receive an inadequate education and could have suffered later on through life.  Through NCLB, all students are given the same chance to succeed and it is the schools responsibility to help.  They must make sure that all students are making progress and achieving set goals every year during their education.  It also requires schools to keep parents involved so they know how their child is performing.  Through the requirements of highly qualified teachers and the use of technology, students are now receiving one of the best educations this country has every seen.  There may be a few dilemmas along the road to success, but overall NCLB has helped to make the state and schools accountable for what the students do.  Through this, each child is making great strides and has the best opportunities set on the road ahead.  This is not only making the nation’s schools a better place to learn, but is creating knowledgeable students who will one day make this country a better place to live.

{{question-answer|question=What do you think is the most important goal of the No Child Left Behind Act? Why?
|answer=I believe that the most important goal of this act would be to have highly qualified teachers.  Teachers are the people we trust to properly educate the youth of this nation.  They have the future of this wonderful country in the palms of their hands.  That is why it is so important for them to have the proper qualifications.  A teacher needs to have a bachelor’s degree to prove that he or she has had the proper education.  Likewise, the teacher needs to be certified and able to prove that he or she knows all the subjects and material that will be taught to the students.  Only then, can parents truly trust that their children are getting an appropriate education.  If teachers just had to have a simple degree, he or she may not be capable or trained enough to properly take control of the classroom, and help the students learn the material that is presented to them.  Teachers that have had all the proper training, certification, and testing, should know how to handle the students.  They should be aware of any problems that may occur and how to solve them.  Most importantly, these trained professionals will help our children become intellectuals that can change this country for the better one day. 

The most important goal of the No Child Left Behind Act is accountability.  I feel as though accountability is important because it requires everyone involved in education to be accounted for improvements that need to take place in education.  The NCLB Act holds states, schools, teachers, and students accountable for improve the standards in education.  One of the biggest problems in education was that there was not uniform system in place to hold anyone accountable for students failing.  The enactment of the NCLB Act, everyone in education is accountable for improving education in America.  Someone in education is always answering to someone else (states to federal government, schools to states, teachers to schools, and students to teachers).   Accountability has really opened up the door to allow everyone to succeed in education.  The main goal in education is to make sure No Child is Left Behind and the new accountability system put into place allows every student a chance to succeed.  

Teachers do seem to be accountable for more things than anyone else.  But it is important to make sure teacher are held accountable because if a student succeed you say it was because they had a good teacher; if a student fails you say it was because they had a bad teacher.  We need to make sure that our students are getting good teachers so that every student is succeeding and we can say it was because they had a great teacher.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are the principles of effective assessment?}}
{{Rquote|right|The purpose of implementing an assessment and accountability program is to improve student learning of worthwhile content.|Educational Testing Service (Bascia)}}

When you think of the term “assessment” you probably immediately think “test.”  While testing is an important part of effective assessment, there are several other key components.

In order for students to succeed both the students and the schools must receive the right resources and be held to the appropriate standards.  While these guidelines may seem to be little more than common sense, they are not always so simple to implement. The American Educational Research Association outlined the following three criteria necessary for an effective assessment program:

# The assessment and accountability program should provide a good target for student and school effort.
# The assessment and accountability program should be symmetrical.
# The assessment and accountability program should be fair. 


==Providing a Good Target==
Standards that are well planned and evenly applied are the first step.  These standards should include a broad curriculum.  Students should be proficient in foundation skills (like multiplication tables or verb declension).  Students however should also be able to use ideas they are taught to solve problems and communicate those ideas to others.  In other words, “Assessment tasks assess the capacity to analyze and synthesis new information and concepts rather than simply recall information previously presented.” (CSHE, 2002)
When setting appropriate targets there are several factors to consider, including:

# A range of subjects should be tested.
# The whole school should accept appropriate responsibility for students’ success or failure.
# A good assessment program focuses attention on the domain of content desired, as opposed to the specific sample tested.
# Hold schools and students accountable require specifying standards for performance.
# The goal is to set rewards and sanctions that are sufficient to focus attention on desired content and increase effort. (Porter, 2004)

==Being Symmetrical== 
For those of you who took geometry a life time ago, symmetrical means to be equal on each side.  When applied to an educational assessment program that means that both the students and the schools are equally held responsible in obtaining goals. Questions that must be asked when creating a symmetrical program include:  

# To what degree will teachers at untested grades share the responsibility for student’s success/failure in high stakes testing?
# How much are the schools, teachers, and students held responsible for their own performance?
# Are the students and teachers held to same set of data for their evaluations?  (Porter 2004)

It is important that the notion of equal responsibility should not end within the schools.  If the state holds the schools to a standard, the state should also be accountable in helping the schools meet that standard.  Alexander Astin highlights this concept in his article “9 Principles of Assessing Student Learning” stating, “Assessment alone changes very little. . . . The push to improve educational performance is a visible and primary goal of leadership; improving the quality of [education] is central to the institution’s planning, budgeting and personnel decisions.

==Fairness in Assessment==
This concept of fairness goes hand in hand with the previous idea of equal responsibility.  “The key ideas behind a fair assessment and accountability program are opportunity to learn, adequate resources, and the reliability and validity of measures on which inferences are made.” (Heubert &amp; Hauser 1999) In other words, if a school is going to hold a student to a standard, the school must adequately teach that standard.  Likewise if a state is going to hold the schools accountable, then the state must provide the proper funds and resources needed.  

But holding each level accountable is one thing, knowing where to start that accountability is something quite different.  Can you hold the student accountable before they receive instruction?  Do you hold the school accountable once the standards are set?  Or should there be a more gradual implementation of standards and accountability?
One solution is to first hold the schools accountable for a period of time before the students (Foster, 2004) Of course there is much more than simply creating the standards in achieving academic success.  The standards must be taught, both efficiently and effectively.  To that a school must have “qualified staff, instructional materials including technology, high-quality teacher professional development and reasonable class sizes.” (Foster, 2000)

But how do high-stakes testing factor into fairness in assessment?  Fairness would indicate that no single test would determine the academic future of a student.  The student must be given multiple tests and multiple opportunities to prove that he/she is proficient.  This may create a “bias of success” (Foster, 2004) because it increases the likelihood that a student will succeed.  Fairness in assessment supports such a positive leaning bias.

==Effective Assessment in the Classroom==

The previous sections have concentrated on assessment applied across a school system. However assessment for that system begins in singular classrooms.  How can effective assessment be applied in those individual classrooms?  Again, there are three basic principles to take into account.

# Create Unambiguous Expectations.  Students will do better when they understand what is expected of them.  Assignment should be clearly defined and pertain to the lectures and resources they are provided.  They should also receive feedback, explanation of their grades, and suggestions for improvement.
# Create Authentic Tasks.  Students will do better when they are given assignments that call upon skills that will be valuable in real-life situations.  
# Give Choice and Flexibility.  Students will work harder if they believe they have a voice in their given assignments.  Providing a choice of assignment and different ways to complete those assignments but the responsibility of the students to highlight their individual skills.  (Assessing Student Learning)

==Other Principles To Consider==
# Standards First, Then Testing.  Policy makers and educators need to use a progression that begins with setting goals and ends with assessment.  Then we can use tests that measure our progress.
# Tests Measure Educational Progress--They Don't Create It.  Tests do not make better students; good schools and good teachers do!
# No Single Test Does Everything--The Importance of Multiple Measures.  No one test can show whether all standards are being met, nor can it show everything we need to know about one student's progress.
# The Importance of Valid, Fair, and Reliable Assessments.  All tests should be created and published using standards developed by the American Educational Research Association and the National Council on Measurement in Education.  When creating tests, fairness, validity, reliability, and technical strengths should be reviewed (McGraw-Hill).

==Conclusion==
Effective assessment is a set of rules, tools, regulations and resources designed to help both students and schools meet the standards necessary to succeed.  Effective Assessment both begins and ends with that standard.  The schools must create and then teach that standard.  Students must learn and apply that standard. When the standard is met, the bar should be raised higher.

{{question-answer|question=How does the idea of “bias of success” affect high-stakes testing?
|answer=“Bias of Success” is the educational practice of putting the odds in favor of the student.  If a student does poorly on a test, the student is allowed the retake a test on the same material.  If a student struggles with a particular format of testing, the student is tested in a different format.  By giving the student multiple opportunities to succeed, the likelihood that the student will succeed increases.  
High stakes testing are singular tests that determine a student’s ability.  The multiple attempts can take the edge off of high stakes test.  Knowing that the test can be retaken again may even take pressure off of the student, thus allowing the student to do better on the first test.  Bias of success allows for the opportunity to have the student show what he/she has learned rather than what they can remember on a given day.  Bias of success removes many of the pressures and disadvantages of high stakes testing.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are feedback skills?}}

“What is your problem?  Don’t you listen to anything I say?”  Not very encouraging or motivating is it?  Think about it.  What if you were the student who just finished an assignment that you had worked very hard on and this was the response that you received from your teacher?  More than likely, you would not be motivated to try to do a better job or even want to do an assignment for that teacher again.  We, as teachers, need to be mindful of what we say and how we say it. People of all ages need feedback on what they do and how they do it.  There are different ways and types of feedback that can be given.  How feedback is given has a huge impact on a student and his/her motivation to learn.  

==What is Feedback?==
Feedback, according to Dictionary.com, is “knowledge of the results of any behavior considered as influencing or modifying further performance.”  Feedback can come from a teacher, the learner him/herself, or from parents, other adults or peers.  Feedback should make reference to the quality of the work and how to improve it.  If the feedback is given correctly it will let the student know what he/she needs to improve on and what he/she did correctly.  There is positive and negative feedback.  This article will focus on positive feedback.

==Students' Needs are Different==
The role of teachers has changed in the last few years.  Teachers need to encourage students to want to learn and to help students develop appropriate learning techniques.  The intent of a teacher should be to help the students cultivate the tools and strategies to be better able to learn and be responsible for their own learning.  Teachers should strive to keep students motivated by varying feedback and giving the appropriate feedback.  Students have different needs and learning styles and because of this a teacher’s first priority should be to build a relationship with each child.  This is necessary so that the teacher will know how each student is motivated to learn and how he/she can give the correct feedback to help each child.  

Some students are intrinsically motivated and they learn simply for the love of learning without obvious external incentives or rewards.  Offering a reward sometimes suggests to an intrinsically motivated student that the activity is not worth doing the task for its own sake.  A teacher needs to be careful with how he/she uses feedback with this type of student so the student will be continue to be  intrinsically motivated  Extrinsically motivated students are motivated to learn because of the reward one receives after doing a task.  

==Encouragement is Important==   
{{Rquote|right|In years to come, a child may forget what you taught them.  But will always remember how you made them feel.|Steven Krushen}}

Praise is perhaps the most widely used form of adult attention in classrooms.  Critics claim that statements of praise may have detrimental effects when they express the teachers’ approval or admiration, provide general commendations on the value of achievements, or set up comparisons between children.  These forms of evaluative praise are thought to focus on children’s approval from others, on extrinsic rather than intrinsic rewards and on competition about achievement, rather than on personal development and the value of the activity itself.  Frequent use of evaluative praise is said to work against the generally accepted educational goals of fostering positive self concept, self-reliance, and internal motivation.  Research does not support the claim that traditional praise reduces internal motivation.  On the contrary,  a recent study revealed that verbal praise increases children’s intrinsic motivation, measured both by the time they spend on a task and their favorable attitude about the task.    Instead of using evaluative praise, a teacher could use effective praise which focuses on the effort and/or specific attributes of the work completed.  Encouragement should be specific, focus on improvement of process and effort, be sincere, and avoid comparisons to other students.  (Slaby, pgs. 64-65).  Non-verbal forms of attention include positive gestures (thumbs up, okay sign), laughing together, showing interest, winking, or clapping.  If a student gets informational feedback and has a pleasant experience they will want to continue the task or behavior.

Positive feedback is important to learner morale (confidence pleasure), which itself can be a powerful determinant of the learning outcome (Draper 2005).  Good feedback tells a student what was “right”, what was “wrong”, and how to right the wrongs without “wronging the rights”.  The first two should always be present and the third should be used when a teacher feels it is appropriate.  The teacher might want to let the student try and figure something out before giving corrective feedback (Isaacs, from Draper 2005).  

Recognition invites repetition.  Children crave to be noticed and recognized.  Behavior that gets a teacher’s focus, attention, and energy is what will grow and flourish.  When teachers notice good work and skills, students will repeat this behavior. Teachers should use language with students to help them develop positive attitudes about themselves and their potential.  With positive feedback a teacher can help students achieve the following: persist at tasks even when they become challenging, learn to carry out a task to completion, feel confident and competent, and feel hopeful about themselves, their potential, and the future (Bilmes, pg. 30 and 158).

Timeliness should be considered when giving feedback.  This will vary because of the student and the assignment.  Immediate feedback is important, it lets the student know about their work right away and what they need to do if anything; and also it keeps them on track and motivated to continue.  Sometimes feedback may need to be delayed a little to promote thought (Draper 2005). 

==Other Sources of Feedback==
Parents and other adults affect students learning also.  Discuss ways of encouragement and feedback with parents so that everyone will be on the same page.  Have both parents involved if possible.  “Children are more likely to be motivated to achieve if they get the same clear and positive message about school effort and expectations from both parents” (Rimm).

Peers can give each other feedback also.  Teachers should instruct the students in the proper way to give feedback to avoid possible hurt feelings and so that the feedback is helpful.  Feedback coming from a peer sometimes is more effective then coming from the teacher.  Students should also be taught to evaluate themselves (Rimm).  When a student succeeds in self-correction, it makes them feel good about themselves and motivates them to keep continue the task.

==Conclusion==
{{Rquote|right|The main difference between high ability achievers and high ability underachievers is that the achievers have learned the attitudes and strategies that enable them to be successful in a school setting”.|Joanne Rand Whitmore, 1980}}
   
Feedback is an important component of teaching.  Feedback is an art acquired over time and is loosely based on intuition.  We, as teachers, need to work on giving appropriate feedback.  We need to be conscious of what we say and how it comes across to students.  Teachers should take the time as ask students about the quality of the feedback they are receiving and if the students understand the feedback.  Feedback should identify what has been done well, what needs improvement, and should give appropriate guidelines on how to make improvements.  Praise and encouragement need to be appropriate.  It is the quality of feedback rather than the quantity.  It should be about helping students “learn” more effectively rather than just rushing through an assignment.  Feedback can be as easy as saying, “you did a good job”.  This can make a child feel confident and motivated.  It will also make the teacher feel good because they will know that they have inspired someone.  Remembering those five little words can make a difference in the life of many students.

{{question-answer|question=Imagine you are a kindergarten teacher. You notice one of your students seems to be having trouble with a rhyming game during center time.  He is not interacting with his peers at the center and is obviously distressed.  What do you do?
|answer=I would casually go to the center and observe all the students at that center for a few moments.  I would begin interacting with all of the students and then begin working with each one individually.  By doing this, I would not be singling out the student having problems.  As I was working with the other students at the center I would be giving them positive feedback.  When I got to the distressed student I would again offer positive feedback and begin working with him/her.  I would spend more time with this student and then I would team all the students up at that one center.  They could then help each other and hopefully the one student having problems would be successful.  By handling it this way you are not singling out the distressed student and he/her will probably not realize why you teamed them up.  You are therefore saving the student embarrassment, while being positive the whole time.

I going to school to teach kindergarten and in love with helping students do well, would observe then take action. I would then go over and talk to the entire student asking them how they were doing and if they needed any help. I would talk to every single student and then when I talked to the student who really needed help and was having trouble I would give him that extra help he needed. Then I might take him aside later when the class was going to lunch or recess or even write is parents a note telling him that I can help him with the that center. I would also like to let his parents know so maybe then can give him extra help at home. If those two options are not helping I can also refer him to a speech teacher/ reading and have them work with that particular student. A student can never have to much help when learning.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should group work be assessed?}}

When putting students into groups you may hear comments like, “Why do I have to be in Johnnie’s group?” or “It isn’t fair to be in a group with Johnnie because he doesn’t do anything to help the group.” These concerns can be multiplied when students will receive a grade for their group work. This article will look at several approaches to assessing group work that hopefully can be utilized to overcome student objections about working in groups.

The dictionary defines collaboration as working together, especially in a joint intellectual effort. Although many studies show the benefits of utilizing group work in the classroom, such as the increased learning and student involvement that can result, it can be difficult or confusing to determine how group work should be graded or assessed. The main reason it can be difficult is just the shear fact that the grading process involves joint effort, that of more than one student. Another reason this can be complicated is because there are several ways to form groups which may have different purposes and outcomes. There are also many questions to consider. How can we be fair to both the individual group members and also to recognize the group itself as a member? How should we deal with those students who refuse to participate or leave most of the work and input to the other team members? What is really being graded – aptitude, achievement, potential, or effort? (Kochis) Let’s look at the issues involving assessing group work and provide some possible approaches for assessment.

There are five main methods of assessing group work. They are:
* Individual assessment
* Assessment by the teacher
* Group assessment
* Self assessment
* Peer assessment

Each method has benefits and downfalls. One thing to consider when deciding how to assess group work, is the purpose of the group work itself. Will the group be creating a project together, will they work as a group but still create individual work, or will the members only be involved in student-led discussion? These factors contribute to the assessment that is chosen. 

==Individual Assessment==
Individual assessment can be easily utilized when a group is formed to brainstorm ideas and to discuss topics, but each member will still be creating their own product. The students may be required to submit a paper or a project based on the group’s ideas as well as their own. However, this type of assessment fails to take into account any of the group dynamics or to distinguish between those who participated in the group’s learning and those who did not. Another method of applying individual assessment works well when contracting is applied to a group project that can be easily broken down into distinct areas.

|} In this group setting, the members of the group would contract individually to determine what each would take responsibility for. They can then be graded based on the extent to which they fulfilled their part of the contract. (Young)
 
==Assessment by Teacher==
Assigning individual grades based on teacher observation is also difficult because a teacher is not an actual member of the group and cannot know what is going on in all groups all the time. It also tends to be an advantage to those members who are more dominant and vocal, even though their contributions may not be the most beneficial. If online discussion boards are used, it is much easier for the instructor to check in on the group discussion to see who is participating and who is not. However, a group grade given by a teacher can be based on more than observation. The team members could be required to keep a journal or a log to track the group’s activities which the teacher could assess. (Young) Also, you could require individual assignments such as worksheets, web references, or discussion questions, to be completed at certain times that would be shared with the group. A written assignment could be required at the end of group work from each member describing what they felt they learned and how they incorporated what they learned from each group member into their final project. (Using the Forums) A project exam question could also be utilized to ensure that those who contributed most to the project would be best suited to answer the question well. Then, these students would be individually rewarded by an increased test score. (Young)

Another issue to consider here is whether attendance should be part of the grade when involving group work. Since students in groups are actively engaged in creating the knowledge they will gain from the course, it is important that they are present. Group work is dependent on interaction.  If a group member is absent, he cannot contribute to discussion or participate in the groups activities. Because of this, most instructors assign from 5% to 15% of a grade based on attendance. (Petrulis)

==Group Assessment==
Assigning a collective grade also fails to take account of group dynamics and fails to distinguish between individual members’ efforts and contributions. (Sullivan) Using this method, each member of the group would receive the same grade. Conflicts can often arise when this grading method is used alone. Highly motivated students often resent being grouped with less committed peers. (Petrulis) You may begin hearing comments like “______ didn’t do any work on the project. It isn’t fair that he should get our grade when we did all the work.” (Arango) One solution to this problem may be to apply the “Share-Out” System.

|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD;padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | The Share Out System is a method of group assessment where the group members themselves decide together how to assign grades to each other.
|} The simplest way to operate this approach is to take the grade the group project was given and multiply it by the number of group members. Then, leave it to the group to decide how to split up the total score. For example, a group of four with a project mark of 55 might share out the 220 (55*4) marks: 65, 60, 50, and 45. (Young) Be careful here though, as this method may again lead to conflict because of competition, and many students may not have developed the negotiation skills required to agree on grades with their peers. (Blease, 2006)

==Self &amp; Peer Evaluation==
The last two methods of group assessment are unique because they do not involve the instructor assigning a grade at all. With self assessment and peer assessment, the group members themselves provide information that determines their grades. Self assessment requires students to make judgments about their own work or their performance on a team. With peer assessment, students are asked to comment on or judge the performance of other group members. Peer assessment is usually done anonymously to avoid potential conflicts and to allow the students to feel they can be honest in their evaluations. (Blease, 2006) Surprisingly, students often grade themselves more harshly than their teachers might, and are also reassuringly honest when completing peer evaluations. (How should I grade group work?)Asking students to evaluate their own performance can help them develop insights into their learning and help them see the value of collaboration. (Petrulis) It also validates individual effort, self-reflection and growth, and encourages students to engage more fully. (Sullivan)

Asking students to grade themselves or their peers can be problematic because many students have not been taught how to do this. They may give very general responses or give inflated or uncritical results. (Sullivan) Therefore, self evaluation should be more than the submission of a simple mark. It should require the student to grade himself on various scales related to individual responsibilities, group participation, etc. The students should also be required to give evidence and rationale for the grades to encourage honest reflection. Some sample questions could be “Did you uphold your responsibilities to the group? If not, what prevented you from doing so? Describe the most interesting, creative, or risky parts of the group for you. What can you take with you form experiences in this class to group work in other environments? Have your attitudes, roles, or skills changed through being part of your group in this class? If so, how?” (How should I grade group work?, Petrulis, Sullivan) 

Some of the potential benefits of self and peer assessment are:
* Increased student ownership of learning.
* Provides increased incentive of team working – when grades are involved, students are far less likely to dismiss group work or become hostile toward group activities.
* Encourages active participation in the learning process by making assessment a shared activity.
* Promotes reflection and hence, potentially deeper understanding. As students become more conscious of the practice of group interaction, they also assume more control and responsibility for their successes and failures of their experiences.
* Increases opportunities for the teacher to monitor progress.
* Increases opportunity for the teacher to identify potential conflicts.

Because each method of assessment has advantages and disadvantages, perhaps the best approach is to use a combination of methods to assign grades. One suggestion might be to weight the assessment as follows: 20% individual assessment (based on an individual essay or exam question) , 20% teacher assessment (based on observation, attendance, and group journals), 20% group assessment (based on final project), 20% self assessment, and 20% peer evaluations. A combination approach also allows for more assurance that both the individual’s contributions and the group’s contributions will be accounted for. This can help alleviate student fears of being paired with less motivated students and losing control of their grades, and at the same time increase the motivation to work in a group setting.

Although there are difficulties with determining grading methods in group settings, instructors have developed productive ways to approach grading and also to allow students to become part of the teaching process.

{{question-answer|question=Which of these methods of group assessment would you use in your classroom and why?
|answer=I think that using the assessment methods in combination is the best approach. By taking the student’s individual work as well as the group’s work into consideration, most students would be more willing to work in this format. Also, I think it is important to get students involved in helping with the assessment through self evaluation and peer assessment. This can help them understand how grades are assigned and force them to critically evaluate their own performance as well as their peers. Also, when group members know that the other members will be commenting on their contributions, I think it motivates them to put forth better effort. Students can’t just pretend to be helping the group when the teacher walks by and expect to get a good grade. If they don’t contribute their part, the other members will definitely let the teacher know about it and it will affect their grades. I also think this helps students feel more in control of their learning. It aids them in understanding where their grade came from, instead of just getting a number back from the teacher without truly understanding the reasoning behind it. Using several methods of assessment allows for all aspects of group work to be considered, instead of focusing only on one part.
----
I am not a fan of group projects in general, but if I did decide that as a teacher I want to use a group project in my lesson I would chose the individual assessment, as well as the group assessment. As a perfectionist type person, I would want a separate grade to tell me how my work measures up. Group work in the form of jigsawing would be a separate grade. It is never fair to grade group work just on the output work produced. A fair teacher needs to be active in group projects, so that the teacher can see which students are actively participating and putting in good efforts for the project. I recently received a group project grade that completely did not reflect the amount of time that I put into the project. The grade reflected the final outcome, which included the one student in the group that completely did not care. This resulted in a bitterness towards the class, teacher, and other students. This is just one example of many that results from group projects, even on the college level. &amp;mdash;Jennifer Monokrousos}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What role should peer evaluation play in grading and course work?}}

In 2002 Kristja J. Falvo, a mother of three, sued the Owasso Independent School District in Oklahoma claiming that peer grading embarrasses her children as well as violates the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) after learning that some teachers were allowing the students to grade each others work and call the grades out loud. 

FERPA is a twenty six year old law that prohibits schools from disclosing a student’s educational record to any third party without parental consent. Falvo considered allowing the students to know the grades of others a violation of the privacy act. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, ruled that the common practice of peer evaluation does not violate the federal law. However, school districts may still decide to ban peer grading from their schools. (Simpson) Each school district would probably want to evaluate the pros and cons of peer grading before coming to a final decision.

==Pros Regarding Peer Evaluation==
There are many arguments supporting peer grading, not only for the student, but for the teacher as well. Many studies have been done to draw the following conclusions.

===Student Advantages===
Peer evaluation helps student in a variety of ways. It helps to sharpen their critical skills as well as their social responsibility. They are able to gain insight into some of the difficulties teachers come across when grading. Realizing what goes into the grading and evaluating process will help many students to understand and appreciate the grades that they have received as well as the people that gave them those grades. (Wilson)
Also, the practice of peer evaluation supports involvement of both right and left brains through personal application of knowledge. Not only do student get to exercise their own knowledge on a certain topic but as they review another person’s work or performance, they are forced to look at certain material through the eyes of another person as well. (McLeod)

According to Hoyt Wilson, peer rating have been found to be valid evaluators of student performance. This is an advantage to both the student doing evaluating and the student being evaluated. After children observe peer responses, whether to an assignment or to their behavior in class, there is a natural tendency for them to determine why such reactions occur. In some cases, this could help student be able to realize their weak points and work on fixing them. 

===Teacher Advantages===
Peer evaluation promotes a feeling of team learning between teachers and students. As the teacher is able to connect with the students on this level, it gives him or her a chance to 1. encourage students to contribute openly, 2. encourage sharing materials and resources, 3. promote expressing acceptance and support during interactions, and 4. point out rejecting and non supportive behaviors that hinder peer evaluation. (Ornstein) All of these lessons in peer evaluation go beyond the classroom and can help the students in group situations for the rest of their lives. Without the atmosphere that peer evaluation creates, the students would not be as receptive to these concepts.

==Cons Regarding Peer Evaluation==
Although many of the arguments in support of peer evaluation make it seem like a great addition to class work, there are still many people who believe that it is negative in the classroom for both students and teachers.

===Student Disadvantages===
{{Rquote|right|I think organization if better if the teacher tells me what to do. I think I do not like my neighbor to read my composition. I have many mistakes…my class friend will laugh.|Student involved in peer revising study in Hong Kong}}

For the student being evaluated there is, according to some, obvious disadvantages. For example, studies show that even if the peer evaluation is planned and controlled by the teacher, social relations will play a part. (Sengupta) Basically, students are more likely to give their friends a better grade than they deserve or give a worse grade to someone that they don’t like. Also, many students have complained about tough grading and unfair scores.

Some also argue that the whole peer evaluation process is a waste of time. Many students are busier figuring out easy ways to complete the evaluation sheet than evaluating the text. Also, even if an evaluator thoroughly read or evaluated a student’s performance, the person being evaluated will be selective when considering suggestions from peers. They usually rely on their own knowledge instead. (Sengupta) This defeats the purpose of the evaluation because the student is not going to notice the same things wrong with his or her assignment that a second party will notice; such as misspellings and grammar errors.

===Teacher Disadvantages===
In the past, by allowing students to grade one another’s assignments, there have been cases of plagiarism and copying. (McLeod) This is more concerned with grading assignments than evaluating performance, but it is still an issue for many teachers. 

Also, students are not always trustworthy of their peers. If a suggestion is given by a fellow student, it will probably be disregarded. However, if the same suggestion is given by the teacher, the student will take it into account. (Sengupta) This causes a problem for the teacher because it makes it that much harder to push the behaviors that make the peer evaluation process successful. 

==Bias==
Bias both occurs with the student and the teacher however it is particularly crucial when it comes time to peer evaluation and grading. First off evaluation and grading are two different things. A bias is much more damaging when grading is occurring. It is hard enough for teachers who have been trained for years to avoid bias, teaching students to put aside their own bias and differences when grading is much more difficult. A student could not like a fellow classmate and grade them poorly. A teacher must closely supervise peer editing to make sure it is a fair experience.
	
==Conclusion==
Looking at both the pros and cons of peer evaluation and grading in the classroom makes it easy to understand why there are people both supporting and rejecting it. However, just reading through the data will not help anyone come to a certain conclusion. The age and maturity of the children, the experience of the teacher, as well as the subject matter are all to be taken into consideration. Peer evaluation is a process in which trial and error is the only way to determine if it will work in a particular school district, or even a particular classroom.

{{question-answer|question=Choose a con of peer evaluation and discuss a way to resolve it.
|answer=One of the cons of peer evaluating is that students give grades and evaluations according to who their friends are. When having students grade each other's work, the teacher could mark out the names so that the evaluator would not know whose paper they had. This way, the student would be focused on the content of the assignment and not on the name at the top. When doing an evaluation of classroom behavior, send the students to different classes to observe and evaluate people that they don’t know. This would be effective because in a different classroom the student could focus on the performance of others without having to worry about the material being taught. They could give the teacher an unbiased observation of how the students behaved during class. Each class could take turns doing this throughout the year. Also, since students mostly worry about finding the easiest way to complete an evaluation sheet, the teacher could focus on thought provoking questions. This way, the student would have to put a lot of thought into the evaluation process so that they person being evaluated can have an idea of what others really think.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How have gender issues changed our views?}}

Students learn differently.  That is plain.  No one child learns the same way.  Classrooms must be as diverse in technique as they are in population.  A teacher must accommodate various needs and intricacies.  They must allot time for independent study as well as collaborative group work.  They need to cater to the visual learner and the auditory pupil; and they most certainly should be able to manage an array of behavioral situations.  Unfortunately, there is not a single fail-safe method or any one best-technique to employ across the board in classrooms.  For many teachers, the sticking point to a successful classroom is the latter.  One cannot teach if the environment is not conducive to learning.  So, what can be done to limit distraction and optimize instructional time?  

Adolescent psychology is associated with the notable changes in the behavior and characteristics of adolescents, cognitive, emotional and attitudinal changes take place during this period, which can be a cause of conflict on one hand and positive personality development on the other.  Due to the adolescents' experiencing various cognitive and physical changes, it is frequently notable that they start giving more importance to their friends, their peer group, and less to their parents/guardians, due to the aggregated influence of whom they might go on to indulge in activities not deemed as socially acceptable, although this may be more of a social phenomenon than a psychological one. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence#_note-1] 

==Gender as a Factor==
Ask any secondary teacher and they will tell you that a major factor in classroom behavior is male-female interaction.  This is social as well as academic; and can be both positive and negative.  
To begin, let it be known that prior to the 20th Century classrooms were typically segregated by gender.  This is due to post schooling societal roles.  That is, schools geared their students towards their social sector—females for the home and males for the work force.  There was simply no professional mobility for females and so they ‘needed’ different training than their male counterparts.  It was only in the 21st Century that gender segregated classrooms began to combine.  This, however, was due to deficiencies in educational funding not academic reform.  It seems that prior to the 20th Century the interest of the students was the focus.  It was understood that different populations needed different instruction.  There was no misconception that all students could be lumped into one classroom and be successful.  Unfortunately, like too often happens, economic interest took precedence over student interest. (Datnow, 2001). 

==Hormonal Havoc==
There is no doubt that gender roles have transformed in the past 100 years.  The professional sector is wide open for women and it is not uncommon for men to stay home.  Thus, the need is less post-education and more immediate.  As researcher, Heather Blair (1999), points out, “Adolescence is a critical time for the construction of gender identity, and often academic success can be jeopardized.  [For example,] it is at this point where many girls begin to lose confidence in themselves as learners…and begin to question their own knowledge and authority” (p. 6).   This is no secret.  Adolescence is an awkward point in anyone’s life.  One’s self image begins to develop.  One’s sexuality emerges and hormones surge.  Males and females often spend more time examining each other than they do their classwork or homework.  What would happen if this factor were eliminated?  Females could focus on their study rather than impressing the boy next to them and vice versa.  As a middle school teacher, I have witnessed acting out on behalf of both genders in order to impress the opposite sex.  It is like witnessing an awkward ritual; and it can lead to momentous disruption in instruction and learning. 

==Learning According to Gender==
As if adolescence was not a big enough obstacle for teachers, they must also navigate the different academic needs of both genders.  Educators must acknowledge the fact that '''the brain develops differently in either sex'''.  For girls, the area of the brain used for language development forms before the area used for geometry and spatial relations; in boys, it is the other way around.  Hence the stereotype that males are more skilled in math and sciences and lack in language skills.  
In a sense, this lends adolescent females to being more susceptible to emotions as the area of the brain used for language development is also used for processing emotions.  In boys, this may not be true.  One could suggest that '''the brain is just wired differently'''.  For many boys, it is extremely difficult to articulate how they “feel”.  

Some research also suggests that '''girls hear better'''. The hearing of a teenage girl is thought to be seven times more acute than that of a teenage boy.  This may contribute to how males and females respond different to instruction and verbal interaction.  
Also, '''girls and boys respond differently to stress.'''  This is true not only in the human species but in most mammals.   It has been found that some stress can enhance learning in males but hinder it in females (Sax, 2006). [http://www.whygendermatters.com]

According To Boy Brains, Girl Brains, An Article by Tyre, Peg in the Newsweek Magazine Moat Schools Are Girl Friendly, because the teachers, who are mostly women, teach the way they learn. So naturally a lot of things going on in the classroom, boys will not immediately be attracted to. A Whopping 70% of students who are diagnosed with learning disabilities are Male. Even 80% of High School Drop Outs Are Male. Shocking, Yet True. Also Less Than 45% of College Students Are Male. According To Gurian, To Change the Educational Gap, teachers should start changing their teaching techniques. Also they should take in consideration lighting classrooms more brightly for boys and speaking to them loudly, since research shows males don't see or hear as well as females. Boys are more-visual learners, so teachers should illustrate a story before writing it and use an overhead projector to practice reading and writing. As A Result of Changes presented by Gurian, Over 185 Public Schools Offer some form of single-sex education courses. To some experts, Gurian's approach is not only wrong but dangerous. Some say his curriculum is part of a long history of pseudoscience aimed at denying equal opportunities in education. For much of the 19th century, educators, backed by prominent scientists, cautioned that women were neurologically unable to withstand the rigors of higher education. A Professor at American University, Davis Sadker, Says, While it's true that brain scans show differences between boys and girls, , no one is exactly sure what those differences mean. According to Sadker, Differences between boys and girls are dwarfed by brain differences within each gender. Sadker States, if you want to make schools a better place, you have to strive to see kids as individuals.

In a poll conducted by USAToday in 2003, in 1,000 high schools polled in 26 states, it was revealed that:

84% of girls feel that it is important to extend their education past high school.  Only 67% of boys agreed.

70%  of  girls thought it was useful to do well in school to achieve life goals; only 57% of the boys felt the same. [http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2003-12-22-our-view_x.htm USAToday Poll]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

These numbers are consistent across the board.  These gaps in achievement rates are constant since 1998.  Thus, there is a clear trend that goes beyond any one teacher or school but is inherent in the educational needs of either gender.  This kind of data lends itself to the extremely controversial topic of gender segregated classrooms.

==The Single Gender Classroom==
===Advocates===
Groups are emerging who feel that both genders would benefit from having separate learning environments.  One particular researcher has listed the goals for both female and male students in their article, “Single-Sex Classrooms”.  On the part of the girls, the author lists increased confidence and self image, improved capability in math, science, technology and typically “male” subjects as goals.  Safety and freedom from harassment and bullying are also listed as objectives.  Finally, parents and educators hope to see an increase in focus on schoolwork.  For boys, the desire is to increase literacy focus and skills.  Also, there is a desire to improve the male view of education and the role they see it  playing in their future.  For many boys their deficiencies in literacy are causing them to fail out as these skills are the foundation for most core subjects.  Several districts across the coutry are launching pilot programs for single gender classrooms.  These districts show that the female population is making gains in areas previously dominated by male students.  (Blair, Heather)  Because researchers can pinpoint deficiencies that seem to be gender wide, it is thought that separate classrooms would provide opportunity to remedy these shortcomings.  Greater focus can be paid to methods that work best for certain groups of students. 

“If you don’t understand those differences and you teach boys and girls as if they were the same, the end result is a kindergarten classroom where the boys tell you drawing is for girls and a middle school classroom where girls tell you computers are for boys,” said Sax, one of the nation’s leading proponents of single-sex education. “If you don’t understand gender differences, you end up furthering gender stereotypes” (MSNBC NEWS). This article was chosen because it further explains why students benefit from single-sex classrooms. While opposers think that this is just discrimination in the classroom, this quotation from MSNBC states that these classrooms are not formed to discriminate but to enhance each student’s learning experience. If students are taught the same information, just in a way that they can better understand, this creates higher test scores and confidence in the student. This is not to be a competition among the sexes, but a learning tool to give each student, boy or girl, the most efficient learning experience possible. If creating a single-sex classroom will help accomplish that, then by all means it is worth a try. The teacher from this article explicitly states how it is easier for him to come to class better prepared specifically for “them”, meaning his all boys’ math class. The material is specifically geared towards everyone in the classroom, but just because the instruction may be different in a single-sex classroom, the goal for every student to succeed remains the same. 

===Opponents===
As stated previously, single-gender classrooms are extremely controversial.  Many in the education field feel as though research presented on behalf of single-gender classrooms is too new and often biased.  Many educators feel like smaller class sizes would be of greater benefit to students and teachers.  In this situation, individualized instruction is easier to give regardless of gender or student population.  Logically, this makes the most sense.  Fewer students mean fewer needs and more time.  Moreover, researchers worry that segregating students by gender would only promote gender bias and stereotypes.  Generally speaking, research shows that small coed rooms are ‘happier’ places. (Datnow, 2001)  

Splitting students by gender may be beneficial to the students, however what if is not? Categorizing males as one thing and females as another, when it comes to education, makes no logical sense. We should be focusing on other ways to improve the students’ educational background. For instance, why break the students up by gender shouldn’t we be focusing on splitting them up by learning styles? Like stated in Beloit Daily News, boys do not necessarily learn better while standing up while females preferred sitting.  

There are some potential unintended consequences that will be faced by teachers, parents and students.  One of the consequences that these students would face is the socialization skills of boys in girls.  If the boys and girls are separated, they will be less likely to play with one another during recess or associate with each other during lunch.  Girls are more likely than boys to engage in social alienation in which they exclude others from their social groups and make use of negative gossip about others (Cairns, Cairns, Neckerman, Ferguson, &amp; Gariepy, 1989; Crick &amp; Grotpeter, 1995). Exposure to these different behaviors and interaction styles may promote the development of different skills, behaviors, and learning styles (Huston &amp; Carpenter,1985; Leaper, 1994; Maccoby, 1990; Thorne &amp; Luria, 1986) (Martin and Fabes 433).  These students will not want to associate with one another and will only make friends with their gender.
Same gender classrooms face the issue of stereotyping.  Gender stereotyping, harassment and other problems common in co-educational schools do not necessarily disappear in single-sex schools, according to a major California study of the nation's largest experiment in public single-sex education.[http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/571/context/cover]  In some cases stereotyping gets worse.  This can be bad for the students because it gives them views about students that are not always true. 

==Conclusion==
Theories in education come and go in waves.  For better or worse, education is subject to trends.  It is impossible to say if one way is the best way.  There are too many variables to be conclusive.  Demographics in students population is a huge variable.  Not all students come from the same economic, social, or cultural background.  Also, not all teachers are qualified in the same areas, have the same strengths and weaknesses, or share the same beliefs.  Education is subject to individualized methods and practices.  It is not an exact science.  One must pinpoint the variable of most impact.  Is it economic background, ethnicity, or gender as some believe?  If gender is in fact the greatest factor in behavior and learning than single-gender classrooms may well be the answer.

{{question-answer|question=Based on information provided, do you think that gender is the variable of most impact in the classroom setting?  If so, why and how might this be addressed?  If not, what is and how should it be addressed?  
|answer=This article brings up some very important issues that relate to today's classroom and educational programs.  It was very interesting to learn about the different statistics and studies that prove that males and females learn and develop differently.  We live in a world that constantly points out the “weaker” sex and tries to make one gender appear inferior to the other.  Unfortunately, these kind of gendered differences are a normal part of our society and it may always be that way.  Consequently,  I do not think that classrooms should be segregated by sex because it would only yield the student’s socialization into our world.  School is a place for education and socialization, so if we were to separate genders in the classroom we would only be keeping students from reality.  

In my opinion, the real problem with today's classroom is the teacher-to-student ratio.  No one can fully benefit from a class that includes over 25 students.  Large class size makes it difficult for students to learn, it prevents one-on-one learning, and it stretches the teacher too thin.  I know there is no easy fix to this problem because of lack of funding and available teachers, but this should not discourage the fight.  We must remember that these students we are educating will be the future leaders of our generation, and we should prepare them to the best of our ability.
----
Gender plays a huge role in the classroom setting.  It affects the way students interact with other students and the way students interact with teachers.  For example, a male teacher cannot interact the same way with a female student that a female teacher may be able to, and vice versa.  More so, the way adolescents interact with each other can be very disruptive to the learning environment.  Often times, male students may compete for the attention of female students.  This may start as a comment or horseplay but end in a physical altercation.  Also, female students may find themselves dressing proactively or ignoring schoolwork in an effort to gain the attention of male students.  This kind of behavior may or may not be a distraction to others but certainly hinders the performance of said student.  Biologically, students of either gender may benefit from single gender classrooms as it eliminates these distractions and factors.  In essence, the teacher will not be competing with hormones.  Moreover, males learn better by using their hands and using manipulatives.  Female students do well using literacy skills.  Ideally, we would be able to match student needs with teacher’s strengths.  Ultimately, I believe moving straight to single-gender classrooms is extreme.  Perhaps, we could keep traditional classrooms but ensure they are gender balanced and have collaborative single gender groups within.  This would allow coeducation, but also encourage female and male students to support their own learning styles.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can class size act as a barrier to effective education?}}

Pupil-Teacher ratio and class size are two terms that educators often use as synonyms.  Other researchers prefer to distinguish between the two illustrating vast differences in data conclusions.  “Pupil teacher ratio is the number of students at a site divided by the number of teachers, staff, and/or adults at the site.  The divisor used in determining pupil-teacher ratio varies according to different definitions. […]  Class size is the number of students regularly in a teachers room” ([http://www.reduceclasssizenow.org/sa_articles/SA8.pdf a helpful link about student-teacher ratio]).  For the purpose of this paper and the information within, the definition of the pupil-teacher ratio will the number of students in a given classroom divided by the number of teachers in a given classroom, making the definition synonymous with class size.

==The Importance of a Smaller Class Size==
Through studies, statistics, and meta-analyses, it seems convincing that a smaller teacher to student ratio is beneficial.  With a smaller class size the teacher can develop a relationship with each of the students paying them individual attention and treating them as equals.    With smaller classes the teacher will have to spend less time on gaining control in the classroom (NEA: Class Size). This is extremely important in the public school system today because teachers must focus on meeting their requirements with SOLs.  With this extra time the instructor could introduce new and exciting material that not only relates to the class requirement, but is also fresh and enjoyable for the students.  Fewer students per teacher would make students feel safer socially and physically (NEA: Class Size).  Public schools have grown enormous because of our country’s exponential population growth and sometimes crowded hallways can be intimidating.  In a smaller classroom these students might feel at ease because of the familiarity of their classmates.  This comfort might also encourage students who are more reserved during class to participate during lessons without suffering the pressure of classmates.  Finally, a class with fewer students would give teachers fewer overall students and would allow for the chance of developing a relationship with the students’ parents.  In this scenario contact between teachers and parents would be less tense and it would eliminate the need for parent-teacher conferences.  This would also give the chance for teachers to update parents on the positive things their kids are doing rather than only notifying them about the negative behavior. 

==Past Research on Class Size==
The issue of pupil to student ratio has become extremely important during the Twentieth Century because of the increased social value of education.  During the Twentieth Century education has been much more accessible because of public school funding and has grown significantly because of immigration, integration, and the astounding growth in population.  Although the issue has become more important in recent times the idea was explored as far back as the late 1800s when J.M. Rice began a study of the topic (Porwoll).  “In a 1902 study, Rice concluded that there was no relationship between class size and student achievement” (Molnar).  Since then there have been other studies that have shown far different results.  In the 1950s Howard Blake did a study with conclusions showing that 16 out of 22 students responded positively to learning in a smaller class (Molnar). 

==Project STAR==
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;350px&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4rb7jPk1ek YouTube video: ad for class size reduction]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Project STAR (Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio) was a study conducted in Tennessee in reference to class sizes and how they affect the success of students.  The project began in 1985 as Kindergarteners were randomly selected and were placed in classes of about fifteen to represent a small class size, and about 22 to represent a regular class size.  The study was concluded in 1989 when the students finished the Third Grade, however, the results persisted.  

“By the end of the third grade, students in Project STAR who had been randomly assigned to small classes outperformed their counterparts by an average of 4.6 months of schooling in reading, 4.7 months of schooling in word study skills, and 2.8 months of schooling in math.  One year after the end of Project STAR, a follow-up study showed that fourth grade students who had formerly been in the small classes showed more initiative, participated more willingly, showed greater effort, and were more engaged in class and school activities than their counterparts who had been assigned to regular size classes during the Project STAR study” [http://www.reduceclasssizenow.org/sa_articles/SA4.pdf].
The effects of the small class instruction continued through middle and high school illustrating that the effected student could read at more than one grade level above their opposing group [http://www.reduceclasssizenow.org/sa_articles/SA4.pdf].

As the young adults entered high school they continued to retain results from their Kindergarten to Third grade education.  The students instructed in the smaller class were more likely to be enrolled in advanced classes, “graduate on time (72 percent of students, versus 66 percent from regular classes),” and graduate with an honors designation (NEA: Class Size).

==National Education Association (NEA)==
“The National Education Association (NEA), the nation's largest professional employee organization, is committed to advancing the cause of public education” (NEA: About NEA).  They support the reduction of class sizes and based on research funded by the Association, they recommend that the class size be 15 students and even smaller class sizes for students requiring extraordinary needs.  The NEA currently supports almost 50 bills in Congress and have funded educational research like Project STAR.

==Economic Impact of Smaller Class Size==
Like all things, the benefits of smaller Student-Teacher Ratios cost extra money.  With smaller class sizes, the demand for more teachers is inevitable and there along with the need of more classrooms in which they can teach.  “The United States began the decade of the 1980s with elementary and secondary school budget of about one-hundred fifty billion dollars or about seven-hundred fifty dollars for every person in the country” (School Class Size).  The money for public schools is allocated by the State Government’s budget which has not yet found extra for this proposal.  Project STAR alone cost twelve million dollars and the average teacher income for the 2004-2005 school year was almost fifty thousand dollars [http://www.aft.org/salary/index.htm].  Because of this budget problem the only alternative for small class instruction is home schooling or private schooling.  Private schools have fewer enrolled students in general and frequently the class sizes are below fifteen from pre-school through high school.

==Conclusion==
Small class instruction has proven to be successful and educators must strive to lower class sizes.  If this was accomplished qualified teachers could instruct in a smaller setting developing the students as individuals and continuing their success.  Fewer students in each class would make schools safer, more intimate and more concentrated.  

Often students feel neglected when they are not able to receive attention from their teacher.  If students are feeling “not good enough” to accomplish certain tasks  even though they are fully capable of doing so, it will drastically affect their grades and motivation to learn.  This is when the teacher has to come back into play and make sure each student is getting the attention that is necessary.  Clearly every student is different and some students do not want to be bothered with the teacher and others love to constantly have the teacher helping them.  If there are too many students in a classroom it is almost impossible for one teacher to make sure every student is satisfied and understanding his or her way of teaching.  Which is why the NEA is correct in supporting fewer students per classroom, to keep the learning on an uphill climb.

{{question-answer|question=What are the effects of having a lower Student-Teacher Ratio?
|answer=With fewer students per teacher teachers can focus more on student’s individual needs.  The teachers can pace themselves by the needs of the students.  Students will be more involved in the courses material.  During class discussion they will be more likely to share their opinion because of the fewer classmates.  The teachers will be able to have the chance to develop a personal relationship with their students parents, eliminating the need for parent-teacher conferences and keeping the parents informed.  With fewer students per teacher students will feel safer at school and will be given the opportunity to develop friendships amongst them.  Teachers will have greater control over their classes and be able to insert extracurricular activities into class time keeping kids interested and excited to learn.  Students will carry their intimate learning experiences with them beyond elementary and middle school and will continue to excel throughout high school and college.  With a smaller student to teacher ratio, schools will have to hire more teachers as well as more classes.  In turn, the Government must allocate billions of dollars to the public school system to pay for the newly added teachers and classrooms.  Overall, the lower student teacher ratio is very beneficial to the affected students.
----
There are several effects for having a lower student-teacher ratio. I believe that the students would be effected in a positive way in a smaller classroom. The teachers would be able to take more time with each student one on one and have a better relationship with each student.  The students would be more inclined on speaking up in class with answering or asking questions because of a smaller peer group to do it in front of. The teachers would be able to focus better on what they are teaching and their lessons instead of having as many students to try to keep quite or make sure they are listening and behaving.  The students would benefit from the closer relationships with the teachers and classmates and will be able to use that along their education experiences and life experiences.  Having smaller student-teacher ratios means that more teachers will have to be hired and paid, which in turn means more money for the government to put aside to go toward education.  But I personally believe that the education of our students is the future for this country and the government should want to put more money toward education to improve it. &amp;mdash;Julieann Murphy}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can families and schools better communicate?}}

It is hard to believe that in today’s world we have a breakdown in communication on any level.  We have the ability to be connected with each other 24 hours a day seven days a week.  Cell phones, pagers, and Internet are all devices we use on a daily basis to stay connected, so it is not surprising that   the communications between the families and the schools the children attend are in sync more than ever.  There is a real effort to include families into the school environment, and in some ways the programs the schools have for our children could not take place without the effort of the parents and guardians.  Communication with our children's  teachers is right at our fingertips, but without getting the information out to parents on how to access this information, it is a resource that is wasted.

==Staying in Touch==
{{Rquote|right|When parents are involved in their children's education, studies show that students generally have higher grades and test scores, and are more likely to go to college.|(pta.org)}}

It is important for those parents who may not be able to take time out of their busy lives to volunteer within the school to be able to communicate with the teachers and have information on what is going on in their children lives as well.  This has become extremely easy with the introduction of technology into our everyday lives.  Teachers are just a mouse click away. Parents are able to email directly to their child's teacher any time day or night, schools have direct voice mailbox for parents to leave messages for the teacher, and the use of cell phones for immediate contact.  No longer do we have to hear about a situation after the fact, but we now have the ability to know immediately.  As your child becomes older, they are less likely to bring home the everyday paper that has been graded.  The days of parents unaware of their child's progress until report cards is in the past.  Now, parents are able to access their child's grades using the Internet.  Parents are able to see what is going on within the school on Internet based School Web Sites and even have homework and daily announcements sent right to their home computers or hand-held devices.  Staying in touch with your children’s teacher and school has never been as easy or more accessible.  
Technology is not the only answer to keeping the communication lines only, School Systems across the nation are setting days on their yearly calendars for personal conferences. Our school system here in Virginia Beach, has devoted several days of teacher-parent conferences staggered throughout the year. This is where the teacher and parent can meet during the day, at a time convenient for both parties.  The meeting is spent discussing the progress the child is making.  They can talk of strategies and the teachers can give parents advice on what they need to work on at home in order to assist the student in making sure they stay up to date with their studies.  This allows the parents to meet the teacher and put a face and personality with a name.  The teacher in return is able to speak directly to the parent and form a relationship.  It gives the link needed to help the child succeed, as one principal of a school said, “In order to run an effective school, there has to be that link between the home and the school.  If you don’t have that link, you’re spinning your wheels.  You never make a dent in education unless the parents are involved.” (2007, The Record) Gone are the days of putting your child on the bus and seeing them when they arrive home at the end of the day.  Today’s schools encourage parents to become a familiar face inside the school.  

One problem however is the fact that not all parents have access to email, don't have cell phone or pagers and a lot of single parents work hours that make it almost impossible to come in for a conference unless it is planned well in advance. One way to overcome this is through SchoolCall. This system makes it simple for schools to report student absences to parents automatically, set up web interfaces that allow teachers to set up call groups, and even voicemail for faculty. This system should be taken a step further to allow calls to a teachers room to be forwarded to their home. This would allow parents who can't call during school hours to contact the teacher without the teacher's home phone number. Often these are the ones, single parents working crazy hours who need to be able to get in contact with teachers and can't always rely on the child to bring messages home, who need this access. While email and cell phones are great, they don't work for everyone and we as teachers need to be aware of this and find ways around this problem.

==Getting Involved==
Statistics show that there is a “positive and convincing relationship between family involvement and benefits for students, including improved academic achievement.” (Henderson and Mapp 2002).  When it has been shown to improve test scores with increased parental involvement schools, school boards and states have come up with ways to make sure that the parents have an opportunity to play a role in their child's education.  It is no longer just the teacher’s job to make sure your child is learning we are now in an age where the parent’s role has become increasingly important in the type of education your child is receiving. 

There are several major groups that play a large part in bridging the communication gap between parents and their children’s school.  The PTA has become a powerhouse for all individual schools over the past several years.  The PTA (Parent Teacher Association) is an organization on the front line of any school when it comes to parent participation.  It organizes volunteers who are responsible for in school and after-school programs that have branched out from carnivals and field days to educational programs such as math and science night.   In December 2003, a campaign was designed to “increase awareness of critical benefits of parental involvement and to provide parents with practical, easy ways to help their children succeed in school and in life.”  (pta.org) This advertising campaign is a tool that is used to inform parents that it is vital to become involved in their children's education. Directed by actor James Woods, the ad states that you must “Know what really matters, know about your kid’s school, and know about your kid” (pta.org) it follows with a phone number and web site that you could use to find your schools information on its PTA organization. One example of how far the PTA has come over the years is the Reflections Contest held every year.  The Reflections Contest is run by local PTA volunteers within each school, which bring together teachers and parents to entice students to enter into a contest displaying their talents in many categories such as music, art, poetry and drama. Winners are judged and chosen on a local, state and then national level and each year the students are able to compete to come up with the theme for the following year.  This is a great way families can become involved, work with and begin the process of communicating with the teachers and the school. 

Another organization is the School Planning Council.  This is made up of Administration, Teachers and Parents who meet together at the beginning of every school year to go over the curriculum.  This is a very important organization that allows parents to have a voice in what their child is learning. The opportunity to participate on the Council is offered to every parent of the school their child attends.  This is another bridge to enable parents to become involved with their children's education.

==Open Door Policy==
Today’s school has a variety of volunteer positions that enable parents to become a part of the school day.  This has come into play on a major scale with the “No Child Left Behind Act of 2001” (NCLB) Title I of NCLB (Section 1118) “outline requirements for schools, districts, and cites to create partnerships between parents and schools.  Under NCLB, schools are required to provide opportunities for parent involvement” (Vaden-Kiernan 2002-03) Teachers want you to come into the class and volunteer, they encourage parents to come in and help with all of the day to day activities and schools have begun opening their doors.  Parents can come into the class and help out with tasks that take up teacher’s instruction time.  For example, parents can help the teacher with copying papers, filing, and grading so that the instructional time for teachers will not be cut short with non-teaching tasks and enables the teacher to concentrate on teaching.
Principals play a vital role in allowing open door policies within the schools so that parent involvement is able to happen.  Principals give the face to the school as a friendly family environment.  If a parent feels wanted, it is more likely that they will want to return to that environment. And studies showed that it is possible that “higher parent involvement encourages schools to communicate better with parents.” (Vaden-Kiernan 2002-03)

==Conclusion==
Today’s school systems are finding a variety of ways to improve communication between parents and their schools.  Schools are improving parental information of how their child develops.  Schools are giving information pertaining to the developmental processes and the expectations of the child, according to grade level, through literature available to all parents.
Schools are keeping lines of communication open.  They are making teachers available and more accessible along with incorporating technology, which enables easier access for parents to communicate with their schools and encouraging parent involvement with an abundance of programs for parents to become involved.  Every child benefits when there is an established and comfortable line of communication between parents and the school.

{{question-answer|question=With the vast resources the school systems have to include parents in the children’s education, do you see any reason why a parent is unable to become involved and if so what would you do to help that parent?
|answer=During the past two years of teaching, I have met many parents who are unable to become actively involved in their child’s education.  Many parents because of their personal situation, such as divorce or economics (some work two jobs) do not have the time or energy to devote time to their child’s education.  For example, I have met a parent who is in a very lengthy custody battle.  She is always traveling to and from another state and it is very difficult for her to become actively involved.  I have given her my cell phone number, exchanged email addresses, and told her that she can contact me on the weekends if necessary.  She has made great strides in keeping in touch with me, but it has been difficult.  

In addition, I have given other parents my cell phone number and will call on weekends and during lunch at school to try and keep in contact with them and inform them of their child’s progress.  I have also (with their permission) called parents at work.   If their child is not doing well (which is the case for many of these students) I will tutor them after school twice a week or refer them to someone who can better help them such as a math/science teacher.  Contacting these parents takes a great deal of effort, however, it is vital to a student’s success in that they know that their teacher is making that extra effort. 

Many parents are unable to attend Parent/Teacher conferences since they work late hours so I will give them my cell phone number or email address.  They can contact me at their convenience.  I also let parents know that they can go to the library to access the Internet if they do not own a computer.  In addition, some students may be out of district so it is harder for the parent to come to school.  Some of these parents do not own a car and must take a bus.  For these parents, it is vital that I give them my cell phone number or email address.  I will send home letters or notes informing them of their child’s progress if I do not get a response from an email or a call. 

Unfortunately, there are those parents who just do not become involved with their child’s education at all.  These parents are very vocal in letting you know that it is your job to educate their child.  A few parents have even told me that they do not want to hear anything from their child’s school or teacher.  In a situation such as this, there is not much a teacher can do except to let the student know that you are always available to help them.  Therefore, it is extremely important that teachers give these students the extra support and guidance that they need. &amp;mdash;Janice Utt}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Should school districts implement school uniform policies?}}

To start off it is important to define what a school uniform actually is. Some schools have reverted to using the traditional catholic school looking uniform. This includes the nice dark pants with a white shirt for boys. For girls it includes a jumper and white shirt with a knee length skirt. The other option, the one that seems to be the most popular is a more casual approach. The more casual uniform is khakis or jeans with a set color for the shirts. Many schools are using the more casual approach because it makes sense financially. Many of these casual uniforms can be worn outside of school. 

The uniform discussion is a hot topic debate in education and one that more and more school districts are looking into – Should students be required to wear a school uniform? As school districts look for a quick fix to problems such as school violence, poor test scores, poor attendance, and substance abuse, they are considering school uniforms as a possible solution. 

Before a school district decides to take such a drastic step there are many important factors and questions it must consider. Is implementing a school uniform or strict dress code the solution to the school’s problems or just a temporary Band-aid that fails to address the true causes for youth violence? And do the potential gains earned from implementing a school uniform policy outweigh the obvious negative effects it will have on the students’ morale and sense of individuality? 

==Goals==
There are many reasons why the school district has been wanting to implement school uniforms. They have high hopes that wearing uniforms will dramatically help improve the focus on school. The first reason they want uniforms to go into effect is to reduce gang colors in schools. Many children grow up poor and in the ghettos. Gangs are not uncommon, even for young children. Simply wearing the wrong colors to school could lead to violence. Another reason for wearing uniforms is to prevent theft. Theft is not uncommon in any school these days. If kids were to wear uniforms, all the kids would dress the same. No single child would wear anything flashy or expensive. This drops the target rate for theft among shoes, and clothing. Another reasons uniforms could be helpful is for the simple fact of discipline. In today’s society children are wanting to dress like the stars on TV. The only issue is many of them are showing off too much skin. If all kids wore the same clothing there would not be the issue of determining what is too short, or showing too much. This leads us to the next reason. Especially during middle and high school when the students start to date and become interested in the opposite sex showing off too much skin could be a distraction. If a young lady wore a shirt that was too tight and a skirt that was too short it could distract some of them young men. They could lose focus on what they are learning. Another reason for uniforms is to instill a sense of “community” among the children. If all the kids are dressed alike there is no reason to feel that anyone is inferior. If a poor child and rich child went to the same school but they both wore the same uniforms who could tell the difference just by looking at the two? The last reason uniforms could be a good idea according to the school districts is a safety reason. If all the children are dressed alike it is very easy to spot out an intruder. This could play a huge role in safety issues when it comes to kidnappings or any scenario of that sort. 

Principals, parents, and students have noted a possible connection between school violence and the clothing students wear in school.  The fashion trends of today is largely dominated by students wearing gang-related clothing.  Gang members frequently roam the streets near inner-city schools.  The color of a students clothing can result in them becoming targets of violence.  Additionally, such clothing arose from the clothing style of inner-city gangs, who wore oversized shirts and baggy pants to hide weapons and drugs from the police.  Such clothing is glamorized in music videos and on television, but it can still be the means of transporting weapons or drugs onto school property and therefore increasing school violence.  Also, children’s desire to be fashionable brings another connection between clothing and violence.  Children may envy other children’s clothing, but lack the money to purchase similar styles.  Consequently, children have been violently injured or even murdered for their designer clothes, sneakers, or professional sport-team paraphernalia.  School uniforms may help to reduce these occurrences.  Many schools feel that uniforms would help schools more easily recognize intruders.  Other schools have implemented a mandatory dress code policy for both students and teachers, rather than adopting uniforms, because they believe students and teachers tend to act the way that they dress.

==The Long Beach Unified School District Uniform Initiative==
Those that argue for the effectiveness of school uniforms point to one case in particular, The Long Beach Unified School District Uniform Initiative in 1994. In that year the school district in Long Beach, California were the first to institute a mandatory dress code. School officials there say that since then, school crime has decreased by 76 percent, assaults committed on school property have dropped by 85 percent, incidents of school vandalism have decreased from more than 1,400 to less than 100 a year, and average attendance has reached an all-time high at nearly 95 percent (Starr).

The results of this particular case has led many school districts to follow the lead of Long Beach and implement their own mandatory school uniform policies. They look at the statistics in this case and come to the conclusion that school uniforms are an efficient deterrent against youth violence that also help boost attendance rates and test scores.

The case study done at Long Beach has also had its share of critics. Some suggest that other changes instituted to the school at the same time as the school uniform policy had more to do with the results of the Long Beach experiment. Experts such as Ray C. Rist, a professor of education and sociology at George Washington University, argues for the implications of the &quot;Hawthorne effect,&quot; which states that a group of people who are treated in a special way may behave differently because of that treatment. In other words, Long Beach students may behave better simply because they are the focus of so much attention. &quot;No one,&quot; says Rist, &quot;has ever been able to establish that uniforms, in and of themselves, can result in a dramatic reduction in crime&quot; (Starr).

==The Root of Youth Violence==
Proponents for school uniform policies argue that school uniforms are an effective deterrent against school violence. Dr. Alan Hilfer, senior psychologist in the Children's and Adolescent Unit at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn says, &quot;Uniforms do eliminate competition, pressure, and assaults perpetrated by older kids on younger kids for their sneakers and other possessions” (School Uniforms). But is forcing a student to wear a uniform really the solution to this problem? If a student is willing to assault another student for his or her sneakers, is forcing them to wear a uniform and look like everyone else, suddenly going to make them a non violent person that accepts life’s proper values?

The root of most youth violence is a result of students that come from dysfunctional households and forcing them to wear a uniform to school is not going to fix that problem. Reducing drug use, broken homes, out-of-wedlock births, gangs, poor schools and all the rest takes big money and big effort, not little gestures (Twomey). Instituting school uniform policies may seem like an easy and cheap solution to reducing youth violence but it hasn’t proven to be an effective one.

==School Uniforms: How Effective Are They?==
In a study published in The Journal of Educational Research, the authors concluded that requiring students to wear uniforms has no direct effect on substance abuse, behavioral problems, or school attendance. They found, in fact, that the students they studied who were required to wear uniforms actually scored lower on standardized achievement tests than did a comparable group not required to wear them (Brunsma, Rockquemore).

Critics of this research will still point to the case study in Long Beach and other school districts that reported positive results to installing school uniform policies. However, without accounting for other outside factors, it is impossible to know what true effects if any, school uniforms have on student’s behavior. Loren Siegel, director of public education for the American Civil Liberties Union says &quot;No empirical studies show that uniforms consistently produce positive changes in student behavior over the long run&quot; (Starr).

==Social Effect on Students==
When students are forced to wear the same school uniform as the rest of their peers and have their individuality taken away, what kind of message does that send to them? Students no longer are given the opportunity to express themselves creatively and be who they are. Instead they are being told they have to look like everyone else. We are trying to prepare students for the future world, and get them to start to think for themselves, but already we are taking one of their basic rights away. 

Many educators feel that forcing a uniform on students limits the choices they can exercise in this aspect of growing up, restricting their development both in school and later in life. If students feel uncomfortable and insecure in class because of their dress, they will be less receptive to learning due to their feelings of anger and embarrassment. As a result, they will be less likely to attend school, behave appropriately in class, pay attention to instruction, and perform at a higher level of achievement, which is what those in favor of school uniforms hope to improve (Caruso).

==Conclusion==
Rather than looking at for a quick and simple solution school districts should consider other factors when dealing with problems in schools. Many experts suggest that measures such as violence prevention courses, closer links between schools and local law enforcement agencies, smaller classes, better facilities, and tighter school security are much more effective than school uniforms in preventing school violence. And they warn that many school districts may see uniforms as an easy solution to a much more complicated problem (Starr). 

The fact is there is no substantial proof that school uniforms alter students’ behavior and improve test scores and if these problems want to be remedied, school districts should look at root problems. School uniforms may seem like an effective solution, but in the end the only thing they are proven to be effective in is suppressing individuality among students and lowering a child’s self-worth. Schools should be encouraging uniqueness among students and respecting their right to freedom of expression rather than taking that away.

{{question-answer|question=What are some of the arguments against implementing school uniform policies mentioned in this article?
|answer=The main argument against having uniforms in the school system is that having the children dress up in alike uniforms does not actually in reality solve any of the problems that many of us think it would. Also you mentioned that uniforms could limit or restrict an individual’s freedom of expression. Children will be children. It does not really make a difference if you are wearing the same clothes as everyone else. Yes, it may seem like a good idea but there are many downsides to this as well. You see kids will find a way to pick on other kids despite clothing issues. Most kids don’t make fun of their peers for their clothes, they make fun of them because they are fat, ugly, or say something “dumb.” Uniforms will not solve the issue of bullying that much, if any at all. If a kid wants to be a bully he or she will find a way regardless of clothing status. I think the most important factor here is that having kids wear the same uniform really does limit a child’s expression of freedom. Each child has his/her own personality. The way one dresses is a statement of individuality. That freedom should not be taken away. Part of growing up is making decisions. A child must learn to make decisions on the simplest things, even deciding what to wear. As trivial as this may seem, it does have a huge impact on the rest of their lives. A child must learn how to dress themselves and learn what is appropriate for every situation. The way a child dresses may possibly be one of their highlights to going to school. It is a way to creatively express how they feel, and what they like. Is it really fair to take away this right? 
----
One of the primary arguments against school uniforms is that it limits children's individuality by making them look like all of their peers.  We can all remember getting ready for the first day of school and taking great pains to pick out the perfect outfit.  Everyone wants to make an impression of their personal style on their peers.  The way students dress at school is often the biggest dividing line.  Appearance allows students to find friends with interests similar to their own.  When we first walk into school and see a group of students with polo shirts and khakis and another group of students wearing jeans and band t-shirts, we will automatically gravitate towards the group that is dressed similarly.  Perhaps this kind of individuality is just an easy way out.  Why not encourage students to use their personalities to identify themselves.  In this materialistic culture we live in, we tend to look to our belongings for meaning.  Perhaps school uniforms would allow students to look inward for their own development rather than constantly trying to stay in fashion.

Another argument against school uniforms is that they simply don't work the way their supposed to.  School uniforms are supposed to reduce bullying and stem the spread of gangs.  Obviously putting all of the kids in uniforms isn't going to stop these problems overnight.  However, limiting the students' choice of clothing might be beneficial.  There would no longer be a dividing line between those with fashionable clothes and those without.  I can still remember a student from my high school who always wore sweat pants and t-shirts to school.  He was ridiculed for his choice of clothing, but perhaps he simply could not afford more elaborate clothes.  Perhaps he simply enjoyed being comfortable.  Whatever the case, the fact that this young man was teased for his choice is a tragedy.

Finally, the financial issue.  One responder to this essay question claimed that the public school system would have to supply these uniforms in order to enforce the policy.  This is simply untrue.  In many Newport News Public Schools, there is a casual uniform policy.  The parents are able to opt out of the uniform code if they wish, but the students are unable to participate in some activities if they are out of uniform.  The uniforms are not a financial problem as the requirements are very simple.  A plain colored polo shirt and slacks.  These are items available in mass quantities at any thrift shop.  If uniforms are chosen with this sort of practicality in mind, the financial strain on buying school clothes can actually be reduced. &amp;mdash;Brian Foster

Despite what proponents may claim, there is no factual evidence that implementing a school uniform policy has any positive effect on classroom behavior and student attendance. To deal with problems such as student misconduct and poor attendance, you have to get to the root of the problem and forcing students to wear school uniforms, is just looking for an easy solution.

One thing we do know is that forcing the students to wear school uniforms takes away their individuality which causes some to feel insecure in class. School uniforms can have many other negative social effects on the students as they feel uncomfortable in class which leads to feelings of anger and embarrassment. This makes students less receptive in class which causes students to be less likely to want to attend school, pay attention in class, or strive to do well academically. &amp;mdash;Sabrina Lee

The school uniform policy has been an ongoing argument for many years.  There are many good reasonable arguments supporting the idea of making school uniforms mandatory.  However, there are also many logical arguments against this policy, as well.
Those supporting uniforms argue that mandatory dress eliminates competition, pressure, and bullying.  Uniforms could very well help these situations, however, most likely they will not tackle the issues, for dress is not usually the cause of these problems.  Another idea is that uniforms will help bring a more positive school environment overall.  However, in reality, dress has not helped raise test scores, reduce drug and alcohol abuse, or raise school attendance.  These two elements do not correlate together.  All in all, making uniforms mandatory eliminates student’s ability to be creative.  Everyone expresses their own uniqueness and style through their dress.   Uniforms give a sense of likeness and forces everyone to be alike, when everyone has always taught students to be different and stand out.   In today’s society, creativity is the driving force for many things and making uniforms mandatory blocks student’s creativity early on in life. &amp;mdash;Christina Wells
----
There are several arguments against school uniforms presented in this article.  The main argument is that having all students wear the same clothes does not really solve any of the problems proponents of the uniforms think they do.  For example, will enforcing school uniforms stop students from bullying each other or stop violence in schools?  Even when students look the same by their clothing, they are still very different.  Kids will find something to pick on a student about no matter what they have on.  There will still be short kids, overweight kids, and ugly kids.  Honestly, I would rather be picked on for what I have on than a personal trait I can’t change.  

Also, uniforms limit individuality and eliminate freedom of expression.  We have standardized our educational content so much, that we should at least allow students the ability to express themselves (within limits) as to how they dress.  Uniforms give the impression that everyone should be the same and act the same.  Wouldn’t the world be boring if this were really the case?

One thing that wasn’t mentioned in the article is cost.  For the public school system, the schools would have to provide the uniforms in order to enforce the rule.  I believe there are many more important things that our schools need to spend money on than uniforms. &amp;mdash;Kendra McPherson
----
A school enforcing a uniform policy to help lower gang violence and other assaults is outrageous in my opinion.  The people that are going to steal, bully, and physically harm others while in school are going to do these things regardless of whether or not they are wearing khakis and a white polo.  Implementing a school uniform and demanding student’s follow the dress code is detrimental to the student's unique personality and sense of individuality.  In a classroom full of peers dressed identically, I would feel my right to reveal my creativity had been taken away.  Many children choose to dress differently from others based on their feelings that standing out and showing their true identity can be exposed through clothing, piercings, and hair styles.  We are each individual human beings with different thoughts, needs, and emotions so how is it possible to wear the same type of clothing and suddenly hide our many differences?  Some of the arguments mentioned in this article against implementing a school uniform policy include tighter school security and a smaller amount of students in the classroom to prevent violence rather than taking away the right to wear what you want.  I agree school violence has to decrease; however, school uniforms are not the change we need. &amp;mdash;Rachel Landreth}}

{{Rquote|right|Once a new technology rolls over you,&lt;br /&gt;if you're not part of the steamroller,&lt;br /&gt;you're part of the road.|Steward Brand}}

Little Johnny comes home from his third grade class with a note that he needs signed by his mom because he failed this week’s States and Capitals quiz. He knows that his mom is going to be furious; but, he cannot seem to remember all 50 states and their capitals, even though he studied the list and maps for two hours the night before the quiz. Finally, after several minutes of hiding in the downstairs playroom, he confronts his mom and asks her to sign the note. Johnny thought she was going to be furious; however, she instead went into the living room and came back with a DVD case. She told him to use the downstairs playroom DVD player to watch the show over and over again until he can remember all of the states and their capitals. Reluctantly, Johnny returned to the playroom to watch the DVD. Sadly, he feared his sanctuary had become a torture chamber for his mom’s cruel and unusual punishment. Two hours later, he came back up to the kitchen, singing a catchy song about all the states and their capitals. The next week, Johnny came home with an A+ on his States and Capitals Test. Johnny had learned all of the states and their capitals in less than two hours thanks to a unique form of teaching called edutainment. Edutainment is defined by Merriam-Webster as entertainment (as by games, films, or shows) that is designed to be educational. With that said, what exactly is edutainment? More importantly, what is the role of edutainment in a classroom? 

==You Say Education, I Say Edutainment==
Edutainment is any form of entertainment that is educational. It can be a show that teaches the order of the planets or a video game that teaches rapid typing skills. Most teachers already use edutainment, whether it is watching an old video or film reel or using a new SmartBoard, or electronic, interactive, blackboard. A teacher can hook up a SmartBoard to a computer so that it will display PowerPoint presentations, quick videos, or even full-length films. A teacher can also use a SmartBoard to show a class how they proof read a paper. The students can see everything the teacher does as he or she proof reads the paper.

Repetitive tasks can become dulling on the student's mind. Education need not just be writing definitions and reading endless sections. Edutainment gives a change of pace as well as an opportunity for the student to enjoy learning. Students can become engaged in the subject and have motivation for learning and memorizing new information. Writing a “Know-Learn-Want to Know” (KWL) doesn’t help the students if they fill it out every time they start a new section.

===Cut! ...It Out, Seriously===
A very common form of edutainment, that has been used since the invention of film, is educational movies. While some can be interesting and fun to watch, most tend to be dreary and boring. The movies that require the student to be interactive tend to be in the “good movie” pile, while movies that have the same narrator drone on about WWII and its effects on the Middle East are moved to the “bad movie” pile.

Edutainment is supposed to be entertaining. A black and white film portraying a culture that is many decades old is no longer interesting. However, a host dressed in a funny-looking lab coat that makes cheesy remarks about the molding process can teach more science in thirty minutes than the students have learned all week. A poorly-drawn cartoon that sings about words that connect ideas, phrases, and clauses, uses a catchy tune that stays with you for life. My mother, to this day, can still be caught singing “Conjunction, junction, what’s your function?” while folding laundry or surfing the web.

How likely is it that a student is going to remember the industrial revolution after watching low-quality, black-and-white film about factors that led to the revolutionary era? A lot less likely than if they watched a film where other students their age acted like adults during the industrial revolution, if it were to happen in today’s society.

Let's &quot;cut&quot; out the boring old films of yesteryear. If we want students to learn anything from videos, it won’t be from the ones I watched when I was a kid.

===The World of Gaming===
Video games are another form of edutainment. The educational video game market has been steadily increasing over the last five years (Simon Egenfeldt-Nielsen, 2007). This past year alone has seen a great deal of edutainment games similar to some original edutainment games like Brain Age and Big Brain Academy by Nintendo. In Brain Age, kids and adults perform simple tasks such as, adding numbers in quick succession, reading comprehensively, and telling how much time has past on a analog clock, among other tasks, to give your brain a “workout” and determine a relative age for their brain’s reflex ability, the younger – the more reflexive. Big Brain Academy focuses on five categories: think, memorize, analyze, compute, and identify. When the game starts, activities are completed at a fast pace and in quick succession to determine your &quot;brain weight&quot;, areas of strengths and weaknesses, and which occupation or famous personality best compares to your brain weight score. The faster and more accurate you complete the activities the &quot;heavier&quot; your brain weighs (Nintendo, 2007).

Video games that fall in the educational genre are not the only video games that can be labeled as educational. Most video games require the player to think critically. In strategy games, you handle resources and personnel to achieve a specific objective. This can teach the player about basic economic principles. In fact, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro offer an economics class for college credits that is a full-fledged video game, simply called ECON 201. Through the challenges the game presents, students learn to deal with economic principles that range from scarcity to sustainable growth. ECON 201 also integrates a variety of interdisciplinary subjects that go beyond economics – such as biology, history and anthropology. For example, students must make ethical decisions as they play the game. They can, when poor actions call for it, face disease outbreak. They can also review historical examples of how the earth faced similar problems before, and apply the researched information to how they will fix their current problem (UNCG.edu, 2007).

A lot of games are being engineered to include an aspect of learning. Reid R. Frazier wrote, “Instead, Marinelli [Don, Director or Etcetera] and other faculty at ETC [Etcetera] want video games to teach, inform and inspire thought.” He also pointed out that games are being engineered specifically to teach. “Students at the ETC have designed games that simulate hazardous material spills for emergency workers, interactive theater for children with life-threatening illnesses and museum displays that teach American history. Current projects include games designed to teach negotiating skills to Girl Scouts and immunology to junior high students.” Edutainment in the form of gaming is on the rise.

===Physical Edutainment: Joining the Dance Dance Revolution===
Imagine walking into the gym and hearing “OK kids, it’s time to exercise, so get off your butts and turn on the video games!” Yes, video game edutainment has even infiltrated the ranks of Health &amp; Physical Education. West Virginia, which has been saddled with the unenviable title of having the worst childhood obesity rate in the nation, has purchased and placed Konami's wildly popular Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) video game in every single one of its public schools after a 24 week study found that overweight/obese students using the game regularly halted weight gain, were healthier, more confident, and more willing to try other exercises. (''Dancing video game...''2007) The DDR game pad is about 3ft x 3ft square and has pressure sensitive arrows on it. To score points, players must step/dance on the pad in rhythm to the corresponding arrows scrolling on the game screen.  In the wake of West Virginia's pioneering use of video games in the &quot;battle of the bulge,&quot; insurance giant Kaiser Permanente released a free health video game, &quot;The Amazing Food Detective,&quot; which can be found at http://members.kaiserpermanente.org/redirects/landingpages/afd/ . The game teaches about healthy lifestyles and shuts off after 20 minutes of play, and will not let a player log back in for at least an hour. (''Video game teaches kids about diet...''2007)

==Classroom Implementation==
But, how can a teacher implement edutainment into an average classroom setting? Although some teaching should be left to books, pencils, and paper, any teacher can implement fun edutainment into the average classroom setting, even if just for a change a pace. Teachers can assign analytical assignments for video games already played at home, research good websites for educational games online, or even motivate students by planning a field trip to a LAN (Local Area Network) center for a team building day. Video games do not have to just teach history, math, science, or english to be educational. Video games can also teach art, music, social skills, team work, strategy, and planning, among other skills used in everyday life.

Teachers can encourage their students to write descriptive paragraphs about the video games they play at home (Hutchinson 2007). The teacher can ask the students to review the games they play in their “off-time” for valuable educational material. This asks the students the think critically and be analytical. For example, the student can take the average Mario Brother’s game (the premise being to run right and jump when needed) and turn it into a lesson about timing, patience, and motivation.

Teachers also have the option to research the World Wide Web for online games that can be played in the computer lab at school. FunBrain.com, for instance, caters to many age groups and subjects. It has a math-focused board game, Sudoku, and fun-to-read stories. It even has a Mad-Libs section that focuses on parts of speech! Students can have fun with out even knowing they are actually fine-tuning their brains.

Something that is a little different, however, completely workable, is scheduling a field trip to a LAN center. A LAN center is a building where many computers are hooked up, or networked, in order to specifically play together. Students would be motivated by the trip for the same reasons they are motivated to go on any other field trip- just to leave the school building. There are many angles from which to promote a LAN center field trip. Many LAN centers already have games to pick from to be played on a LAN (Local Area Network), the hard part will be picking a game appropriate to the skill or subject you are attempting to teach. Team Building is always an easy, but good, skill to work on in a LAN center. Many of the games require strategy, alliances, tact, and timing. However, teachers would have the option to have the class play Oregon Trail if they so desired.

==Game Over==
Let’s face it, edutainment is being integrated into culture. The best way to approach the catchy form of teaching is through direct embrace. Become a developer of new ideas to implement video games and other forms of edutainment into the classroom. Encourage students to seek edutainment outside of the classroom!  Invite a comical guest speaker to get the students interested in a new subject. Comedy is still considered a form of entertainment!

While it’s a ways off from implementation, hand-held systems today have many games that warm the brain up for intense absorption. There are also games that increase focus, teach and practice methods for memorization, and lay the foundation for organization. One game for the Nintendo DS asks the player to visit at least five times a week in order to keep the brain “young.” This will help students learn to keep a schedule.

Education has its pros and cons. The pros speak for themselves. The cons… are the time and effort needed to achieve even the slightest amount of success in education. A lot of subjects can become boring rather quickly. Edutainment allows all the boring time and effort spent on education to be turned into a fun experience that will leave you singing, “The leg bone’s connected to the knee bone,” that is right, you said knee bone.

{{question-answer|question=Why do you think comedy is or isn’t a good form of edutainment? Cite your proof with examples from the section.
|answer=I think comedy is a good form of edutainment. Rarely do you see people sleeping at a good comedian’s show. Throwing comedy into education lets the students have fun and learn at the same time! Personally, I can remember all the funny, quirky teachers I had, their names, and a lot of what they taught me that year. Comedy causes smiling and smiling just…sticks with a person.

In Section 2.4 there are several references to comedy being a good form of edutainment. In Cut! …it out, seriously, the writer refers to Bill Nye the Science guy and how is quirky behavior helps teach students concepts of science. Even in the closing paragraphs the writer refers to  comedy as &quot;a form of entertainment.&quot;

Comedy is a very good form of edutainment. The students are interested in hearing the jokes, and the way educational comedy is usually structured, the student has to understand the concept before the joke is funny. It’s a win-win situation!
----
I think comedy is a great form of edutainment. In some cases, sensitive subjects that need to be addressed are delivered better through comedy than any other medium. I am an Elementary/Middle school Health and P.E. teacher, and the number one issue I have to deal with is the crisis of proper diet among American children. I say &quot;proper diet&quot; because this phrase covers the two extremes of obesity and eating disorders. These are both sensitive subjects that deal directly with a child’s self esteem, which in turn can affect their entire life, not just their academic performance. I happened upon a goldmine of comedic edutainment dealing with both of these issues in episodes of two extremely popular Disney Channel shows: &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; and &quot;That's So Raven.&quot; The &quot;That's So Raven&quot; episode deals with eating disorders among models (and of course the runway gets trashed in true comedic form). &quot;The Suite Life...&quot; episode follows an overweight chef and a youngster battling a sugar addiction, and in a separate storyline follows two teen girls; one overeating because someone called her skinny and one starving herself because she was called fat, all to get ready for a modeling show (that of course gets trashed, but with a twist, when the curtain comes down, the antagonist is caught stuffing her bra with tissue). By screening these episodes for Health class and putting a comedic face on a very serious issue, the students are more apt to internalize and “get the message.” It’s a great tool.  As mentioned in the “Let’s cut it out” section of the article, &quot;Let's 'cut' out the boring old films of yesteryear. If we want students to learn anything from videos, it won’t be from the ones I watched when I was a kid.&quot; &amp;mdash;Mike Hancock }}

== A conversion engine doesn't work ==

First, check if you installed conversion engines you want to use.  With &lt;code&gt;uim-sh&lt;/code&gt;, you can see the list of conversion engines you installed:
 $ '''uim-sh'''
 uim&gt; '''installed-im-list'''

or

 $ '''uim-sh'''
 uim&gt; '''installed-im-module-list'''

You can make use of the -e option in uim-sh if you are using ''uim'' 1.5 or later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uim.googlecode.com/svn/tags/uim-1.5.0-alpha/NEWS uim 1.5.0-alpha release NEWS]&lt;/ref&gt;
 $ uim-sh -e installed-im-list
 $ uim-sh -e installed-im-module-list

If you can't find engines you want to use, install them.

Second, check if the engines are enabled. You can do it with uim-sh:
 $ '''uim-sh'''
 uim&gt; '''enabled-im-list'''

or (''uim'' 1.5 or later)
 $ uim-sh -e enabled-im-list

You can also use a GUI tool (&lt;code&gt;uim-pref-gtk&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uim-pref-qt&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;uim-pref-qt4&lt;/code&gt;):
 $ uim-pref-gtk
&quot;Global settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Input method deployment&quot; -&gt; &quot;Enabled input methods&quot; -&gt; &quot;Edit...&quot;

Third, if you want to use Canna, Sj3 or Wnn, check if cannaserver, sj3server or jserver is running respectively.

 $ ps aux | grep cannaserver # Canna
 $ ps aux | grep sj3server   # Sj3
 $ ps aux | grep jserver     # Wnn

== Uim doesn't work with an application ==

First, check if required bridges are installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/uim/wiki/WhatsUIM What's uim?]&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;uim-xim&lt;/code&gt;: X applications
* &lt;code&gt;uim-gtk&lt;/code&gt;: GTK+ applications, including GNOME applications
* &lt;code&gt;uim-qt3&lt;/code&gt;: Qt 3 (or earlier) applications, including KDE 3 applications
* &lt;code&gt;uim-qt4&lt;/code&gt;: Qt 4 applications, including KDE 4 applications
* &lt;code&gt;uim-fep&lt;/code&gt;: consoles
* &lt;code&gt;uim.el&lt;/code&gt;: Emacs

In some distributions, &lt;code&gt;uim-qt&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;uim-qt3&lt;/code&gt;. In others, it means &lt;code&gt;uim-qt4&lt;/code&gt;.

X applications include GTK+ and Qt applications and you can use &lt;code&gt;uim-xim&lt;/code&gt; to input in GTK+ and Qt applications, but using &lt;code&gt;uim-xim&lt;/code&gt; isn't recommended because &lt;code&gt;uim-xim&lt;/code&gt; has many limitations compared with &lt;code&gt;uim-gtk&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uim-qt3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uim-qt4&lt;/code&gt;. 

Some X applications don't use GTK+ or Qt. You need to install &lt;code&gt;uim-xim&lt;/code&gt; to input in such applications. 

You can check if &lt;code&gt;uim-xim&lt;/code&gt; is running as follows:
 $ ps aux | grep uim-xim

If &lt;code&gt;uim-xim&lt;/code&gt; isn't running, run it:
 $ uim-xim &amp;

If the GTK+ immodule (&lt;code&gt;uim-gtk&lt;/code&gt;) causes GTK+ application crashes or it doesn't work, try to force ''uim'' to use XIM in GTK+ applications:
 $ GTK_IM_MODULE=xim firefox # force ''uim'' to use XIM in Firefox

If the Qt immodule (&lt;code&gt;uim-qt3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uim-qt4&lt;/code&gt;) causes Qt application crashes or it doesn't work, try to force ''uim'' to use XIM in Qt applications:
 $ QT_IM_MODULE=xim opera # force ''uim'' to use XIM in Opera

Forcing ''uim'' to use XIM in GTK+ or Qt applications is not a true fix but just a workaround. If you notice a bug in &lt;code&gt;uim-gtk&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uim-qt3&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;uim-qt4&lt;/code&gt;, report it to the [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ freedesktop.org bugzilla], mailto:uim-en@googlegroups.com (English) or mailto:uim-ja@googlegroups.com (Japanese).

Second, check your environment variables:&lt;ref name=&quot;system&quot;&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/uim/wiki/UIMSystemConfiguration System Configuration for uim]&lt;/ref&gt;
 $ '''echo $XMODIFIERS'''
 @im=uim
 $ '''echo $GTK_IM_MODULE'''
 uim
 $ '''echo $QT_IM_MODULE'''
 uim

If these environment variables aren't correctly set, see [[Uim/Setup]].

Third, check what conversion engine you are using. You can use an IM switcher or a toolbar to do it:
 $ uim-toolbar-gtk

You may want to specify a default conversion engine:&lt;ref name=&quot;system&quot; /&gt;
 $ uim-pref-gtk

&quot;Global settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Input method deployment&quot; -&gt; &quot;Specify default IM&quot; (Check) -&gt; &quot;Default input method&quot;

For GTK+ applications, see also [[#Uim doesn't work with GTK+|Uim doesn't work with GTK+]].

== Uim doesn't work with GTK+  ==

If you can use ''uim'' everywhere except in GTK+ applications, the problem lies most likely with the GTK immodule. You will need to:

:1. Run the following commands:
  $ gtk-query-immodules-2.0 &gt; /tmp/gtk.immodules.current
  $ diff -u /tmp/gtk.immodules.current $(locate gtk.immodules | grep gtk-2.0) &gt; /tmp/gtk.immodules.diff
:2. Send the following files and information to mailto:uim-en@googlegroups.com
::* &lt;code&gt;/tmp/gtk.immodules.current&lt;/code&gt;
::* &lt;code&gt;/tmp/gtk.immodules.diff&lt;/code&gt;
::* Your OS distribution and version

== Last resort ==

If you have tried everything in the book and nothing helps you can always:
# Remove all ''uim''-related packages (''uim'', dictionaries, GTK+ and Qt).
# Reboot
# Reinstall
This is, naturally, a lousy solution to any problem and it is impossible to predict its effectiveness, but we shouldn't complain if it gets the job done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A Basic XHTML Document==
====File Extension====
A user can still use the standard '''.html''' or '''.htm''' extension, but now the user can use the following:
*'''.xhtml'''
*'''.xht'''
*'''.html'''
*'''.htm'''
You can use any of these for all the XHTML standards.

====XML Declaration====
It is a good idea to begin all XHTML, or indeed any XML application, with an XML declaration.  XML declarations explicitly state which version of XML and which character encoding we are going to use.  For example, if we wanted to use XML 1.0 with Western European character encoding, our XML declaration might look something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that if no XML declaration is stated, the document is assumed to be XML 1.0 with UTF-8 character encoding.

====Doctype Declaration====
Your XHTML isn't valid unless it has a doctype.  Doctypes are actually SGML statements which tell the browser what version of XHTML you are using.  For example, to let the UA know that we want our markup to be served as XHTML 1.0 Strict, we need only input the following:

&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; 
     &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

====Tags and Elements====
XHTML uses tags. Tags are pieces of text enclosed in less-than (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;) and greater-than (&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) signs. An example of a tag in XHTML is the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, in which all XHTML documents are enclosed. In XHTML, all tags should be in lower case.

Tags are composed of the tag name and the attributes. The tag name determines the type of tag, and the tag attributes give more information about the tag. For example, in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, used mainly to make links, the &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; attribute is used to say where those links should go. A hyper-link to http://www.wikibooks.org would be written as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikibooks.org/&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Tags are useless unless they are part of an element, or a tag with information between an opening tag and a closing tag. A link to http://www.wikibooks.org with the text &quot;Wikibooks&quot; written inside of it would be written as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikibooks.org/&quot;&amp;gt;Wikibooks&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. That comes out to [http://www.wikibooks.org/ Wikibooks]. The closing tag is the same as the opening tag except it starts with a slash (/) and doesn't repeat the attributes.

Elements can be nested. That means that there can be elements that are completely inside another element. An example of this would be 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikibooks.org/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span id=&quot;wikibooks&quot;&amp;gt;Wikibooks.org&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

You'll learn what the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag does later.

====A Sample Document====
As I said before, the document starts with an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;code&gt; tag. The document also ends with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. These two tags and everything in between are referred to as an &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element. Two elements must be nested inside the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element: the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element and the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. Of course, other elements may be nested or sub-nested within these elements.

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is, for now, only to house the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. The title is put between the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; begin and end tags. So the overall syntax of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is, for a title of &quot;Wikibooks&quot;:

 &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;
     WikiBooks
   &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;

Of course, this cannot be in a &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; file alone, but making this into a complete XHTML file isn't much more work. As I already said, you have to put an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag around the whole thing. But you also need a place for the content. Hence, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is put within  the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. For now, we'll just put text within the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. The text will show up in most browsers in Times New Roman 12-point font and wrapped around the screen. Any kind of whitespace will show up as one space. So here's a sample XHTML document with the title &quot;Wikibooks&quot; and the content &quot;Wikibooks is a great website.&quot;:

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;?&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html 
   PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot;
   &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &amp;lt;html &lt;nowiki&gt;xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;
       Wikibooks
     &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
       Wikibooks is a great website.
     &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first line is the doctype. This tells the browser what type of document the file is. All valid HTML and XHTML documents have a doctype. We will be using the XHTML 1.0 Strict doctype.

'''Jasminum nudiflorum''' or '''Winter Jasmine''', is a slender, deciduous shrub native to China. It is grown for its winter flowers and nice, &quot;waterfall&quot; habit.

==Description==
It has arching green shoots and opposite, pinnate, dark green leaves.  Each leaf is divided into three oval-oblong leaflets which are about 3 cm long. The solitary flowers have six petals and are bright yellow, about 1 cm across, appearing in the leaf axils.

==Ecology==

&lt;!--distribution, invasiveness, reproduction, etc.--&gt;

==Culture and Use==
Winter Jasmine likes full sun or partial shade and is hardy. In cooler climates, it is often grown so that it cascades over stone walls, which helps provide reflected heat and allow the plant to bloom on cooler days.

It tolerates hard pruning and should be pruned in spring immediately after flowering, regular pruning will help to prevent bare patches. This species of Jasmine can be grown as a [[../Bonsai|bonsai]].

It is easily propagated by [[../Layering|layering]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Media Types==
===XHTML as XHTML===
The recommend [[w:MIME|media type]] for XHTML is &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt;; ideally, this would serve XHTML as XHTML.  As of 31 December 2006, only Gecko and Presto based layout engines (Firefox and Opera respectively) support this media type.  To have your XHTML read as XHTML, save your markup with an &lt;code&gt;.xht&lt;/code&gt; file extension.

====Best Practices for serving XHTML as XHTML====
In addition to conformation to all of the rules of XML, we strongly recommend that you adhere to the following practices when serving XHTML as XHTML:

*An XML stylesheet PI (processing instruction) is recommended for associating external stylesheets:
&lt;div style=&quot;border: #7777FF solid 1px; text-align: left; padding:5px; clear: both; background-color: #DDDDFF&quot;&gt;Rather than this:
&lt;div style=&quot;border: #7777FF solid 1px; text-align: left; padding:5px; clear: both; background-color: #FFFFFF;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/mystyle.css&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;XHTML as XHTML should include this: 
&lt;div style=&quot;border: #7777FF solid 1px; text-align: left; padding:5px; clear: both; background-color: #FFFFFF;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;?xml-stylesheet type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/mystyle.css&quot;?&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;?xml-stylesheet type=&quot;text/xsl&quot; href=&quot;/mystyle.xsl&quot;?&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

===XHTML as XML===
A secondary media type for XHTML is the generic XML media type, &lt;code&gt;application/xml&lt;/code&gt;.   This media type is supported by most layout engines, including Gecko, Presto, Web Core, KHTML, and even Trident, though only two--Gecko and Presto--serve it as XHTML; the rest serve it as XML, which could result in several quirks.  That said, this is the media type of choice for cross-compatibility.  Serving XHTML as XML has the benefit of XML parsing, meaning that, unlike &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; which serves XHTML as HTML, there will be no conflicts between XML syntax and XHTML syntax, since they are both the same.  To have your XHTML read as XML, save your markup with an &lt;code&gt;.xml&lt;/code&gt; file extension.

====Best Practices for serving XHTML as XML====
In addition to conformation to all of the rules of XML, we strongly recommend that you adhere to the following practices when serving XHTML as XML:
*We encourage all authors to set a charset parameter through a higher level protocol (this can be done with a scripting language like PHP).  If you are unable to go that route (and even if you are), you should define your character encoding via XML declaration:
&lt;div style=&quot;border: #7777FF solid 1px; text-align: left; padding:5px; clear: both; background-color: #DDDDFF&quot;&gt;Rather than this:
&lt;div style=&quot;border: #7777FF solid 1px; text-align: left; padding:5px; clear: both; background-color: #FFFFFF;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;XHTML as XML should include this: 
&lt;div style=&quot;border: #7777FF solid 1px; text-align: left; padding:5px; clear: both; background-color: #FFFFFF;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

===XHTML as HTML===
A third option is serving XHTML as HTML via &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt;.  This essentially defeats most purposes of programming with XHTML, since HTML is neither subjected to XML parsing nor extensible.  Further, the only way to write valid XHTML as HTML is to adhere to the rules of both languages--even when those rules conflict with each other (such as  those pertaining to empty elements).  Finally, HTML rules apply for DOM scripting and stylesheets.

Before serving XHTML as HTML, we encourage you to examine the purposes of doing so.  Some questions worth asking might include the following:  Do I want to take advantage of the extensibility of XML?  Do I want to my markup to be parsed as XML?  Am I going to take advantage of XSL stylesheets?  If the answer to all of those questions is no, then HTML 4.01 may be the way to go.  However, if you have your heart set on serving XHTML as HTML, XHTML 1.0 Transitional does technically allow for it.  To have your XHTML read as HTML, save your markup with an &lt;code&gt;.htm&lt;/code&gt; file extension and be sure your DTD is XHTML 1.0 Transitional.

==Content Negotiation==
For the purposes of XHTML, content negotiation is the practice of serving one media type to certain layout engines, while serving another to others via embedded scripting languages (Javascript, PHP).  The difference between using content negotiation and simply serving XHTML with a &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; media type is that content negotiation often (though not necessarily) serves HTML as HTML as opposed to XHTML as HTML.  In other words, depending on the UA (user agent), a peek at the source code would reveal either an HTML DTD or XHTML DTD, an XML declaration or a Content-type meta tag, an XML stylesheet PI or a linked one.  This means that with judicious scripting, one could author valid XHTML without regard to the rules of HTML and take advantage of the extensibility and efficient processing of XML for supporting layout engines while authoring valid HTML (sans aforementioned extensibility, processing) for other layout engines using much of the same markup.

==Media Types and Layout Engines==

====Presto media type notes====
# &lt;tt id=&quot;presto_xml&quot;&gt;application/xml&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; In order to recieve the benefits of XML processing in Presto-based layout engines (such as Opera or Opera Mini or Opera Mobile), one must use an XSL stylesheet to transform the XHTML into XML. [http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq#ie].

====WebCore media type notes====
# &lt;tt id=&quot;webcore_xhtml&quot;&gt;application/xhtml+xml, application/xml, text/xml&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; HTML entities and custom entities defined by custom DTD are not recognized.

====KHTML media type notes====
# &lt;tt id=&quot;khtml_xhtml&quot;&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; KHTML supports this media type, but processes the document as HTML.
# &lt;tt id=&quot;khtml_xml&quot;&gt;application/xml, text/xml&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; HTML entities and custom entities defined by custom DTD are not recognized.

====iCab media type notes====
# &lt;tt id=&quot;icab_application-xhtml-xml&quot;&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; Type selector in CSS is matched case-insensitively.

==XML Parsing==
Save two copies of the following document, one as badlyFormed.html and one as badlyFormed.xhtml.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Not well-formed&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An XHTML-compliant browser should refuse to render any part of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; well-formed&lt;/i&gt;.
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

According to the XML specification, on which the XHTML specification is based, a compliant browser should refuse to render any part of the document. Instead it should return an error message. Open badlyFormed.xhtml. You should get an error message similar to this one:

&lt;pre&gt;
XML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. Expected: &lt;/i&gt;.
Location: file:///D:/Practice/XHTML/BadlyFormed.xhtml
Line Number 8, Column 35:

  &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; well-formed&lt;/i&gt;.
----------------------------------^
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you don't get an error message then either the MIME type is set incorrectly or your browser is non-compliant. Microsoft Internet Explorer, version 7.0 and lower, is non-compliant. Mozilla Firefox is compliant (at least from version 1.0 upwards, possibly in earlier versions).

Using Firefox you can check the MIME type for the page. From the Tools menu select the Page Info option. Three lines down on the General tab is 'Type:'. The type for badlyFormed.xhtml should be &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt;. If it isn't you don't have the extension &lt;code&gt;.xhtml&lt;/code&gt; mapped to &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt;. 

Now try opening badlyFormed.html with Firefox. The page will probably be displayed, contrary to the XHTML specification. Check the MIME type. It should be &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt;. This means that Firefox parses the document as HTML not XHTML. Web browsers normally display HTML regardless of any errors on the page, so the page is rendered.

'''Tarsonemidae''' is a family of mites, also called the thread-footed mites or tarsonemid mites.
Only a limited number tarsonemid genera, [[../Steneotarsonemeus/]], [[../Polyphagotarsonemus/]], [[../Phytonemus/]], [[../Floridotarsonemus/]] and [[../Tarsonemus/]], are known to feed on higher plants while most species in this family feed on the thin-walled mycelia of fungi or possibly algal bodies (Jeppson, 1975). Even among the plant-feeding tarsonemid mites, most are confined to areas of new growth where cell walls are thin and therefore easily pierced.  However two species (broad mite and cyclamen mite) are able to feed on older leaves because of their ability to inject toxins during feeding (presumably of salivary gland origin) causing an increase of thin walled cells surrounding feeding sites (Jeppson, 1975). This proliferation of new growth often results in leaves that appear stunted, puckered and twisted (Jeppson, 1975). 

While little pest management research has been done on the majority of tarsonemid species, comprehensive studies have been made into the biological and chemical control of the cyclamen mite and the broad mite. Chemical trials demonstrated that [[../Endosulfan/]] and [[../Dicofol/]] consistently reduced densities of P. latus and P. pallidus (Rai, et. al, 2004, Sterk, et. al, 1997), and planting stock can be effectively decontaminated through fumigation with [[../Methyl bromide/]] or [[../Ethylene dibromide/]] (Jeppson, 1975). Three entomogenous fungi, ''[[../Beauveria bassiana/]]'', ''[[../Metarhizium anisopliae/]]'', and Paecilomyces fumosoroseus, can effectively manage broad mite infestations, with B. bassiana providing the greatest reduction (Nugroho, 2004). Predatory phytoseiid mites, in the genus Neoseiulus, can also successfully control P. latus and P. pallidus under greenhouse and field conditions (Croft, et. all, 1998, Weintraub, et. al 2003).

==Moving things from wikipedia==
Hello! Thanks for helping build the garden book. Please keep in mind that when we copy things from wikipedia, it's important to move the contribution history as well, since this is required by our copyrights. 

If you'd like any other pages brought over, please just list it on [[WB:RFI]], and someone will import it for you. I'll import the wikipedia article on Poinsettia now and just merge it in. 

There's also some templates used in the gardening books that are quite useful in organizing the chapters. I'll apply those as well... leave me a note on my talk and I'll walk you through the other templates. Again, thanks for contributing! I hope the garden book will get very large over the coming months and years :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

[[Image:Red_locust_with_Metarhizium.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Red locusts killed by ''M. anisopliae'' var. ''acridum'' during a biological control campaign. Notice the green coat of spores on the insects.]]
''Metarhizium anisopliae'' (also known as ''Entomophthora anisopliae'' in the early 1900s) was named after the insect species it was originally isolated from, the beetle ''Anisoplia austriaca''.  It is a fungus that grows naturally in soils throughout the world and causes disease in various insects by acting as a parasite; it thus belongs to the entomopathogenic fungi. It is a mitosporic fungus with asexual reproduction for which a teleomorph has not yet been discovered. ''Cordyceps taii'' was shown to be the teleomorph of ''Metarhizium taii'', so it seems likely that the one of ''M. anisopliae'' will also turn out to be a ''Cordyceps'' species. However, it is also possible that some, if not most, strains of ''M. anisopliae'' have lost the capability of reproducing sexually.

==Uses==
'''''Metarhizium anisopliae''''' is being used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as [[../Grasshoppers/]], [[../Termites/]], [[../Thrips/]], etc. and its use in the control of malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation.

==Action==
The disease caused by the fungus is called '''green muscardine disease''' because of the green color of its spores. When these mitotic (asexual) spores (properly called conidia) of the fungus come into contact with the body of an insect host, they germinate and the hyphae that emerge penetrate the cuticle. The fungus then develops inside the body eventually killing the insect after a few days; this lethal effect is very likely aided by the production of insecticidal cyclic peptides (destruxins). The cuticle of the cadaver often becomes red. If the ambient humidity is high enough, a white mold then grows on the cadaver that soon turns green as spores are produced. 

==Application==
The microscopic spores are typically sprayed on affected areas; the plan for malaria control is to coat mosquito nets or cotton sheets attached to the wall with them. The level of insect control (mortality) in general depends on factors like the number of spores applied against the insect host, the fungus strain used, the formulation and weather conditions. Oil-based formulations allow the application of fungal spores under dry conditions.

==Precautions==
The fungus does not appear to infect humans or other animals and is considered safe as an insecticide.

==Resistance==
Most insects living near the soil have evolved natural defenses against entomopathogenic fungi like ''M. anisopliae''. This fungus is therefore locked in an evolutionary battle to overcome these defenses, which has led to a large number of strains that are adapted to certain groups of insects. Some strains are so specific that they have attained variety status, like ''Metarhizium anisopliae'' var. ''acridum'', which almost exclusively infects grasshoppers in the suborder Caelifera of the Orthoptera.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The hardest problem to overcome when trying to build a fire in wet weather is finding dry fuel.  Even in the wettest weather, dry fuel can be found by splitting open a log and taking the wood from the center of it.  You can get both your kindling and your fuel from this source.  Another place to find dry fuel is on the underside of dead branches - especially those still on a tree.

Before you begin gathering your fuel, you will need to set up a dry place to store it as you collect it. A tarp can be used for this if you lay it out on the ground, place the wood on it, and fold the tarp over it.  This will keep the wood off the wet ground and keep rain off it as well.  If it is windy, you should place a few rocks on top to hold down the tarp.

Once you have your fuel, you can begin gathering tinder.  If you have some with you, you're good to go, but remember, that because your kindling may be slightly wet, you will need more than the usual amount of tinder.  If you need to collect it, there are still several options for finding some.  Milkweed seed pods are fairly waterproof, and the fibers inside are pretty easy to ignite.  Pocket lint is another possibility, but you may have difficulty getting enough of it to light your kindling.  You can also make wood shavings from the same wood you're using as kindling.  If available, birch bark can be lit even when wet.

Once you have your fuel, kindling, and tinder, you are ready to lay the fire.  This is done as with any other fire.  You may wish to place a tea candle in the tinder pile as well, as this will help keep things going long enough for the kindling to catch.

Once your fire is lit and the fuel is burning, you can lay wet logs next to the fire to dry them out before trying to use them.  The heat from a good hot fire can drive the moisture out of even the wettest logs.  You may need to turn them over periodically to dry all sides.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

=Torte=

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] semi-sweet [[Cookbook:Chocolate Chips|chocolate chips]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], separated
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

===Topping===

* chocolate glaze
* caramel sauce
* chocolate curls, if desired
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]] [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecans]]


==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|325°F]].
# Grease a 9x3-inch springform pan.
# Heat chocolate chips and margarine in a two-quart saucepan over medium heat until chocolate chips are melted; cool 5 minutes.
# Stir in flour until smooth.
# Stir in egg yolks until well blended.
# [[cookbook:Beat|Beat]] [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg whites]] in large bowl on high speed until foamy.
# Beat in sugar, 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] at a time until soft peaks form.
# Fold chocolate mixture into egg whites.
# Spread in greased a 9x3-inch springform pan.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] for 35-40 minutes or until top of cake appears dry and cracked; cool 10 minutes.
# Run knife along side of cake to loosen, remove side of pan. Cook cake completely.
# Place on serving plate.
# Spread top of cake with chocolate glaze; drizzle with caramel sauce.
# [[Cookbook:Garnish|Garnish]] with chocolate curls and pecans.

=Chocolate Glaze=

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] unsweetened [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]]
* 5 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]] [[Cookbook:Boil|boil]]

==Procedure==

# Heat chocolate and margarine over low heat until melted.
# Blend in powdered sugar and water until smooth.
# Stir in additional boiling water, ½ teaspoon at a time, until of drizzling consistency.
''Makes about ½ cup glaze.''


=Caramel Sauce=

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] packed [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Cream|heavy whipping cream]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]

==Procedure==

# Heat all ingredients to [[Cookbook:Boil|boiling]] over medium heat, stirring constantly, reduce heat to low.
# [[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] uncovered for 5 minutes.
''Makes about 1¾ cup sauce.''

=Easy Chocolate Curls=

==Procedure==
The curls will be easier to make if the chocolate is slightly warm, so let the chocolate stand in a warm place for about 15 minutes before making curls. Semi-sweet chocolate can be used, but the curls will be small. Also, the thicker the bar of chocolate, the larger your curls will be.

#Place a bar or block of [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] on waxed paper. Make chocolate curls by pulling a [[Cookbook:Vegetable Peeler|vegetable peeler]] toward you across the flattest side of the chocolate, pressing firmly in long, thin strokes. Small curls can be made by using the side of the chocolate bar.
#Transfer each curl carefully with a toothpick to wax-lined [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] or directly onto frosted cake, pie or other dessert.

= Blackburne Shilling Gambit =
===3...Nd4===
Black violates an opening principle and moves again his knight. It may be tempting for White to take the now unprotected pawn with [[/4. Nxe5/]] but after 4...Qg5, White is in trouble (though 5. Bxf7+ remains playable). To maintain an advantage, White can play [[/4. Nxd4/]], [[/4. c3/]] or [[/4. O-O/]].

= Hungarian Defence =

This defence is seldom seen, but has a reputation of being solid. Its aim is to defend against an eventual queen exchange and against a pawn storm on the king side.

Whites best choice is to attack the center with [[/4. d4/]]. [[/4. O-O/]] is also an option, despite being a bit passive.

== Overview ==

'''''Year-end exams''''' are exams taken at the end of the Hogwarts school year in order to test the students' progress and, sometimes, determine the student's courses the next year, and the magical career they will follow in years to come.

== Event Details ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Exams actually take place at the end of the Spring Term, generally putting them in the first week of June, though in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], they end on June 24th. It is quite likely that this is a special case, because of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] which occurs that year. Exams typically occupy a week, Monday to Friday, and there can be two exams a day for each student, plus the Astronomy exam at midnight. With only eleven slots for exams, a practical maximum number of courses for the usual student is eleven.

Summer term, which occupies the last three weeks of June usually, is much more relaxed than the usual school year. The time is used by the teachers to prepare grades and mark exams.

Passing and failing grades are never explicitly mentioned. It is likely that the scale used for marking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWLs]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWTs]] is not used for regular exams, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] have to explain the O/E/A/P/D/T grade levels used in OWLs to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], when they have been at Hogwarts for some time already; and Hermione thinks the twins are pulling her leg about there being a grade &quot;T for Troll&quot;.

Hermione, several times in the series, manages to seriously disconcert Harry and Ron by presenting them with &quot;revision&quot; (study) schedules, generally far before they are prepared to start studying for the year-end exams. Hermione, of course, excels at these exams, and is repeatedly the top of the class.

There are not year-end exams for all characters every year. In the fifth and seventh years, for instance, there are OWL and NEWT exams instead. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], much to Hermione's dismay, the entire school is excused from year-end exams in the celebration following Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]'s return from the Chamber. In ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]], as school champions, are excused from the year-end exams. And in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], the entire school is again excused from exams in the wake of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Death|death of Dumbledore]].

== Notable Consequences ==

One of the major issues for Harry is that, each year he is at Hogwarts, some major event is coming to a head right at the end of the year, as exams are either looming or in progress. As such, the exams may get short shrift, or there may be inadequate preparation on Harry's part for the exams. However, Harry still manages to pass all his courses, usually with significant help from Hermione, who is consistently at the top of the class.

The specific issues that Harry faces as he comes into the year-end exams are:
* ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'': Harry's belief that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], with help from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], is about to retrieve the Stone and, with its help, return to life and try again to kill Harry;
* ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'': The apparent opening of the Chamber, which has put an air of fear throughout the school and culminates in the abduction of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]];
* ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'': the re-appearance of the murderer [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who Harry has been told was the wizard who betrayed his parents to the Dark Lord;
* ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'': though excused from exams, Harry had to face the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]], which would be a practical test of his spell-casting abilities;
* ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'': regular exams are replaced by OWL exams, which are interrupted by the attack on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], and by Voldemort's efforts to lure Harry into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]
* ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'': Harry is convinced that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] is plotting something, and is meeting a stony response from Dumbledore, so feels he must investigate by himself. The Horcrux hunt which takes place immediately before exams is also a distraction.

It is interesting, perhaps, to note that in his six years of attendance at Hogwarts, Harry sits year-end exams in only his first and third years, and OWLs in his fifth year. This could lead us to wonder how large a sample Hermione was working from when she said, in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', that Harry had the highest scores in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]].

== Analysis ==

As the books are written to each cover one school year, the end of the book will almost always coincide with the end of the school year. As the climax of a book must come near the end, the climactic battles or events will of necessity fall at the end of the school year, exactly when exams would be held. It is interesting to note how the author combines the heightened tension due to the approaching exams with the heightened tensions due to the other events that Harry is dealing with.

By and large, though, year-end exams are not a particularly important part of our story. Critical as they are for the normal Hogwarts student, it is apparent that Harry is not typical in his school career. In the first, second, and third years, the primary purpose of the exams seems to be to show us Hermione's determination to do well academically; she prepares revision (study) schedules for herself two months or more in advance of the exams, pesters Harry and Ron to follow the schedules she has made up for them, and goes over the tests repeatedly afterward, until Ron, in exasperation, tells her to &quot;give it a rest.&quot; In book 4, now that we know how much Hermione agonizes over her exams, the fact that she willingly gives up her study time to drill Harry in the jinxes he will need for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] is a stronger indicator than nearly anything else the author could use of the depths of Hermione's friendship, and her concern for Harry's progress. And in the sixth year, Harry's concentration on the lessons he receives from Dumbledore, and on other events transpiring around the school, seems to make him largely oblivious to the oncoming exams.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is necessary to include exams in the books, as there are always exams at school. However, as mentioned above, they are generally a distraction from the story line, or simply used as a device to heighten tension. The fact that Harry does reasonably well on his exams is mentioned in passing in his first year, and then never again, though Hermione's ongoing position at the top of their class is mentioned repeatedly. One gathers that the exams are included as a necessary part of the school year, rather than being particularly useful to the narrative.

== Overview ==

The '''''Goblet of Fire''''' is &quot;a large, roughly-hewn wooden cup&quot;, &quot;full to the brim with dancing blue-white flames&quot;, kept in an ornamental casket.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], in his introduction to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], said that selection of the Champions to represent each school would be done by an &quot;impartial judge&quot;. The Goblet of Fire is that judge; those who wish the chance to compete place their names in the Goblet, and at the start time (which is apparently Hallowe'en), the Goblet selects one person from each school by returning one name from each school.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]], four Champions are selected, apparently giving Hogwarts two shots at the championship. At the time, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] reminds everyone there that the Goblet is a &quot;powerful magical artifact,&quot; far beyond the ability of a fourth-year student to alter, and suggests that the only way that could have happened would be if someone had hoodwinked the Goblet into believing that there were four schools competing, and then entering [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s name as the sole competitor from this fictional fourth school. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Karkaroff]], the Headmaster of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], demands that the names be re-submitted, but is told that the Goblet has extinguished itself and will not re-ignite until it is time for the next Tournament.

# During the hiatus in the Triwizard Tournament, did the Goblet ignite every five years and wait, flaming patiently, for submissions?

== What is the European Union? ==

The [[w:European Union|European Union]] is a supranational group of '''28 countries''' in Europe, and was initially formed in the
1950's.  Originally it was called the Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the first countries were France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.  In 1973 the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark joined followed by Greece in 1981.  In 1986 Spain and Portugal joined and later Finland, Sweden and Austria in 1995.  In May 2004, 10 countries joined at the same time: Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus.  The most recent new members were Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 and Croatia in 2014.

These countries trade with each other in a common market, meaning that goods can be sold and bought freely across the union.  People can also live and work (with some restrictions) in any EU country if they are an EU citizen.  Member countries also have some common laws derived from decisions made by the union.  Each country in the EU also elects politicians to a European Parliament which helps make and decide what common goals the union should pursue.  Fifteen countries in the European Union also share a common currency: the [[w:Euro|Euro]].

[[Image:European Union as a single entity.svg|thumb|200px|right|Map showing all of the countries of the European Union]]

== Which countries are in the EU? ==

There are 28 countries in the EU which has a population of around '''500 million''' and the largest economy in the world.

The members are (in order of when they joined): France, Italy, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, United Kingdom, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Finland, Sweden, Austria, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta, Cyprus, Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia.

Macedonia, Turkey, Montenegro, Serbia and Iceland are applicant countries who wish to join the European Union in the future.  

== Which countries use the euro? ==

Seventeen of the twenty-seven EU member countries use the '''euro''' as their currency: France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia and Latvia. All other members (except the United Kingdom and Denmark) are obliged by the 1992 Maastricht Treaty to adopt the euro at some point in the future. 

In addition, a few smaller countries which are not part of the EU also use the euro: Vatican City, San Marino, Monaco, Andorra, Montenegro and the province of Kosovo in Serbia.

== Which countries have &quot;open borders&quot;? ==
[[File:Schengenzone.svg|thumb|200px|right|Schengen Countries, no borders (in dark blue and light blue)]]

The '''Schengen Agreement''' was signed by many countries in Europe (including some which are not part of the EU).  Countries which have singed up to this agreement have no border controls between similar countries.  This means that you can travel from Portugal to Spain to France to Germany to Poland to Lithuania to Latvia to Estonia and Finland (several thousand kilometres) and you don't need to stop at borders, show passports.

The following countries have singed the agreement and removed border controls: Portugal, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Iceland (not part of the EU), Sweden, Norway (not part of the EU), Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland (not part of the EU), Italy, Malta, Slovenia, Hungary and Greece.  Liechtenstein  will join at the end of 2011.  The only EU countries where passports are still needed are the United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria.

[[Image:Cooked_mussels_DSC09244.JPG|thumb|300px|Cooked [[mussel]]s]]
'''Shellfish''' is a culinary term for aquatic animals that are not fish, mammals, or reptiles, that are used as food; generally, mollusks, crustaceans, and echinoderms. Both salt-water and freshwater invertebrates are considered shellfish. Mollusks commonly used as food include the [[cookbook:clam|clam]], [[cookbook:mussel|mussel]], [[cookbook:oyster|oyster]], [[cookbook:Periwinkle|winkle]], and [[cookbook:scallop|scallop]]. Some crustaceans commonly eaten are the [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp and prawn]], [[cookbook:lobster|lobster]], [[cookbook:crayfish|crayfish]], and [[cookbook:crab|crab]]. Echinoderms are not eaten as commonly as molluscs and crustaceans. In [[cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asia]], [[cookbook:sea cucumber|sea cucumber]] and [[cookbook:sea urchin|sea urchin]]s are eaten. Edible cephalopods such as [[cookbook:squid|squid]], [[cookbook:octopus|octopus]], and [[cookbook:cuttlefish|cuttlefish]] and terrestrial [[cookbook:snail|snail]]s, though all molluscs, are sometimes considered to be shellfish and sometimes not.

The term ''finfish'' is sometimes used to distinguish ordinary (vertebrate) [[cookbook:fish|fish]] from shellfish.

==Usage in various cuisines==

Shellfish dishes are a feature of all the [[cookbook:cuisines|cuisines]] of the world, with a few exceptions.

Lobster in particular is a great delicacy in the [[cookbook:cuisine of the United States|United States]], where families in the north-east region make them into the centerpiece of a [[cookbook:New England clam bake|clam bake]], usually for a special occasion. Lobsters are eaten on much of the East Coast; the American lobster ranges from [[cookbook:Cuisine of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] down to about the Carolinas, but is most often associated with Maine. A typical meal involves [[cookbook:boiling|boiling]] the lobster with some slight seasoning and then serving with drawn [[cookbook:butter|butter]], [[cookbook:baked potato|baked potato]], and [[cookbook:corn on the cob|corn on the cob]].

Clamming is done both commercially and recreationally along the North-east coastline of America. Various type of clams are incorporated into the [[cookbook:New England cuisine|cuisine of New England]]. Notable is the soft-shelled clam, which is eaten [[cookbook:fried|fried]] or [[cookbook:steaming|steamed]], where they are called 'steamers.' Many types of clams can be used for [[cookbook:clam chowder|clam chowder]], but [[cookbook:quahog|quahog]]s, a hard shelled clam also know as a chowder clam, are often used because the long cooking time softens its tougher meat.

The Chesapeake Bay and Maryland region has generally been associated more with crabs, but in recent years the area has been trying to reduce its catch of [[cookbook:blue crab|blue crab]]s as wild populations have been depleted.  This has not, however, stemmed the demand: Maryland style [[cookbook:crabcake|crabcake]]s are still a well known treat in crabhouses all over the bay, though the catch now comes from points farther south.

In the [[cookbook:Southeastern cuisine|South-east]], and particularly the gulf states, shrimping is an important industry. Copious amounts of shrimp are harvested each year in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean to satisfy a national demand for shrimp. Locally, prawns and shrimp are often [[cookbook:deep fried|deep fried]]; in the [[cookbook:Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] and [[cookbook:Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] kitchens of Louisiana, shrimp and prawns are a common addition to traditional recipes like [[cookbook:jambalaya|jambalaya]] and certain [[cookbook:stew|stew]]s. Crayfish are a well known and much eaten delicacy here, often boiled in huge pots and heavily spiced.

In many major cities with active fishing ports, raw oyster bars are also a feature of shellfish consumption. When served freshly shucked (opened) and iced, one may find a liquid inside the shell, called the liqueur. This is a primary feature of the raw bar, and should be sampled, if not enjoyed. Some believe that oysters have the properties of an aphrodisiac. &quot;[[cookbook:Rocky Mountain oyster|Rocky Mountain oysters]]&quot; is a euphemism for [[cookbook:beef|bull]] testicles, as their appearance and preparation is similar. 

[[cookbook:Jewish cuisine|Jewish]] [[cookbook:Kosher|Kosher Law]] traditions forbid the eating of shellfish, as do some interpretations of [[cookbook:Islamic dietary laws|Islamic dietary laws]]. A rational basis taken up by some non-religious people is the tendency of some shellfish to feed on waste or accumulate heavy metals or toxins in their tissues. Another is that some of these dishes are consumed raw (oysters, mussels, clams and shrimp, most notably) and have the potential to cause serious illness from shellfish poisoning. Some people suffer from potentially-fatal allergies to shellfish. 

In [[cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]], chefs often use shellfish and their [[cookbook:roe|roe]]. [[cookbook:Sushi|Sushi]] and [[cookbook:sashimi|sashimi]] feature both raw and cooked shellfish.

==Food safety==
Shellfish are an important part of a [[cookbook:Eating for Health|healthful diet]]. They contain high quality [[cookbook:protein|protein]] and other essential nutrients, can be low in saturated fat, and may contain omega-3 fatty acids. In fact, a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fish and shellfish can contribute to heart health and children's growth and development. But, as with any type of food, it's important to handle seafood safely in order to reduce the risk of food borne illness. Follow these basic food safety tips for buying, preparing, and storing fish and shellfish - and you and your family can safely enjoy the fine taste and good nutrition of seafood.

===Why Freshness Counts===
Healthwise, it is important to look for freshness when choosing seafood. In some species, if the catch has been left out in the sun too long - or the fish haven't been transported under proper refrigeration - toxins known as scombrotoxin, or histamine, can develop. Eating spoiled shellfish that have high levels of these toxins can cause illness.

Today, fresh catches can be processed and frozen immediately to very low temperatures - frequently, this takes place right on the fishing vessel. However, frozen seafood can spoil if it thaws during transport and is left at warm temperatures for too long.

To help ensure that the frozen shellfish you're buying is safe, follow these guidelines:
* Don't buy frozen seafood if its package is open, torn or crushed on the edges.
* Avoid packages that are positioned above the &quot;frost line&quot; or top of the freezer case in the store's freezer.
* If the package cover is transparent, look for signs of frost or ice crystals. These could mean the fish has been stored a long time or thawed and refrozen - in which case, choose another package.

===Selecting Shellfish: Some Special Guidelines===
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration requires shellfish harvesters and processors of oysters, clams, and mussels to put a tag on sacks or containers of live shellfish (in the shell), and a label on containers or packages of shucked shellfish.
* Tags and labels contain specific information about the product, including a certification number for the processor, which means that the shellfish were harvested and processed in accordance with national shellfish safety controls.
* Ask to see the tag or check the label when purchasing shellfish. 

In addition, follow these general guidelines:
# Discard Cracked/Broken Ones: Throw away clams, oysters, and mussels if their shells are cracked or broken.
# Do a &quot;Tap Test&quot;: Live clams, oysters, and mussels will close up when the shell is tapped. If they don't close when tapped, do not select them.
# Check for Leg Movement: Live crabs and lobsters should show some leg movement. They spoil rapidly after death, so only live crabs and lobsters should be selected and prepared.

===Storing Seafood===
Put seafood on ice or in the refrigerator or freezer soon after buying it, using these guidelines for safe storage
* If seafood will be used within two days after purchase, store it in the refrigerator.
* If seafood won't be used within two days after purchase, wrap it tightly in moisture-proof freezer paper or foil to protect it from air leaks, and store it in the freezer.

===Preparing Seafood===
Thaw frozen seafood gradually by placing it in the refrigerator overnight. If you have to thaw seafood quickly, either seal it in a plastic bag and immerse it in cold water, or - if the food will be cooked immediately thereafter - [[cookbook:microwave|microwave]] it on the &quot;defrost&quot; setting and stop the defrost cycle while the fish is still icy but pliable.

When you're preparing fresh or thawed seafood, it's important to prevent bacteria from the raw seafood from spreading to ready-to-eat food. Take these steps to avoid cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods:
* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before and after handling any raw food.
* Wash the cutting board with soap and hot water to remove food particles and juices after using it for raw foods such as seafood, and before using the board for cooked or ready-to-eat foods or preparing another food item.
** As an added precaution, sanitize cutting boards by rinsing them in a solution made of one teaspoon of chlorine bleach in one quart of water - or run the plastic board through the wash cycle in your automatic dishwasher. Or, consider using one cutting board only for raw foods and another only for ready-to-eat foods such as bread, fresh fruit and vegetables, and cooked fish.
** As a rule of thumb, avoid using cutting boards that are made of soft, porous materials. Instead, choose those made of hard maple or plastic, and make sure they are free of cracks and crevices. Smooth surfaces can be cleaned more easily and thoroughly.

Most seafood should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 °F. But if you don't have a food thermometer, there are other ways to determine whether seafood is done.
* Shrimp and Lobster: The flesh becomes pearly-opaque.
* Scallops: The flesh turns milky white or opaque and firm.
* Clams, Mussels, and Oysters: Watch for the point at which their shells open, which means they're done. Throw out the ones that don't open.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm confused about why this chapter is here.  This has nothing to do with The 10 Commandments, since Jesus' reply doesn't include any of them.  Am I missing something?

--[[User:Tmargheim|Tmargheim]] 01:26, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

Why wouldn't &quot;the most important commandment&quot; be included? - [[User:TheSun|TheSun]] 19:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

I think that the answer given lies outside of the stated scope of this book, which from the title, seems to be the ten commandments found in Ex 20.  The two commandments presented here are not found in the ten, they are in fact drawn from other important portions of Old Testament Scripture.  I think this might fit more in a discussion of the concept of Old Testament Law; however, this book gives as its focus the ten commandments found in Ex 20, and so this seems irrelevant.  If the question was asked and answered as &quot;Which of the 10 Commandments is the most important?&quot; (which I would say is implied by its inclusion in the &quot;Understanding the Ten Commandments&quot; section of a book titled &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;), it would seem much more related to the book as a whole.  I think that a discussion of Jesus' commentary on the whole of the Torah is out of place here. --19:57, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

'''American style Carbonara sauce''': This recipe was shown to me by Dottore (Doctor) Roberto Schirra, in the Italian Army, who welcomed us into his Turin apartment at the end of our strenuous deployment. He explained that it was named for the charcoal that it was first cooked over.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* As this is for cooking, virgin or extra virgin olive oil is not necessary, any grade, even &quot;pure&quot; olive oil is sufficient.
* &quot;Al dente&quot; means &quot;to the tooth.&quot; The pasta should be firm in the center when bitten.
* Amount of crushed red peppers is widely variable to suit your taste.
* As we sat down to eat, one of my fellow troops reached behind him and got some bread from the counter, Dottore Schirra frowned and said, &quot;You would eat bread with bread?&quot;

== Tips for Beginner ==

*Be brave, if something is wrong or the lay-out is totally rubbish, somebody will see it. It would be discussed and if never helps reverted.
*Questions? The Admins and I like it to help! Ask us before something become false. 
*It is useful to make a text document with the most important and most used formations. if 
you make a side with 100 chemical formula then can you save much time.

== Fixed a few spelling mistakes ==

I hope you don't mind but I've fixed a few of your spelling and grammar mistakes on your user page.  You can compare the history of the page so you can learn your mistakes. :)  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 04:13, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

Thanks Xania for correcting my userpage. I know my spelling and the grammar aren't the best. I hope it become better. ;-)

Happy new yaer wishs 

--[[User:Sundance Raphael|Sundance Raphael]] 12:22, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

:Also here? ;-)
:On you're userpage you write ''mittelalter'', the english translation for this is ''Middle Ages''.
:A &quot;wiki trick&quot; to translate things like that is open the german Wikipedia article and then click on english in the &quot;other languages box&quot; ;-)

::Thanks MichaelFrey for the tip. --[[User:Sundance Raphael|Sundance Raphael]] 14:35, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

== Usage of the welcome template ==

Please consider substituting the welcome template. Instead of writing &amp;#123;{[[Template:welcome|welcome]]{{#if:{{{param|}}}|&amp;#124;{{{param|}}}}}}}, you would then write {{[[Template:Welcome|subst:welcome]]}}. That way, users can see the wikicode when they edit their talk page and there are fewer links to the welcome template. Thank you. [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 17:44, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Hi and a little job? ==

Hi Sundance.  I'm guessing that you keep an eye on Recent Changes to pick up the new user welcomes?  If so could you look out for more &quot;regular&quot; editors and see if they are on [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]] (you will need to use the &quot;sort&quot; buttom to make it alphabetical).  If they are not on there you could add them?  Hard to say what is &quot;regular&quot; but more than one lot of editing on one book maybe?  Let me know if it isn't clear or anything - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:35, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
:I know this is not very helpful - I don't have any &quot;rule&quot;.  The page started as one in my namespace for something I was working on (&amp; still am).  However all I did was look at perhaps the last 1000 recent changes every day or two and see who seemed to be regularly involved.  To me it is not necessarily the quantity of edits but if they go round making small &quot;fixes&quot; to articles they may well be more active than someone who edits one article extensively and then disappears.  I hope I am clear even if not very helpful.  Please let me know if I can be of any help to you Sundance.

{{recipesummary|Stir fry recipes|variable|15-25 minutes|2|}}

== Ingredients ==
This recipe is very flexible. Add what ever ingredients you think will fit. A popular combination is pork with water chestnuts and asparagus. Stir fry style meats and vegetables simple means the ingredients are cut to small pieces which are slightly smaller than bit size and a perfect for pan frying.

* 1 part Stir Fry Meat (pork, beef, shrimp...)
* 1 part Stir Fry Vegetables (water chestnuts, asparagus, broccoli, squash, bamboo shoots...)
* 1 part cooked Lo Mein Noodles (Spaghetti noodles work well too. For a healthier option, try whole grain spaghetti noodles.)
* Enough Soy Sauce to heavily coat all the ingredients.
* Enough olive oil to coat a skillet.
* Salt and pepper to taste.

Optional
* Crushed/Chopped Garlic
* Bean sprouts

== Cookware ==
* Skillet - Large enough for desired amount of ingredients.
* Pot and strainer - Large enough for noodle preparation.
* Stirring Utensil - Tongs, wooden spoon... 

== Procedure ==
# Cook noodles in a pot according to directions.
# Coat a skillet with olive oil and place on stove with medium to low heat (add garlic if desired).
# Add meat and vegetables to skillet, season with salt and pepper, lightly coat with soy sauce, and cook everything until it's done; about 8-10 min. (Optional: Right before everything is finished cooking add bean sprouts and cook until they turn mildly translucent.)
# Strain noodles and add them to the [[cookbook:stir-fry|stir fry]].
# Coat with soy sauce and cook for roughly 1 minute in order to sear in the flavor. (Tip: When adding the soy sauce, start out light...taste and then add more. It's much easier to add ingredients than removing them.)</text>

----

:Welcome to Programming Text Adventures in BASIC.
:Hopefully in reading this guide you will be able,
:to program your own text adventures.

----



== '''What Will I Need?''' ==

:I assume a basic knowledge of the BASIC programming language (please spare the puns).
:I also assume you are using a old BASIC interpreter or compiler such as Quick Basic, Free BASIC
:or [[Chipmunk Basic help|Chipmunk Basic]]. (Qbasic is recommended only for Microsoft systems) 
:I assume you are good at computers, play or played a text adventure before.

----

== '''Starting to Code the Adventure''' ==

So what are text adventures? What is interactive fiction? You've probably played Zork, Adventure, or many others.
Interactive fiction or text adventures are very fun to play and communicate a great sense of environment to the
player. They rely on story-telling, treasure finding, and sheer elements of adventure. If you have never played a
text adventure, and would like to get an idea of what a text adventure is like exactly, here's a link to an online 
version of zork: http://thcnet.net/zork/index.php  .

Now let's write a text adventure in Basic.

Note: when creating a game, you should code the introduction LAST. Dive straight into coding the game!

(You really don't need a REM for comments. As an alternative, start the line with a ' )
:Enter this Program into Your BASIC Interpreter or Compiler
&lt;pre&gt;
REM INSERT TEXT ADVENTURE NAME
REM BY INSERT YOUR NAME HERE
10 PRINT &quot;WELCOME TO &lt;YOUR TEXT ADVENTURE HERE&gt;&quot;
20 PRINT &quot;PROGRAMMED BY &lt;YOUR NAME HERE&gt;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

(by this day and age, you don't need a number at the beginning of each line (no 10,20,30 on every line)


Remember, the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step!

----

== '''Coding Rooms: Arrays &amp; Data''' ==

Okay by now we have a introduction and a beginning, now we need a room. Of course, a room means anything
a dungeon, a spacecraft, or a musty cavern filled with flesh-eating zombies.


To do this, you need a data array. In short, think of an array as a &quot;storage bin&quot;. You know how for variables, you
would use something like triangle = 9 or name$ = &quot;Julius&quot;? Well, an array is like an extended set of variables. 

To use an array in your text adventure, you must first understand what an array looks like:

Here is an example of a simple data array that has 5 names stored and lists them on the screen:
:
&lt;pre&gt;
 CLS

 'below is the array, using a FOR..NEXT loop to &quot;store&quot; the names contained in the DATA statements:
 
 DIM name$(5)
 FOR n = 1 TO 5    'also in the FOR NEXT loop is a PRINT statement, which will print the current value stored by name$ 
  READ name$(n)
  PRINT name$(n)
 NEXT n

 DATA &quot;James&quot;, &quot;Beth&quot;
 DATA &quot;Fran&quot;, &quot;Olivia&quot;
 DATA &quot;Bevan&quot;

 'feel free to copy this program and change it however you like! You can also make arrays that store number values as well!
&lt;/pre&gt;

Container classes are usually most useful if they can hold any kind of item. Otherwise, you would have to write a different container for each type you wanted to hold. The traditional object-oriented approach (used by Java before version 1.5) takes advantage of polymorphism. Since all classes derive from &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;, a container that holds &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt; instances can serve as a general-purpose container. This has a number of disadvantages:

* Primitive types (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;) cannot be directly held in the container. You must write a wrapper class (such as Java's &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;) to hold such items.
* The container is not typesafe. You must cast items from &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt; to their real type when removing them from the container. There are also no particular limits on the actual types of the items in the container, meaning a given container is capable of holding a random mix of types.
* All of this up- and down-casting can have a negative impact on performance.

The simpler solution of just writing a custom container class for each type you want to hold has obvious drawbacks. (Most obviously, it does not promote code reuse.)

Template classes were originally added to C++ to solve this problem, and D's template features are based on those in C++. A library writer first writes a generic container (say, a linked list), as though any type may be contained in it. At the start of the container, the library writer puts a placeholder for the type that will be stored in it. By convention, we usually call this &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;. This generic class is called a ''template class'', so called because it serves as a template for more concrete implementations.

== Syntax ==

A template class in D looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
class Foo(T)
{
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the &lt;tt&gt;(T)&lt;/tt&gt; after the name of the class. This is the template parameter list. To actually use the class, we must ''instantiate'' it, by saying something like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
auto f = new Foo!(int);
&lt;/source&gt;

The template parameter list can have multiple parameters in it, just like a function parameter. A parameter with just a name is taken to be a type. Attempting to pass anything other than a type to &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; is an error. There are four kinds of template parameters:

; Types : The &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; in the example above is a type parameter.
; Constant values : Nearly any value which can be determined at compile-time can be used as a template parameter. Value template parameters look just like function parameters, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;int i&lt;/tt&gt; in a template parameter list means the template expects an integer literal or a &lt;tt&gt;const int&lt;/tt&gt;.
; Alias parameters : These parameters can accept essentially any symbol which can be determined at compile-time. This includes functions, other templates, classes, and much more. Alias parameters are declared by putting &lt;tt&gt;alias&lt;/tt&gt; before the parameter's name.
; Tuple parameters : D supports ''variadic templates''. This is an advanced topic, and is covered [[../Advanced Templates|later]].

== Example ==

A simple templated stack (implemented with a linked list) might look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
class LinkedStack(T)
{
    private Node head;
    class Node
    {
        T item;
        Node next;
        Node prev;
    }
    this()
    {
        head = new Node;
        head.prev = head;
        head.next = head;
    }

    void push(T t)
    {
        Node temp = new Node;
        temp.item = t;
        head.prev.next = temp;
        temp.prev = head.prev;
        temp.next = head;
        head.prev = temp;
    }
    T pop()
    {
        Node temp = head.prev;
        temp.prev.next = head;
        head.prev = temp.prev;
        return temp.item;
    }
    T peek()
    {
        return head.prev.item;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To use the above example, we might say:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
void main() {
    auto list = new LinkedStack!(int);
    list.push(1);
    list.push(2);
    list.push(3);

    auto strList = new LinkedStack!(char[]);
    strList.push(&quot;hello&quot;);
    strList.push(&quot;world!&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Note the syntax: &lt;tt&gt;LinkedStack!(int)&lt;/tt&gt;. This is a ''template instantiation''. This tells the compiler to generate a version of the &lt;tt&gt;LinkedStack&lt;/tt&gt; class where &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; is replaced with &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. The type of the &lt;tt&gt;list&lt;/tt&gt; variable in the above example is &lt;tt&gt;LinkedStack!(int)&lt;/tt&gt;. The type of &lt;tt&gt;strList&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;LinkedStack!(char[])&lt;/tt&gt;. These two types are distinct from each other. In terms of inheritance, they are only related insofar as they both inherit from &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;.</text>

Just as template classes allow the writing of generic data structures, template functions allow the writing of generic algorithms. Generally speaking, template functions allow the library writer to write functions for argument types without having to overload the function with the same code.

== Syntax ==

A template function looks like a regular function with two sets of arguments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
foo(T, U) (T t, U u)
{
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The first set of arguments are the template arguments. (See the section on [[../Template Classes|template classes]] for what are allowed as template arguments.) The second set of arguments are the regular function arguments.

In the case of the above example, the function can just be called by passing the regular function arguments. D will derive the template parameters automatically based on the types of the arguments. This is called ''implicit function template instantiation'', or IFTI for short.

Function templates may be explicitly instantiated like any other template, as in &lt;tt&gt;foo!(&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[])(12, &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/font&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Example ==

The classic example of a template function is the &lt;tt&gt;min&lt;/tt&gt; function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
T min(T) (T t1, T t2)
{
    if (t1 &lt; t2) return t1;
    else return t2;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This function determines which of any two arguments (of the same type) are smaller. (With the stupid caveat that it will return the second argument if they are equal.)

 min(12, 20); // Returns 12
 min(&quot;green&quot;[], &quot;blue&quot;); // Return &quot;blue&quot;

(A note about the second example. We pass &lt;tt&gt;min&lt;/tt&gt; a slice of &quot;green&quot;, because otherwise D will infer the type of the argument to be char[5], a static array. The type of &quot;blue&quot; is char[4], a different type. By slicing &quot;green&quot;, we get a char[], a dynamic array, and D knows how to implicitly convert &quot;blue&quot; to this type.)</text>

Wikimedia Commons requires that movies be uploaded as Ogg-Theora (OGG) files. As of Blender 2.42a, this is not a builtin feature of Blender. To get OGG files from your finished animation isn't difficult, though. However, you'll need additional software. 

There are basically two ways to generate OGG files: you can use one of the many fine video editors or you can use special conversion programs. Video editors like LiVES or Cinerella allow you to load your AVI or your rendered frames, manipulate them, and create the OGG file from it. Please refer to the editor's documentation on how to achieve this.

A disadvantage of a video editor is they are huge pieces of software, duplicating functionality that you already used when you created your animation file/s with blender. It's actually not necessary to install a video editor just for converting your animation to OGG Theora format.

== Converting saved frame picture files to Ogg Theora ==
It's actually possible to convert frame pictures that you saved before to OGG format movies. The [http://www.v2v.cc/~j/ffmpeg2theora/ ffmpeg2theora software package], which is available in source or binary for all relevant systems, is capable of batch-processing files into an Ogg format movie. For example, if your frames were saved as PNG (with filenames &lt;tt&gt;filename001.png&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;filename002.png&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.), you could convert them to a soundless OGG file with:

 ffmpeg2theora filename%03d.png -o output.ogv

Sound is possible too, as well as being able to set the quality and framerates. Consult the &lt;tt&gt;ffmpeg2theora&lt;/tt&gt; documentation for more.

== Converting AVIs to Ogg Theora ==
&lt;tt&gt;ffmpeg2theora&lt;/tt&gt; can also convert AVI movies to OGG.  Usage example:

 ffmpeg2theora --optimize my.avi

*: What do you mean by &quot;No vote&quot;? Wasn't there a vote by [[User:Kernigh]]?

: '''Unsure'''. I was going to vote &quot;re-close&quot; but as [[User:Kernigh]] states, this distribution has merged with a different one and the website has shut down. So, I figured I'd go for delete as it doesn't seem like the distribution is obtainable. Then I found some iso images and I reckoned we needed some extra information on this. I'm contacting the original contributor and the new project at http://www.arcanelinux.org/. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 20:33, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
:: I just got a [[User talk:Swift#How to install h3knix|reply]] from [[User:Pianoman87]], the original contributor.
::&lt;blockquote&gt;I found that by accident while searching for typoes on wikipedia, and transwikied it to wikibooks. I know nothing about the distribution. I nominated that page for deletion in January but it was kept. I'd be inclined to vote delete for now assuming the distribution doesn't exist anymore. Pianoman87 00:53, 8 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:: No word from the Arcane distro. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:16, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

: I'm unsure whether to delete or keep even if the distro is unobtainable. It still might be of use to someone. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 18:19, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''.  Looking at this the websites links are generally parked/defunct.  If this distro no longer exist a page on '''installing''' it seems to be of historical interest only and not a textbook.  Unless someone wishes to make a positive case I will close this as a delete shortly --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:47, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment''', Perhaps it could be merged/turned into a book on Arcane Linux, since it consists of only one page? Some clean up would probably be necessary, if someone wishes to take on the task of doing so. There also seems to be a general guide to using Linux, where it may be of use if the people contributing to that book are interested in for example comparing differnt linux distros to help new users decide which to use. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:30, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page.

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

'''Batter''' is a term for a variety of coatings put on food before cooking, to give a crispy coating.

Most batters contain beaten [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] and [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]], but there is an enormous variety of recipes and techniques. [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]] uses batter extensively in the form of [[Cookbook:tempura|tempura]].

==Simple egg batter==
This is a [[Cookbook:Basque cuisine|Basque]] batter, useful to coat fillets of fish. It is easily scaleable - use one egg for each two fillets.
*Preheat a large [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frying pan]] and add cooking oil when it is hot
*[[Cookbook:Egg#Separating eggs|Separate]] the egg and reserve the yolk 
*Beat the egg white until it is almost forming soft peaks
*Beat the yolk lightly on its own, then fold it into the egg white
*Coat the fish fillets in flour (which can be [[Cookbook:Seasoned flour|seasoned]]) then dip them in the batter
*Fry the fillets in the oil, turning once, until the batter is browned.

==Examples of dishes dipped in batter before cooking==
*[[Cookbook:Mozzarella Sticks|Mozzarella Sticks]]
*[[Cookbook:Onion Rings|Onion Rings]]
*[[Cookbook:Tempura|Tempura]]

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/Iamjaypatel|Iamjaypatel]] ([[User talk:Iamjaypatel|talk]]) to last version by 71.97.76.39</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">(This section is meant to be an appendix.  Only go into enough detail to highlight the key differences between the two languages.)

(Despite what the title may suggest, the aim of this module is not state which version is &quot;better.&quot;  Only which version is right for users for their particular project so that they might make an informed decision.)

==What are the Differences Between the Two?==
===Syntax===

XHTML has a stricter, XML-based syntax that does not appear in HTML, therefore making it slightly more advanced for new users.  

The most important change is that there are no unpaired tags such as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  As such, there is now a corresponding closing tag, or the tag is immediately closed within the tag itself.

===Media Types===
===Parsing===


==Which Version is Right For Me?==
(This section is only meant to highlight the positives for each language.)
===The Case for HTML===
You should use HTML if the following conditions are met:
*I want cross-compatibility without resorting to complex methods.
*I want to use the most established, thus most bug-free version of HTML.
*I want more flexibility when it comes to error-handling.

===The Case for XHTML===
You should use XHTML if the following conditions are met:
*I want to take advantage of XML applications such as MathML and XSL.
*I want to take advantage of XML's more efficient parsing processing.
*I want to use XHTML's inherent extensibility to create custom elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Extensible Hypertext Mark Up Language (XHTML) is the successive markup language to the near ubiquitous Hypertext Mark Up Language (HTML).  Rooted in Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), HTML is flexible but complex, leaving the liberties with which web browsers take with its rules to cause a number of problems. Based on the strict and simple Extensible Markup Language (XML) standard, XHTML aims to resolve said problems while offering extensibility with other XML-based applications.  In summation, XHTML is HTML rewritten to comply with XML, hence its name.

XHTML, being a subset of XML, will also be extensible to other XML applications and featured.  For example, it may also include fragments from other XML based languages, such as Scalable Vector Graphics or MathML through the usage of namespaces.  

== The Components ==

An XHTML document is made up of four main components:
*'''Document Type Definition (DTD)''': This used to be optional in HTML, but it is compulsory in XHTML. The DTD describes the language or script in which the text has been encoded.
*'''Text content''': the headers and paragraphs that appear on the page.
*'''References''': Advanced content like links and images.
*'''Mark-Up''': Instructions on how the content should be displayed.

Each of these components is comprised of text. This means that the page can be saved in text format and viewed in any browser.

XHTML stands for extensible Hypertext Markup Language. It is a different version of HTML, it is based off of XML. XHTML is used to make webpages and has a very specific way to be written to be correct and without error.  XHTML is also very case-sensitive. the tags are written in lowercase and need to be closed.The order of the tags also need to be in correct order for the information to come out correct. there are three main sections of XHTML consist of A declaration statement, a Head statement and a body.

      <comment>Set stable version settings for &quot;Wikijunior:Bugs/Contributing&quot; [Default: Stable, Precedence: Pristine]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Guidelines==
When working on this project, remember that it's aimed at children. It's more important to be understood than to be precisely accurate on every detail. Use technical vocabulary when you need to, but don't use big words where simpler language would work.  Whenever you have to use a word, list it in the glossary of basic terms, and define it.  Either that, or note it needs to be defined in the glossary page.  Giving definitions when such words are used is generally a good idea as well.

Please, if you can contribute to this book, do so. You can work on almost anything including this page, but if you want to make some significant changes please bring them up [[Talk:Wikijunior Bugs|on the discussion page]].  Additional new elements are welcome; see the section below.

Try to restrict discussion to the main discussion page so that people can actually see your message without having to check specific pages.

==Create or request an article==
You are encouraged to create an article on an interesting or useful Bug. Note however that not all articles will make it into the final published version, though they will all be available on this live online version. If you would like someone else to write a page about a bug, add your suggestion to the ''Article Stubs'' list. When creating stub articles please use the [[Wikijunior Bugs/Stub Template]].

&lt;!-- Except for the first article, add a request alphabetically in the format:
 * [[/Bugs/]] 
--&gt;
==Major questions==
The questions that will appear in every article are:

* What does it look like? 
* Where does it live? 
* What does it eat? 
* How does it defend itself? 
* Is it safe to touch?
* What stages of metamorphosis does it go through? 
* What special behavior does it exhibit? 
* How does this bug affect people?

NTFS (or NT File System) is a proprietary file system created by Microsoft. This is the default file system used on a system using Windows NT, Windows Server, Windows XP, and Windows Vista, Windows 7.

Although this file system is proprietary, there are open-source applications that are able to reliably read/write to it, for instance [http://www.ntfs-3g.org NTFS-3G].

      <comment>/* Arbitrators */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mediation and Arbitration ==

Until now (famous last words) there hasn't been a real need for mediation beyond very informal mediation and airing grievances on the Staff Lounge (or occasionally spilling over onto Textbook-l).  In the very few situations that it has gone completely out of control, at least in the past, [[User:Jimbo|Jimbo]] or somebody else came in to help out.  I will point out, however, that the stewards in particular want to stay completely away from Wikibooks politics as much as absoltutely possible and IMHO have yet to realistically come in to help even when their assistance has been formally requested.

Formal Arbitration has never been done at all.... even by Jimbo (here on Wikibooks).  At least unless you count the issues regarding the video game guides and removal of some content by Jimbo as arbitration, but it wasn't to settle any disputes.  Jimbo simply came into Wikibooks and set out some decrees of what he thought Wikibooks should be looking like.

In some ways, I hope that we can continue this general record of trying to resolve issues by concensus.  I know that there is on a (very few) rare situations that Wikibooks has been a case of the &quot;last user standing wins&quot; kind of mentality, but on the whole there has been an acceptance of compromise even when not all users agree on the same course of action.  While I havn't always been complacent and sometimes very vocal on talk pages, I will accept decisions made that don't go my way.  I certainly won't revert changes made to project pages unless there is a very strong concensus on a course of action.

In this regard, I would even suggest (perhaps very strongly) that the sections on this page regarding mediation and arbitration be simply removed for this reason.  I am willing to listen to debate about this, and I'm not going to perform that seemingly drastic action.  Still, we need to be cautious to jump here too fast to grow something that discourages cooperation and compromise.

As far as any time limits are concerned:  Wikibooks is not Wikipedia.  It seems as though just about any decision on Wikipedia is resolved in &quot;about a week&quot;.  About every page on Wikipedia is archived &quot;in about a week&quot;, and AfD discussions are usually closed &quot;in about a week&quot;.  That seems to be the average attention span of Wikipedians, as anything else said is ancient news.  Given the nature of the project on Wikipedia, that is fine there, and I'm not out to change any of those practice there.

The problem here is that the very nature of Wikibooks takes quite a bit more concentration and not all Wikibookians necessarily &quot;come up for air&quot; and read discussion fora like [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge]] or policy pages.  At least on a semi-daily basis.  That and I've strongly suggested that to help keep Wikibooks growing, not to mention the comparatively fewer active users, that discussions should be allowed to run much longer.  Indeed if you look at the Staff Lounge there are discussions sometimes a couple of months old, as well as on the VfD pages, but still considered active discussions.

I strongly believe that such longer term attitudes need to prevail among arbitrators as well, where a chance to achieve compromise can be made first well before the arbitrators need to come into the fray.  A week to come to a decision is way too short in terms of a context for Wikibooks, and I would strongly disagree to any such time limits being used here.  If there is a huge cultural difference between Wikibooks users and Wikipedians, this would have to be one of the most defining characteristics.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:42, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

:Robert, we are currently in a situation where consensus building has failed (and we've been there for a long time). I understand the desire not to have to use these kinds of structures, but we've been stuck for months now, and need a formal structure. I'd rather not use the SL as a forum for dispute resolution actually... that shouldn't be the first thing a new user sees. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:45, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

:IMHO this is what administrators ought to be doing best... if you can stomache it.  Stepping in between two users to try and cool things off.  But the problem does come in when one of the parties involved ''is'' an administrator, as active users here on Wikibooks often get admin status.  The problem with arbitration is that you have to have somebody with enough &quot;authority&quot; to make things stick, even when seemingly prevailing concensus is to do the opposite of the ultimate arbitration decision.  And somebody who can cut through the BS of all the arguments and find the core principles that are holding everything up.

:Wikipedia had Jimbo for the longest time, and the arbitrators there were (at least initially) hand selected by Jimbo, even though now they are elected positions.  How and under what sort of criteria somebody like that should be selected here is something up for question.  Hopefully if the situation arises (being a smaller community here on Wikibooks) we can find a comparatively uninvolved admin who is willing to act as an arbitrator without getting into the thick of the fight.

:I certainly don't want Wikibooks arbitration &quot;cases&quot; to end up so legalistic that you have to file &quot;briefs&quot;, do &quot;discovery&quot;, present &quot;evidence&quot; and other judicial steps that have gone to the point that some users are now specializing in Wikipedia law.  I am not kidding here either, as it is that bad right now.

:What keeps things more under control here on Wikibooks is that it is possible for everybody to know everybody.  There is a numerical population theory that suggests levels of organization based on essentially just population, and that groups less than 100 people are something that a human mind can fully grasp and that you can develop personal relationships with all of those individuals in a community that size.  Once it gets larger, you no longer get to know everybody involved.  This isn't a hard and fast rule, and in groups like Wikibooks people come and go, but it is something to think about.  And one of the reasons why certain organizational structures are in place on Wikipedia that aren't found here on Wikibooks (yet).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:50, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What do they  look like?==
[[Image:Meat_eater_ant_feeding_on_honey02.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A Meat Eater Ant.]]
Even though ants can look like small moving dots if you're standing, when looking closely at an ant, you can see that it has antennae which are curved to look a lot like our own elbows. Ants also have small sharp claws that help them keep hold of things while moving around on objects such as trees.

==Where do they live?==
Ants live in little &quot;cities&quot; called ''ant colonies''. Ant colonies are found in many places: under stones, within living or dead wood, and even underground. More advanced ant species are great builders and create many  chambers that are used for different reasons. A chamber may be used as a nursery or to store food. When ant colonies are underground they are often covered with piles of dirt, sand, clay, or pine needles. These piles are called ''ant hills''. Ant hills are used as entrances to the colony and as protection of the colony. Some ant hills are small but others can grow as tall as 3 feet!

==What do they  eat?==
Counting on what type of species or role in its ant colony, ants eat many different types of food. Species like the meat-eater ant eat mainly meat like remains of dead animals, but also can eat other foods including honey. Some other ant species, such as leafcutter ants actually &quot;grow&quot; their own food. They do this by collecting leaves and cutting them into pieces on which a type of fungus grows. The ants then harvest and eat this fungus.

==How do they  defend themselves?==
Most ants work as a group to defend themselves. Whole colonies working together are sometimes called ''superorganisms'', as the colony can act much like one large whole organism instead of the hundreds of tiny bugs that they really are. Another ant defense system is that some species of ant have venom which they could use for defense. This is also a reason why one particular species of ant is called a 'killer ant', even though these ant don't kill but can cause some damage to their victim.

[[Image:Ameiseneier.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The small white objects are ant pupae.]]

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
Ants go through a type of metamorphosis called ''holometabolism'' which is a type of metamorphosis that includes a total of four stages. The ant begins life as an egg laid by the only reproducing female ant in an ant colony, called a ''queen ant''. After the egg hatches, it is in its baby stage which is called the larval stage. After a while, the ant larvae goes into a stage in which it cannot move, and is also gaining its adult features; this stage is called the pupal stage. Finally after a few weeks, the pupal casing the young ant was enclosed in is broken and the fully-adult ant comes out.

Most ants live up to 6 to 10 weeks with the exception of some queen ants which may live up to 15 years and some worker ants which may live up to 7 years.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
Unlike many other animals, ants use smell instead of noises to talk to each other. Ants use a type of chemical called ''pheromones'' that leave a scent to help ants communicate, as well as figure out where each member of the colony is or was last located at. Ants also use their elbow-shaped antennae to smell, as they don't 
have nostrils like humans have.

==How does this bug affect people?==
Ants can either help get rid of pests or be the pest itself. Ants can eat smaller insects that can be pests to a human's backyard or garden, but ants can also be pests as they can destroy some gardens. One species of ant known as the ''carpenter ant'' is sometimes a pest to humans, because they eat wood. One kind of ant, the red imported fire ant, which is common in the southern United States, can deliver a very painful bite.

People in some parts of the world eat ants as food! Countries known for having dishes with ants on the menu include Mexico, Colombia and Thailand.

[[Image:Hercules.beetle.arp.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A Hercules Beetle (left) and a Jade Headed Buffalo Beetle (right).]]

Beetles belong to the order ''Coleoptera''. There are about 350,000 named species. They are an amazingly large and varied group of insects. Beetles living in the tropics can be more than 5 inches long. Smaller species are smaller than a grain of rice. Some have bright colors or are iridescent, shimmering with a rainbow of bright colors. Some have bold dots, stripes, and unusual patterns. The vast majority, however, are dull shades of brown and black. They can be rounded or long and thin. 

Most beetles have similar types of bodies. Their bodies are covered by a hard, jointed, external covering called an exoskeleton. Numerous plates provide armored defense and flexibility. The body is divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. 

They have wings and most can fly. Beetles belong to the order ''Coleoptera'' which means “sheath wings.” The name refers the plates or &quot;elytra&quot; that cover and protect the wings. When the beetle is resting, the elytra usually meet in the middle of the back.

They have large prominent compound eyes. Beetle antennae may be threadlike or clubbed. Beetles have chewing mouthparts with well-developed jaws called mandibles. The Stag Beetle, has mandibles that look like the antlers of a deer.

==Where does it live?==
Beetles can be found all over the earth in all kinds of habitats. Some, like the Lady Bug or Lady Bird Beetle, live on plants. Others live in dark, moist places under logs, rocks, and leaves. They live in gardens, grain fields, ponds and lakes. They have not been found in the frozen areas around the North and South Poles.

[[IMage:Elephant_Beetle_Megasoma_elephas_Male_Side_2699px.jpg|Thumb|300px|left|An Elephant Beetle feeding on a stalk of sugar cane.]]

==What does it eat?==
Beetles have mouth parts designed for chewing solid foods, so their diet is broader than other insects. Some are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. Others have highly specialized diets feeding only on a single kind of plant. Some eat and digest wood, resin, or sap. A few drink only the liquids of plants, trees, and fruits. Carnivorous beetles eat small prey such as earthworms and snails. Carrion Beetles eat dead animals. Clown Beetles eat the larvae of other insects. Diving Beatles eat tadpoles and other small water creatures.

==How does it defend itself?==

The beetle’s soft body and membranous wings are protected by the elytra, the front pair of wings. The elytra are thickened into hard covers which fold back to make an effective shield.

Beetles have various defense strategies, including camouflage, mimicry, and poison. They use camouflage to blend into their surroundings to hide from predators. They mimic the color or shape of other insects to deceive enemies. Many Longhorn Beetles look like wasps, even though they are harmless. Ladybird Beetles fall to the ground and &quot;play dead&quot; They also secrete a bad tasting fluid from the joints in their legs.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
[[Image:Engerling1.jpg|thumb|250px|A stag-beetle larva]]

Beetles undergo complete metamorphosis with an immature larval stage and a pupal stage. Larvae (grubs) are often worm-like and lack compound eyes. They usually have biting mouthparts. They can be predacious or vegetarian. Wings develop internally during the juvenile stages.

The last resting stage before the final molt is called a pupa. Pupae do not feed and are usually relatively inactive. They are vulnerable to predators and parasites. The pupal case is shed when the adult beetle is ready to emerge. 

Beetles mate in spring or summer. Most species produce one generation a year. Some may produce as many as four.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

Scarab Beetles push or roll balls of dung to their brood sites. It is thought that this behavior inspired the design in Egyptian art showing the Scarab Beetle pushing the sun along its course in the sky.

Although most beetles have a hard time righting themselves when turned upside down, the Click Beetle does not. It has a special mechanism on the underside of its body to help it spring into the air to right itself. It is named for the clicking sound it makes when doing this.

Many beetles make noises by tapping on hard surfaces or by rubbing parts of the body together. These beetles seem to have better hearing than beetles that do not make such sounds.

Burying Beetles are known to hide small animal carcasses from mammalian scavengers. A small dead animal, such as a mouse, supplies food for a whole brood of larvae that a pair of beetles will care for together.

[[Image:Chlorocales_africana_oertzeni_seitlich_2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An African Jewel Beetle.]]

==How does it affect people?==

People in some parts of the world sell Horned Beetles that have been bred for fighting.

Beetles are among the most important of the insect recyclers. Many species are decomposers that feed on dung or dead plants and animals. Some beetles are helpful to people. Ladybird Beetles eat aphids and other insects that harm crops. Ground Beetles feed on Potato Beetles that ruin potato crops.  

Some beetles are pests that can transmit disease. Others cause millions of dollars in damage to plant products. Woodworm Beetles damage furniture and wood floors.

[[Image:Lampyris noctiluca.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A firefly close-up]]
Have you ever been in a field at night and sometimes seen little flying specks of light around? Well, if you were to look at one up close you'd realize that these lights are really bugs! These bugs are called fireflies. When you look close-up, you can see that fireflies have soft bodies, compound eyes and a bright, glowing rear end. The firefly's larvae look almost exactly like fully grown fireflies, except that they don't have the compound eyes the adults have.

Fireflies are among the most familiar insects. They belong to the Family Lampyridae. Lampyrids are able to flash their lights on and off, unlike other luminescent insects which glow continuously. The flashing rhythm is different in various species. 

Like many other beetles, fireflies are brownish or blackish in color. Fireflies are medium sized insects, from 1/4 to 3/4 inches long. The sheath or covering that protects the wings is fairly soft. The protective shield (pronotum) extends forward beyond the body to hide the head from above. Females may be short-winged or wingless. 
The last 2 or 3 segments of the abdomen have a green, yellow, or orange luminous organ. The light comes from many tiny air tubes (tracheoles). They contain unstable molecules that break down to create light. The light on the firefly’s tail does not feel warm to the touch.  

The Pyralis Firefly is 3/8 to 1/2 inches long. The protective shield is rosy pink with dull yellow edges. There is a black spot in the center. The protective wing coverings (elytra) are mostly blackish brown with dull yellow sides and middle.  Both males and females have flashing lights. Females have a smaller light and do not fly. 
The smaller Scintilating Firefly is yellow and pink with a large black spot on its pronotum.

The Pennsylvania Firefly is 3/8 to 5/8 inches long. The body is long and flattened. The head is dull yellowish in color with threadlike antennae. Eyes are large and widely separated. The pronotum is a dull yellowish color with a black spot inside a reddish ring. Elytra are brown or gray and with a narrow pale stripe down the middle and yellow bands down the sides. Both sexes have a green luminous organ at the end of the abdomen. The larva is spindle-shaped.

==Where does it live?==
Fireflies (or ''lightning bugs'', as they are called in some parts in the United States) are found everywhere in the world, usually in marshes and forests; places that have enough food for the firefly's young.  The firefly is so widespread, that in some parts of the United States, the firefly is known by both the name firefly and the term &quot;lightning bug&quot;.  They are also known as &quot;glowing bug&quot;.

Fireflies spend a lot of time clinging to foliage, tree trunks, and branches. Some live in moist places under debris and decaying vegetation on the ground. Others are found beneath bark and decaying vegetation. 

Pyralis Fireflies are found east of the Rocky Mountains. They are usually seen in meadows. The Skintilating Firefly is found from New England to Kansas and Texas. Fireflies in the Pennsylvania Family are found from the Atlantic Coast to Texas and north to Manitoba. They live in meadows and open woods.

==What does it eat?==
Fireflies are predatory when young, but as adults they usually eat plant pollen and nectar. This mixed diet depends on the type of species of firefly as there are around 2,000 different firefly species! The larvae of the firefly mainly eat the larvae of snails and slugs. They catch their prey usually by spitting digestive fluids (like spit and stomach acid) at their prey using organs near their mouth known as ''mandibles''.

Adults are not known to feed, but they are sometimes attracted to moth baits. Firefly larvae prey on small animals, insect larvae, snails, and slugs. 

Pennsylvania Fireflies eat soft bodied insects, snails, slugs, and mites. They also eat members of their own species.

==How does it defend itself?==
It is not well known how fireflies actually protect themselves.

Both fireflies and their larva are luminescent. The light may serve as a warning to predators that they do not taste good.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
Fireflies flash their lights to help them find a mate of their own species. There may be several different species courting in the same field, so each species has its own flashing code.

The firefly goes through the four-stage type of metamorphosis known as ''holometabolism''. The firefly starts life as an egg and in three to four weeks hatch into larvae. The larvae hatch mainly in the spring and already glow like the adult firefly. For this reason, the larvae of some firefly species are known as ''glowworms''. Most of the time, the firefly larvae will stay in this stage until the next spring. Then they go into the pupal stage for approximately two weeks. Finally, they emerge as adult fireflies; however, some firefly larvae won't reach the pupal and adult stage for a few years, depending on the species. 

Pennsylvania Fireflies and Pyralis Fireflies lay eggs in rotting wood and humid debris on the ground. Larvae hatch in spring. The fully grown larvae spend the winter in pupal chambers hidden in the soil. They pupate the following spring. Adults emerge from early summer to late August. Eggs, larvae, and pupae are all luminous.
[[Image:GluehwuermchenImWald.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Fireflies in the forest.]]

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
The firefly's well known behavior is its bright rear end, which is used usually around mating. The process that makes the firefly's rear end glow is known as ''lighting'', which is caused by the firefly's special organs inside itself. Most species of firefly are also nocturnal. Some species of firefly surprisingly do not have the glowing rear end, and are ''diurnal'', which means that they are active at daytime like humans are. Some of these non-bright species glow when they are under shade, though.

Fireflies have trouble surviving in captivity. In just a few minutes after capture, the regular rhythm of their flashes is lost and the light slowly fades. 
 
Most of the fireflies that we see are males. Each species emits a specific signal. Upon recognizing the specific code, the female will respond with her own signal. The male quickly finds her and they mate. 

Sometimes females of one species flash another species’ mating code.  When the male nears it is captured and eaten. 
Glowworms and fireflies belong to the same beetle sub-family. Only the females produce light to attract males.

==How does this bug affect people?==
The firefly is known for being part of different people's cultures. In ancient Mayan folklore, the firefly used to be associated with the stars. In ancient China, fireflies were caught and used to light lanterns. The Pyralis Firefly is named after a fabled fly that rose from the fire. Pyralis is Greek for “of fire.” In modern times, the firefly is known for being the state insect of Pennsylvania.

[[Image:Danaus_plexippus_croped.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Monarch butterfly feeding on nectar from a flower.]]
Butterflies are common insects that have a worm-like body and highly colorful wings. The body and wings are covered with tiny scales that are best seen through a microscope. If you catch a butterfly by the wings some of the scales will peel off on your fingers. Butterflies are common in the garden. They can often be seen visiting flowers during day time.

Moths look similar to butterflies and they are closely related. Moths are nocturnal in nature, though, with stocky bodies. Most moths have dusky colors.

==Where does it live?==
Butterflies are very common throughout the world. In cooler climates they are especially common during spring and summer. You can find them in your own neighborhood or garden. Anywhere that there are many plants and flowers you can find butterflies. Some people grow gardens for the purpose of attracting butterflies. These are called &quot;butterfly gardens.&quot; Butterfly larvae are called caterpillars. Each butterfly species eats specific types of plants. These plants are called &quot;hosts.&quot; The caterpillar of the monarch butterfly feeds on the milkweed plant.

==What does it eat?==

Caterpillars eat their own egg shells as soon as they hatch in most cases. The larvae (caterpillars) feed on tender shoots and leaves. In most species larvae eat more than their own body weight. Caterpillar mouths are suited for cutting and chewing and have strong mandibles.

The pupae are dormant and do not feed.

All adult butterflies feed on liquid food. Adults have long tubular mouths which remain coiled under the head. These mouth parts can be extended while feeding. Butterflies feed on nectar and plant saps. A few feed on sap from fruits or fermented saps. In some species, the adults do not feed at all.

==How does it defend itself?==
Hairy caterpillars have spiny bristles. These bristles bother predators by lodging in the skin or mucous membranes. Some of these bristles also contain venom that can cause irritation. 

Some caterpillars eat food that contains toxins. They store these toxins in their bodies even after they become adult butterflies. This makes animals that eat them sick. Bad tasting butterflies are often brightly colored.

Caterpillars and some butterflies use camouflage to avoid detection. They can be the same color as the plants where they live, or look like sticks or other common objects. The pattern on a butterfly's wings sometimes looks like the face of a much larger animal. This is thought to frighten off some predators. 

[[Image:Inachis_io_stages.png|thumb|344px|left|The peacock butterfly shown as a larva, pupae, and adult, along with detail of the head.]]

==What stages of growth does it go through?==

A butterfly goes through four stages during its life. It starts life as an egg. It then becomes a larva and then a pupa, and finally an adult. During the larval stage, a butterfly is called a caterpillar. During its pupal stage it is called a chrysalis, and during the adult stage it is called an imago, which is the butterfly. Butterflies go through complete metamorphosis, which means that the adult form is very different from the juvenile form.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
Butterflies sense the air for scents, wind and nectar using their antennae. The antennae are very sensitive. 

A butterfly tastes with its feet (called tarsi.) It picks which plant to lay eggs on based on the taste it senses when it lands on the plant.  

Butterflies have four independent wings. This allows them to be nimble fliers. 

Many butterflies migrate over long distances. One famous migration is the Monarch butterfly's which goes from Mexico to southern Canada. Butterflies navigate using the sun as a compass.

==How does this bug affect people?==
Butterflies are pollinators.  They add beauty to gardens.

Caterpillars of many butterfly species are major pests of crop plants.

[[Image:IC Macroglossum stellatarum1 NR.jpg|right|250px|thumb|This moth flies in the daytime.  It sips nectar through its long proboscis and even looks like a hummingbird!]]
==What does it look like?==
Moths are flying insects with wings, similar to butterflies. Some moths have very large wings.  There are some moths that do not have wings such as the female gypsy moth.  The wings of a moth are covered with tens of thousands of tiny wing scales which overlap like shingles on a roof. Most moths are dull colors such as gray and brown. Moths often have antennae that look like feathers. [[Image:Thysania agrippina 0001b L.D.jpg|right|250px|thumb|This is the moth with the largest wingspan - It is called the White Witch!]]

==Where does it live?==
Moths and their larvae can be found almost everywhere including: wetlands, temperate forests, mountains, deserts, rain forests, grasslands and even Arctic regions.  There is even a moth that lives in the fur of South American sloths!

==What does it eat?==
Moth larvae eat all sorts of plants but each kind of moth only will eat one or a few different plants.  Adult moths, mostly active at night, will drink the nectar of night blooming flowers and even the sap that leaks from a tree (after it gets damaged). There are moths that eat clothing.  [[Image:Tineola.bisselliella.mounted.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The larvae of this moth eats clothing.]]

==How does it defend itself?==
Moths and their larvae defend themselves in various ways.  Some have an unpleasant taste to birds or mammals. Moth larvae can be covered with irritating 'hairs' or spines.  Some of these spines can sting.  When a predator tries to eat the caterpillar, some of the 'hairs' can come off when leaving the predator with a mouthful of tasteless fuzz!  Some caterpillars are just plain scary-looking (Hickory-horned-devil!) Most moths are active at night and so hide during the day, away from predators.  Bats consider night-flying moths quite delicious.  Some moths are able to 'trick' bats by hearing/detecting their approach and then taking evasive actions. Camouflage is another way that moths defend themselves. The colors of some moth's wings help the moth to blend into its surroundings. Predators are unable to see the moth and so the moth survives. Some moths have large spots on their wings that look like eyes. If a predator such as a bird sees the moth, it attacks what it thinks are the moth's eyes. However it has merely pecked at the wing and the moth can escape with its head in one piece.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
All of them: egg, larva, pupa and adult phases.  The larvae grow from a tiny caterpillar to a much larger caterpillar and may shed its skin as it grows up to five times!

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
Moths are attracted to bright lights.  Some moths are active during the day.  That is why you always see them gathered around street lights, porch lights, flames, etc.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Some moths lay eggs in clothing. Others lay them in dry food, like flour or rice. When the eggs hatch, the larvae will then eat the clothing or dried food. In the same way, larvae have damaged crops, trees and ornamental plants. Have you ever found strange holes in your clothes? They might have been made by a hungry moth larva!  

Humans use mothballs to keep moths out of their clothing. Mothballs are round, white balls treated with chemicals that poison moths. Since the poison may also harm humans, the balls should never be tasted or eaten. You should wash your hands immediately after touching mothballs. 

At the same time, moths also do things which help people. For example, moths help flowers grow by pollinating them. The downside of this is that the moths also lay their eggs in the leaves of the plant. When the eggs hatch into caterpillars, the munching of the plant begins! Have you ever seen the holes that caterpillars make as they chew on the leaves of plants?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a Praying Mantis?==
A cartoon version of this very helpful bug is a praying grasshopper. Here we wrote all we can figure out about them. They are very shy creatures.
== What does it look like? ==

[[Image:MCC-Mantis-10-27-01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Praying mantis on banana.]]

The praying mantis is a skinny insect with long, curved legs in the front. The position of these legs make the mantis look like it is praying. Most, but not all, mantes (the plural of mantis) are green or brown but some are black or even pink! The mantis uses the colors to blend in with its surroundings to catch prey. Some are so well disguised that other bugs think they are flowers.

==Where does it live?==
Mantes are found all around the world including North America and Europe. Many different types are found in Asia. Some common species of mantes were introduced to North America from Asia and Europe. Nearly 2,000 species live throughout the world. Most are found in places with warm temperatures. A mantis will often roost in something close to its own body color. Most mantes are green or brown and they perch in grasses, bushes and trees. However, some other species are brightly colored and depend on flowers for camouflage.

==What does it eat?==
The mantis is a carnivorous ambush predator. Mantes eat other insects which they catch with their spiny front legs. The rows of spines act like hooks, so they can grab and hold their prey. There is almost no way to escape. The mantis' strong arms and hooked claws are a deadly trap. Their camouflage helps them stay hidden and they are so fast they can snag prey in the blink of an eye. Some species of mantes also eat lizards, spiders, other mantes, and even small birds and mice. 

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:300px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
&lt;p&gt;When the Chinese saw the praying mantis defending itself, they created Praying Mantis Kung Fu. It is a style of martial arts that mimics the attacks and movements of a praying mantis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
==How does it defend itself?==
When the praying mantis needs to defend itself against predators, it will stand up tall, raise its large front legs, and open its wings to look as big as possible. It uses its front legs not only to catch prey but also to defend itself if necessary. It does this by standing up tall and making clicking noises to frighten its enemies. If that does not work the mantis either flies away quickly or it delivers a powerful punch with its hooked front leg. Although an angry mantis can be frightening, they are generally not aggressive to humans.

[[File:Mantis egg 2005 Spring 001.jpg|thumb|The egg mass of a praying mantis]]

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
The female lays  eggs in the autumn in an egg sack. The eggs prepare to hatch in the spring. When the nymphs hatch, they look like miniature versions of their parents. The new born mantes scamper off to find food. The nymphs may be eaten by bugs, birds or bigger mantes. The nymphs hatch and molt several times before reaching adulthood. But once a mantis becomes an adult it mates, and lays eggs of its own, restarting the mantis life cycle, an endless circle of life.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
The praying mantis depends a lot on camouflage and blending into its surroundings. It will dance to make it look like it is blowing in the wind like a leaf or a twig. A praying mantis can also hold very still to surprise its prey. Some people haven't seen it before, but all mantes can fly. These remarkable talents show that big surprises can come in small packages.

==How does this bug affect people?==
Some people think mantes are pests. That is only partly true, as mantes often eat helpful bugs like [[Wikijunior:Bugs/Ladybug|ladybugs]]. They can beneficial too! Praying mantes are excellent exterminators. They keep down the population of bugs that are a threat to farming. They can also eliminate bugs with harmful diseases. A master of disguise, the praying mantis can be an able assistant to a farmer or gardener. Look at a bush in your yard, very very carefully. You might find a mantis poised on a leaf if you are very lucky!

[[Image:Becho.Galicia.070621 20.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A cricket from Europe.]]
Crickets are small, often nocturnal insects. They are usually dark brown or black, so that they blend in with the ground. They have six legs. Four are walking legs and two large back legs are used to make very long jumps. Attached to the head are two long antennae, also known as feelers, used for touching and smelling. Crickets are sometimes confused with grasshoppers because they are similar in size and body shape, but grasshoppers have shorter antennae and are green in color. 

Crickets are related to grasshoppers. True crickets belong to the Family Gryllidae. They have a broad, somewhat flattened body between 3/8 inch and 1 inch in length. The long, tapered antennae (feelers) usually grow much longer than the body. Most crickets have flat overlapping wings on top of the back. Some species have tiny wings and others are wingless. Females have long, needlelike ovipositors for laying eggs. 

Both males and females have a flat, round tympanum (hearing organ) in each front leg. Males have a hard, sharp-edged “scraper” on the right forewing. The scraper is rubbed with a thick, toothed vein on the left forewing. The action of the vein on the scraper (stridulation) produces sound. 

Field crickets (''Gryllus assimilis'') are also known as common black crickets. They are brown, red or black in color and about 1/2 to 1 inch long. 

House crickets (''Acheta domesticus'') are light yellowish-brown in color. They have a light-colored head with three dark bands on top and between the eyes. The wings cover the abdomen. There is another pair of long hind wings at the very tip of the abdomen. These are sometimes shed in adulthood. There are spines on the hind legs.

Tree crickets belong to the genus ''Oeceanthus''. They are usually green with broad transparent wings. Snowy tree crickets are about 1/2 inch long and pale green to white in color. They have a very slender body and two long antennae.

Ant-loving crickets (''Myrmecophila'') are a tiny wingless species, less than 1/4 inch long and about l/4 inch wide. 

Bush crickets are slender and range from 1/4 inch to 3/4 inch in length. They are brown or gray in color. They may have small wings or no wings at all. Some female bush crickets are called “sword-bearing” because they have a long, sharp ovipositor (egg laying organ).  

Mole crickets are brownish with broad, spade-like front legs designed for digging. They are usually about 1 inch long and have relatively short antennae. Pigmy mole crickets are less than 1 inch long. 

Only male crickets chirp. They do not rub their legs together to do this. Instead they run the top of one wing against the “teeth” on the bottom of the other wing to make a chirping sound. The wings are held up and open to make the sound louder. In slow motion, they appear to be shrugging their shoulders when chirping. At actual speed, the chirping movements are too fast for the eye to follow.

Crickets have been chirping and singing for more than 300 million years—long before the earliest sounds of amphibians and birds. Experts recognize four types of cricket songs: calling, courting, aggressive, and mating. The calling song is fairly loud. It is  meant to attract females and repel other males. The very quiet courting song is used when a female is near. Only signals from a male of her kind will cause a female to approach and accept him as a mate. An aggressive song is used when another male is detected. 

Crickets that live in trees and bushes usually sing only at night. Those that live in weeds generally sing both day and night. House crickets and field crickets make songs both day and night. 

Females of chirping and singing species have organs on their legs to hear sound. Most camel crickets do not produce sounds, so neither males nor females have hearing organs.

==Where does it live?==
Crickets have a variety of habitats. They can be found in trees and on or around different types of plant life. 

Field crickets are common in North America. They live in fields, lawns, pastures, along roadsides, and in woods. Bush crickets live in tropical areas, such as the south eastern coastal plain of the United States. They are usually found in bushes, under debris near ponds, or moist, sandy areas near water. Tree crickets occur in trees, shrubs, high grass or weeds.

Mole crickets burrow in moist ground and are rarely seen. Pigmy mole crickets prefer moist sandy places along shores of ponds and streams. They burrow in the ground but are sometimes found on the surface. Ant-loving crickets live in ants’ nests.

==What does it eat?==
Crickets are omnivores and scavengers.  They feed on leaves, flowers, bark, and seeds. Some species are predatory, feeding on other insects, snails or even small vertebrates such as snakes and lizards. 

Field crickets eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants. They eat live or dead insects, grasshopper eggs, and pupae of flies, moths and butterflies. Sometimes they steal prey from spider webs.
 
Spotted camel crickets come out on warm humid nights to feed. They eat fungi, roots, fruit, and dead insects, including other crickets. Bush crickets eat leaves, flowers, and fruits of living plants. Ant-loving crickets eat ants’ young.

Tree crickets feed on aphids. Snowy tree crickets eat small insects. They also feed on fruit crops such as apples and peaches.

If keeping a cricket as a pet, they will eat fish food.  Crickets will also eat potatoes.

==How does it defend itself?==
The main predators of the cricket are frogs, lizards, tortoises, salamanders, and spiders.  

Unlike other insects, crickets do not actively defend themselves. Crickets have cerci (long hairs) at the end of the abdomen to detect movement. They use their strong legs to hop away from danger. Some use camouflage to blend with their surroundings. 

Crickets cease sound production when they detect a disturbance. If captured, they will try to wrench free, risking the loss of a leg, without making a sound. 

Bush crickets have a row of spines on the hind legs to deter predators. Some bush crickets are unable to make sounds. Since they are relatively large, sound might increase the danger of being detected. Their silence may protect them from predators.


[[File:Criquet.1(L).jpg|right|thumb|250px|A green bush cricket.]]
==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

Crickets undergo simple or incomplete metamorphosis. They develop in three main growth stages—egg, nymph, and adult. There is no “resting” stage before the adult stage. They mature in 6 to 8 weeks after molting 6 to 12 times. One generation hatches each year. Crickets cannot make sounds until after the final molt. 

Bush crickets lay eggs in pith, bark, or soft wood of plant stems. Female house crickets deposit eggs in damp sand, peat moss, and other moist places. They complete their life cycle in 2 to 3 months in warm weather. 

Field crickets lay eggs in warm, damp soil. Newly hatched nymphs burrow up to the surface where they molt 8 to 10 times. In 2 to 3 months they become adults. 

Female snowy tree crickets make a series of tiny holes in the bark of the host plant to lay eggs. The egg stage lasts through cold winter months. Eggs deposited in early autumn hatch as nymphs in spring. One generation is produced each year.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

The very regular chirping rate of snowy tree crickets is a common night sound in many places. As the temperature drops, songs become slower and the pitch of the song falls. People use the chirp rate to estimate the temperature.

==How does this bug affect people?==
Crickets are attracted to light so sometimes they come indoors. When inside a house they like to eat clothes made from cotton, silk or wool. Crickets are sometimes eaten by people! This is common in Africa or Asia, where they are considered a delicacy. In other places it is considered good fortune to have a cricket in the home because the singing is pleasant. Crickets are popular pets and are considered good luck in Asia.

Crickets are harmless to humans. They are used to catch many kinds of fish. They are sold as food for reptiles, lizards, and frogs. In ancient China, crickets were valued pets kept in golden cages. 

Field crickets are considered a nuisance pest because of their chirping. They sometimes cause damage to fruit and vegetable crops. They are known to chew on wood, rubber, plastic, or leather. Snowy tree crickets may cause damage to fruit crops by introducing disease.

[[Image:Plumpollen0060.jpg|thumb|300px|right|This bee is collecting pollen to create honey from a flower. The white lump on its hind leg is the pollen that it has collected.]]
==What does it look like?==
Bees are flying insects with two pairs of transparent wings. Many common species have colored stripes on their body. Honey bees are the most well-known kind of bee. They live in colonies and make honey. Honey bees have a hairy striped body. Each pair of a honey bee's legs is designed for certain tasks like cleaning antennae, carrying pollen, or picking wax made by their body. The mouth is suited for chewing solid food like pollen and for lapping up liquids like nectar.

There are other families of bees, though. These other types of bees are different from honey bees in look, feeding, and nesting habits. There are bumble bees, mining bees, leaf cutter bees, mason bees, digger bees, carpenter bees and many others. These other types of bees are common but aren't as familiar as honey bees. 

All bees, wasps, hornets and ants belong to a common insect order Hymenoptera. All these insects have transparent wings and share a similar anatomy.

==Where does it live?==
Many bee species are social, living in small communities. But some are solitary. Bees make their own nests using wax, propolis, plant parts, mud etc. The nests are often built in the open on trees and shrubs, in holes bored into wood, in underground tunnels, or in cracks and crevices in buildings. Bees can make their hives or nests in the open as well as in dark places. Nesting habits differ with species.

Honeybees are social insects and have large colonies. They live in hives made of wax and propolis which they make from plant resins and sap. Female worker bees secrete the wax they use (beeswax) from glands in their abdomen.

==What does it eat?==
Most bees eat nectar and pollen as their primary food. Pollen is a source of protein that helps to build body parts and nectar is a carbohydrate source that provides energy.

In honey bees, there are queen, worker and drone bees. These different types of bees are called &quot;castes.&quot; The main food differs for each caste. The queen and the growing larva are fed with a liquid called royal jelly that is secreted by the worker bees. As a honey bee grows, its food changes from royal jelly to pollen and nectar. The adult workers feed mostly on nectar and pollen. Drones are fed with royal jelly, nectar and pollen. Honey bees convert nectar into honey and store it for times like winter when nectar and pollen are not available.

[[Image:Bees.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A honeycomb in a beehive.]]

==How does it defend itself?==
Female honey bees have stingers. Worker bees sting  to defend the colony when they feel threatened. A bee's stinger is in the last segment of its abdomen. In many species the bee dies after it stings. The stinger is connected to a venom gland. Worker bees have tiny barbs in the stinger like a harpoon. Because of these barbs, the stinger is ripped from the bee while stinging and the bee dies due to the injury. The stinger is left in the body of the victim. If the stinger is not removed, venom continues to be pumped into the wound by pulsing venom glands.

The stinger left in the victim’s body is an alarm signal to the colony. Once it stings, it releases a chemical called pheromones. This attracts other bees in the colony to sting the victim. So when a person is stung by a bee, the stinger should be removed immediately to avoid more stings. Bee stings are painful, but quick removal of the stinger will reduce the pain and swelling. Some species are highly venomous and stings can be life threatening. For some people, even the sting from bee species that are not very venomous can cause allergic reactions. These allergic reactions can lead to intense pain or even death if not treated immediately.

Some species, like killer bees, are highly irritable. They have a reputation of attacking innocent passers-by. These bees are present in North and South America. It is a good idea not to go near a bee colony unless one is has a good knowledge of handling bees. Often it is difficult to tell the difference between killer bees and domesticated bees in the wild. Bee stings can be fatal if there are too many stings or if the species is highly venomous.  

A few bee species that do not have stingers bite using the mandibles. Mandibles are mouth parts of the insect that are using for cutting and chewing.

[[Image:Apis mellifera carnica larva.jpg|thumb|250px|Honeybee larva in a hive.]] 
==What stages of growth does it go through?==

Bees are advanced insects that have all the four stages of metamorphosis. A bee's life cycle includes egg, larva, pupa and adult stages.

In most bees species the eggs hatch by the third day after laying or within a few days. During the larval stage growth rate is high and hence larvae are hungry and eat a lot. Adult bees take care of the larvae by feeding them. The larval stage lasts for a week or two, after which larvae enter the dormant pupal stage. The pupal stage lasts for anywhere from a week to a couple of weeks. Larvae and Pupae are housed in special cells prepared by adult bees made of wax, propolis or plant parts. Larvae do not forage on their own and require parental care to survive. 

In a few primitive species of bees, the adults stuff the cells with reserve food and lay the egg in the cells. The emerging larvae feeds on the stored food till it enters pupal stage.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
Each honey bee colony has different castes of bees that look different from each other. Each honey bee colony has a queen. The queen is the only female that can lay fertilized eggs. When the eggs hatch, they become larvae and can develop into an either a queen or worker. Queens are generally larger in size compared to other castes in the colony. There are also a few drones in the honey bee colony which are male bees which have only reproductive function. Drones mate with newly emerged queens. After mating the drones die.

The majority of bees in a honey bee colony are female worker bees. Usually, they cannot lay eggs unless the queen dies. The workers forage for pollen and nectar, and make nectar into honey and royal jelly. They feed the queen, drones and larvae. They also build, maintain and defend the hive. 

A major activity of worker bees in a honeybee colony is preparation of honey. The worker bees lap up nectar (which is water like in consistency) from flowers and other plant parts. They store the nectar in their stomach until they return to their hive. In the bee’s stomach water is removed from the nectar to concentrate and thicken the nectar. Some digestive juices also mix with the nectar. When the bee returns to the hive, the concentrated nectar is regurgitated into special honey storing cells. The nectar becomes thicker by evaporation. The worker bees beat their wings to create an air flow in the hive. This is called fanning. When nectar in the cells reaches the required thickness it is called honey and the cells are sealed with wax by the bees.

Honey bees also collect and store pollen in special cells for reserve food.

Bees, like most insects, communicate using chemical signals called pheromones. In addition to this, honey bees also communicate by movement inside the hive. This is called bee dance. The communication by bee dance is symbolic and is thought to convey the direction and distance of a food source from the hive.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Honey is taken from honey bee colonies in the wild and from colonies that are reared in apiaries (bee farms). In addition to honey pollen, bee's wax, propolis and royal jelly are major apiary products. 

Bees are very important pollinators and improve productivity in crops. Many species are reared by farmers to enhance crop productivity by proper pollination.

As noted before bee stings can be extremely painful and can lead to health problems if they are not treated correctly.

Some species of leaf cutter bees and wood borer bees are household or garden pests that eat plant parts like leaves and flowers, or bore into wooden articles in the house hold.

[[Image:Scanning_Electron_Micrograph_of_a_Flea.jpg|thumb|A photo of a flea.]]

Fleas are wingless insects about 1/25-inch long. Their flattened brown, shiny bodies are covered with bristles and spines. They have six long gangly legs. The backward-pointing, comb-like structures behind the head are called ctenidia. Some species have a row of bristles called a genal comb on the lower front of the head. They have compound eyes and their short antennae are normally hidden in grooves. They have specialized “knife-and-straw” mouthparts for ripping into skin and sucking bodily fluids.
There are 18 families and about 2000 species of fleas. They belong to the Order Siphonaptera.

==Where does it live?==

Fleas are found in various habitats--dog dens, gopher burrows, and nests. Some species like the European Rabbit Flea live in nests containing newborn animals. Rodent Fleas occur worldwide, but are found mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. Sticktight Fleas are common in the warmer climates of the southeastern United States. Carnivore Fleas occur in the West. Chigoe fleas occur in tropical areas--Caribbean, Africa and South America.

==What does it eat?==

Fleas are ectoparasites, meaning they live on the outside of their host animal and feed on it without killing it. Before biting they lubricate an area with a special saliva to prevent clotting so the blood moves easily. Larvae feed on detritus left behind by adult fleas.

Rodent Fleas feed on mice, wood rats, and other rodents; a few attack birds. Sticktight Fleas feed on poultry, birds, and mammals. 
Malacopsyllid Fleas are parasites of opossums and rats. Carnivore Fleas feed on large meat-eaters such as wolves and bears.

==How does it defend itself?==

Fleas are easily able to jump away from danger using a structure called the pleural arch in the hind leg. It is made of a rubberlike protein called resilin. When a flea prepares to jump, the pleural arch is compressed to keep muscle energy stored. When released, most of the stored energy is suddenly unleashed. This causes the hind leg to snap straight, lifting the flea’s body. When the tips of the hind legs leave the surface, the flea can stay airborne for as long as 1/10 of a second.
 
A camouflaging layer of dust on sticky new cocoons offers some protection to larvae.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

Fleas undergo complete metamorphosis involving an egg, a legless larva, a pupa, and an adult. Most female fleas lay only a few eggs at a time. A few weeks after hatching from the egg, the larva spins a silken cocoon and pupates inside the cocoon. Adult fleas emerge from the cocoon when they sense the presence of a host. Depending on the temperature, the pupa might transform into an adult flea anywhere from a week to a year. Newly emerged adult fleas can live only about one week without feeding. However, completely developed adults can live inside their puparia, for several months without eating. 
 
Fleas need to eat while mating. Males need food energy for stamina and females need it for ovulating. A few hours after mating, females lay eggs on the host itself or in the nest or burrow.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

Fleas have amazing jumping ability. They can jump 150 times their height upward and 80 times their height horizontally. 

Fleas usually find a host by detecting body heat. They can also detect carbon dioxide from the host's breath. Mouse Fleas are different. Instead of detecting carbon dioxide from the host, they recognize the mouse’s odor. 

Rabbit fleas are sensitive to hosts’ hormones and mate only when the rabbits do. 

Most fleas move freely on and off their hosts, but some like female Chigoes (sand fleas) attach themselves permanently to their hosts. They fix themselves to peoples’ feet, usually under toenails. The resulting swelling can grow to the size of a pea. Female Sticktite Fleas also attach themselves permanently to their hosts.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Flea bites leave itching red welts and the saliva may cause some people to have an allergic reaction. 

Dog Fleas carry tapeworms that harm dogs, cats, and humans. Cat scratch disease is carried by Cat Fleas, but is usually transmitted by a cat scratch. Some flea species carry the Myxoma virus. Fleas that carry the Myxoma virus transmit deadly myxomatosis in rabbits. 
 
Fleas carry the human disease endemic typhus, which killed many soldiers in World War I. Some scientists believe a bacterium carried by rat fleas caused bubonic plague, a disease that ravaged Europe in the Middle Ages. Others believe the plague is transmitted from one rodent to another, but not to humans.

[[File:AmericanCockroach.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An American Cockroach]]
A cockroach is similar to other insects in the way its body is constructed. The body is divided into three parts—head, thorax, and abdomen. Three pairs of legs are attached to the thorax. Most cockroaches have three joints on each leg, which means they have 18 knees!

The skeleton is made of a hard substance called chitin. When a skeleton is on the outside, it is called an exoskeleton. The exoskeleton supports and protects the roach’s insides. Because it is hard, the exoskeleton cannot grow. To get around this problem, a cockroach sheds its exoskeleton several times per year. Then its body grows quickly before the new exoskeleton forms. When the exoskeleton has just been shed, the cockroach’s skin appears very light. Then, after about eight hours, the skin becomes dark again. 

Wings, when present, overlap one another and lay flat over the back, but the tips of the hind pair do not fold. There is a yellowish stripe along the front margin of each fore wing. Males usually have two sets of wings. Females either lack wings or have wings that are too small for flying. There are important sensory organs called cerci on the rear-most segment of the body. 

At first, many cockroach species appear similar to each other, but have distinguishing characteristics when examined more closely. The American cockroach is often referred to as a water bug. It is 1-1/2 inches to 2 inches long. Its flat oval body is reddish brown. It has wings that are fully developed. There are yellowish edges and markings on the exoskeleton. The exoskeleton, known as the pronotum is usually bare or only slightly covered with silky hair. 

The Oriental cockroach has an unusual scallop shape which comes from the way the rear, side corners of its abdomen point outward like edges of a scallop shell. It can be confused with American and Turkistan cockroaches because of its general appearance. However, a closer look will reveal distinguishing cream-colored markings behind the head and around the wings.

The male Oriental cockroach is about 1 inch long and has short, rounded wings. The female is larger than the male and can grow to 1-3/8 inches long. The female has very small wing stubs, so it is flightless. The Oriental cockroach is black or very dark, reddish brown. It is often called Black roach, Black beetle, or water bug because of its dark color and hard body. Another name is Asiatic cockroach. It is also called Shad roach because its young appear in great numbers just when shad are swimming into fresh waters to breed. 

The German cockroach looks shiny and is generally brown or light brown in color. It has long slender legs, long, thin antennae, and wings. The Field cockroach is a species that is often confused with the German cockroach. It is olive in color with a black stripe between the eyes. 
The Madagascar hisser is one of the largest species of cockroach, reaching two to three inches in length when mature. Unlike most cockroach species, it is wingless.

== Where does it live? ==
Most cockroaches live in warm, moist, tropical regions of the world, such as Florida and Mexico. Only a few species live close to people where they can find food easily. They often hide in dark corners of kitchens or near the stove where food gets spilled. 

The majority of cockroach species have lived in the same places for a very long time, far away from people. An example is the Common wood cockroach, the country cousin of the city-dwelling pest cockroaches. It lives in the damp forests of South Africa, in areas where it can hide under logs and stones. It likes moist conditions. Another example is the Giant Cave cockroach from the rain forests of Central America and the Caribbean. It likes to live in caves with bats. Its young burrow into the bat droppings. The species lives outside caves too, where it shelters in hollow logs and trees.

Cockroaches are very successful creatures because they have not adapted exclusively to one habitat or food. They can survive in a variety of places. Entomologists, people who study insects, believe there are about 3,500 different species of cockroaches worldwide. About 55 cockroach species are found in the United States.
In cooler areas cockroaches can be found all the way from Antarctica to Greenland. They find crevasses and corners inside warm buildings such as hospitals, ground-floor storage areas, homes, and basements. They rarely live outdoors in the cooler climates except during very hot, humid summer weather.
California is home to six species of “pest” cockroaches. The German cockroach prefers kitchens, bathrooms, and areas where food is prepared or stored. Brownbanded cockroaches prefer warm areas indoors, behind pictures on walls, in hollow legs of furniture, and cluttered rooms. Smokybrown cockroaches like planter boxes, trees, shrubs, and vegetation. 

A seventh species, the Field cockroach, is not really a pest since it is usually found outdoors in piles of leaf litter and plant debris. It is known to come indoors when it is hot or dry. 
[[File:Bush Cockroach.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A bush cockroach]]
The German cockroach was introduced from Europe and has become widely established in cities. 

The American cockroach was introduced to the United States from Africa as early as 1625. It has spread throughout the world by commerce. It prefers sewers, water meter boxes, and storm drains. It is at home in steam tunnels of large buildings like hospitals and places where animals are raised. 

The Oriental cockroach usually lives outdoors and likes cool damp, dark places such as woodpiles, ivy, ground cover, garages, basements, water meter boxes, and drains. 

Turkistan cockroaches usually live outdoors or in masonry areas away from building. They prefer water meter boxes, cracks between concrete blocks, piles of leaves, and potted plants. 

In northeastern areas of the United States the American cockroach is a common pest. It often infests landfills and survives the winter weather by taking advantage of the warmth generated by piles of trash. 

The unusual Hissing roach is originally from the island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa. It likes to live in rotting logs. It can be found in many parts of the world because people enjoy keeping it as a pet because of its appearance, large size, and interesting behavior.

== What does it eat? ==
We think of dead animals, dung, and dead plant matter as waste to be disposed of. But to a Cockroach and tens of thousands of other insects, these are valuable food resources. A Cockroach is called an omnivore because it eats both plant and animal matter. 

Some species, such as the Wood Cockroach, eat organic matter such as cellulose, a material that is found in trees and plants. The Wood Cockroach is usually found in the woods living under dead logs and stones. It can survive and grow on a diet rich in cellulose. It has overcome the difficulty of digesting cellulose by means of a specialized digestive system.

When a cockroach moves its feelers, it is sniffing the air. It uses its feelers as a nose. It can also smell with its mouth, which is handy for sniffing out food.

In general, cockroaches have powerful jaws to chomp through food. When chewing, the mouth moves side-to-side rather than up and down. The mouth parts point backward. The sense of smell is partly located in the mouth and partly in the feelers. Salivary glands in the mouth produce fluid to help digest food. The fluid from the salivary glands also allows it to spit—a nasty roach habit.

== How does it defend itself? ==
Many cockroach species use defensive secretions that are extremely sticky and sometimes toxic. The upper side of the hindmost segment of the abdomen is covered with a sticky secretion. Small predators, such as centipedes and ants, are disabled when their mouth-parts or legs become entangled in the sticky secretion.
[[File:Madagascan.hissing.cockroach.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|Madagascan hissing cockroach.]]
Inside the outer skeleton, a cockroach has a white substance called fat body. It is similar to the fat we have in our bodies. It stores energy. But, it also helps with digestion in a way that makes poisons, such as insecticides, less harmful.

A cockroach is very sensitive to movement, so it is hard to sneak up on one from behind. One way it senses movement is through two tiny hairs at the tip of the abdomen. These are called cerci. Even a tiny breeze caused by something nearby tells it something is happening. If it is frightened by the movement, it will zoom off in the opposite direction to whatever the cerci have detected.

A cockroach has a pair of compound eyes made up of tiny light sensitive parts called ommatidia. Each one of these acts like a single eye with a six-sided lens. Light passes through the ommatidia, then a nerve takes the image to the brain. The compound eye is very sensitive and can pick up light from different sections of the roach’s surroundings. The brain combines all the individual images from the ommatidia to create one complete image, or picture. Compound eyes are very useful for detecting small movements. As something moves, its image is picked up by a changing cluster of ommatidia. This immediately alerts the cockroach that an enemy is approaching.

The Madagascar cockroach is nicknamed “hisser” because of its ability to force air through small openings the abdomen. It is believed to be the only insect that can hiss in this exact manner. Hissing takes two forms: the disturbance hiss and the fighting hiss. Only the male uses the fighting hiss. The hissing sound is used to frighten away predators and to defend territory. Hissing is also a way to communicate danger to others.

== What stages of metamorphosis does it go through? ==
A cockroach undergoes incomplete metamorphosis. It goes through three stages in the life cycle—egg, nymph, and adult. Just like young of other insect species, a cockroach develops inside a fertilized egg. The eggs are usually glued together by the female to form a packet, or egg case. It contains 16 to 64 eggs depending on the species and on how much food the mother can find. In some cockroach families the female keeps the eggs inside her body and gives birth to live young. The Cape Mountain cockroach does this. In some species the female carries the egg case inside until hatching time is close. Other species deposit their egg cases quite soon after they are formed. 

The young cockroaches that are born alive stay with their mother for a day or so. Most are not born alive. Their mothers lay eggs that they hatch out of. As soon as they hatch they are on their own for survival. At first the newly hatched babies are soft and white. Soon after being exposed to air they harden and turn a darker color.
[[File:Giant brazilian cockroach closeup arp.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Giant Brazilian cockroach.]]
The creature that hatches from the egg is the nymph. It looks like the adult but is smaller and does not have reproductive organs or wings. Each time a nymph needs to grow, it has to shed its skin. This happens between five and fourteen times before adulthood is achieved. As the nymph grows, it gradually develops all of its adult features. The German cockroach nymph sheds its skin about six times in the 95 days it takes to become an adult. Depending on species and conditions, adults can live for as little as a month or for several years.

== What special behavior does it exhibit? ==
A cockroach is a nocturnal creature, moving about at night time. It does not like the light. It tends to congregate with others in corners and generally travels along the edges of walls. It hides in dark, warm areas, especially narrow spaces where surfaces touch it on both sides. An adult German cockroach can hide in a crack 1/16 inch wide! The Madagascar hissing cockroach is an excellent climber and can easily scale smooth glass.

When disturbed, a cockroach will run rapidly. Its speed helps it quickly get away from danger and into a safe hiding place. Certain large tropical cockroaches hold the record for the fastest moving land insects in the world. Many species are wingless and depend on fast running speed to escape enemies. 

A cockroach can do without food for up to a month. It cannot live without water for more than a week. Most of the water it needs comes from food.

== How does this bug affect people? ==
Not all cockroach species are pests. Many live far away from people. As a decomposer they help recycle dead wood. They speed up the breakdown of dead organic matter. 

Cockroaches become pests when they infest homes. They eat all kinds of food and sometimes destroy books, rugs, and clothing. Their presence does not necessarily indicate uncleanliness, but people are repulsed when they find cockroaches where they live. 

Disease-causing organisms can be carried on the legs and bodies. Cockroach excrement and castoff skins contain allergens which cause skin rashes, watery eyes, congestion, asthma, and sneezing. Secreted odors can affect the flavor of various foods. When there are many cockroaches present, these secretions may result in a characteristic, unpleasant odor. 

Cockroaches are able to live in cold conditions but will die if temperatures go much below freezing. When it gets too cold they move in with humans. They are attracted to large buildings with central heat and boiler rooms. The heating of buildings in winter has allowed roaches to spread to all the places where humans live. On the other hand, they cannot survive at very high temperatures, so heat is sometimes used to kill them. People have their homes wrapped in a very large canvas tent, and then blow heated air (140 degrees F) into it for four hours to get rid of the unwelcome guests.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Jumping_spider_nagerhole.jpg|thumb|right|Jumping Spiders actively hunt, and as their name suggests they jump on top of their prey when they attack.]]

==What does it look like?==

Spiders are members of a group of animals without backbones, called the Arthropods, meaning “joint legged.” They are not insects. They belong to the Class Arachnida, along with ticks, mites, and scorpions. 

Spiders never have antennae or wings. Their eight legs have seven segments each. The tip of each leg usually has two or three claws and many bristles or hairs. 

Spiders do not have an internal skeleton or backbone. They instead have an external skeleton, called an exoskeleton. It is tough and fairly rigid like a suit of armour. It is flexible for ease of movement. Muscles are attached to the inside. The exoskeleton supports and protects a spider’s soft delicate internal organs. 

The head and thorax are combined to form the cephalothorax. Sometimes there are spikes, lumps, or odd shapes on it. There is a narrow pedicel (waist) connecting the cephalothorax to the abdomen. When viewed from above a tough covering or shield called a carapace can be seen. 

At the front of the head are chelicerae (jaws). There are sharp teeth and fangs to pierce the exoskeleton of a spider’s prey. Each fang has a tiny hole connected to poison sacs. The fangs move on hinges and inject poison when the spider bites.

Scientists use the number and arrangement of a spider’s eyes to identify its family. There is normally a group of six to twelve simple eyes. One pair of eyes forms an image, while the surrounding eyes detect movement. 

The silk with which a spider builds webs comes from a special organ in the abdomen called a spinneret. Most spiders have three or four pairs of spinnerets to deliver liquid silk to the outside. 

People often confuse spiders with their eight-legged relations called harvestmen which look similar but have a different body arrangement. Unlike spiders, harvestmen have a body with head, thorax and abdomen fused into a single structure.

Spiders range in size from very small to relatively large. The small Branch-tip Spider is only 1/16 of an inch long. The Orb Weaver Spider is 3/8 of an inch long. The large Black-and-Yellow Argiope Spider is 1-1/8 inches long. 

Tarantulas are large hairy spiders. They can be 1-3/8 inches or more in length. Female Desert Tarantulas can be 2-3/4 inches long! 
Brown Recluse Spiders have a leg span about the size of a quarter. Their body is about 3/8 of an inch in length and about 3/16 of an inch in width. They are commonly referred to as &quot;fiddleback&quot; or &quot;violin&quot; spiders because of a violin-shaped marking on the back. Often, this feature is very faint depending on the species and on how recently it has molted. Their color ranges from light tan to dark brown. They are covered with many fine hairs that give them a velvety appearance. They have long, thin, brown legs also covered with fine hairs. Brown Recluse Spiders have six eyes instead of the usual eight.

==Where does it live?==

Spiders are familiar predators found in nearly every habitat. Some species live in damp marshes and some live in dry deserts. Spiders that do not spin webs live in silk-lined burrows, while others have no permanent safe place. Some spiders live part of their lives on the surface of freshwater ponds and lakes. A few dive below the surface where they can survive for short periods of time. Spiders that live along the coastline are able to tolerate immersion in salt water when the tide is in. Only true water spiders, ''Argyroneta'', are able to live completely under water. 

Water Spiders build their homes underwater, spinning silken tents that they fill with bubbles of air. They are found throughout temperate Asia and Europe, including Great Britain and Ireland. They live in lakes, ponds, and ditches. 

American House Spiders live in sheltered corners of houses, barns and other buildings. Their range is throughout the United States and Canada.

Brown Recluse Spiders are native to the United States. They are found mainly in the central Midwestern states southward to the Gulf of Mexico. Occasionally they are transported in materials and may be found outside this area. In favorable habitats, their populations are usually dense. 

Brown Recluse Spiders seek and prefer seclusion. They usually occupy dark, undisturbed sites indoors or outdoors. Indoors, they may be found in attics and basements. They may seek shelter in shoes, folded linens, and behind furniture. Outdoors, brown recluse spiders may be found beneath logs and under loose stones in piles of rocks.
 
Black Widow Spiders live among fallen branches and under many kinds of objects, including furniture and trash. Their range is from Massachusetts to Florida, west to California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. They are most common in the south. 

Tarantulas are nocturnal and hide in dark cavities or burrows during the day. They come out to hunt by touch when it gets dark. They are sometimes called banana spiders, because tropical species arrive in cargoes of fruit. There are about 30 species in the United States.

==What does it eat?==

All spiders feed almost entirely upon prey that they catch for themselves. A few species eat food which has been taken by other spiders. They usually eat other arthropods, mainly insects, woodlice and centipedes. One family feeds exclusively on other spiders. Very large species, such as the “bird-eating” spiders, are able to consume small animals. 

Orb Weaver Spiders coat some of their silk with droplets of sticky liquid to catch prey. Other species create a bewildering maze of dry silk threads where insects get lost. 

Water Spiders anchor their nests to water plants. During the day, they sit in the nest with their front legs in the water, waiting. When a water insect passes by it is quickly pounced on, killed, and drawn into the nest. When they venture out of their nest to hunt, Water Spiders carry an air bubble on the abdomen to breathe from. Their genus name is ''Argyros'', from the Greek for “silver” because the air bubble shines with a silvery hue through the water.  

Some spider species stalk and ambush their victims on the ground. Most spin webs to catch prey in the air. Intricate spider webs can be seen between plants, branches, or buildings. There are many different web shapes, weaving patterns, and web locations. Each spider species spins only one kind of web. Scientists often identify a species by its distinctive web.

American House Spiders spin irregular webs made of sticky strands. Their webs catch dust as well as prey and are known as “cob webs”. 

Black Widow Spiders spin irregular meshed webs with a funnel-shape to hide in.  

Most Tarantulas line the top of their burrows with silk, but do not spin webs to catch prey. They prey on insects, lizards, and other small animals. 

Brown Recluse Spiders are largely scavengers, preferring dead insects.

==How does it defend itself?==

Most species have poor vision and feel movement through body hairs or slits in the exoskeleton.
Brown Recluse Spiders are not aggressive, and normally bite only when crushed, touched or disturbed. There are reports of people having been bitten in bed after rolling over onto one of these spiders. Others have been bitten after accidentally touching one while cleaning storage area.

Black Widow Spiders are the most feared of all spiders. Female Black Widow venom is very poisonous to people. Despite their reputation, they often attempt to escape rather than bite, unless they are guarding an egg mass. Males do not bite.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

Spiders undergo simple metamorphosis with only three main growth stages, egg, spiderling, adult. The pupal stage is omitted and the young spiderlings often look like small versions of adults. Because the exoskeleton cannot stretch, spiders can grow only by shedding or molting the exoskeleton several times.

Most spiders lay eggs in silken sacs. Egg sacs may be placed in the web or attached to twigs or leaves. Some species carry the sac around until the eggs hatch. Young spiderlings are often cannibalistic, eating their own kind. 

Female American House Spiders spin pear-shaped brownish silken cocoons around the egg mass and hang it in a web. 

Female tarantulas continue to molt after reaching maturity and may live to twenty years.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

Some spiders have up to six types of silk glands to make silk for different uses. They use silk to catch and bind prey, to build webs and cocoons, and to spin draglines. Many spiders pull a dragline when walking. It serves as a life line for jumping clear of danger. Dragline silk is twice as elastic as nylon.

All young spiders release long silken strands, which they use like a parachute to ride the wind from one place to another. This process is called parachuting.

Spiders save their prey for a later meal by wrapping it in hundreds of thin threads called a swathing band.

Female Black Widow Spiders often eat the male after mating, earning the name “widow.”

When young Water Spiders hatch, they leave the nest covered with bubbles trapped by hydrophobic (water repelling) hair so they can breathe under water until they find a nesting place of their own.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Few spiders bite people. The venom of most is harmless. Some South American species of Tarantulas have deadly venom, but the bite of North American Tarantulas is no more dangerous to people than a wasp or bee sting. 

Spiders are part of folklore and legend in many parts of the world. They are considered beneficial to humans because they help keep insect populations in check. They help to balance nature in general.

[[Image:Scorpion 01.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A scorpion from South Africa]]

It resembles a lobster or cray fish though much smaller (about one to two inches) in the United States, with a tail that curls upwards with a potent stinger at the tip. Scorpions have four pairs of legs and two large pincers at the front.

==Where does it live?==
Scorpions can be found in many parts of the world, including many states of America, Canada, southern England, Australia, areas of South America and Africa, In the Sahara Desert, and in the Alps, even the Himalayas and amongst other places. It prefers humid places and loves water.

==What does it eat?==
Scorpions usually eat small arthropods and insects, using their pincers to catch their food. 
Depending on how toxic their venom is and the size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with venom which will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it.
It eats insects, bugs, animal, snakes and in rare case even fish. If it can't find a pray in the woods, under stones and open areas it will go into the water to hunt for fish.

==How does it defend itself?==
Its main defense is hiding; when confronted its tail arcs and is ready to inflict a nasty sting that is rarely fatal in humans. The scorpion also has a pair of pincers and a pair of large claws in its front. However, it uses these mainly to capture and eat prey.

[[Image:Scorpionwithyoung.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A scorpion carrying its young on her back.]]
==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
Scorpions don't exactly go through metamorphosis. Actually, scorpions go through a process called ''vivipary'' which is a relatively small process. Instead of laying eggs like most other insects and arachnids do, scorpions develop their young inside and give live birth, much like how humans reproduce. After birth, the scorpion's young stay on the mother's back for nourishment. Scorpions then stay with their mothers until they have reached at least their first moult. ''Moulting'' is when a scorpion sheds its hard covering and exposes its soft body, allowing the scorpion to grow itself, as well as grow a new hard covering. After one or more moults, the scorpion is finally independent from its mother and has reached its fully-grown stage.

[[Image:Euscorpius_fg01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A scorpion fluoresces (glows) under a black light. Under regular light, this scorpion is black.]]

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
The scorpion is a nocturnal creature, meaning it rests in the daytime and comes out to eat at night. It will usually try to avoid light at all times, and is adapted to digging and staying underground when it rests.

==How does this bug affect people?==
Scorpions are generally harmless and timid, and only usually use their sting for killing prey or defending themselves. Generally, they will run from danger and people or remain still.

Most species of scorpions produce venom that is especially designed to work on other insects that it eats for food. This means that it is completely harmless to people, causing only swelling and numbness when stung. Some species of scorpions, however, produce venom that can be deadly to humans.

==What does it look like?==
[[Image:Centipede.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A centipede crawling around.]]

Centipedes have between 15 and almost 200 segments, with one pair of legs for each segment. Most centipedes have less than fifty segments, and so less than one hundred legs. They are flat ''arthropods''. The head has two antennae and a pair of mandibles. The furthest forward, or ''anterior'', segment has a pair of venomous claws. The largest known centipede, the ''Amazonian giant centipede'', grows over one foot long. However, the most common centipedes are only a few inches long.  A centipede is usually between a brown and a red color.  Some types of centipedes are blind.

==Where does it live?==
[[File:Centipede, Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|One of the world's largest centipedes.]]
Centipedes live all over the world, in South America, North America, Africa, and Europe.  Some of the largest centipedes are located in South America (see left).  Centipedes prefer moist, dark, and cool habitats.  The centipede is mainly a nocturnal creature, but may be seen during the day.

==What does it eat?==
A centipede is a carnivorous creature, and eats prey that is available to it.  It is not well known exactly what it eats, but any soft-bodied, reasonably sized creatures are common in the diet.  It is believed that for some species of centipedes worms are the main source of food.  Some larger species of centipedes can eat reptiles, small mammals, birds, and bats!  Some centipedes even eat each other!  To kill their prey, a centipede will grab it with its jaws and inject a poisonous bite to kill it.

==How does it defend itself?==
Centipedes have many self-defense mechanisms against predators such as beetles, spiders, and snakes.  A centipede can pinch a predator with its back legs or poison an animal with its bite, but it has some more interesting defensive tricks.  A centipede can &quot;drop&quot; its legs that are being pinched by a predator and run away, leaving the predator with nothing but a few legs!  Some centipedes also emit a gas that can hurt predators.  Centipedes also blend into the environment quite nicely, and are very quick!  That centipede is one tough arthropod!

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
[[Image:Centipede.protecting.eggmass.-.marshal.hedin.jpg|thumb|right|A centipede protecting its eggs.]]
Males deposit a mass that contains the necessary components for reproduction.  Males will then court females and lead them to this mass, or leave the mass for a female to find.  A female will then take in this mass and get ready to lay eggs.  In colder climates, eggs are laid during the spring or summer.  In warmer climates however, there seems to be no specific breeding pattern.  Around 10-60 eggs are laid, depending on the species.  Eggs are laid in the ground or in nests.  While some centipedes just bury their eggs, other types will guard the eggs until they hatch.  It may take a couple of months before the eggs hatch into larvae.  The lifespan of a centipede varies greatly between the different types, but some can live between 5 and 6 years!

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
Centipedes are indeed quite interesting creatures!  The ability to lose legs and kill much larger animals make it very unique.  The centipede is also nocturnal, mostly roaming at night.  Walking barefoot at night would give me the creeps!

==How does this bug affect people?==
The centipede can be a nuisance as its bites can be painful to humans.  There is only one recorded death as a result of a centipede, but the victim was bit in the head.  Poisons usually are not strong enough to hurt humans, but some bites can numb, swell, or discolor the skin.  If a person is allergic, they should seek medical attention.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Millipede.jpg|thumb|Rusty millipede (''Trigoniulus corallinus'')]]

==What does it look like?==
Have you ever been playing in a sandbox and seen a tiny critter with seemingly thousands of legs?  Did it curl into a ball when you picked it up?  You were holding a millipede.  Millipedes are arthropods that have a large number of legs - two pairs of legs per segment. The name comes from the Latin roots milli (&quot;thousand&quot;) and ped (&quot;foot&quot;). Millipedes do not have a thousand legs, although common species have between 80 and 400 legs (two or four pairs of legs per segment).  Millipedes range in length from around 1.25 centimeters to 16.5 centimeters.  Millipedes have very many short legs, which makes them rather slow.  Millipedes, however, are powerful diggers! With their legs, they burrow underground, head first.  Millipedes have flat, lensed eyes on the side or front of their heads.  From birth, they gradually grow and add more legs at two pairs per segment.

==Where does it live?==
Most millipedes live underground. They have poor eyesight, because they don't need to see in the dark. 

There are millipedes all over the world. The largest species is giant African millipede (Archispirostreptus gigas).  One species of millipede( Pneumodesmus newmani) was the first known land creature!  It lived around 428 million years ago, that's a long time!

==What does it eat?==
Millipedes are scavengers, and eat mostly dead vegetation.  Most millipedes eat decaying leaves and other dead plant matter.  They will eat anything from rotting leaves to apples, to potataoes!  When eating, a millipede will moisten the food with secretions, and then scraping it in with the jaws.

==How does it defend itself?==
[[File:Becho.Galicia.070621 03.jpg|thumb|left|A millipede curled up in a defensive position.]]

When a millipede is in danger, it curls into a tight coil — protecting its delicate legs inside its armoured body.  The millipede lacks the ability to bite or sting, so this is it's primary protection.  Many species also put out poisonous liquid or gas through microscopic pores along the sides of their bodies.  These poisons can burn ants and other insects that are attacking it.  Any effects on humans are usually minor, but can cause skin irritation.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
Most millipedes go through a simple stage of metamorphosis.  During winter, adults keep safe and warm until spring.  During spring, male and female millipedes become active and mate.  Females will then lay eggs, covered in a sticky substance, in the soil.    Larvae usually resemble small adults just days after hatching, and grow gradually in size.  In other species, females do not lay eggs, but give birth to their young.  Millipedes will take between 21 and 25 weeks to develop out of the basic stages, and grow for 2 to 5 years.  After maturing, they will live for several more years.
[[Image:NarceusAmericanusMillipede.jpg|thumb|The North American millipede ''[[wikipedia:Narceus americanus|Narceus americanus]]'', with many pairs of legs.]]

==What special behaviour does it exhibit?==
The millipede burrows down into dirt in a wave-like pattern.  It moves down a tunnel head first.  While burrowing, millipedes seem to have the ability to restructure and secure the dirt around them.  Millipedes also shed old exoskeletons as they grow larger.

==How does this bug affect people?==
Though it may seem small, the millipede is very important to the ecosystem!  Since it is a scavenger, a millipede cleans up dead matter from the environment.  The millipede is like a garbage man for the Earth!  Occasionally, the millipede can be a pest as it eats plant stems or leaves.  The creature may seem creepy with all those legs, but most won't do any harm at all.  Be careful though, all those legs may tickle your skin!

The hunter's fire is a cooking fire.  The logs on top are spaced close enough together such that a pot, pan, or Dutch oven can be placed on them.  Try to lay it as level as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Camp Reflector Fire.svg|thumb|300px|Reflector Fire]]
This fire can be used for baking, though it is not as efficient as a reflector oven (which is has a metallic reflecting surface and often surrounds the item.  The fire itself can be of any other form, and is placed in front of the reflector.  The item to be baked is placed between the reflector and the fire.  This fire is also good for getting oneself warm.  The reflector can also be a large rock.  If you sit (or sleep) between the reflector and the fire, the side of you facing the fire will be warmed directly, while the reflector throws heat to the opposite side.  Very toasty.

If making the reflector from logs, the vertical members should be driven deeply into the ground to support the weight of the horizontal members.  You can also use rocks to support them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Camp Star Fire.svg|thumb|300px|Star Fire]]
The advantage of this fire is that the logs can be of any length, avoiding the need to cut them up.  As the ends of the logs burn, they are pushed into the fire.  The fire is lit at the center of the star.  If the logs are propped up on the fire ring, gravity will feed them in as they burn.

name=Veela|
type=Magical being|
features=Infinitely attractive women|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 8|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Veela''''', who are the team mascots of the Bulgarian National Quidditch team in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], take the form of inhumanly beautiful and infinitely desireable women.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Veela seem to have the ability to change between two states. In their normal state, they appear to be women, with skin that &quot;shines moon-bright&quot; and white-gold hair that &quot;fans out behind them without wind&quot;. They are incredibly beautiful, though inhumanly so, but when they dance, that apparent inhumanity no longer matters. Like the legendary Sirens, Veela music and dance has the power to cloud men's minds and make them want to do insane and self-destructive things in order to secure the notice of these desirable creatures.

When they get angry, though, they change into beings with heads like birds, with sharp, cruel, beaks and scaly wings, and apparently have the ability to throw fireballs. &quot;And that is why you should never go for looks alone,&quot; as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] comments.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 18|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], it is revealed that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|wand]] has, as its active magical core, the hair of a Veela. Fleur says that it is from her grandmother, which tells us both that Veela and humans can interbreed, and that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 16|earlier guess]] that there was some Veela in Fleur's background is correct.

== Analysis ==

Veela are mentioned also in the Muggle mythos. There, they are shapeshifters, though most alluring in their human form. Predominantly women, though there are some males, they are rather mischievous creatures. They enjoy luring men away from their homes or away from their journeys, and dancing or singing so that the men are compelled to join them. Men so entranced end up being led into fairy rings and forced to dance until they die or one of their friends pulls them out. We note that this magical luring effect is referred to in archaic texts with the fine old word &quot;glamour,&quot; and have used the same term in this text in places where it seems appropriate.

We do see quite a few males so entranced in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', though none of them are convinced to dance until they die; we do note that Ron and Harry almost jump from the Top Box at the Quidditch World Championship, that the referee at that match abandons his job, and that Ron almost volunteers to fly a broomstick to the moon shortly afterwards. It is interesting that Ron is more susceptible than Harry. Perhaps Harry's resistance to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] is somehow related to his lack of susceptibility to the Veela glamour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many people prefer using a monitor as an alternative to a [[Operating System Design/Processes/Semaphores | semaphore]].

A Monitor is essentially a class with private methods, plus a queue.  Processes that want to enter a monitor (i.e., run *any* of the private methods) must wait in the queue. Only when there are no processes in the monitor (i.e., no one is running any of the private methods) is a process allowed into the queue. The monitor itself runs the single threaded portions.  This guarantees that there can only be one process executing inside a monitor at any one time.

A common bug with semaphores is a process that acquires a semaphore, does what it needs to do, but accidentally fails to release the semaphore.
That process may have finished long before the programmer notices that other processes are deadlocked, waiting forever for someone to release the semaphore.

Monitors make this common problem impossible.
It is still possible for a system using monitors to deadlock, but only when the process is stuck in an infinite loop inside the monitor, which is much easier to debug than a process that seemed to finish successfully a long time ago.

The '''Original Texas-Style Chili''' version of [[Cookbook:chili con carne|chili con carne]] contains no [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] at all, except [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]]. If using fresh peppers, they should have been prepared by being [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]], peeled, and chopped. If using dried peppers, they need to be soaked in hot water for 1 hour before being chopped.

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs.]] (1.3 {{kg}}) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or other [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]] (55 {{g}}) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] kidney [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]] pods (previously skinned and blistered, or else buy sun-dried chili peppers)
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*1 tablespoon crushed [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Tabasco Sauce|Tabasco sauce]] (optional but frequently included)
*2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves, chopped (or more, to taste)
*2 heaping tablespoons ''[[Cookbook:Corn Masa|masa harina]]''

Many of the above quantities may be somewhat adjusted up or down, depending on personal taste.

==Procedure==
#Sear beef in a little cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] (not [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]) until lightly browned. Drop the seared beef, [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]], and chile pods in a large iron [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or pot (at least four [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]]), and enough water (the reserved &quot;pepper water&quot; if you prepared the pods yourself) to keep the meat from burning. Bring to a boil, then lower heat, cover, and [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]] about 30 minutes.
#Take pot off the stove and add spices and garlic. Put back on the stove, bring to a boil again, lower heat, and simmer another hour, keeping the lid on as much as possible. Stir when necessary, but remember that too much stirring will tear the meat. Add a little more water if anything seems seriously in danger of burning (but as little water as possible).
#Take pot off the stove and skim off all or most of the grease. (The old-timers left it all.) Mix in ''masa harina'', which &quot;tightens&quot; or thickens the chili con carne and adds a subtle [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamale]]-like flavor. Simmer about 30 minutes more, until meat is done. Do a lot of tasting during this time, (1) to adjust the seasoning, and (2) just because a chili cook should do a lot of tasting. Serves 6-8.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] is simply bite-size - traditionally, it was the size of a [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecan]] nut - or coarsely ground, with 1/2-inch plate holes in a meat grinder as standard. It must always be [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Venison|venison]], or other mature meats. Stewing meat also works well. Prime beef or [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]], on the other hand, are not suitable for chili con carne, as they tend not to remain solid. 
*Many cooks omit the [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] as being much too greasy, although it does add flavor.
*Ancho or Anaheim peppers are recommended. For an &quot;elevated&quot; flavor, use four pepper pods per pound of meat; for a milder &quot;beginners&quot; version, use only 2-3 pods. 
*[[Cookbook:Chili Powder|Chili powder]] is a barely adequate substitute in the original recipe, but lacks the subtle sting of the pods. A heaping [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of chili powder is the approximate equivalent of one average-size chili pod.
*Crushed tortilla chips can be substituted for masa harina (this is what Alton Brown did on the Food Network show Good Eats)

This is a modern version of '''Jailhouse Chili''', as served in the Texas prison system. In the early part of the 20th century, those likely to regularly spend time in local detention facilities in the [[cookbook:Southwestern cuisine|American Southwest]] were said to rate the accommodations among themselves by the quality of the [[cookbook:Chili con carne|chili con carne]] they were served. This became a matter of local pride and competition with other communities.

==Ingredients==
*25 [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs.]] (11 {{kg}}) coarse-ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*1/2 lb. (225 {{g}}) [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
*1/4 lb. (110 {{g}}) [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
*1/8 lb. (55 {{g}}) [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*2 handfuls crushed dried red [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]]
*1/2 lb. (225 {{g}}) finely-chopped [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]

==Procedure==
#Sear beef in a little cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] (not [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]) until lightly browned. Drop the seared beef and chili peppers in a large [[cookbook:stock pot|stock pot]], and add enough water to keep the meat from burning. Bring to a boil, then lower heat, cover, and [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]] about 30 minutes.
#Take pot off the stove and add spices and garlic. Put back on the stove, bring to a boil again, lower heat, and simmer another 90 minutes, keeping the lid on as much as possible. Stir when necessary, but remember that too much stirring will tear the meat. Add a little more water if anything seems seriously in danger of burning (but as little water as possible).
#Take pot off the stove and skim off all or most of the grease. Serve hot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Earth existed for millions of years before the time of the dinosaurs.  This time is known as the Paleozoic Era while the dinosaur time is known as the Mesozoic Era.

There were strange and wonderful creatures living in each of the seven periods of the Paleozoic Era:  Precambrian, Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian.

The types of creatures that lived then were reptiles, amphibians, fish, arthropods and mammal-like reptiles.

In the late Permian a big extinction wiped out 90% of life on Earth. It all started 543 million years ago. Before this time there was a time called the Precambrian, it lasted for four billion years. The Permian extinction that wiped out 90% of all life on Earth gave the reptiles space to spread out quickly and evolution led them to develop into dinosaurs over millions of years.

===The Precambrian period===

This period was the period from which the Earth was first formed. It lasted billions of years and for almost all of it there was no life.  However, for reasons we don't yet understand life suddenly began. It started out only as small, one-celled creatures. Soon they evolved into more complicated creatures at the start of the Cambrian period.

===The Cambrian period===
The Cambian started 543-490 million years ago. At this time life developed in the seas, not on dry land.

Some of the first creatures to live on Earth in the Cambrian were haikouichthys, trilobites, jellyfish and a creature called Anomalocaris. Haikouikthys were 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) long. They had a primitive backbone, scavenged meat and lived 535 million years ago in the area now known as China. Haikouicthys also was one of the first vertabrates

The trilobites were the Paleozoic's big success story; they could be 5 millimeters- 80 centimeters long (0.2-32 inches). The trilobites were scavengers too and they lived 520-248 million years ago in the Cambrian period to the Permian period. They could be found all over the world.

The Anomalocaris was two meters (6.5 feet) long and it had a hard shell that could split off if it was bent too far. Anomalocaris was a carnivore. Anomalocaris lived in the areas now known as North America, China and Australia.

=== The Ordovician period===

The Ordovician Period lasted from about 510 to 440 million years ago.  The land of the super-continents did not support life, so all the creatures lived in the oceans and seas.  Some creatures that developed in the Ordovician had backbones and were the first vertebrates. Some common non-vertebrate animals from this period were corals, sea urchins, trilobites, sponges, arthropods and jellyfish.

One creature of the Ordovician Period was called Cameraceras.  Cameraceras was a cone like creature that was 10-11 meters (33-36 feet) long.  It lived in the ocean and is related to the modern day squid. Another creature of the Ordovician is Megalograptus, Megalograptus was one metre(3.25 feet) long. Megalograptus was carnivorous and was found in the area now known as North America.

=== The Silurian period===
The Silurian started 433-417 million years ago. The first plants started to evolve, life finally
reaching land. The land creatures were similar to today's millipedes and centipedes. As the plants died and the bugs and fungus decomposed them, the first dirt started to arrived. Silurian fish like cephalaspis were bony-headed fish. While life on land was going slowly, the water saw the arrival of massive arthropods like ''Brontoscorpio'' (meaning thunder scorpion), which was 99cm long. The fish back then had a good reason to have large head armour: since bones were still primitive, the fish used bony plates to protect their brain. Fish like cephalaspis had a very good sense of navigation and memory. Although there were benefits to having head wear, there was also the down side the boniness slowed the fish down, making them vulnerable to attack by ''Brontoscorpio''.

=== The Devonian Period===
During the Devonian Period, fish may have evolved feet and lungs, and became the first amphibians and the first vertebrate to walk on land. The Devonian also saw the success for the placoderms, a group of bony fish with scissor-like jaws and big bony teeth. The placoderms eventually became extinct at the end of the Devonian. On land, plants started to get big and turned into the first trees and since there would be nothing to eat the trees for the next hundred million years the trees turned into vast forests.

=== The Carboniferous period===

This period was a time were giant insects ruled. The earth's oxygen content was 20% higher than today, and this probably explains why they got so big. As well as giant insects, many other huge creatures roamed the land, such as Eryops, a large carnivorous amphibian.

=== The Permian Period===
Mammal-like reptiles started evolving such as ''Cynognathus'', ''Dimetrodon'' and ''Placerias''. Near the end of the Permian the earth's land formed the super continent Pangea, and started to dry up causing creatures like Scutosaurus to search the planet for water. The end of the Permian also saw an extinction worse than the K-T Extinction. The K-T extinction killed 75% of life on earth, but this extinction killed 90% of life on earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The nervous system is divided between the peripheral nevous system, or PNS, and the central nervous system, or CNS. The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system is made up of the spinal nerves, the autonomic nervous system and the cranial nerves
==Terminology==
	To refer to various positions in the nervous system, a set of spatial terms are used. In the spinal cord, dorsal is closer to the back of a person, and ventral is closer to the person's chest, or front. Closer to the brain is referred to as rostral, and closer to the end of the spinal cord is caudal. In the brain, superior and dorsal refer to a position closer to the top of the head, and inferior and ventral refer to a position closer to the bottom or base of the head. Also, in the brain, to refer to something closer to the face, it is called rostral or anterior, and something closer to the back of the head, it is called posterior or caudal. Throughout the nervous system, concentric strucutures are found, and to refer a structure closer to the outside of the head, the term lateral is used, and closer to the center of the brain is called medial. In addition, slices called sections of structures can show three dimensions of the structure. A section that would cut ear to ear and nose to back of the head is called a horizontal section. A section parallel to the face is a coronal section, and a section that could separate the two hemispheres of the brain is a sagittal section.
==Neural Development &amp; Structures==
===Neuralation===
	In the beginning of neural development (neurulation) in a growing embryo, there are three layers: the endoderm, which becomes the viscera; the mesoderm, which becomes the bones and muscle; and the ectoderm, which becomes the skin and nervous system. The disctinction of the nervous system appears after three weeks. The neural plate becomes a groove, which then differentiates to a tube, which becomes the CNS, and a crest, which becomes the PNS. In the mesoderm, the are somites (masses of tissue) that become the spinal cord vertebrae and the somatic muscles.

===First Phase: Rostral===
	The first phase of neural differentiation occurs on the rostral end of the neural tube (the tube becomes the brain) which forms three separate vesicles: the prosencephalon becomes the forebrain; the mesencephalon becomes the midbrain, and the rhombencephalon becomes the hindbrain. The forebrain, or prosencephalon, develops into two pairs of vesicles, the optic vesicles and the telencephalic vesicles, and an unpaired diencephalon. The optic vesicles, which are parts of the brain, form into optic stalks and optic cups, which become the optic nerve and retina. 
===Telencephalon===
	The telencephalon differentiation occurs in 4 stages: First, the telencephalon grows over and around the diencephalon. Next, vesicles begin to form ventrally to become the olfactory bulbs, and then the gray matter differentiates into the different structures of the telencephalon. Finally, the white matter, the fatty tissue or myelin, forms around axonal inputs and outputs of the cells in the telencephalon. The telencephalon contains the cerebral cortex and the basal telencephalon while the diencephalon contains the thalamus and the hypothalamus. In the paired telencephalon are the lateral ventricles as well. The diencephalon contains the third ventricle. The white matter that develops is involved with three different systems: the cortical white matter connects different neurons in the cortex. The corpus collosum connects the two hemispheres, and the internal capsule connects the cortex to the diencephalon.
===Forebrain===
	The forebrain can be seen to have many different structures. The differentiation of the telecephalon results in a pair of cerebral hemispheres that contain the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulbs, basal ganglia, hippocampus and amygdala. the cerebral cortex is associated with cognition and motor and sensory functions. The olfactory bulbs relay olfactory information to the cortex. the basal ganglia contributes to the fine tuning of voluntary motor control. The hippocampus is associated with the formation of short term memories, and the amygdala is associated with fear and emotion. In the diencephalon, there is the thalamus and hypothalamus. The thalamus is a sensory relay to cortex, and the hypothalamus maintains control of the autonomic nervous system and endocrine systems.

===Midbrain===
	The midbrain (mesencephalon) differentiates into the tectum, which contains the superior and inferior colliculus, the tegmentum, which contains the dopamine reward system (contributes to motor control), and the cerebral aqueduct, which connects two ventricles and contains cererbro-spinal fluid.
===Hindbrain===
	The hindbrain (rhombencephalon) differentiates into two structures on its rostral end, and one on its caudal end. In the rostral end, the rhombic lips swell and fuse to become the cerebellum. The ventral rhombencephalon becomes the pons. The caudal  end of the ventral rhombencephalon becomes the medulla. In the hindbrain, the fourth ventricle is also formed, connecting to the cerbral aqueduct. The hindbrain acts as a bidirectional relay between the forebrain and the spinal cord. The cerebellum controls movement and coordination, and it is where inputs from the spinal cord and cortex converge to coordinate motions. The pons acts as relay to the cerebellum: 90% of axons from the cerebral cortex synapse in the pons. The medulla is a relay area for the somatic sensory, autonomic sensory, and the motor nuclei.
===Spinal Cord===
	The spinal cord is formed from the caudal end of the neural tube, and it is characterized by two colors. The gray matter contains the dorsal horns, which contains sensory axons and terminals, an intermediolateral column, and the ventral horns, which carry motor axons and neurons. The white matter is made of three different columns carrying ascending sensory signals and descending motor signals.
===Four Regions of Dermatomes===
	The somatic motor system in the spine is divided into four regions. Starting from the top of the spine, the cervical division (C1 through C8), the thoracic division (T1-T12), the lumbar division (L1-L5), and the sacral division (S1-S5, Coc1). There are two spinal nerves coming out of each side of each spinal column, and the dorsal nerve carries sensory signals to the brain, and the ventral nerve carries motor signals from the brain. 
===Autonomic Nervous System===
	The autonomic nervous system in the spine has two major divisions that act in opposite ways. The sympathetic division prepares the body for action (fighting, fleeing etc...)  while the parasympathetic division causes the body to relax.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many different sensory systems. The somatic sensory system mediates the sense of touch, and the proprioceptive division relays information about internal parts of the body. The auditory system provides hearing, and located in the same area is the vestibular system, which provides a sense a balance. The olfactory system and the gustatory system mediate the sense of smell and taste. The conversion of outside signals to chemical signals in the brain is referred to as transduction, and sensory transduction in the various systems shares a few characteristics. Sensory receptors (neurons, in the somatic sensory and olfactory systems, and epithelial cells in the visual, auditory, gustatory systems) synapse on an interneuron that relays signals to the brain. Perceptions can vary in four ways: modality (auditory, visual, etc.), intensity, duration and location. Variations in sensation are encoded in variations in action potentials. 
===Modalities===
	There are five major modalities: vision, touch, smell, taste and hearing. In each modality, there may be submodalities (touch, pressure and temperature, in touch.) Each modality has a specific receptor. Vision transduction requires photoreceptors; audition, mechanoreceptors; taste and smell, chemoreceptors, and the touch system uses mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors and nociceptors (pain receptors.) Each one of these modalities has its own pathway, and a relay through the subnuclei of the thalamus, and eventually terminate in a specific area of the cortex. 
===Intensity===
	The instensity of a stimulus has a threshold; that is, there is a minimum stimulus required for its perception. The intensity is encoded in two ways: frequency of action potential and population. A stronger stimulus will cause a higher frequency of action potentials. In addition a greater stimulus will affect a larger area, causing a larger number of cells to respond to the stimulus, and this is perceived as a more instense stimulus.
===Skin's Mechanoreceptors===
	Skin receptors include four types of mechanical receptors that have different field sizes and speeds of adaptation. There are two mechanoreceptors with large field sizes: pacinian corpuscles and ruffini's endings. While they both respond to stimuli from a large area of the skin, and  therefore are not useful for locating stimuli accurately, pacinian corpuscles' speed of adaption is fast, and ruffini's endings adaptation is slow. The term speed of adaptation refers to how quickly the mechanoreceptor respond to stimuli. Slow adaptation means that the receptor is slow to give a response to a stimuli, and when a stimulus is removed, the response falls slowly. Fast adaptation means that the receptor will respond quickly, but will not give a sustained response. Two mechanoreceptors have a small receptive field: merkel's discs and meissner's corpuscles. Merkel's discs respond slowly, and meissner's corpuscles respond quickly. In addition to these four receptors, the skin contains nociceptors (pain receptors, usually free nerve endings) and thermoreceptors (sensitive to temperature.)
===Dermatomes===
	Dermatomes are the receptive field of a particular section of the spinal cord. Specifically, the area of the skin that makes up the receptive field of a spinal nerve, dorsal root and spinal segment. 
===Speed of Adaption===
	All receptors will adapt to stimulus, i.e. the receptor's potential amplitude decreases with continued stimulation. The slowly adapting receptors experience tonic (continued) activation while the rapidly adapting receptors respond only with the onset and offset of the stimulus, but not in between. This difference discriminates between transient and persistent sensory signals.
===Types of Nerve Projections===
	There are four types of primary afferents (nerves fibers): the largest is the A alpha, whose diameter is usually between 13 and 20 micrometers. Signals travel  between 80 and 120 m/s in A alpha afferents and carry information from proprioceptors in the skeletal muscles. A beta afferents are 6 - 12 micrometers in diameter and carry information from the skin's mechanoreceptors at 35 - 75 m/s. A gamma afferents are 1 - 5 micrometers in diameter and carry information about pain and temperature at 5 - 30 m/s. All three A type afferents are myelinated, which increases the speed of transmission. The fourth type of afferent is C, which is unmyelinated, .2 - 1.5 micrometers in diameter, and carries information about temperature, pain, and itch at .2 - 5 m/s. 
===Somatic Sensory System Paradigm===
	There are a few elements shared by every modality of the somatic sensory system. Starting with a receptor, the sensory system transfers information via a primary sensory neuron to a sensory pathway which then carries the information to the brain. Receptors that relay information on touch and pressure are mechanical; for temperature, there are thermoreceptors, and pain receptor are called nociceptors. The primary sensory neurons are the first neurons in the sensory system to respond and are called the first order neurons. These project through the dorsal root ganglia to synapse inside the spinal cord, and on the other (peripheral end) is a receptor. At this point, each modality follows its own pathway. Mechanoreceptors follow the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway and the second neuron in the pathway is found in the medulla. Thermoreceptors and nociceptors follow the spinothalamic pathway and their second order neurons are found in the dorsal horn of the spinal segment corresponding to their dermatome. 
===Pathways===
====Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscal Pathway====
	The dorsal column-medial leminiscal pathway, used to transmit touch and proprioceptive information, first goes up the ipsilateral (same side as input) dorsal column until it reaches the medulla. The projection synapses in the dorsal column nuclei (includes the Gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus.) Next, the pathway crosses to the contralateral side (opposite side of the input) and continues to the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus. After synapsing in the thalamus, still on the contralateral side, the pathway continues to the primary somatic sensory cortex.
====Spinothalamic Pathway====
	The spinothalamic pathway, relaying information about temperature and pain, enters the spinal cord through the ipsilateral dorsal horn and immediately crosses, and the projection synapses on the secondary neuron in the contralateral side. The pathway proceeds all the way up the spine to the ventral posterior nuclei of the thalamus. After the thalamus, the pathway continues to the primary somatic sensory cortex (on the contralateral side.) In the somatic sensory cortex, every part of the body is represented by a particular area, i.e. each part of the body constitutes the receptive field of some group of neurons in the somatic sensory cortex.

'''Pedernales River Chili''' was American President Lyndon Johnson's favorite [[cookbook:chili con carne|chili con carne]] recipe. It was named after the location of his Texas Hill Country ranch. The recipe calls for leaving out the traditional [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] (on doctor's orders after his heart attack while he was U.S. Senate Majority Leader) and also adds [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]. LBJ preferred [[Cookbook:Venison|venison]], when available, over beef; Hill Country deer were thought to be leaner than most. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson had it printed up on cards as a mail-out because of the many thousands of requests the White House received for the recipe.
The recipe is originally from Zephyr Wright, the Johnson's family cook.

==Ingredients==
*4 [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs]] (1.8 {{kg}}) course ground [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], [[Cookbook:venison|venison]] preferred
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], finely chopped
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] (preferable to fresh [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], which grows wild in central Texas)
*1 teaspoon powdered [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
*6 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]] (or more, to taste)
*2 cans (16-[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]]/500[[Cookbook:g|g]]) whole [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] 
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (470 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) hot water

==Procedure==
#[[cookbook:browning|Brown]] meat, onion, and garlic in a large [[Cookbook:skillet|skillet]]. 
#Add rest of ingredients and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover, and [[Cookbook:simmer|simmer]] for about an hour. 
#Skim off grease. Serves 10-12.

'''New Mexico Chile Verde''' is the most popular version of [[cookbook:chili con carne|chili con carne]] in the U.S. state of New Mexico. While there apparently is no canonical recipe for Chile Verde (''green chile''), &lt;!--- that I have been able to find---&gt; all versions involve roasting fresh green chile peppers and cooking them slowly with meat (usually [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] but also [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], or [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]]), [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], and [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]. The consistency is usually much thinner than Texas-style chili and is sometimes listed on restaurant menus as &quot;green chile stew&quot;. In addition to being eaten by the bowl (sometimes with [[Cookbook:Pinto Bean|pinto beans]] or diced [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] added), Chili Verde often is treated as a condiment and is ladled over [[Cookbook:Burrito|burritos]], [[Cookbook:Enchilada|enchiladas]], [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburgers]], and [[Cookbook:Fried Eggs|fried eggs]].

The following is a representative recipe for Chile Verde, but there are many variations:

==Ingredients==
*2 green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]], chopped
*4 large, mild green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chile peppers]]
*5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] water
*1 large can (16-[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]]) stewed [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|bouillon]] granules
*1 tablespoon dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds (''not'' powdered)
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
*8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]] ground [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped
*6 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240ml) all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

==Procedure==
#Combine bell peppers, chili peppers, water, tomatoes, bouillon, oregano, cumin, and coriander in a large pot. Cook over medium heat until peppers are tender.
#Meanwhile, cook pork and onion in a [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] over medium heat, stirring occasionally, about ten minutes, or until pork is browned and crumbly. Drain pork and add to chile mixture. [[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] for 20 minutes.
#Heat butter in the skillet over medium-low heat. Add flour. Cook, stirring frequently, until flour browns, about 2 minutes. Add flour mixture to chile. Continue cooking and stirring until thickened to preference. Serves 5-6, usually accompanied by [[Cookbook:Corn Bread|cornbread]].

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*If fresh green chili peppers are not available, dried [[Cookbook:Anaheim chili|Anaheim]] chili peppers may be substituted, but the results will be substantially different.

[[Image:Bowl of chili.jpg|thumbnail|200px|A bowl of chili con carne with beans and tortilla chips]]
'''Chili con carne''' (in America shortened to '''chili''') is a spicy [[cookbook:stew|stew]]-like dish, the essential ingredients of which are [[cookbook:beef|beef]], [[cookbook:pork|pork]], [[cookbook:venison|venison]], or other mature [[cookbook:meat|meat]], and [[cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]s. Variations, either geographic or by personal preference, include the addition of [[cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es, [[cookbook:onion|onion]]s, [[cookbook:bean|bean]]s, and other ingredients. ([[cookbook:Brown Sugar|Brown sugar]] is often a favorite condiment). There are also many versions of [[cookbook:vegetarian|vegetarian]] chili, also known as chili sin carne, made without meat (sometimes with a meat substitute). The name &quot;chili con carne&quot; is a slight corruption of the Spanish ''chile con carne'', &quot;chili with meat&quot;. Chili con carne is the official dish of the U.S. state of Texas. 

==Texas chili recipes==
Texas chilies are generally beef-based, use dried red chili peppers and are therefore red in color. They contain no beans and little or no vegetables other than the chili peppers.

[[Image:Chili_ingredients.jpg|thumb|Ingredients for Chili con Carne]]
;[[cookbook:Original Texas-Style Chili|Original Texas-Style Chili]]
:This recipe contains no vegetables except chilies which have been prepared by being boiled, peeled, and chopped.

;[[cookbook:Jailhouse Chili|Jailhouse Chili]]
:In the early part of the 20th century, those likely to regularly spend time in local detention facilities in the American Southwest were said to rate the accommodations by the quality of the chili they were served. This became a matter of local pride and competition with other communities. This is a modern version, as served in the Texas prison system.

;[[cookbook:Pedernales River Chili|Pedernales River Chili]]
:This chili was the favorite of U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and is named after the location of his Texas Hill Country ranch. Johnson preferred his chili made with venison. [http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/FAQs/Recipes/chili.asp]

;[[cookbook:Texas Easy Chili|Texas Easy Chili]]
:This recipe is a [[cookbook:chili powder|chili powder]]- and tomato juice-based sauce combined with cubed or ground beef.

==New Mexico chili recipes==
The official state vegetable of New Mexico is the chili pepper and the official state question is &quot;Red or green?&quot; This refers to the decision New Mexican chili devotees must regularly make, and which engenders frequent discussion and argument. The red chili is simply a riper form of the green chili; the former is cooked in its dried form and the latter is used fresh from the field, with significant differences in results. For those who simply cannot decide, the standard reply is &quot;Christmas&quot;, meaning a portion of each. New Mexico chilies are more commonly based on pork, and include more vegetables than Texas style chilies.

;[[Cookbook:New Mexico Chile Verde|New Mexico Chile Verde]]
:Chile verde (&quot;green chili&quot;) is generally considered more typical of New Mexican cuisine, possibly because of its more marked visual contrast to Texas-style chili. While there apparently is no canonical recipe for chili verde,&lt;!-- that I [who?] have been able to find--&gt; all versions involve roasting fresh green chilies and cooking them slowly with meat, garlic, oregano, and cumin.

;[[Cookbook:Green Chili Stew|Green Chili Stew]]
:This recipe is a New Mexican dish that is known as the beef stew of New Mexico. It is usually served with [[Cookbook:tortilla|tortillas]] or sopapillas.

;[[Cookbook:Chile Colorado|Chile Colorado]]
:Chili Colorado (&quot;red chili&quot;) is a pork-based chili from New Mexico that uses dried red chili peppers.

==Other meat based chili recipes==
;[[Cookbook:Chili con Bambi|Chili con Bambi]]
:Another venison based chili con carne. Intended for slow cooking so can use very tough meat.

;[[Cookbook:Cincinnati-Style Chili|Cincinnati-Style Chili]]
:Cincinnati-style chili is a very popular regional variation that is quite different from Texas-style chili. Most notably, it is usually eaten as a topping for spaghetti or hot dogs, rather than as a stew by itself. Cincinnati-style chili is beanless, but a &quot;four-way&quot; serving includes beans on top of the spaghetti under the chili.  The connection between [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]] and chili probably originated in Cincinnati, since the cheese normally tops Cincinnati spaghetti dishes.

;[[Cookbook:White Chili|White Chili]]
:Instead of a tomato-based sauce and red meat (beef), great northern beans and chicken breast meat can be substituted. The resulting dish appears white when cooked, and has more of an alkali bean taste, instead of the acidic taste of traditional chili.

;[[Cookbook:Pepper chili|Pepper chili]]
:Chili made with bell-peppers

==Vegetarian chili==
Vegetarian chilis acquired wide popularity in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s with the rise of the [[cookbook:vegetarian|vegetarian]] philosophy, and is also popular with those on diets which restrict red meat. To make a chili vegetarian, the meat is left out of the recipe or replaced with a meat analogue such as [[cookbook:Textured Vegetable Protein|textured vegetable protein]] or [[cookbook:tofu|tofu]]. Some people consider vegetarian chili to be a spicy vegetable stew, and not true chili.

;[[Cookbook:Chili (Vegan)|Vegan Chili]]
:This is a kind of chili that needs no meat (and uses no ersatz meat). Molasses gives this chili a somewhat Louisiana flavor.

;[[Cookbook:Bean Chili|Bean Chili]]
:This chili recipe, which is also [[cookbook:vegan|vegan]], uses kidney beans, red and green bell peppers, and chili powder.

;[[Cookbook:Black Bean Chili|Black Bean Chili]]
:This vegetarian chili uses [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black beans]].

==Accompaniments and additions==
[[Image:Pot of Chili.jpg|thumbnail|175px|A pot of chili with beans.]]
Several beverages are commonly used to accompany a bowl of chili, including ice-cold [[cookbook:beer|beer]] or cold [[cookbook:milk|milk]] to moderate the impact of the chilies on the throat. Saltine crackers, broken up and scattered on top, are common in chili parlors. Similarly, commercial corn chips can be added as a topping, producing something akin to [[cookbook:Frito Pie|Frito Pie]]. Jalapeño [[cookbook:cornbread|cornbread]], rolled-up corn tortillas, and pork tamales also are popular for dunking.  Peanut butter sandwiches or peanut butter on saltine crackers served on the side can also accompany chili. In Missouri, a small portion of pickle juice is often poured into the bowl of chili. In Indiana, some heap coleslaw in their bowl of chili before eating.

===Beans===
[[cookbook:Pinto Bean|Pinto bean]]s (''frijoles''), a staple of [[cookbook:Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex]] cooking, have long been associated with chili and the question of whether beans &quot;belong&quot; in chili has been a matter of contention among chili cooks for an equally long time. It is likely that in many poorer areas of San Antonio and other places associated with the origins of chili, beans were used rather than meat, or in addition to meat, due to poverty. In that regard, it has been suggested by some chili aficionados that there were probably two chili type made in the world, depending on what could be afforded and how frugal the cook was.

As chili spread east into areas where beef was more expensive (beef was plentiful and cheap in San Antonio and other cattle towns), chili with pinto or other beans became more prevalent. In some eastern areas, this dish is referred to as &quot;[[cookbook:Chili Bean|chili beans]]&quot; while the term &quot;chili&quot; is reserved for the all-meat dish. Other changes included the adding of other vegetables. Tomatoes are almost always used, bell peppers are common, and even celery appears in recipes. Many easterners are just as adamant about the inclusion of beans in their chili for an authentic flavor as Texans are about their exclusion.

Most commercially prepared canned chili includes beans. Commercial chili prepared without beans is usually called &quot;chili no beans&quot;. If you substitute chunks of fresh [[cookbook:mushroom|mushroom]]s for the beans, you will cut the calorie content of your favorite chili recipe by at least a third, without sacrificing taste. The bland white button mushroom will soak up the flavors of the chilies, tomatoes, chili powder, etc, while helping the chili retain its consistency.

Many chili experts believe, however, that beans and chili should ''always'' be cooked separately and served on the side. It is then up to the consumer to stir his preferred quantity of beans into his own bowl. Some cooks prefer black beans, [[cookbook:Black-eyed Pea|black-eyed pea]]s, or kidney beans instead of pinto beans.

A popular saying among chili purists is &quot;If you know beans about chili, you know chili ain't got no beans&quot;.

===Tomatoes===
Another ingredient considered anywhere from required to sacrilegious is tomatoes. Wick Fowler, north Texas newspaperman and inventor of &quot;Two-Alarm Chili&quot; (which he later marketed as a &quot;kit&quot; of spices), insisted on adding tomato sauce to his chili, one 15-oz. can per three pounds of meat. He also believed that chili should never be eaten newly-cooked but refrigerated overnight to seal in the flavor. Matt Weinstock, a Los Angeles newspaper columnist, once remarked that Fowler's chili &quot;was reputed to open eighteen sinus cavities unknown to the medical profession&quot;. [Tolbert, ''A Bowl of Red'']

===Rice===
In Southeast Texas people eat chili over white [[cookbook:rice|rice]], much like one would eat [[cookbook:gumbo|gumbo]], this is due to the proximity to Louisiana. This is also common in the [[cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].

== Similar dishes ==
Dishes often described as similar to chili con carne include French [[cookbook:cassoulet|cassoulet]], Indian [[cookbook:curry|curry]], Jewish [[cookbook:cholent|cholent]], Serbian bean soups and especially Hungarian [[cookbook:goulash|goulash]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Camp Teepee Fire.svg|thumb|300px|Teepee Fire]]
The teepee fire is probably the most recognized campfire.  It is somewhat difficult to lay however, as getting the logs to balance against one another can be tricky.  Sometimes the log pile will topple and upset the kindling and tinder beneath, and you'll have to start again from scratch.  If necessary, you can lash them together at the top with twine (but don't use a synthetic rope such as nylon or polypropylene).  Once laid, the teepee fire is very easy to light, as convection will take the flames right to the fuel.  

Adding fuel to a teepee fire can also be challenging as the balance problem is still there, but it is now complicated by the presence of heat.  For this reason, teepee fires often devolve into a chaotic heap.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Camp Log Cabin Fire.svg|thumb|300px|Log Cabin Fire]]
The log cabin is easy to lay, and it is fairly stable as well.  It is laid very much like a log cabin (hence the name).  It is somewhat difficult to light though, as the fuel is off to the side of the tinder and kindling.  When it burns, it falls in on itself, confining itself to the fire ring.  It is also easy to add more fuel and maintain a neat orderly fire.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Camp Council Fire.svg|thumb|300px|Council Fire]]
The council fire was used by Native Americans during their meetings (or councils).  It is very much like the log cabin fire except that more than two logs are laid on each layer.  Be careful not to lay the logs too close to one another.  Leave gaps of at least one inch (2.5 cm) between each log to allow air to circulate.  Like the log cabin fire, the council fire is very stable, and it falls into itself as it burns, remaining within the fire ring.  Unlike the log cabin fire, the council fire lights easily as the main fuel is located directly above the kindling and tinder where convection will carry the flames.  This fire is hot, and will make a nice bed of coals for cooking.  It also uses a lot of fuel. This fire is sometimes called a pyramid fire as well.

== Overview ==

'''''Bertha Jorkins''''' was a witch working with the Department of Magical Games and Sports in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. She was also [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]'s and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]]'s school mate at Hogwarts. When she is first mentioned in the book, she has been missing since being on vacation in Albania. It is later revealed that she is dead.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|Chapter One]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] reminds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] that he murdered Bertha Jorkins after they forced her to reveal Ministry information. With this information, Voldemort devised a plan to lure [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] to a place where he would use him for a sinister purpose.

After her disappearance from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]]'s department, Bagman seems unconcerned, saying, &quot;Poor old Bertha... memory like a leaky cauldron. Will likely turn up sometime in October thinking it's still July.&quot; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] is later called upon to assist in damage control when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] discovers her unexplained absence and writes about it in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']].

Bertha's absence is mentioned several times throughout the book. Sirius Black disputes Bagman's claim about Bertha, telling Harry that when they were at school together, she had a very good memory and a very long nose for gossip; a bad memory is not something he would associate with her. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] summons her memory from his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], and he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] see her accusing a fellow student of jinxing her only because she followed him, though she later expands on this, saying she had followed him and his girlfriend, had seen them kissing, and had told him she would tell everyone about it.

Finally, under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] reveals that Bertha had visited [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch Sr.]]'s house some time before our story begins, and had discovered that Barty, who supposedly died in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], was hidden at his father's house. Bartemius put a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|memory charm]] on Bertha, but it caused her ongoing memory problems. On vacation, she fell in with Wormtail, who brought her to Voldemort. From her, Voldemort learned about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] being held at Hogwarts. By breaking the memory charm, he learned also that Barty Crouch Jr. had escaped Azkaban and was being hidden at his father's house. Breaking the memory charm destroyed Bertha's mind, and Voldemort quickly murdered her as she was no longer useful.

== Strengths ==

Before Bartemius Crouch damaged it, Bertha had evidently quite a good memory, and one gathers that she had something like Rita Skeeter's nose for gossip.

== Weaknesses ==

After her memory had been charmed, she seems to have become notably weak in her ability to remember, and had been, as a consequence, shunted around from department to department at the Ministry.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

In ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', Voldemort had gained some kind of body shortly after Bertha had been captured by Peter (Wormtail) Pettigrew.  Later on it mentions that Voldemort &quot;pointed his wand&quot; at Peter and used the Cruciatus Curse on him.  When Harry arrives in the graveyard Peter drops an &quot;ugly baby&quot; into the cauldron.  What if the &quot;service&quot; that Bertha provided was more then just the information about Barty Jr. and the Triwizard Tournament at Hogwarts? It is entirely possible, though horrible to contemplate, that the body that Voldemort inhabited during this book was, in fact, Jorkins' child, possibly one that she had gone on holiday to have privately. Voldemort would, of course, not mention this in his exposition to the Death Eaters as to how he had survived, due to the shameful weakness of the body he had been forced to inhabit; and the author would not have mentioned it anyway in a book intended for children.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Kosher''' refers to that which is prepared in accordance with Jewish Law.  Kosher foods are foods that practicing Jews are allowed to consume. The specific rules are enumerated in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah Torah], and refined in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud Talmud].

There are two groups of rules - what can be eaten and how it can be prepared.

If you need to feed someone who keeps kosher, fresh, uncooked, un-processed fruits and vegetables are always OK (except if they are grown in the land of Israel, in which case additional restrictions apply).  For some, any vegetarian food cooked in your home may be fine.  There is a wide variety of stringency observed by individuals.  Your best bet is to ask.

== What can be eaten ==

*Any fish that has ''both'' scales and fins. This means that shellfish are not kosher, and neither are fish like catfish.

*Any land animal that chews its cud  ''and'' has split hooves. Sheep and cows are kosher animals, while pigs, horses and dogs are not kosher. Pigs do have a split hoof, but they do not chew their cud, so they are not kosher.  Both deer and goats are kosher if properly slaughtered. There are also restrictions as to what parts of the animal may be eaten. Some parts may never be eaten and some parts are not normally processed as kosher meat in the United States due to the additional labor involved. (kosher hot dogs cannot contain some of the filler and miscellaneous scraps that are added to most non-kosher hot dogs)

*There is a list of non-kosher birds in the Torah, which names predominantly scavengers and predators. Kosher birds include duck, chicken, and turkey. Ostrich is not kosher.

*There are some kosher insects that are types of grasshopper or locust. Ashkenazi and most Sepharadi groups have lost the tradition of which exact species are kosher, but Yemenites and some Sepharadi groups have maintained this tradition and can properly identify them (though to most people the prospect of eating insects is not appealing, rendering this a largely academic point).

*Animal blood is not to be eaten.

*Eggs from kosher birds are kosher. Eggs are not used if any blood spots are found.

*Honey made by bees is kosher even though it is processed by a non-kosher insect.
*Other than this one exception, any bi-product of a non-kosher animal is not kosher, e.g. milk from a non-kosher animal such as a pig or a camel.

*An animal that is sick or injured cannot be eaten. 

*All kosher animals must be slaughtered properly, according to a particular method, in order for the meat to be permissible.

*There are some restrictions on plants, like they need to be checked that there are no insects. Any beverages made from grapes including grape juice and wine require special processing and supervision to be kosher.

*Gelatin is usually made from non kosher animals' hooves/bones, but it is possible to get kosher gelatin either made from kosher fish, kosher animals or vegetable products.

*Ask a local Rabbi for more details.

== How it can be Prepared ==

*It is not enough for an animal to be kosher, that animal must also be slaughtered in a specific way as to minimise the amount of pain dealt to the animal, and otherwise in accordance with Jewish law (halachah). 

*Meat must be &quot;kashered&quot;, which removes the blood from the meat. This is done either using [[Cookbook:Kosher Salt|salting]] or [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]]. Most kosher meat that one can buy is already kashered.

*Milk and meat cannot be cooked or eaten together. This includes eating dairy and meat within certain time periods. Depending on the family's custom, the most common of which are 6 hours or 3 hours before consuming dairy products after meat products. Some hold that it is permissible to wash out your mouth before consuming meat products after dairy products, except for hard cheese, which requires the same waiting period as is required to eat dairy after meat. One must have two entirely different sets of cooking pots and table dishes for milk and meat. Both birds and mammals are considered meat, while fish, insects, and eggs are considered to be neither dairy nor meat.  Fish can be eaten with meat or dairy, although some hold that one should not eat fish and meat off of the same dish. Some Jews of Sephardic backgrounds follow Maimonides' ruling, and do not mix fish with dairy products of any kind.

== Store Bought Goods ==

Ever wonder what the U or K in a circle means? Well, those are two of many symbols used by Jews in the USA to identify kosher products. A &quot;plain k&quot; [a K all by itself] does not mean that the food is certified kosher, but rather that the company declares it to be kosher. Many Jews do not accept &quot;plain k&quot; as a legitimate kashrut certification.

A list of many of the kosher certification agencies are found here:  http://www.kashrut.com/agencies/

Some Jews will not accept certain certifications as interpretations and levels of observance vary from Jew to Jew.

== Notes ==
*If you are entertaining for people that you know or think may keep kosher, be sure to ask them about their personal rules, as there are many interpretations and subtle variations that different people will follow.  Depending on their observance, they may be fine eating a vegetarian dish cooked in your home, or may not be comfortable doing anything more than eating unprepared fruit. 

*A more detailed explanation of [[w:Kashrut|Kashrut]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bell's theorem: the simplest version==
Quantum mechanics permits us to create the following scenario.
* Pairs of particles are launched in opposite directions.
* Each particle is subjected to one of three possible measurements ('''1''', '''2''', or '''3''').
* Each time the two measurements are chosen at random.
* Each measurement has two possible results, indicated by a red or green light.
Here is what we find:
* If both particles are subjected to the same measurement, identical results are never obtained.
* The two sequences of recorded outcomes are completely random. In particular, half of the time both lights are the same color.

&lt;BR&gt;[[image:Bell_simple.png|471px]]

&lt;BR&gt;If this doesn't bother you, then please explain how it is that the colors differ whenever identical measurements are performed!

The obvious explanation would be that each particle arrives with an &quot;instruction set&quot; — some property that pre-determines the outcome of every possible measurement. Let's see what this entails.

Each particle arrives with one of the following 2&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8 instruction sets:
::'''RRR''',''' RRG''',''' RGR''',''' GRR''',''' RGG''',''' GRG''',''' GGR''', or '''GGG'''.
(If a particle arrives with, say, '''RGG''', then the apparatus flashes red if it is set to '''1''' and green if it is set to '''2''' or '''3'''.) In order to explain why the outcomes differ whenever both particles are subjected to the same measurement, we have to assume that particles launched together arrive with opposite instruction sets. If one carries the instruction (or arrives with the property denoted by) '''RRG''', then the other carries the instruction&amp;nbsp;'''GGR'''.

Suppose that the instruction sets are '''RRG''' and '''GGR'''. In this case we observe different colors with the following five of the 3&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9 possible combinations of apparatus settings:
::'''1—1''',''' 2—2''',''' 3—3''',''' 1—2''', and '''2—1''',
and we observe equal colors with the following four:
::'''1—3''',''' 2—3''',''' 3—1''', and '''3—2'''.
Because the settings are chosen at random, this particular pair of instruction sets thus results in different colors 5/9 of the time. The same is true for the other pairs of instruction sets ''except'' the pair '''RRR''', '''GGG'''. If the two particles carry these respective instruction sets, we see different colors ''every'' time. It follows that we see different colors ''at least'' 5/9 of the time.

But different colors are observed half of the time! In reality the probability of observing different colors is 1/2. Conclusion: the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be explained with the help of instruction sets. In other words, these measurements do not reveal ''pre-existent'' properties. They ''create'' the properties the possession of which they indicate.

Then how is it that the colors differ whenever identical measurements are made? How does one apparatus &quot;know&quot; which measurement is performed and which outcome is obtained ''by the other apparatus''?

Whenever the joint probability '''p(A,B)''' of the respective outcomes '''A''' and&amp;nbsp;'''B''' of two measurements does not equal the product '''p(A)&amp;nbsp;p(B)''' of the individual probabilities, the outcomes — or their probabilities — are said to be ''correlated''. With equal apparatus settings we have '''p(R,R)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;p(G,G)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0''', and this obviously differs from the products '''p(R)&amp;nbsp;p(R)''' and '''p(G)&amp;nbsp;p(G)''', which equal &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac12\times\frac12=\frac14.&lt;/math&gt; What kind of mechanism is responsible for the correlations between the measurement outcomes?
:''You understand this as much as anybody else!''
The conclusion that we see different colors at least 5/9 of the time is ''Bell's theorem'' (or ''Bell's inequality'') for this particular setup. The fact that the universe violates the logic of Bell's Theorem is evidence that particles do not carry instruction sets embedded within them and instead have instantaneous knowledge of other particles at a great distance.  Here is a comment by a distinguished Princeton physicist as quoted by David Mermin&lt;ref&gt;N. David Mermin, &quot;Is the Moon there when nobody looks? Reality and the quantum theory,&quot; ''Physics Today'', April 1985. The version of Bell's theorem discussed in this section first appeared in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;
::Anybody who's not bothered by Bell's theorem has to have rocks in his head.
And here is why Einstein wasn't happy with quantum mechanics: 
::I cannot seriously believe in it because it cannot be reconciled with the idea that physics should represent a reality in time and space, free from spooky actions at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein, ''The Born-Einstein Letters'', with comments by Max Born (New York: Walker, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;
Sadly, Einstein (1879&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1955) did not know Bell's theorem of 1964. We know now that
::there must be a mechanism whereby the setting of one measurement device can influence the reading of another instrument, however remote.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Bell, &quot;On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox,&quot; ''Physics''&amp;nbsp;1, pp. 195-200, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Spooky actions at a distance are here to stay!''

&lt;/div&gt;

==A quantum game==
Here are the rules:&lt;ref&gt;Lev Vaidman, &quot;Variations on the theme of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger proof,&quot; ''Foundations of Physics'' 29, pp. 615-30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two teams play against each other: Andy, Bob, and Charles (the &quot;players&quot;) versus the &quot;interrogators&quot;.
* Each player is asked either &quot;What is the value of '''X'''?&quot; or &quot;What is the value of '''Y'''?&quot;
* Only two answers are allowed: +1 or &amp;minus;1.
* Either each player is asked the '''X''' question, or one player is asked the '''X'''&amp;nbsp;question and the two other players are asked the '''Y'''&amp;nbsp;question.
* The players win if the product of their answers is &amp;minus;1 in case only '''X'''&amp;nbsp;questions are asked, and if the product of their answers is +1 in case '''Y'''&amp;nbsp;questions are asked. Otherwise they lose.
* The players are not allowed to communicate with each other once the questions are asked. Before that, they are permitted to work out a strategy.

Is there a failsafe strategy? Can they make sure that they will win? Stop to ponder the question.

Let us try pre-agreed answers, which we will call '''X&lt;SUB&gt;A&lt;/SUB&gt;''', '''X&lt;SUB&gt;B&lt;/SUB&gt;''', '''X&lt;SUB&gt;C&lt;/SUB&gt;''' and '''Y&lt;SUB&gt;A&lt;/SUB&gt;''', '''Y&lt;SUB&gt;B&lt;/SUB&gt;''', '''Y&lt;SUB&gt;C&lt;/SUB&gt;'''. The winning combinations satisfy the following equations:

:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;math&gt;
X_AY_BY_C=1,\quad Y_AX_BY_C=1,\quad Y_AY_BX_C=1,\quad X_AX_BX_C=-1.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;Consider the first three equations. The product of their right-hand sides equals&amp;nbsp;+1. The product of their left-hand sides equals '''X&lt;SUB&gt;A&lt;/SUB&gt;X&lt;SUB&gt;B&lt;/SUB&gt;X&lt;SUB&gt;C&lt;/SUB&gt;''', implying that '''X&lt;SUB&gt;A&lt;/SUB&gt;X&lt;SUB&gt;B&lt;/SUB&gt;X&lt;SUB&gt;C&lt;/SUB&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1'''. (Remember that the possible values are ±1.)  But if '''X&lt;SUB&gt;A&lt;/SUB&gt;X&lt;SUB&gt;B&lt;/SUB&gt;X&lt;SUB&gt;C&lt;/SUB&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1''', then the fourth equation '''X&lt;SUB&gt;A&lt;/SUB&gt;X&lt;SUB&gt;B&lt;/SUB&gt;X&lt;SUB&gt;C&lt;/SUB&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1''' obviously cannot be satisfied.
:The bottom line: There is no failsafe strategy with pre-agreed answers.

==The experiment of Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger==
And yet there is a failsafe strategy.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Greenberger,  M. A. Horne, and A. Zeilinger, &quot;Going beyond Bell's theorem,&quot; in ''Bell's theorem, Quantum Theory, and Conception of the Universe'', edited by M. Kafatos (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1989), pp. 69-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here goes:
* Andy, Bob, and Charles prepare three particles (for instance, electrons) in a particular way. As a result, they are able to predict the probabilities of the possible outcomes of any spin measurement to which the three particles may subsequently be subjected. In principle these probabilities do not depend on how far the particles are apart.
* Each player takes one particle with him.
* Whoever is asked the '''X'''&amp;nbsp;question measures the ''x''&amp;nbsp;component of the spin of his particle  and answers with his outcome, and whoever is asked the '''Y'''&amp;nbsp;question measures the ''y''&amp;nbsp;component of the spin of his particle and answers likewise. (All you need to know at this point about the spin of a particle is that its component with respect to any one axis can be measured, and that for the type of particle used by the players there are two possible outcomes, namely +1 and&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1.
Proceeding in this way, the team of players is sure to win every time.

Is it possible for the ''x'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;components of the spins of the three particles to be in possession of values before their values are actually measured?

Suppose that the ''y''&amp;nbsp;components of the three spins have been measured. The three equations

:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;math&gt;
X_AY_BY_C=1,\quad Y_AX_BY_C=1,\quad Y_AY_BX_C=1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;of the [[This quantum world/Game|previous section]] tell us what we would have found if the ''x''&amp;nbsp;component of any one of the three particles had been measured instead of the ''y''&amp;nbsp;component. If we assume that the ''x''&amp;nbsp;components are in possession of values even though they are ''not'' measured, then their values can be inferred from the measured values of the three ''y''&amp;nbsp;components.

Try to fill in the following table in such a way that
* each cell contains either  +1 or &amp;minus;1,
* the product of the three X&amp;nbsp;values equals&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1, and
* the product of every pair of Y&amp;nbsp;values equals the remaining X&amp;nbsp;value.
Can it be done?

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=&quot;30&quot; style=&quot;background:grey&quot;|
!width=&quot;50&quot;|A
!width=&quot;50&quot;|B
!width=&quot;50&quot;|C
|-
! X || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;  
|-
! Y || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; 
|}

The answer is negative, for the same reason that the four equations

:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;math&gt;
X_AY_BY_C=1,\quad Y_AX_BY_C=1,\quad Y_AY_BX_C=1,\quad X_AX_BX_C=-1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;cannot all be satisfied. Just as there can be no strategy with pre-agreed answers, there can be no pre-existent values. We seem to have no choice but to conclude that these spin components are in possession of values ''only if'' (and only when) they are actually measured.

Any two outcomes suffice to predict a third outcome. If two ''x''&amp;nbsp;components are measured, the third ''x''&amp;nbsp;component can be predicted, if two ''y''&amp;nbsp;components are measured, the ''x''&amp;nbsp;component of the third spin can be predicted, and if one ''x'' and one ''y''&amp;nbsp;component are measurement, the ''y''&amp;nbsp;component of the third spin can be predicted. How can we understand this given that
* the values of the spin components are created as and when they are measured,
* the relative times of the measurements are irrelevant,
* in principle the three particles can be millions of miles apart.
How does the third spin &quot;know&quot; which components of the other spins are measured and which outcomes are obtained? What mechanism correlates the outcomes?
:''You understand this as much as anybody else!''

= Scandinavian Defence =

In this position, black queen is under attack and must find a safe square. There are several possibilities.
:[[/3...Qa5/]] is the most common. The queen cannot be attacked again, she can pin the knight if White dares to advance his d pawn and she can later move to b6 to target the b2 pawn.
:[[/3...Qd6/]] and [[/3...Qd8/]] are less aggressive alternatives.
:[[/3...Qe5/|3...Qe5+]] and [[/3...Qe6/|3...Qe6+]] check the king, inviting White to play 4. Be2 and weaken the g2 pawn.
Of course, Black cannot play 3... Qc6?? because of 4. Bb5, winning the Queen.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:31, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Paperbark Maple''' (''Acer griseum'') is a species of maple native to central China. It was introduced to cultivation in Europe in 1901 by [[w:Ernest Henry Wilson|Ernest Henry Wilson]] for [[w:Veitch Nurseries|Veitch Nurseries]], and to North America shortly after. The tree grows very slowly, so if being planted as a shade tree, large stock should be used.

==Description==
It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree, reaching 10-18 m tall, and has smooth, shiny orange-red bark, which peels in thin, papery layers (mature bark is platy and brightly metallic-copper in color). The leaves are compound, with three leaflets, each 4-10 cm long and 2-6 cm broad, dark green above, bright glaucous blue-green beneath. The petioles and young stems are pubescent. The flowers are produced in small corymbs in spring, the fruit being a pair of winged samaras with the seeds about 1 cm long and a 3 cm wing. Young trees are upright, eventually developing a rounded habit.

Emerging foliage is copper-colored, fall color is bright red, in late season.

==Ecology==
Some specimens will produce prolific seedlings in the garden, but due to the slow growth it is unlikely to become invasive.

==Uses==
[[Image:Acer griseum1.jpg|left|thumb|Foliage]]
Paperbark Maple is widely grown as an ornamental plant in temperate regions.  It is admired for its decorative exfoliating bark, translucent pieces of which stay attached to the branches until worn away.  It also has spectacular autumn color which can include red, orange and pink tones.

Deep, well-drained soils are recommended, as unlike many other maples its roots run well below the surface.

Recent attempts have been made to acquire new seed stock from wild populations in China because it is believed that the current gene pool of cultivated specimens is very small.  Propagation of ''Acer griseum'' is somewhat difficult as seeds have [[w:parthenocaptic|parthenocaptic]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia'' by C.J. van Gelderen &amp; D.M. van Gelderen, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pests and diseases==
Pest and disease issues are rare in the garden. See [[../Acer/]] for a discussion of pest and disease problems affecting maples in general.

Due to the slow growth of seedlings, nursery stock often has problems with wrapping roots, which can lead to girdling later on if not addressed early.

Moves : 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 b5 8.e5 dxe5 9. fxe5 Qc7 10. exf6

Now Black has a logical move which explains the move 9...Qc7: 

[[/10...Qe5+/]]

Indeed, after this move Black will capture a figure : Bishop (in the main line) or a Knight. 
So, the material will be recovered.

      <text xml:space="preserve">in the first sentence, should &quot;atom's&quot; be replaced by &quot;electron's&quot;? --[[User:Tom Bachmann|Tom Bachmann]] 16:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
:We tend to speak of the angular momentum quantum number of ''the hydrogen atom'' rather than of the electron. Is what we loosely call &quot;the Moon's orbital angular momentum&quot; actually a property of the Moon or rather a property of the Earth-Moon system? If we take into account that both the Earth and the Moon orbit a common center of gravity, it should become clear that it's a property of the Earth-Moon system. As long as we think of the proton as (the source of) an unchanging potential well in which the electron is moving, we may of course attribute the angular momentum to the electron instead.--[[User:Koantum|Koantum]] 02:53, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

Moves : 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 b5 8. e5 dxe5 9. fxe5 Qc7 10. exf6 Qe5+ 11. Be2 Qxg5

White can be aggressive by [[/12. Bf3/]] or [[/12. fxg7/]] but the white King would be not in security. That is why, in the main line White prefers to avoid a position too complicated:
[[/12. 0-0/]] (main line)

Moves : 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 b5 8.e5 dxe5 9. fxe5 Qc7 10. exf6 Qe5+ 11.Be2 Qxg5 12. 0-0 

Black seems to be very undevelopped. Moreover black Queen has moved already three times. In the main line the Queen goes on to impress : 

[[/12...Qe5/]]

This move was found and studied by Polugaevsky. Black is threatening 13...Bc5.
Besides, Black has two Bishops very powerful. That is why [[/12...Qe5/]] is very interesting
and the part for Black is not in disadvantage. Of course, Black has to be prudent.

== Email ==

I notice you included a link to your email. Instead, you can use the email feature built into MediaWiki. A link to the page Special:Emailuser/Username will take you to a form where people can email you without seeing your email unless you reply to it. This is much more secure than providing emails either in plaintext, or redacted (as you have done). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:17, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just a thought about the &quot;is it dangerous&quot; part:  Yes, Zn is necessary for life, but can be just as deadly as any heavy metal at higher concentrations.  I don't think it is appropriate to teach kids (even at this age) to simply lump things into &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;Good&quot; categories.  Kids this age are quite capable of understanding that too much of a good thing can be bad.  As points of interest, you could mention that it can build up in the environment from industrial pollution, or that welders ( maybe say metalworkers) can get too much of it and get sick, or that overdoses can occur from taking too many vitamin pills. Actually, this post applies to quite a few of the elements.</text>

% wrapped.tex - illustrating how to specify the size of the table
% columns.

% Andrew Roberts - September 2003

\documentclass[english]{article} 

%The Babel package adds multi-lingual support to Latex.  In particular,
%text that Latex automatically inserts, like dates, or section headings
%must be configured to the native language of the document.  The default
%is American. 

%The reason for adding babel in this instance seems silly, considering
%it is essentially the same language.  However, it also dictates the
%formatting of dates, which is different between us and the US. Adding
%the optional argument 'english' in the documentclass command, as well
%as invoking the babel package will recitfy the issue.

'''Wikibooks''' is a project intended to be used for the '''collaborative''' creation of textbooks that are free for any person or institution to use. Our goal is to create high-quality, up-to-date materials to be used in classrooms or by individuals. The texts we create here are free for all to use, as they are licensed under the [[WB:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA License]] and [[WB:GFDL|GFDL]]. 

As a collaborative text-creating project, Wikibooks is and must be open to all contributors. Those who have worked long and hard on their books must be willing to welcome those who wish to collaborate in order to improve the book. Noone, regardless of their contributions, has a right to &quot;defend&quot; a book from further development on this project by discouraging new contributors. New contributors should be welcomed and encouraged. If the book follows an established Manual of Style, the new contributors should have this described to them. If a new contributor has ideas, they should be taken into consideration. Established contributors must by all means be [[WB:CIVIL|civil]] and welcoming. 

Every time we edit a page, the message below includes the sentence: &quot;If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, then don't submit it here.&quot; Wikibooks are meant to be written by anyone and everyone who is familiar with the topic and wishes to make the textbook better. Wikibooks grow as the community involved writing the book grows.

==Communication is important for collaboration==
Collaboration requires communication. The easiest way to communicate when working on a book is to include descriptive edit summaries, to let other contributors know why you made a particular change or addition. If it is a &quot;radical&quot; change, it might also be a good idea to leave a more detailed note on the talk page.

More general discussions of the book as a whole may belong on a &quot;[[Wikibooks:WikiProject|project page]]&quot; (if there is no project page, the discussion page of the main book page is usually the best place, contributors should always add this to their watchlists). If you ask a question but receive no answer, it may be that nobody else is currently working on the book, or perhaps they are not watching the page you left a note on. Past contributors can be found by browsing the page history. 

Wherever you leave a message (edit summary, talk page, user talk, etc.), remember to [[WB:CIVIL|be civil]]. Communication quickly breaks down where civility and mutual respect are absent.

==In case of dispute==
Sometimes contributors of good faith are just unable to agree on something.</text>

''This recipe is incredibly quick to prepare, rich in flavor, and makes a great side dish.  The butter adds flavor but can be excluded for vegan/low-fat diets.''

==Ingredients==
*½ to 1 T unsalted butter
*1 to 2 T olive oil
*1 T chopped garlic or shallots
*1 head (3-4 cups of leaves) tat soi or any other dark leafy green, base removed (tear into smaller pieces if using a large leaf plant like chard)
*soy sauce

==Procedure==

#Rinse greens thoroughly. 
#Melt butter and olive oil in a wok or sauté pan over medium-high heat.
#Add garlic and sauté until golden.
#Stir in tat soi and cook - stirring constantly - until lightly wilted.
#Remove from heat and cover, allowing the greens to steam in the pan for a minute or two.
#When ready to serve, toss with about 1T of soy sauce.

{{recipe}}  | [[Cookbook:Breakfast|Breakfast Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Bread|Bread]] |

These are a favourite for breakfast, with butter, or jelly on top.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] warm (105°-115°F) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 1 cup warm (105°-115°F) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 package [[Cookbook:Yeast|active dry yeast]]
* 5 to 6 cups all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]

==Procedure==

# Combine milk, sugar, salt and margarine.
# Measure water into large warm bowl, sprinkle in yeast, and stir until dissolved.
# Stir in milk mixture and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth.
# Add enough additional four to make a stiff dough.
# Turn out onto floured board and knead about 2 minutes, or until dough is manageable and can be formed into a ball. The dough may be slightly sticky.
# Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top.
# Cover; let rise in a warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about an hour.
# Punch dough down; divide in half.
# On a board, heavily sprinkled with cornmeal, pat each half into a ½-inch thickness.
# Cut into circles with a floured 3-inch cookie cutter.
# Place on ungreased baking sheets about 2 inches apart.
# Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until doubled in size, about ½ hour.
# Place on lightly greased medium hot griddle or skillet, cornmeal side down.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] until well browned, about 10 minutes on each side.
# Cool on wire racks.
* To serve, split in half and toast.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* You can also start the dough by mixing the yeast, the dry ingredients, and half or more of the flour, with the liquids at 145°-150°F, then continuing the rest of the instructions.
* After punching the dough down, many bakers let it rest 10 minutes.
* ½ cup of [[Cookbook:Currant|currants]] may be added to the warm milk mixture.
* You can substitute 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Flour|whole wheat flour]] for 1½ cups of the all-purpose flour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This a great idea for a book that could be very interesting. As a suggestion, I think &quot;math&quot; should be singular in the title. While &quot;maths&quot; can technically be correct, it is usually used when describing different branches, and kids tend not hear the term used in that context (or at least I did not). I suggest that some of the early chapters talk about the uses of elementary math, which they should be able to understand, while later chapters get more advanced. These later topics do not need to be taught, but only to show how they are used and what they can do, etc. The uses could include using math to solve puzzles and win board games, logic, making games (programming - but again, only an general overview; nothing complicated), and optimization. The more abstract uses, while important, should probably get very little (if any) coverage because not only will the math be incomprehensible, but its use will be as well. The best topics seem to be puzzles and games because they can be described physically and their purpose is already understood. [[User:Ian Burnet|Ian Burnet]] 05:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

In April this year, Hagindaz [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20060414155038&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Hagindaz merged three books] by {{user|Kurt Kawohl}}, aka {{user|Kkawohl}}, under this title.

All seem to originate from Wikipedia, judging from the intensive interlinking. The first two sections deal with spiritual transcendence &quot;into a w:Dimensional Beyondnes&quot;. Searching the internet for either of the two reveals little along the lines of the article, other than what the author of the article himself has written. The term &quot;Dimensional Beyondness&quot; was first used by Kirkegaard, but every other mention of it on the Internet is by Mr. Kawohl and in this book Kirkegaard is only mentioned in passing while Kawohl's own book and ideas take centre stage. This former half seems to be severely plagued by original research which won't be fixed by this author.

The latter is hardly any better. Despite a token &quot;... perceives:&quot; in the opening of this book's last section, it is completely an expression of a very narrow point of view. The description may be of interest, but when educational, it is too encylopaedic in tone &amp;mdash; when not, it is soapboxing.

I have stated before that I have nothing against the subject matter, were it handled appropriately. I see this in breach of Wikibooks policies and after extensive reading here on Wikibooks, at Wikipedia and the Internet, I have become convinced that this will not be rewritten properly and that the current content will not be salvaged. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:56, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:OK - first off I would possibly object if someone else did this but ...
:These two are by the same person on the same subject [[Theology/Urantian theology]] &amp; [[Urantia United Foreword]] - I've mentioned it on their user page and not had a response.  I suggest when these are all concluded something on both user talk pages about the fact that further similar offerings may well be quickly deleted would not be inappropriate - thanks and with apologies for adding to a VfD in progress --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - he's just pushing his barrow again. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 07:41, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per Swift. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:50, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - enough I feel --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:08, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - As someone worded it nicely, &quot;self-promotion spam&quot;. --[[User:Zddune|Zddune]] 18:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - Again, I don't see this as a breach of policy. As long as he realizes that he needs to solidify some of his arguments up a little, give a couple of citations and so forth, I don't see an issue. The issue I see of course, is the fact that the last edit was June of last year... I understand that stubs aren't exactly in policy yet, so I'm pretty much neutral right now. This is not spam, as he is obviously not making any money off of it, it isn't an advertisement and it is a &quot;textbook&quot; in the idea that it holds itself up. Well... it can eventually, it just needs to be &quot;de-wikified&quot;.--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 19:52, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:*'''Comment''' however as they tend to point to what I presume is his website it may well be that they are designed to attract traffic --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:36, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''': Its definitely designed to attract traffic. Do a [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Kurt+Kawohl Google] search with his name and this guy has copy pasted these materials all over the internet, whereever he can stuff them in. --[[User:Zddune|Zddune]] 23:44, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
:*'''Keep''' I'm in agreement with Dragontamer.  I think we may be a bit too hasty at times.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
::: There is nothing hasty about this nomination. I spent over an hour reading up on KK's edits on WP, here and searching the Internet. My decision to nominate this was not done beforehand, but in light of the damming evidence I am positive that this will never amount to a wikibook in step with policies. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:47, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

:: &quot;''As long as he realizes that he needs to solidify some of his arguments up a little''&quot;. I agree completely (which is why I stated that &quot;''I have nothing against the subject matter, were it handled appropriately.''&quot;) My objections to this book are that there is no indication that it will happen.
:: &quot;''This is not spam''&quot;. I'm not nominating this book for deletion on account of it being as stub, spam or an advertisement. Please note that the subject is the author's own published views. Wikibooks is not a soapbox.
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the page:
:&quot;Spiritual transcendence&quot; of a person's spirit into a w:Dimensional Beyondness was supposedlt achieved by most well known religious leaders.Abraham, Moses, Noah, w:Jesus, w:Muhammad, w:Krishna, w:Bahá'u'lláh, w:Ahmad, w:Nanak, w:Kawohl
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:: The book currently suffers from breaches of OR and NPOV policies. The user has a history of pushing his views on Wikipedia and had a bunch of stuff deleted (I admit, I'm assuming that they are one and the same. Conformation would be nice). I'm sceptical that Wikibooks will get any more cooperation. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:47, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

I edited and removed links. Please reconsider. [[User:Kkawohl|Kkawohl]] 00:36, 4 January 2007 (UTC)kkawohl

: Actually, you removed ordinary links from your ''other'' book here on VfD.
: Kkawohl, the problem is not the links. Well, they are a problem, but not one that warrants a VfD. The links are simply a sign that this is probably a copy of something from Wikipedia. Is this the case? If so, where is that copy now? In the case that it was deleted, could you provide us with links to the AfD discussion?
: The problem is that you seem to be writing a book on ideas put forth by yourself. You have a website, please use it for you personal promotion. Just as my personal theories on politics don't belong here, your ideas on spirituality don't either.
: Please don't take this personally (as [[User:Iamunknown]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Staff_lounge&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=707833 said well]). I simply see this as a breach of Wikibooks' policies. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:47, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

* '''Comment''' - I take the chance to point the user to the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] and to inform  that the same policy will probably be open for reevaluation, he is welcomed to take the chance and provide any insight that may have escaped Wikibookians previously, more, I remember the user that by deleting the book at Wikibooks, Wikibookians are expressing the general opinion to not host its content, many other services do mirror Wikibooks and the user is free under the GFDL to move it anywhere else and if he is the sole author (or using only his contributions) even under a different license, we are not evaluating the book content in itself but against the specified general wishes of the community. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:59, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

* Uh, '''delete'''........no, really.....'''delete'''.......no, I mean it: '''DELETE'''!  With about 500 hours' worth of work, this might one day become a NPOV textbook. [[User:Buddpaul|Buddpaul]] 02:09, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

* '''Propose Close''' I'm proposing that this vote be closed as delete even though it's only been open for a few days.  A quick decision is quite unusual on Wikibooks! [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:48, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:*  With care - personally I am unsure.  The policy is seven days.  It was not appreciated by another admin when I did it! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:57, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
:* No problem.  This discussion remains open.  I didn't know about any 7 day discussion rule and thought it would work like on Wikipedia where a decision is reached once a sizeable number have voted.

* '''Delete''' After thinking on it, I feel that its stubbiness and inactivity is enough reason to delete it. Another big issue is the possibility of original research... I admit that I don't know the next thing about theology, but it does sound awfully OR to me. I don't think of this as spam, nor as an advertisement however. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:13, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Arcade-20071020-a.jpg|thumb|right|Two girls playing Video Games at an arcade.]]
When people play a video game, they are not usually thinking about numbers.  Regardless of the game, most of the thinking they are doing is logic, or trying to decide the best choice.  Playing games does not have to be done so casually however.  For every game, there are people interested in the best way to play; this can be found out by using math.  More importantly, whenever one  plays against or with &quot;the computer&quot; in a video game, the computer must know the rules of the game and how to win (as well has how to  adjust difficulty for different players). But  a computer can't do anything without being taught how to do it by a human.  This is where math comes into play; math is the language computers speak, and it’s the only way to tell them how to play games.

Just like robots in science fiction, computers can only do exactly what they are told.  That might make one think that we'd be better off doing their jobs ourselves, but computers can do what they are told much faster than any human ever could.  They are not limited to simple tasks, either; if a person could tell a computer how to think, (which is not an easy task, but is being developed) a computer would be able to think. The process of writing instructions for a computer is called programming, and it is a very big, popular career today.

Every video game must be programmed, but nowadays not everything they write is numbers.  Some is a sort of mixture between human language, logic, and math known as code, but math is still essential to the process.  Developers of video games have to make music and graphics for the game, but they also have to tell the game how to work.  For example, in 3D games, developers have to tell the computer how to make things be displayed when viewed from different angles and how to make objects to not go through each other. All of these are big challenges, but possibly the biggest challenge is making Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI. While AI in video games is not real intelligence like humans have, it can still seem like it is human when it plays the game.

Every game can be broken down with math and expressed somehow with numbers.  To illustrate this, we can start with a simple game like checkers.  The board has 8 rows and 8 columns, for a total of 64 squares.  Each square could have either 0 pieces or 1 piece and that piece could be either red or black.  So we might describe the board at any given moment as 64 different numbers arranged in a square (known as a matrix). For each number we could say that 0 means no pieces, 1 means a red piece, and 2 means a black piece. We could also do this be having a number for each piece: where it is on the board. This is pretty simple for checkers, but it is not always. If we were to try to define a 2D area with numbers, we would have to use many very small squares and make some things able to be in several squares at once. This way, a player could move a little bit at a time instead of in big jumps.  If the world were 3D, there would need to be even more information about where something is.

Going back to checkers, the best way to define the game is to give each piece two numbers: its row and its column.  To start defining moves, we could say that a piece can only move diagonally by saying that it must change rows and columns at the same time, and it can only move over one at a time.  To say this with math, if you add or subtract 1 to a row, you must add or subtract 1 to a column.  To keep players from going off the board, it’s important to say that a piece can never move above the row or column 8 or below the row or column 1.

Hi Ian.  If this page is really a &quot;Wikijunior&quot; page it should actually be named &quot;Wikijunior:What can you use maths for?/Video Games&quot;.  It is quite simple to move it (nothing is lost) if that is the intention either feel free to do it or ask.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To sum a series of variables &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, the Greek capital letter sigma ''Σ'' is used:

&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma^n_{i=1} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n
&lt;/math&gt;.

There are some properties concerning the summation operator ''Σ'':

1. &lt;math&gt;
\Sigma^n_{i=1} k = nk 
&lt;/math&gt;, where k is a constant. 

2. &lt;math&gt;
\Sigma^n_{i=1} k x_i = k \Sigma^n_{i=1} x_i
&lt;/math&gt;, where k is a constant. 

3. &lt;math&gt;
\Sigma^n_{i=1} (a + b x_i) = n a + b \Sigma^n_{i=1} x_i
&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a'' and ''b'' are constants. This is a result of rules 1 and 2 above.

4. &lt;math&gt;
\Sigma^n_{i=1} (x_i + y_i) = \Sigma^n_{i=1} x_i + \Sigma^n_{i=1} y_i
&lt;/math&gt;,


The double summation operator is used to sum up twice for the same variable:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Sigma^n_{i=1} \Sigma^m_{j=1} x_{ij} &amp; = \Sigma^n_{i=1} (x_{i1} + x_{i2} + \ldots + x_{im}) \\
&amp; = (x_{11} + x_{21} + \ldots + x_{n1}) + (x_{12} + x_{22} + \ldots + x_{n2}) + \ldots + (x_{1m} + x_{2m} + \ldots + x_{nm})\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The double summation operator has the following properties:

1. &lt;math&gt;
\Sigma^n_{i=1} \Sigma^m_{j=1} x_{ij} = \Sigma^m_{i=1} \Sigma^n_{j=1} x_{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;. The order of the summation signs is interchangeable. 

2. &lt;math&gt;
\Sigma^n_{i=1} \Sigma^m_{j=1} x_i y_j = \Sigma^n_{i=1} x_i \Sigma^m_{j=1} y_j
&lt;/math&gt;.

3. &lt;math&gt;
\Sigma^n_{i=1} \Sigma^m_{j=1} (x_i + y_j) = \Sigma^n_{i=1} x_i \Sigma^m_{j=1} x_ij + \Sigma^n_{i=1} x_i \Sigma^m_{j=1} y_{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;.

4. &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left [ \Sigma^n_{i=1} x_i \right ]^2 &amp; = \Sigma^n_{i=1} {x_i}^2 + 2 \Sigma^{n-1}_{i=1} \Sigma^n_{j=i+1} x_i x_j \\
&amp; = \Sigma^n_{i=1} {x_i}^2 + 2 \Sigma_{i &lt; j} x_i x_j \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.


Finally, the product operator ''Π'' is defined as:
&lt;math&gt;
\Pi^n_{i=1} x_i = x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdots x_n
&lt;/math&gt;.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== [[Shaving]] ==
Hi, thank you for contributing Wikibooks. Can you please add all your pages to the [[Wikibooks:Categories#Book_Categories|book category]] with  &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Shaving|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;? Regards, --[[User:Ramac|Ramac]] ([[User talk:Ramac|talk]]) 18:47, 3 June 2008 (UTC)
:I also wanted to remind you to try not to create a [[WB:NOTWP|macropedia]] - Wikibooks is for textbooks, which must be ''instructional''. If your book consists solely of description of shaving, shaving equipment etc. then the book needs to be changed. It's not going to be deleted or anything, but something to work towards and think about. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:01, 4 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

= Three Knights Game =
Black can copy White's moves with [[/3...Nf6/]], leading to a very quiet game.

Other alternatives include bishop moves :
:[[/3...Bb4/]] is playable, but maybe too early because White can play 4. Nd5 (the knight is not pinned yet).
:[[/3...Bc5/]] is dangerous because White can take the e5 pawn and grab back material with the d4 fork. But it's not really a mistake because Black will be able to take a pawn during the process. In this line, Bxf2+ is playable and does not lose material.

It's also possible to play [[/3...g6/]]. It may prepare f5. It may also transpose into Scotch Game as the d4 counter-attack is often seen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Cookbook:Kefir and Kombucha]] ==
{{Closed|1= &lt;span style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot;&gt; Closed&lt;/span&gt; as '''Delete'''. -[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:00, 30 December 2006 (UTC)}}

Suggest delete this page (and its sub-pages: [[Cookbook:Kefir and Kombucha/Complete table of kefir organisms|Complete table of kefir organisms]], [[Cookbook:Kefir and Kombucha/Complete table of kefir contents|Complete table of kefir contents]]) for the following reasons:

* current content is not Cookbook material; more appropriate for Wikipedia
* a Wikipedia article [[w:Kefir|already exists]] for kefir
* a recipe [[Cookbook:Kefir|also exists]] for kefir in Wikibooks Cookbook
* nothing at all to do with [[w:Kombucha|kombucha]], as its title purports
* not [[WB:NPOV|NPOV]]
* listed for Cookwork in May this year by another Wikibookian, and nothing much done to it since

I see no reason to keep this page or its sub-pages; '''Delete''' --[[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 12:51, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' far more Wikipedia than cookbook --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:56, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
* '''Delete''', preferably once the contents have been verified to be on WP or moved there. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:45, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
** From a WP perspective, it's a mix of POV, unreferenced speculation, generalisations, misconceptions, partial fact, and a dose of copyvio from [http://users.chariot.net.au/~dna/kefirpage.html this website]. The WP page on kefir could do with some work, but requires referenced information and general editing for tone, rather than a copy from these pages.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

'''In case of order conflict'''

* left before top horizontal

* center stroke before wings

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck!--[[User:Sundance Raphael|Sundance Raphael]] 17:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== ''Cycling round the world'' ==

Thank you for posting ''[[Cycling round the world]]''. Is it, as it appears to be, a copy of Alastair Humphrey's book ''Moods of Future Joys''? &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 17:49, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

: As I strongly suspect that it is a copyright violation, I am nominating it for speedy deletion. An [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]] will evaluate my claim and then may delete the content. Please do not take this a personal offense. You are still welcome to edit Wikibooks. But your contributions must be your own original work, or anothers licensed under a [[w:free content|free content]] license and must be compatible with the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]].
: Please note that if this is not a copyright violation and is indeed your own work and is accidently deleted, you may request that it be undeleted at [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]].
: Again, thank you for contributing to Wikibooks. You are definitely welcome here. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at my [[User talk:Iamunknown|talk page]]. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 01:51, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''''Abdomen''''' – Hindmost section of the body of an insect or spider.
 
'''''Algae''''' – Water plant with no true stems or leaves.

'''''Amphibian''''' – Animal able to live both on land and in water.

'''''Antennae''''' – Pair of flexible sensitive projections on an insect’s head (feelers).

'''''Aquatic''''' – Growing or living in or near water.

'''''Arthropod''''' – Animal with its skeleton on the outside, having a segmented body and jointed limbs. Spiders, insects and crustaceans are all different types of arthropods. 

'''''Biocontrol (biological control)''''' - Use of organisms to control insect pest populations. 

'''''Bug''''' - Informal classification for any land-dwelling arthropod (insect, arachnid, crustacean, etc.)

'''''Cellulose''''' – Organic substance found in all plant tissues.

'''''Cephalothorax''''' – Two of the three major body regions (head and thorax) combined into one, as in spiders.

'''''Cerci''''' – Two tiny hairs at the tip of an insect's abdomen that detect movement.

'''''Chelicerae''''' - spider's jaws; located on the very front of a spider's cephalothorax.

'''''Chitin''''' – Organic substance forming a part of the exoskeleton.

'''''Chrysalis''''' – Capsule-enclosed pupa from which a butterfly or moth develops. 

'''''Citrus''''' – Fruit trees such as lemon, orange, and grapefruit.

'''''Cocoon''''' – Silky sheath around a chrysalis; a protective wrapping.

'''''Colony''''' – Group of organisms usually of the same species living close together. 

'''''Complete metamorphosis''''' – Insect changes to an adult in several stages. For example, a housefly changes from an egg to early larva, then to full-sized larva, then to a pupa and finally to an adult. When in the pupal stage, it “rests” before the final molt to become an adult. 

'''''Compound eye''''' – Organ of vision in many insects. It contains many light-sensitive facets that make a complete image on the retina. Very useful for detecting small movements.

'''''Cornicles''''' – Pair of wax-secreting projections (little horns) on the back end of an aphid.

'''''Coxa''''' – First segment of an insect leg.

'''''Crustacean''''' – Animal that has a hard shell, such as a crab or shrimp.

'''''Cuticle''''' – Outermost layer of an insect’s exoskeleton.

'''''Decomposer''''' – Insect that eats dead or decayed matter.

'''''Detritus''''' – Decomposing or decaying organic matter.

'''''Duff''''' – Decomposed leaf litter. 

'''''Ecdysis''''' – Another name for molting or shedding of the old exoskeleton.

'''''Elytra''''' – Sheath or covering that protects the wings of beetles.

'''''Embryo''''' – Organism in the earlier stages of development. An organism inside an egg is an embryo.

'''''Entomology''''' - Study of insects.

'''''Exoskeleton''''' – External supporting and protective structure of an insect.

'''''Fang''''' – Piercing part of the spider jaw. 

'''''Femora''''' - Plural of femur.

'''''Femur''''' – Segment of an insect’s leg nearest to its body. 

'''''Filament''''' – Fine thread or fiber.

'''''Filiform''''' – Thin and hairlike.

'''''Fry''''' – Newly hatched fish. 

'''''Gall''''' – Growth caused by an insect on a plant. It is used for protection and food.

'''''Grub''''' – Thick-bodied wormlike larva of certain insects. 

'''''Halteres''''' – Pair of balancing organs just behind and at the base of a fly’s wings.

'''''Herbivorous''''' – Feeding on vegetable matter; plant eating.

'''''Holometabolism''''' – Complete form of metamorphosis in which an insect passes through four separate stages of growth, as embryo, larva, pupa, and imago.

'''''Hydrophobic''''' – Repelling water.

'''''Imago''''' – Fully adult stage of an insect after undergoing metamorphosis. 

'''''Incomplete metamorphosis''''' - Gradual development in three distinct stages: egg, nymph, and adult, or imago. There is no pupal stage. The nymph resembles the adult but lacks wings and functional reproductive organs.

'''''Insecticide''''' – Chemical substance used for killing insects.

'''''Instar''''' – Name for the stages between molts.

'''''Invertebrates''''' – Organisms with no backbones, such as insects, crustaceans, and mollusks.

'''''Iridescent''''' – Displaying the colors of a rainbow in shifting hues and patterns, as soap bubbles.

'''''Leaf litter''''' – Partially decomposed leaves, twigs and other plant matter that has recently fallen and covers the ground.

'''''Leaf miner''''' – Insect that spends part of its life in the layers of a leaf. As it feeds it bores or tunnels mines which also provide protection.

'''''Leaf roller''''' – Insect that curls part of leaf around its body for protection during an immature stage.

'''''Lymph''''' – Clear liquid inside the body that bathes the cells with water and nutrients.

'''''Mammal''''' – Member of the class of animals that suckle their young. 

'''''Mandible''''' - Jaw.

'''''Mechanical control''''' – Method of controlling insects, such as using oil to block the spiracles so an insect cannot breathe.

'''''Metamorphosis''''' – Change in the form of the body during development. For example, the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly or a tadpole into a frog.

'''''Mimicry''''' – Copying the shape of another animal or some inanimate object such as a stick.

'''''Molting''''' – Shedding an exoskeleton so an insect can grow.

'''''Naiad''''' - Juvenile form of dragonfly, damselfly, or mayfly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you would like to discuss anything regarding the bugs project, please post here.

What does the word 'bugs' mean ? true bugs, insecta, arthopoda, or anything one can find
under a rock? Regarding the target audience, learning the correct names of taxons and
morphological structures is not much different from learning to speak. No doubt 8-12 years
old can do this. They also need to understand phrases like &quot;the beetle is black; pronotum
and elitra are red&quot;.

== New Proposed Main Bugs Page ==

I would like to propose an alternate layout for the wikijunior bugs page. . I have made a mock-up of the proposed layout on my [[User:Urbane_User/Sandbox|personal sandbox]] which can be accessed by clicking this link or through my user page. All of the existing articles and other pages will remain unaltered by this as the only page that will change will be the main bugs page, if it is accepted that is.

I have proposed this new design to increase efficiency and reduce the amount of time that is spent moving articles from the stub list into the developing articles list and so on...

Please take a look and tell me what you think.

Regards,
[[User:Urbane User|&lt;b&gt;Urbane User&lt;/b&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane User|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane_User|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:08, 15 January 2007 (UTC) 

:{{comment}} I think we should maintain a way to separate the stubs from articles with useful content. Currently there are only a couple articles that rise to the level of being more than stubs. Judging by past experience, some of these proposed articles will remain stubs for many months or even years. The problem arises when you are trying to put together a useful book, and a significant number of categories are stubs. This is a problem with Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations (where the existing format originated, as I recall) where we have enough good articles to make a decent book, but also many articles that contain no meaningful content whatsoever. The downside, as you've identified, is that it requires busy work, and that the &quot;goal&quot; table of contents gets messed up. I certainly think there's room for improvement in the current design and you've made a good start. I like the toolbox idea. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 17:49, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Having thought about this some more, I suggest that you [[Wikibooks:Be bold|Be bold]] and do what '''you''' think is right. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 15:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

== Main Bugs Page ==

I have redesigned the main user bugs page to, hopefully, make it more efficient for us to use. If anybody has any problems with the new design, i have made an archive of the old page in case it needs to be reinstated (if you would like this then please ask) and will be happy to sort out any problems that people may have.

Where are the authors list

The link to the authors list can be found both in the introduction paragraph, and in the toolbox on the right.

== move protection ==

the page is move-protected, but should now be moved to [[Wikijunior:Bugs]] // [[user:tsca|tsca]] [[:meta:user talk:tsca|[re]]] 20:17, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

== Too American ==

This book seems to be targeted entirely at American kids.  First there's the use of the name ''bug'' and the name used for some of those bugs (ladybug, for example).  Secondly when you get to the section on ''Where does it live?'', this section is generally just about naming different parts of the USA - the one about crickets talked about the USA for several sentences then mentioned, in passing kind of, that they may exist elsewhere in the world too.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:34, 24 August 2011 (UTC)

: Hm.  Is the word &quot;bug&quot; itself still mainly US dialect?  The OED (the real one&amp;nbsp;:-) says it's chiefly US, but that was written a century ago; en.wikt and en.wp don't seem to remark thereon (yes, that could be US bias on their part).  One can see how this book's authors would have hoped for an informal term to appeal to kids and, at the same time, a term with wide scope.  I'm not sure what alternative title to suggest; it doesn't seem appealing to call a kids' book &quot;Arthropods&quot; (and anyway, it excludes trilobites and crustaceans).  &quot;Insects and spiders&quot; is closer, though not precise and perhaps a bit bland.

: Do you have suggestions for an alternative title?

: Bias in specific article titles and article contents, presumably has to be dealt with on a per-article basis.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 16:45, 24 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]].

== Hey ==

Hey TheSun, thank you for your help with the book! I haven't had the time / motivation to work on it much lately, but hopefully will find both and make some improvements sometime soon. Feel free to make any other changes that you think should be made (it's probably all fresher in your mind after all, if you're studying it currently!). Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 01:53, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

==Overview==

'''''Bartemius &quot;Barty&quot; Crouch, Sr.''''' led the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s first rise to power (apparently in the 1960s). During this period he became a ruthless leader, doing things such as giving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]]s the power to kill.  He later became the head of the Department of International Magical Co-operation after losing status in the Wizarding world, due to the common belief that he drove his son to joining the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]].

==Role in the books==

===[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]===

Mr. Crouch is first mentioned as being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]]'s boss at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. Mr. Crouch is apparently the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation, and Percy is writing a report on substandard cauldrons being imported from Europe for him.

We first see Mr. Crouch at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], where he is apparently in charge of organizing the international aspects of the competition. He stops at the Weasley campsite when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] calls him over; Percy scrambles to make him a cup of tea, which Mr. Crouch accepts, calling Percy &quot;Weatherby&quot;. He then corrals [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], and they [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|apparate]] off to attend to some detail.

After the appearance of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]], Mr. Crouch is in the team of wizards that attempt to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] the wizard who produced the Mark. Mr. Crouch is suspicious of everyone there present, and is shocked when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]] discovers his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]], at the apparent source of the incantation. Arthur Weasley, another of the wizards in that group, points out that Mr. Crouch has accused the two people there present least likely to be involved with the Death Eaters: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], and his own house-elf. Mr. Crouch goes off into the woods to search for other evidence, and on his return, fires Winky.

We next see Mr. Crouch when he arrives at the school on 30 October to be introduced as one of the five judges in the upcoming [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], and again on the following night when the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] selects the Champions of each school who will take part in the Tournament. Surprisingly, the Goblet selects a fourth wizard, Harry Potter. Called upon to interpret the rule book, Crouch says that if the wizard's name comes out of the Goblet, then he is required to compete. With this settled, though to nobody's satisfaction, Crouch goes on to explain that he will not be telling them what they will face in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]] of the Tournament, because ability to think quickly and bravely is necessary to a wizard, but he does give them the date when it will occur.

As he steps into the firelight, Harry notices that Mr. Crouch seems ill; apparently [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] sees this as well, because he asks Crouch to stay the night. Crouch refuses, saying he has to get back.

Crouch is then present to the Weighing of the Wands ceremony, in which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]] checks the wands of the four Champions to see that they are in full working order. Harry thinks he still looks a bit ill.

Crouch is present again during the First Task, and he awards Harry 9 out of 10 points for retrieving the golden egg from his dragon.

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], Crouch is absent; Percy Weasley has taken his place, saying that Mr. Crouch is tired and is staying at home. He is sending instructions by Owl Post, and Percy is just glad that Crouch has an assistant that he can trust enough that he can get the rest he needs. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] suggests that he wouldn't be so tired if he hadn't summarily and unjustly fired his Elf; Percy tries to defend Crouch's actions.

Percy is again substituting for Mr. Crouch at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]]. Shortly afterwards, Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and Hermione visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who is living in a cave near [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]]. Sirius says that it is very unusual for Mr. Crouch to be taking a vacation; he was always very dedicated to his work at the Ministry. Sirius also says that it was at Mr. Crouch's direction that he was kept in Azkaban Prison for twelve years without a trial.

In late May, Harry is taken aside by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] for a private conversation under the eaves of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. As they finish their conversation, a disheveled Mr. Crouch appears, talking to the trees, and in apparent sane moments demanding to see Dumbledore. Leaving Krum to guard him, Harry runs off to collect Dumbledore, an action which is delayed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. By the time Dumbledore and Harry return to the Forbidden Forest, Krum has been Stunned and Mr. Crouch is gone.

Shortly after this, Harry is left alone in Dumbledore's office as Professor Dumbledore, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] go to investigate the place where Crouch was found. Harry discovers Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], and ends up viewing three trials at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wizengamot|Wizengamot]] in which Crouch presided. We see Crouch considering whether to release [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] based on the names of supposedly uncaught Death Eaters he has given them; presiding over the session where Ludo Bagman was released; and the session where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan Lestrange]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus Lestrange]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]], his own son, were sentenced for the torture of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alice Longbottom|Alice Longbottom]].

Fudge apparently shortly opens an inquiry into how Crouch could have been apparently so very ill without anyone in the Ministry knowing. Percy is evidently called in as part of this inquiry; as a result, Fudge himself ends up judging the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]].

Following the Third Task, when Barty Crouch Jr. is revealed, we are given some additional information. When Crouch went off into the forest after the discovery of Winky under the Dark Mark, he had found Barty Stunned under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] and sent him home. He had fired Winky, not for being associated with the Dark Mark, but for allowing Barty to escape and get himself a wand. Shortly afterwards [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] had managed to put Crouch under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]], and he had been under the Imperius Curse during the selection of the Champions and during the First Task. As Wormtail's control started getting tenuous, Crouch was confined to his home, where Voldemort and Wormtail were also staying. He had managed to escape, had made his way to the Forbidden Forest where Harry had seen him, and had then been killed by Barty, and his body hidden.

== Strengths ==

Although it is hard to say what Mr. Crouch Senior would be like, due to his presence in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' being almost entirely while under the Imperius Curse, what little we see of him in the Pensieve, at the Quidditch world cup, and from Dumbledore's and Sirius' comments on him, it appears that Mr. Crouch Senior was truly a man of the law. He prosecuted Karkaroff, and gave him no favours, and against his own will let Bagman go when the vote of the jury went against him. It is with his son, though, that we start to see his compassion. Although he does not pardon his son, in fact, harshly convicts him with other Death Eaters, Mr. Crouch accedes to his wife's dying request to remove his son from Azkaban, at her own request allowing her to replace him there. This act demonstrates Mr. Crouch Senior's ability to love, and perhaps to forgive.

Mr. Crouch does seem to eventually be able to throw off the Imperius Curse, partially or completely, though it seems that either that, or some other restraint applied to him, resulted in his being driven at least partially insane.

== Weaknesses ==

While, as mentioned above, Mr. Crouch does free his son from Azkaban at his late wife's request, he cannot forgive Barty to the extent of allowing him any freedom; though removed from the Dementors, Barty remains restrained by the Imperius curse placed on him by Mr. Crouch and by the efforts of the House-elf Winky. Mr. Crouch's love of his wife in this case could be seen as a weakness, as it impels Crouch to act against his own interests. Compassion also causes Mr. Crouch to allow Barty to attend the Quidditch World Cup, a choice which results in Mr. Crouch's capture and eventual death at his son's hand.

Mr. Crouch's severity and officiousness could also be seen as a weakness, as it prevents his showing mercy to any accused. It also leads him, presumably, to preside over the trial of his son, where a more just prosecutor would recuse himself to avoid even the appearance of partiality.

== Relationships With Other Characters ==

Mr. Crouch's severity extends to his own family, where he is seen to prosecute his own son, being instrumental in committing him to Azkaban. Yet he loves his wife enough to accede to her dying wish that Barty should be freed from Azkaban. Placed in an untenable conflict, being aware that Barty is guilty and unrepentant, Crouch resorts to keeping Barty under house arrest, using the Imperius Curse and the actions of the house-elf Winky. When this is discovered by Bertha Jorkins, Mr. Crouch destroys her memory of the event, possibly rendering her memory permanently unreliable.

Mr. Crouch's severity and officiousness is seen here as the dominant part of his personality, preventing him from getting close to anyone &amp;ndash; he addresses Percy Weasley, his own assistant, as &quot;Weatherby&quot;. We have no idea whether this is a defence mechanism intended to prevent further revelations of Barty's existence, or whether this is the way he has always been; but it would seem that if it is a conscious defence mechanism, it is simply an increase in degree from his normal personality.

Let's say that you, for some reason, wanted to know exactly how many squares there are on a chess board.  How would you figure it out?  The first thing you think of would probably be to count them out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.  You're a busy person though and don't have that kind of time, you need to know quickly.  How do you do it?  You could use a very simple geometric property: area.  

Area is how much space there is inside a 2d object (a 2d [2 dimensional] object is something like a circle or a square but not a ball or box).  Area is measured in square units.  The units are whatever I am using to measure the object, they can be feet, inches, or miles in the US or meters, centimeters, or kilometers in the rest of the world.  In the case of our chess board, the units we will use will be squares.

How do we find the area?  For a square (like our chess board) that is simple; all we need to do is multiply the length of the bottom times the length of a side.  So here is the process we will follow to find the area of our chess board.  First, count the number of squares along the bottom of the board, then count the number of squares along a side.  Both numbers should be 8.  Next multiply the two numbers.  8 x 8 = 64.  So the area of the chess board is 64 square squares, thus we have 64 squares on one chessboard, and we found that out without wasting time counting all of the spaces.

This idea can be applied to any flat, rectangular surface- even if it doesn't have squares marked off. Simply measure a surface's length and width and multiply them. They do not need to even be whole numbers (they can have decimals or fractions). For example, if a table surface measures 150 cm by 250 cm, then its area is 150 x 250 = 37,500. That's a big number! But if you drew 1 cm by 1cm squares on the table, that's how many there would be.

It's hard to think about area with decimals, but it is very useful because not all tables are going to have a whole number of squares. For example, if our table earlier was actually a little bit off- say, 150.2 by 249.6, we can still multiply these numbers, but you might need a calculator. 150.2 x 249.6 = 37,489.92, which is slightly less than before. Notice that even though one side was slightly bigger, the other side was smaller by more, so there is less area. If you drew squares on this table, you would not even get 37,489 full squares, because all squares on the edge would get cut off. But if you added up all of those pieces of squares, 37,4892 is how many full squares could be made (with .92 left over).

Area with decimals has some results that you might not expect. If a square is 1/2 meters by 1/2 meters (.5 m by .5 m), its area is .5 x .5 = .25 or 1/4. That seems strange because it is less than either the length or the width. But if you divide a square by drawing one line vertically through the center and another horizontally through the center, you will have four equal sections. That is, each square is 1/4 of the total area even though it is only 1/2 by 1/2 of the total length and width.

Area can be applied to more than just square surfaces. You can find the area on a circular or triangular table too. In fact, the area of any surface, no matter the shape, can be measured. It gets a lot more difficult for some shapes, however, so we won't teach just how, but be aware it can be done. By using area, you can compare objects that aren't of the same shape. For example, you could determine whether a circular table had more or less space than a square table.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alcoholic liver disease characteristically progresses through successive stages before terminating in cirrhosis, the end stage live disease. the disease, a companion to uncontrolled, prolonged alcohol ingestion takes years to develop(5-10 years). the first change which is noticeable is, fatty change of the liver. then comes the alcoholic hepatitis stage characterized by the inflammatory process and then the stage of cirrhosis. 
laboratory findings include AST level increase in particular.
cirrhosis itself proceeds through micro nodular and macronodular stages and finally ending in a shrunken , fibrotic liver.

==Propagator for a free and stable particle==
===The propagator as a path integral===
Suppose that we make '''m''' intermediate position measurements at fixed intervals of duration&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Delta t.&lt;/math&gt; Each of these measurements is made with the help of an array of detectors monitoring '''n''' mutually disjoint regions&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;R_k,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;k=1,\dots,n.&lt;/math&gt; Under the conditions stipulated by '''Rule&amp;nbsp;B''', the [[../two slits|propagator]] &lt;math&gt;\langle B|A\rangle&lt;/math&gt; now equals the sum of amplitudes
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k_1=1}^n\cdots\sum_{k_m=1}^n\langle B|R_{k_m}\rangle\cdots
\langle R_{k_2}|R_{k_1}\rangle\,\langle R_{k_1}|A\rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;
It is not hard to see what happens in the double limit &lt;math&gt;\Delta t\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; (which implies that &lt;math&gt;m\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;n\rightarrow\infty.&lt;/math&gt; The multiple sum &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k_1=1}^n\cdots\sum_{k_m=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; becomes an integral &lt;math&gt;\int\!\mathcal{DC}&lt;/math&gt; over continuous spacetime paths from '''A''' to '''B''', and the amplitude &lt;math&gt;\langle B|R_{k_m}\rangle\cdots\langle R_{k_1} |A \rangle&lt;/math&gt; becomes a complex-valued functional &lt;math&gt;Z[\mathcal{C}:A\rightarrow B]&lt;/math&gt; — a complex function of continuous functions representing continuous spacetime paths from '''A''' to&amp;nbsp;'''B''':
:&lt;math&gt;\langle B|A\rangle=\int\!\mathcal{DC}\,Z[\mathcal{C}:A\rightarrow B]&lt;/math&gt;
The integral &lt;math&gt;\int\!\mathcal{DC}&lt;/math&gt; is not your standard [[wikipedia:Riemann integral|Riemann integral]] &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b dx\,f(x),&lt;/math&gt; to which each infinitesimal interval &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; makes a contribution proportional to the value that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; takes inside the interval, but a [[wikipedia:Functional integration|functional or path integral]], to which each &quot;bundle&quot; of paths of infinitesimal width &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{DC}&lt;/math&gt; makes a contribution proportional to the value that &lt;math&gt;Z[\mathcal{C}]&lt;/math&gt; takes inside the bundle.

As it stands, the path integral &lt;math&gt;\int\!\mathcal{DC}&lt;/math&gt; is just the idea of an idea. Appropriate evalutation methods have to be devised on a more or less case-by-case basis.

===A free particle===
Now pick any path &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; from '''A''' to&amp;nbsp;'''B''', and then pick any infinitesimal segment &lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Label the start and end points of &lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; by [[wikipedia:Inertial frame of reference|inertial coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;t,x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t+dt,x+dx,y+dy,z+dz,&lt;/math&gt;  respectively. In the general case, the amplitude &lt;math&gt;Z(d\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt; will be a function  of &lt;math&gt;t,x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dt,dx,dy,dz.&lt;/math&gt; In the case of a free particle, &lt;math&gt;Z(d\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt; depends neither on the position of &lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; in spacetime (given by &lt;math&gt;t,x,y,z&lt;/math&gt;) nor on the spacetime orientiaton of &lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; (given by the [[wikipedia:Four-velocity|four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;(c\,dt/ds,dx/ds,dy/ds,dz/ds)&lt;/math&gt; but only on the [[wikipedia:Proper time|proper time]] interval &lt;math&gt;ds=\sqrt{dt^2-(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2)/c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

(Because its norm equals the speed of light, the four-velocity depends on three rather than four independent parameters. Together with &lt;math&gt;ds,&lt;/math&gt; they contain the same information as the four independent numbers &lt;math&gt;dt,dx,dy,dz.&lt;/math&gt;)

Thus for a free particle &lt;math&gt;Z(d\mathcal{C})=Z(ds).&lt;/math&gt; With this, the [[../two_slits#Why_product.3F|multiplicativity of successive propagators]] tells us that
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_j Z(ds_j)=Z\Bigl(\sum_j ds_j\Bigr)\longrightarrow Z\Bigl(\int_\mathcal{C}ds\Bigr)&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that there is a complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Z[\mathcal{C}]=e^{z\,s[\mathcal{C}:A\rightarrow B]},&lt;/math&gt; where the [[wikipedia:Line integral|line integral]] &lt;math&gt;s[\mathcal{C}:A\rightarrow B]= \int_\mathcal{C}ds&lt;/math&gt; gives the time that passes on a clock as it travels from '''A''' to '''B''' via&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt;

===A free and stable particle===
By integrating &lt;math&gt;\bigl|\langle B|A\rangle\bigr|^2&lt;/math&gt; (as a function of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_B&lt;/math&gt;) over the whole of space, we obtain the probability of finding that a particle launched at the spacetime point &lt;math&gt;t_A,\mathbf{r}_A&lt;/math&gt; still exists at the time&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t_B.&lt;/math&gt; For a stable particle this probability equals&amp;nbsp;1:
:&lt;math&gt;
\int\!d^3r_B\left|\langle t_B,\mathbf{r}_B|t_A,\mathbf{r}_A\rangle\right|^2=
\int\!d^3r_B\left|\int\!\mathcal{DC}\,e^{z\,s[\mathcal{C}:A\rightarrow B]}\right|^2=1
&lt;/math&gt;
If you contemplate this equation with a calm heart and an open mind, you will notice that if the complex number &lt;math&gt;z=a+ib&lt;/math&gt; had a real part &lt;math&gt;a\neq0,&lt;/math&gt; then the integral between the two equal signs would either blow up &lt;math&gt;(a&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt; or drop off &lt;math&gt;(a&lt;0)&lt;/math&gt; exponentially as a function of &lt;math&gt;t_B&lt;/math&gt;, due to the exponential factor &lt;math&gt;e^{a\,s[\mathcal{C}]}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Meaning of mass===
The propagator for a free and stable particle thus has a single &quot;degree of freedom&quot;: it depends solely on the value of &lt;math&gt;b.&lt;/math&gt; If proper time is measured in seconds, then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is measured in radians per second. We may think of &lt;math&gt;e^{ib\,s},&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; a proper-time parametrization of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C},&lt;/math&gt; as a ''clock'' carried by a particle that travels from '''A''' to&amp;nbsp;'''B''' via &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C},&lt;/math&gt; provided we keep in mind that we are thinking of an aspect of the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics rather than an aspect of the real world.

It is customary
* to insert a minus (so the clock actually turns clockwise!): &lt;math&gt;Z=e^{-ib\,s[\mathcal{C}]},&lt;/math&gt;
* to multiply by &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; (so that we may think of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; as the rate at which the clock &quot;ticks&quot; — the number of cycles it completes each second): &lt;math&gt;Z=e^{-i\,2\pi\,b\,s[\mathcal{C}]},&lt;/math&gt;
* to divide by Planck's constant &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; (so that &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is measured in energy units and called the [[wikipedia:Rest energy|rest energy]] of the particle): &lt;math&gt;Z=e^{-i(2\pi/h)\,b\,s[\mathcal{C}]}=e^{-(i/\hbar)\,b\,s[\mathcal{C}]},&lt;/math&gt;
* and to multiply by &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt; (so that &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is measured in mass units and called the particle's [[wikipedia:Invariant mass|rest mass]]): &lt;math&gt;Z=e^{-(i/\hbar)\,b\,c^2\,s[\mathcal{C}]}.&lt;/math&gt;
The purpose of using the same letter &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; everywhere is to emphasize that it denotes the same physical quantity, merely measured in different units. If we use [[wikipedia:Natural units|natural units]] in which &lt;math&gt;\hbar=c=1,&lt;/math&gt; rather than conventional ones, the identity of the various &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;'s is immediately obvious.

==What does it look like?==
[[Image:Phalagnium_opilio.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A harvestman. 
Harvestmen are sometimes called Daddy longlegs. Other common names are granddaddy-longlegs, harvest spiders, shepherd spiders, and reapers. 

They belong to the class Arachnida, but are not true spiders. Many different kinds of creatures belong to this class, including spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks. Harvestmen are opilionids. The body is a single oval unit. There is no constriction between the cephalothorax and the abdomen. Unlike spiders, harvestmen do not have a segmented abdomen.

They have 2 eyes, often on raised structures. Chelicerae (pincers) have 3 segments; pedipalps (feelers) have 6 segments. The 4 pairs of walking legs have 7 segments. The second pair of legs is longest and acts like antennae. All of the legs are attached to the cephalothorax. None are attached to the abdomen.

Harvestmen have extremely long, thin legs. The legs break off easily and do not grow back. The reddish-brown body is 1/8 to 1/2 inch long. There is a very small claw at the tip of each pedipalp. 

Worldwide, there are about forty families of Harvestmen. Only members of the Phalangiidae family—Eastern Daddy longlegs and Brown Daddy longlegs— are considered true Daddy longlegs.

Eastern Daddy longlegs are yellowish to greenish-brown. They are 1 /4 to 3/8 of an inch long. There is a blackish stripe on each side of the body. Their long thin legs are pale to dark colored. 

Brown Daddy longlegs have a reddish-brown body. They are 1/8 to
1 /4 of an inch long with long dark legs. 

Harvestmen in the Family Cosmetidae are generally dull-colored. Some are able to change color to blend in with their surroundings. Harvestmen in the tropics are green or yellow with reddish-brown legs.

Many Harvestmen in the Family Gonyleptidae are brightly colored. They usually have stout bodies with small bumps on the surface. The hind legs sometimes have long, sharp spines. Males tend to have smaller bodies, with more spines on their legs, than females. 

The endangered Cokendolpher Cave Harvestman is small and does not have eyes. It is also known as Robber Baron Cave Harvestman.

==Where does it live?==
Most harvestman species live in moist, shady environments like caves, basements and deep woods. They are found under logs and rocks. 
 
Cosmetids live in tropical regions of North and South America. They are found under stones and debris in grassland, forest, and semidesert regions. Gonyleptids live in South American tropical forests, under logs and stones.
Eastern Daddy longlegs are found east of the Rocky Mountains. They are found on leaves, tree trunks, and shady walls of buildings. 

Brown Daddy longlegs are found throughout North America. They can be seen in shady areas and in fields. They hide under rocks, on tree trunks and foliage in open areas. 
 
Cokendolpher Cave Harvestmen are only found in Bexar County Texas. They are subterranean, living underground in a cave. Much of their habitat has been destroyed. None have been seen since 1993.

==What does it eat?==
Harvestmen are mostly scavengers. They are omnivores, feeding on insects and plants. In darkness, they search for slow-moving or dead insects. They eat small insects, insect eggs, mites, and earthworms. They eat fungi, decaying organic plant material and juices. Sometimes adults store food for their larvae to eat.

==How does it defend itself?==
Harvestmen are eaten by birds, large spiders, and predatory insects. They have spines on their legs to fend off predators. If a leg falls off, it keeps twitching a while. Scientists believe this helps detract predators so the harvestman can escape.

Harvestmen do not have venom glands. They have special glands on the carapace (protective covering). Crystals in these glands contain a defensive fluid with a distinctive odor. When attacked, the harvestman regurgitates a drop of fluid to mix with the crystals. The tips of the forelegs are dipped into the fluid then brushed onto the attacker. This defense is called “leg dabbing”.  Some fluid remains on the harvestman’s body to keep the attacker away. The fluid is replenished when the harvestman drinks water.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
Male Harvestmen do not court females before mating. Some species reproduce by direct fertilization. In a few species, females reproduce without males. 

After fertilization, females use a special slender tube (ovipositor) to insert hundreds of eggs into cracks in the soil. The eggs are inserted one-by-one and overwinter in the soil. Females of one Gonyleptid species build a mud wall around their eggs to protect them. 

Young harvestmen molt as they slowly grow larger in the soil. The outgrown cuticle is shed and replaced with a larger one. The new one has folded membranes inside. It is soft and fragile. The immature harvestman swallows air to swell up inside and expand the new cuticle. The mature harvestman will split the cuticle and crawl out in summer. One generation matures each year. In areas where frost occurs, few adults survive until spring.

==What special behaviour does it exhibit?==
Harvestmen have no silk glands, so they are unable to spin webs to catch prey. They hunt at night and will sit motionless on leaves waiting to ambush their prey.  

Dozens of adult daddy longlegs often gather close together with their legs interlaced. In cold weather, they may cluster in knotholes of trees. In dry climates, they gather together during the day. Scientists think they do this to avoid drying out.  

Some species of Harvestmen have red mites parasites attached to their legs.

==How does this bug affect people?==
Harvestmen rarely enter houses. They may be considered a nuisance when they gather in large numbers. 

They are medically harmless to people. They do not harm animals, crops, or buildings. They are not venomous although many people wrongly think they are. Some people believe they do not bite. Others say the fangs are able to penetrate skin but only cause a mild reaction. 

People once believed daddy longlegs could find lost cattle. To find a lost herd, a farmer would pick up a daddy longlegs by its legs. One leg was left free to point in the direction of the cattle. 
Some people think killing a daddy longlegs will bring rain.

Harvestmen are beneficial because they eat insects and help decompose dead organic matter.

==Fractions symbols==
G'day, it would be very handy to have the fractions symbols added into this boilerplate. See the [[w:MediaWiki:Edittools|Wikipedia equivalent]], or just wedge the following code in somewhere:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;charinsert&gt; ½ ⅓ ⅔ ¼ ¾ ⅛ ⅜ ⅝ ⅞ &lt;/charinsert&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Trouble ==

My wiki doesn't show it as it should... it just shows the plain text.. do i need to modify anything in the php files? --[[User:Gerard armando|Gerard armando]] 05:20, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

== Nasalization ==

I think it would be helpful if we could include a number of nasalized vowels for transcription of French and Portuguese at the least, namely: ã  ɑ̃  ə̃  ɛ̃  ɔ̃  œ̃  æ̃  ẽ  ĩ  õ  and ũ. On other wikis, they have had trouble getting the combining character (&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;̃) to show up on its own, so they included just the common nasalized vowels with the diacritic.

: I have no objections to putting these under say the Latin list, but I just wanted to make sure this is the complete list of symbols you'd like. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:32, 23 June 2010 (UTC)

== tie bar ==

Also the ‿ symbol would be helpful. Thanks. —'''[[User:Internoob|Internoob]]''' ([[User talk:Internoob|Disc]]·[[Special:Contributions/Internoob|Cont]]·[[wikt:User:Internoob|Wikt]]) 19:13, 22 June 2010 (UTC)

'''Montreal Russian Borscht'''; this recipe was a prize winner in Montreal, Canada's Russian community

==Ingredients==
* 7 litres [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 1 can stewed [[Cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es, or an equivalent amount of fresh tomatoes
* 1 small can [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]] and [[cookbook:salt|salt]], to taste
* 1 large [[cookbook:onion|onion]], thinly sliced
* 1 or 2 cloves [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
* 5 or 6 medium [[cookbook:beet|beet]]s, peeled and julienned
* 3 medium [[cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s, peeled and julienned
* 1 [[cookbook:potato|potato]], julienned (optional)
* &amp;frac12; large [[cookbook:Cabbage|white cabbage]], shredded 

==Procedure==
# Fill large [[cookbook:stock pot|stock pot]] with water. Add can stewed tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, salt, onion, garlic, and beets, and bring to a [[cookbook:boil|boil]] for 20 minutes.                       
# Add carrots, cabbage, and optionally the potato.
# Return to a boil and cook for 1.5 hours

==Notes, tips, and variations==
It's very important to remember that this particular recipe is somewhat like wine. The older it gets, the better it gets. It is recommended to let sit in refrigerator for at least two days, before serving. The difference is truly remarkable.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Cuisine of Vietnam]]

'''Summer Rolls''', or ''Gỏi Cuốn'' in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnamese]], are wraps of various ingredients in rice wafers, and are often confused with [[Cookbook:Nem|Nem]] or spring rolls (which, in turn, are often confused with [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg rolls]]).

==Ingredients==
* 4 [[Cookbook:Rice Wafer|rice wafers]] (rice paper, tapioca sheet)
* 4-8 [[Cookbook:Shrimp|prawns]]
* 50g cooked [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] or [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] meat
* 50g cooked [[Cookbook:Vermicelli|vermicelli]] (thin rice noodles)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]], sliced into fingers
* 4 leaves of [[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]] (leafy variety - Romaine/Cos, Mignonette, etc.)
* 2 leaves of [[Cookbook:Nappa Cabbage|Chinese cabbage]], halved lengthways
* fresh herbs, to taste (e.g. [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]])
* a bowl of warm [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==
[[Image:East-asian-food-spring-rolls-1.jpg|thumb|right|Ingredients before rolling]]
Repeat for each summer roll:
# Dip a rice wafer into the warm water and remove immediately when it is completely wet - it only needs to be in the water for a few seconds
# Lay the rice wafer on a board or plate
# Arrange a portion of the ingredients near the edge of the rice wafer in a neat pile, with the fingers of cucumber roughly parallel to the edge of the wafer
# Fold the edge of the wafer over the pile of ingredients, and roll it over once
# Fold the sides of the wafer inwards, to close of the ends of the roll you just made
# Roll the wafer up the rest of the way, to enclose the roll completely
# Set aside for 5 minutes to dry a little before eating

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Summer rolls can easily be made vegetarian by omitting the prawns and meat, and adding more greens and vegetables like [[Cookbook:Bean Sprouts|bean sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Snow Pea|snow pea sprouts]], fingers of [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Any Book planned which teaches step-by-step coding of OS (e.g. Minix/Minix-3)==
Over time I have been looking for a book which can guide say a C/C++ programmer to write his own OS. Normally books only discuss the various modules(Memory Management, Process Management etc) and stop at that, in case of book on Minix by [[w:Andrew S. Tanenbaum| Andrew S. Tanenbaum]] it supplied the source code but didn't devote chapters on writing part of the souce code. Any such book available somewhere or is there a plan for the same.

== Theseus and the Zipper ==
=== The Labyrinth ===
&quot;Theseus, we have to do something&quot; said Homer, chief marketing officer of Ancient Geeks Inc.. Theseus put the Minotaur action figure™ back onto the shelf and nodded. &quot;Today's children are no longer interested in the ancient myths, they prefer modern heroes like Spiderman or Sponge Bob.&quot; ''Heroes''. Theseus knew well how much he had been a hero in the labyrinth back then on Crete&lt;ref&gt;Ian Stewart. ''The true story of how Theseus found his way out of the labyrinth''. Scientific American, February 1991, page 137.&lt;/ref&gt;. But those &quot;modern heroes&quot; did not even try to appear realistic. What made them so successful? Anyway, if the pending sales problems could not be resolved, the shareholders would certainly arrange a passage over the Styx for Ancient Geeks Inc.

&quot;Heureka! Theseus, I have an idea: we implement your story with the Minotaur as a computer game! What do you say?&quot; Homer was right. There had been several books, epic (and chart breaking) songs, a mandatory movie trilogy and uncountable Theseus &amp; the Minotaur™ gimmicks, but a computer game was missing. &quot;Perfect, then. Now, Theseus, your task is to implement the game&quot;.

A true hero, Theseus chose Haskell as the language to implement the company's redeeming product in. Of course, exploring the labyrinth of the Minotaur was to become one of the game's highlights. He pondered: &quot;We have a two-dimensional labyrinth whose corridors can point in many directions. Of course, we can abstract from the detailed lengths and angles: for the purpose of finding the way out, we only need to know how the path forks. To keep things easy, we model the labyrinth as a tree. This way, the two branches of a fork cannot join again when walking deeper and the player cannot go round in circles. But I think there is enough opportunity to get lost; and this way, if the player is patient enough, he can explore the entire labyrinth with the left-hand rule.&quot;

 data Node a = DeadEnd a
             | Passage a (Node a)
             | Fork    a (Node a) (Node a)

[[Image:Labyrinth-Tree.png|center|frame|An example labyrinth and its representation as tree.]]

Theseus made the nodes of the labyrinth carry an extra parameter of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. Later on, it may hold game relevant information like the coordinates of the spot a node designates, the ambience around it, a list of game items that lie on the floor, or a list of monsters wandering in that section of the labyrinth. We assume that two helper functions

 get :: Node a -&gt; a
 put :: a -&gt; Node a -&gt; Node a

retrieve and change the value of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; stored in the first argument of every constructor of &lt;code&gt;Node a&lt;/code&gt;.
{{Exercises|1=
# Implement &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt;. One case for &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;get (Passage x _) = x&lt;/code&gt;.
# To get a concrete example, write down the labyrinth shown in the picture as a value of type &lt;code&gt;Node (Int,Int)&lt;/code&gt;. The extra parameter &lt;code&gt;(Int,Int)&lt;/code&gt; holds the cartesian coordinates of a node.}}

&quot;Mh, how to represent the player's current position in the labyrinth? The player can explore deeper by choosing left or right branches, like in&quot;

  turnRight :: Node a -&gt; Maybe (Node a)
  turnRight (Fork _ l r) = Just r
  turnRight _            = Nothing

&quot;But replacing the current top of the labyrinth with the corresponding sub-labyrinth this way is not an option, because he cannot go back then.&quot; He pondered. &quot;Ah, we can apply ''Ariadne's trick with the thread'' for going back. We simply represent the player's position by the list of branches his thread takes, the labyrinth always remains the same.&quot;

 data Branch = KeepStraightOn
             | TurnLeft
             | TurnRight
 type Thread = [Branch]

[[Image:Labyrinth-Thread.png|center|frame|Representation of the player's position by Ariadne's thread.]]

&quot;For example, a thread &lt;code&gt;[TurnRight,KeepStraightOn]&lt;/code&gt; means that the player took the right branch at the entrance and then went straight down a &lt;code&gt;Passage&lt;/code&gt; to reach its current position. With the thread, the player can now explore the labyrinth by extending or shortening it. For instance, the function &lt;code&gt;turnRight&lt;/code&gt; extends the thread by appending the &lt;code&gt;TurnRight&lt;/code&gt; to it.&quot;

 turnRight :: Thread -&gt; Thread
 turnRight t = t ++ [TurnRight]

&quot;To access the extra data, i.e. the game relevant items and such, we simply follow the thread into the labyrinth.&quot;

 retrieve :: Thread -&gt; Node a -&gt; a
 retrieve []                  n             = get n
 retrieve (KeepStraightOn:bs) (Passage _ n) = retrieve bs n
 retrieve (TurnLeft      :bs) (Fork _ l r)  = retrieve bs l
 retrieve (TurnRight     :bs) (Fork _ l r)  = retrieve bs r

{{Exercises|1=Write a function &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; that applies a function of type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; to the extra data at the player's position.}}

Theseus' satisfaction over this solution did not last long. &quot;Unfortunately, if we want to extend the path or go back a step, we have to change the last element of the list. We could store the list in reverse, but even then, we have to follow the thread again and again to access the data in the labyrinth at the player's position. Both actions take time proportional to the length of the thread and for  large labyrinths, this will be too long. Isn't there another way?&quot;

=== Ariadne's Zipper ===
While Theseus was a skillful warrior, he did not train much in the art of programming and could not find a satisfying solution. After intense but fruitless cogitation, he decided to call his former love Ariadne to ask her for advice. After all, it was she who had the idea with the thread.
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|Ariadne Consulting. What can I do for you?}}
&lt;br&gt;Our hero immediately recognized the voice.
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Hello Ariadne, it's Theseus.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;An uneasy silence paused the conversation. Theseus remembered well that he had abandoned her on the island of Naxos and knew that she would not appreciate his call. But Ancient Geeks Inc. was on the road to Hades and he had no choice.
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Uhm, darling, ... how are you?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;Ariadne retorted an icy response, {{Haskell speaker 2|Mr. Theseus, the times of ''darling'' are long over. What do you want?}}
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Well, I uhm ... I need some help with a programming problem. I'm programming a new Theseus &amp; the Minotaur™ computer game.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;She jeered, {{Haskell speaker 2|Yet another artifact to glorify your 'heroic being'? And you want me of all people to help you?}}
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Ariadne, please, I beg of you, Ancient Geeks Inc. is on the brink of insolvency. The game is our last hope!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;After a pause, she came to a decision.
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|Fine, I will help you. But only if you transfer a substantial part of Ancient Geeks Inc. to me. Let's say thirty percent.}}
&lt;br&gt;Theseus turned pale. But what could he do? The situation was desperate enough, so he agreed but only after negotiating Ariadne's share to a tenth.

After Theseus told Ariadne of the labyrinth representation he had in mind, she could immediately give advice,
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|You need a '''zipper'''.}}
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Huh? What does the problem have to do with my fly?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|Nothing, it's a data structure first published by Gérard Huet&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Huet. ''The Zipper''. Journal of Functional Programming, 7 (5), Sept 1997, pp. 549--554. [http://www.st.cs.uni-sb.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;.}}
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Ah.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|More precisely, it's a purely functional way to augment tree-like data structures like lists or binary trees with a single '''focus''' or '''finger''' that points to a subtree inside the data structure and allows constant time updates and lookups at the spot it points to&lt;ref&gt;Note the notion of ''zipper'' as coined by Gérard Huet also allows to replace whole subtrees even if there is no extra data associated with them. In the case of our labyrinth, this is irrelevant. We will come back to this in the section [[#Differentiation of data types|Differentiation of data types]].&lt;/ref&gt;. In our case, we want a focus on the player's position.}}
&lt;br&gt;&quot;I know for myself that I want fast updates, but how do I code it?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|Don't get impatient, you cannot solve problems by coding, you can only solve them by thinking. The only place where we can get constant time updates in a purely functional data structure is the topmost node&lt;ref&gt;Of course, the second topmost node or any other node at most a constant number of links away from the top will do as well.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that changing the whole data structure as opposed to updating the data at a node can be achieved in amortized constant time even if more nodes than just the top node is affected. An example is incrementing a number in binary representation. While incrementing say &lt;code&gt;111..11&lt;/code&gt; must touch all digits to yield &lt;code&gt;1000..00&lt;/code&gt;, the increment function nevertheless runs in constant amortized time (but not in constant worst case time).&lt;/ref&gt;. So, the focus necessarily has to be at the top. Currently, the topmost node in your labyrinth is always the entrance, but your previous idea of replacing the labyrinth by one of its sub-labyrinths ensures that the player's position is at the topmost node.}}
&lt;br&gt;&quot;But then, the problem is how to go back, because all those sub-labyrinths get lost that the player did not choose to branch into.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|Well, you can use my thread in order not to lose the sub-labyrinths.}}
&lt;br&gt;Ariadne savored Theseus' puzzlement but quickly continued before he could complain that he already used Ariadne's thread,
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|The key is to ''glue the lost sub-labyrinths to the thread'' so that they actually don't get lost at all. The intention is that the thread and the current sub-labyrinth complement one another to the whole labyrinth. With 'current' sub-labyrinth, I mean the one that the player stands on top of. The zipper simply consists of the thread and the current sub-labyrinth.}}

 type Zipper a = (Thread a, Node a)

[[Image:Labyrinth-Zipper.png|center|frame|The zipper is a pair of Ariadne's thread and the current sub-labyrinth that the player stands on top. The main thread is colored red and has sub-labyrinths attached to it, such that the whole labyrinth can be reconstructed from the pair.]]

Theseus didn't say anything.
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|You can also view the thread as a '''context''' in which the current sub-labyrinth resides. Now, let's find out how to define &lt;code&gt;Thread a&lt;/code&gt;. By the way, &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt; has to take the extra parameter &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; because it now stores sub-labyrinths. The thread is still a simple list of branches, but the branches are different from before.}}

 data Branch a  = KeepStraightOn a
                | TurnLeft  a (Node a)
                | TurnRight a (Node a)
 type Thread a  = [Branch a]

{{Haskell speaker 2|Most importantly, &lt;code&gt;TurnLeft&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TurnRight&lt;/code&gt; have a sub-labyrinth glued to them. When the player chooses say to turn right, we extend the thread with a &lt;code&gt;TurnRight&lt;/code&gt; and now attach the untaken left branch to it, so that it doesn't get lost.}}
&lt;br&gt;Theseus interrupts, &quot;Wait, how would I implement this behavior as a function &lt;code&gt;turnRight&lt;/code&gt;? And what about the first argument of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;TurnRight&lt;/code&gt;? Ah, I see. We not only need to glue the branch that would get lost, but also the extra data of the &lt;code&gt;Fork&lt;/code&gt; because it would otherwise get lost as well. So, we can generate a new branch by a preliminary&quot;

 branchRight (Fork x l r) = TurnRight x l

&quot;Now, we have to somehow extend the existing thread with it.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|Indeed. The second point about the thread is that it is stored ''backwards''. To extend it, you put a new branch in front of the list. To go back, you delete the topmost element.}}
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Aha, this makes extending and going back take only constant time, not time proportional to the length as in my previous version. So the final version of &lt;code&gt;turnRight&lt;/code&gt; is&quot;

 turnRight :: Zipper a -&gt; Maybe (Zipper a)
 turnRight (t, Fork x l r) = Just (TurnRight x l : t, r)
 turnRight _               = Nothing

[[Image:Labyrinth-TurnRight.png|center|frame|Taking the right subtree from the entrance. Of course, the thread is initially empty. Note that the thread runs backwards, i.e. the topmost segment is the most recent.]]

&quot;That was not too difficult. So let's continue with &lt;code&gt;keepStraightOn&lt;/code&gt; for going down a passage. This is even easier than choosing a branch as we only need to keep the extra data:&quot;

 keepStraightOn :: Zipper a -&gt; Maybe (Zipper a)
 keepStraightOn (t, Passage x n) = Just (KeepStraightOn x : t, n)
 keepStraightOn _                = Nothing

[[Image:Labyrinth-KeepStraightOn.png|center|frame|Now going down a passage.]]

{{Exercises|1=Write the function &lt;code&gt;turnLeft&lt;/code&gt;.}}

Pleased, he continued, &quot;But the interesting part is to go back, of course. Let's see...&quot;

 back :: Zipper a -&gt; Maybe (Zipper a)
 back ([]                   , _) = Nothing
 back (KeepStraightOn x : t , n) = Just (t, Passage x n)
 back (TurnLeft  x r    : t , l) = Just (t, Fork x l r)
 back (TurnRight x l    : t , r) = Just (t, Fork x l r)

&quot;If the thread is empty, we're already at the entrance of the labyrinth and cannot go back. In all other cases, we have to wind up the thread. And thanks to the attachments to the thread, we can actually reconstruct the sub-labyrinth we came from.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;Ariadne remarked, {{Haskell speaker 2|Note that a partial test for correctness is to check that each bound variable like &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; on the left hand side appears exactly once at the right hands side as well. So, when walking up and down a zipper, we only redistribute data between the thread and the current sub-labyrinth.}}

{{Exercises|1=
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now that we can navigate the zipper, code the functions &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; that operate on the extra data at the player's position.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zippers are by no means limited to the concrete example &lt;code&gt;Node a&lt;/code&gt;, they can be constructed for all tree-like data types. Go on and construct a zipper for binary trees
&lt;pre&gt;
 data Tree a = Leaf a | Bin (Tree a) (Tree a)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Start by thinking about the possible branches &lt;code&gt;Branch a&lt;/code&gt; that a thread can take. What do you have to glue to the thread when exploring the tree?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple lists have a zipper as well.
&lt;pre&gt;
 data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a)
&lt;/pre&gt;
What does it look like?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write a complete game based on Theseus' labyrinth.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;}}

Heureka! That was the solution Theseus sought and Ancient Geeks Inc. should prevail, even if partially sold to Ariadne Consulting. But one question remained:
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Why is it called zipper?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|Well, I would have called it 'Ariadne's pearl necklace'. But most likely, it's called zipper because the thread is in analogy to the open part and the sub-labyrinth is like the closed part of a zipper. Moving around in the data structure is analogous to zipping or unzipping the zipper.}}
&lt;br&gt;&quot;'Ariadne's pearl necklace',&quot; he articulated disdainfully. &quot;As if your thread was any help back then on Crete.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;{{Haskell speaker 2|As if the idea with the thread were yours,}} she replied.
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Bah, I need no thread,&quot; he defied the fact that he actually did need the thread to program the game.
&lt;br&gt;Much to his surprise, she agreed, {{Haskell speaker 2|Well, indeed you don't need a thread. Another view is to literally grab the tree at the focus with your finger and lift it up in the air. The focus will be at the top and all other branches of the tree hang down. You only have to assign the resulting tree a suitable algebraic data type, most likely that of the zipper.}}

[[Image:Labyrinth-Finger.png|center|frame|Grab the focus with your finger, lift it in the air and the hanging branches will form new tree with your finger at the top, ready to be structured by an algebraic data type.]]

&quot;Ah.&quot; He didn't need Ariadne's thread but he needed Ariadne to tell him? That was too much.
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Thank you, Ariadne, good bye.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;She did not hide her smirk as he could not see it anyway through the phone.

Half a year later, Theseus stopped in front of a shop window, defying the cold rain that tried to creep under his buttoned up anorak. Blinking letters announced
&lt;center&gt;&quot;Spider-Man: lost in the Web&quot;&lt;br&gt;
- find your way through the labyrinth of threads -&lt;br&gt;
the great computer game by Ancient Geeks Inc.
&lt;/center&gt;
He cursed the day when he called Ariadne and sold her a part of the company. Was it she who contrived the unfriendly takeover by WineOS Corp., led by Ariadne's husband Dionysus? Theseus watched the raindrops finding their way down the glass window. After the production line was changed, nobody would produce Theseus and the Minotaur™ merchandise anymore. He sighed. His time, the time of heroes, was over. Now came the super-heroes.

== Differentiation of data types ==

The previous section has presented the zipper, a way to augment a tree-like data structure &lt;code&gt;Node a&lt;/code&gt; with a finger that can focus on the different subtrees. While we constructed a zipper for a particular data structure &lt;code&gt;Node a&lt;/code&gt;, the construction can be easily adapted to different tree data structures by hand.
{{Exercises|1=
Start with a ternary tree
&lt;pre&gt;
 data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a) (Tree a)
&lt;/pre&gt;
and derive the corresponding &lt;code&gt;Thread a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Zipper a&lt;/code&gt;.
}}

=== Mechanical Differentiation ===
But there is also an entirely mechanical way to derive the zipper of any (suitably regular) data type. Surprisingly, 'derive' is to be taken literally, for the zipper can be obtained by the '''derivative''' of the data type, a discovery first described by Conor McBride&lt;ref&gt;Conor Mc Bride. ''The Derivative of a Regular Type is its Type of One-Hole Contexts''. Available online. [http://strictlypositive.org/diff.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;. The subsequent section is going to explicate this truly wonderful mathematical gem.

For a systematic construction, we need to calculate with types. The basics of structural calculations with types are outlined in a separate chapter [[../Generic Programming/]] and we will heavily rely on this material.

Let's look at some examples to see what their zippers have in common and how they hint differentiation. The type of binary tree is the fixed point of the recursive equation
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Tree2} = 1 + \mathit{Tree2}\times\mathit{Tree2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
When walking down the tree, we iteratively choose to enter the left or the right subtree and then glue the not-entered subtree to Ariadne's thread. Thus, the branches of our thread have the type
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Branch2} = \mathit{Tree2} + \mathit{Tree2} \cong 2\times\mathit{Tree2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
Similarly, the thread for a ternary tree
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Tree3} = 1 + \mathit{Tree3}\times\mathit{Tree3}\times\mathit{Tree3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
has branches of type
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Branch3} = 3\times\mathit{Tree3}\times\mathit{Tree3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
because at every step, we can choose between three subtrees and have to store the two subtrees we don't enter. Isn't this strikingly similar to the derivatives &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} x^2 = 2\times x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} x^3 = 3\times x^2&lt;/math&gt;?

The key to the mystery is the notion of the '''one-hole context''' of a data structure. Imagine a data structure parameterised over a type &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, like the type of trees &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Tree}\,X&lt;/math&gt;. If we were to remove one of the items of this type &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from the structure and somehow mark the now empty position, we obtain a structure with a marked hole. The result is called &quot;one-hole context&quot; and inserting an item of type &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into the hole gives back a completely filled &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Tree}\,X&lt;/math&gt;. The hole acts as a distinguished position, a focus. The figures illustrate this.
{|
|-
| [[Image:One-hole-context-Tree.png|center|frame|Removing a value of type &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from a &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Tree}\,X&lt;/math&gt; leaves a hole at that position.]]
| [[Image:One-hole-context-plug.png|center|frame|A more abstract illustration of plugging &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into a one-hole context.]]
|}

Of course, we are interested in the type to give to a one-hole context, i.e. how to represent it in Haskell. The problem is how to efficiently mark the focus. But as we will see, finding a representation for one-hole contexts by induction on the structure of the type we want to take the one-hole context of automatically leads to an efficient data type&lt;ref&gt;This phenomenon already shows up with generic tries.&lt;/ref&gt;. So, given a data structure &lt;math&gt;F\, X&lt;/math&gt; with a functor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and an argument type &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we want to calculate the type &lt;math&gt;\partial F\, X&lt;/math&gt; of one-hole contexts from the structure of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. As our choice of notation &lt;math&gt;\partial F&lt;/math&gt; already reveals, the rules for constructing one-hole contexts of sums, products and compositions are exactly Leibniz' rules for differentiation.
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=2 | One-hole context
! Illustration
|-
| &lt;math&gt;(\partial\mathit{Const_A})\,X&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;=\,0&lt;/math&gt;
| There is no &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A = \mathit{Const_A}\,X&lt;/math&gt;, so the type of its one-hole contexts must be empty.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;(\partial\mathit{Id})\,X&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;=\,1&lt;/math&gt;
| There is only one position for items &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X=\mathit{Id}\,X&lt;/math&gt;. Removing one &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; leaves no &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the result. And as there is only one position we can remove it from, there is exactly one one-hole context for &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Id}\,X&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the type of one-hole contexts is the singleton type.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\partial(F + G)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;=\partial F + \partial G&lt;/math&gt;
| As an element of type &lt;math&gt;F+G&lt;/math&gt; is either of type &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; or of type &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, a one-hole context is also either &lt;math&gt;\partial F&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\partial G&lt;/math&gt;.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\partial (F \times G)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;=F \times \partial G + \partial F \times G&lt;/math&gt;
| [[Image:One-hole-context-product.png]]&lt;br&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;=(\partial F \circ G) \times \partial G&lt;/math&gt;
| [[Image:One-hole-context-composition.png]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Chain rule'''. The hole in a composition arises by making a hole in the enclosing structure and fitting the enclosed structure in.
|}
Of course, the function &lt;code&gt;plug&lt;/code&gt; that fills a hole has the type &lt;math&gt;(\partial F\,X) \times X \to F\,X&lt;/math&gt;.

So far, the syntax &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; denotes the differentiation of functors, i.e. of a kind of type functions with one argument. But there is also a handy expression oriented notation '''&lt;math&gt;\partial_X&lt;/math&gt;''' slightly more suitable for calculation. The subscript indicates the variable with respect to which we want to differentiate. In general, we have
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(\partial F)\,X=\partial_X(F\,X)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
An example is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\partial(\mathit{Id}\times\mathit{Id})\,X=\partial_X(X\times X)=1\times X + X\times 1 \cong 2\times X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Of course, &lt;math&gt;\partial_X&lt;/math&gt; is just point-wise whereas &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; is point-free style.
{{Exercises|1=
# Rewrite some rules in point-wise style. For example, the left hand side of the product rule becomes &lt;math&gt;\partial_X(F\,X \times G\,X) = \dots &lt;/math&gt;.
# To get familiar with one-hole contexts, differentiate the product &lt;math&gt;X^n := X\times X\times \dots\times X&lt;/math&gt; of exactly &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; factors formally and convince yourself that the result is indeed the corresponding one-hole context.
# Of course, one-hole contexts are useless if we cannot plug values of type &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; back into them. Write the &lt;code&gt;plug&lt;/code&gt; functions corresponding to the five rules.
# Formulate the '''chain rule''' for '''two variables''' and prove that it yields one-hole contexts. You can do this by viewing a bifunctor &lt;math&gt;F\,X\,Y&lt;/math&gt; as an normal functor in the pair &lt;math&gt;(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, you may need a handy notation for partial derivatives of bifunctors in point-free style.
}}

=== Zippers via Differentiation ===

The above rules enable us to construct '''zipper'''s for recursive data types &lt;math&gt;\mu F := \mu X.\,F\,X&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial functor. A zipper is a focus on a particular subtree, i.e. substructure of type &lt;math&gt;\mu F&lt;/math&gt; inside a large tree of the same type. As in the previous chapter, it can be represented by the subtree we want to focus at and the thread, that is the context in which the subtree resides
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Zipper}_F = \mu F\times\mathit{Context}_F&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
Now, the context is a series of steps each of which chooses a particular subtree &lt;math&gt;\mu F&lt;/math&gt; among those in &lt;math&gt;F\,\mu F&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the unchosen subtrees are collected together by the one-hole context &lt;math&gt;\partial F\,(\mu F)&lt;/math&gt;. The hole of this context comes from removing the subtree we've chosen to enter. Putting things together, we have
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Context}_F = \mathit{List}\, (\partial F\,(\mu F))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
or equivalently
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Context}_F = 1 + \partial F\,(\mu F) \times \mathit{Context}_F&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

To illustrate how a concrete calculation proceeds, let's systematically construct the zipper for our labyrinth data type

 data Node a = DeadEnd a
             | Passage a (Node a)
             | Fork a (Node a) (Node a)

This recursive type is the fixed point
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Node}\,A = \mu X.\,\mathit{NodeF}_A\,X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
of the functor
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{NodeF}_A\,X = A + A\times X + A\times X\times X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
In other words, we have
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Node}\,A \cong \mathit{NodeF}_A\,(\mathit{Node}\,A) \cong A + A\times \mathit{Node}\,A + A\times \mathit{Node}\,A\times \mathit{Node}\,A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
The derivative reads
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\partial_X(\mathit{NodeF}_A\,X) \cong A + 2\times A\times X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and we get
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\partial \mathit{NodeF}_A\,(\mathit{Node}\,A) \cong A + 2\times A\times \mathit{Node}\,A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
Thus, the context reads
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Context}_\mathit{NodeF} \cong \mathit{List}\,(\partial \mathit{NodeF}_A\,(\mathit{Node}\,A)) \cong \mathit{List}\,(A + 2\times A\times (\mathit{Node}\,A))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
Comparing with

 data Branch a  = KeepStraightOn a
                | TurnLeft  a (Node a)
                | TurnRight a (Node a)
 type Thread a  = [Branch a]

we see that both are exactly the same as expected!

# Redo the zipper for a ternary tree, but with differentiation this time.
# Construct the zipper for a list.
# Rhetorical question concerning the previous exercise: what's the difference between a list and a stack?
}}

=== Differentation of Fixed Point ===
There is more to data types than sums and products, we also have a fixed point operator with no direct correspondence in calculus. Consequently, the table is missing a rule of differentiation, namely how to differentiate fixed points &lt;math&gt;\mu F\,X = \mu Y.\,F\,X\,Y&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\partial_X(\mu F\,X) = {?}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
As its formulation involves the chain rule in two variables, we delegate it to the exercises. Instead, we will calculate it for our concrete example type &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Node}\,A&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\partial_A(\mathit{Node}\,A) &amp;=&amp; \partial_A(A + A\times\mathit{Node}\,A + A\times \mathit{Node}\,A\times\mathit{Node}\,A)\\
&amp;\cong&amp; 1 + \mathit{Node}\,A + \mathit{Node}\,A\times\mathit{Node}\,A\\
&amp;&amp;+ \partial_A(\mathit{Node}\,A)\times(A + 2\times A\times\mathit{Node}\,A)
.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Of course, expanding &lt;math&gt;\partial_A(\mathit{Node}\,A)&lt;/math&gt; further is of no use, but we can see this as a fixed point equation and arrive at
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\partial_A(\mathit{Node}\,A) = \mu X.\,T\,A + S\,A \times X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with the abbreviations
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;T\,A = 1 + \mathit{Node}\,A + \mathit{Node}\,A\times\mathit{Node}\,A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S\,A = A + 2\times A\times\mathit{Node}\,A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
The recursive type is like a list with element types &lt;math&gt;S\,A&lt;/math&gt;, only that the empty list is replaced by a base case of type &lt;math&gt;T\,A&lt;/math&gt;. But given that the list is finite, we can replace the base case with &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and pull &lt;math&gt;T\,A&lt;/math&gt; out of the list:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\partial_A(\mathit{Node}\,A) \cong T\,A \times (\mu X.\,1+S\,A\times X) = T\,A\times\mathit{List}\,(S\,A)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
Comparing with the zipper we derived in the last paragraph, we see that the list type is our context
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{List}\,(S\,A) \cong \mathit{Context}_{\mathit{NodeF}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;A\times T\,A \cong \mathit{Node}\,A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
In the end, we have
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Zipper}_{\mathit{NodeF}} \cong \partial_A(\mathit{Node}\,A) \times A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
Thus, differentiating our concrete example &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Node}\,A&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; yields the zipper up to an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;!
{{Exercises|1=
# Use the chain rule in two variables to formulate a rule for the differentiation of a fixed point.
# Maybe you know that there are inductive (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) and coinductive fixed points (&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;). What's the rule for coinductive fixed points?
}}

=== Differentation with respect to functions of the argument ===
When finding the type of a one-hole context one does d f(x)/d x. It is entirely possible to solve expressions like d f(x)/d g(x).
For example, solving d x^4 / d x^2 gives 2x^2 , a two-hole context of a 4-tuple. The derivation is as follows
let u=x^2
d x^4 / d x^2 = d u^2 /d u = 2u = 2 x^2 .

=== Zippers vs Contexts===
In general however, zippers and one-hole contexts denote different things. The zipper is a focus on arbitrary subtrees whereas a one-hole context can only focus on the argument of a type constructor. Take for example the data type

  data Tree a = Leaf a | Bin (Tree a) (Tree a)

which is the fixed point
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Tree}\,A = \mu X.\,A+X\times X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
The zipper can focus on subtrees whose top is &lt;code&gt;Bin&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; but the hole of one-hole context of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Tree}\,A&lt;/math&gt; may only focus a &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt;s because this is where the items of type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; reside. The derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Node}\,A&lt;/math&gt; only turned out to be the zipper because every top of a subtree is always decorated with an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
{{Exercises|1=
# Surprisingly, &lt;math&gt;\partial_A(\mathit{Tree}\,A)\times A&lt;/math&gt; and the zipper for &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Tree}\,A&lt;/math&gt; again turn out to be the same type. Doing the calculation is not difficult but can you give a reason why this has to be the case?
# Prove that the zipper construction for &lt;math&gt;\mu F&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained by introducing an auxiliary variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, differentiating &lt;math&gt;\mu X.\, Y\times F\,X&lt;/math&gt; with respect to it and re-substituting &lt;math&gt;Y=1&lt;/math&gt;. Why does this work?
# Find a type &lt;math&gt;G\,A&lt;/math&gt; whose zipper is different from the one-hole context.
}}

===Conclusion===
We close this section by asking how it may happen that rules from calculus appear in a discrete setting. Currently, nobody knows. But at least, there is a discrete notion of '''linear''', namely in the sense of &quot;exactly once&quot;. The key feature of the function that plugs an item of type &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into the hole of a one-hole context is the fact that the item is used exactly once, i.e. linearly. We may think of the plugging map as having type
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\partial_X F\,X \to (X \multimap F\,X)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A \multimap B&lt;/math&gt; denotes a linear function, one that does not duplicate or ignore its argument, as in linear logic. In a sense, the one-hole context is a representation of the function space &lt;math&gt;X \multimap F\,X&lt;/math&gt;, which can be thought of being a linear approximation to &lt;math&gt;X\to F\,X&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Closed|1= General consensus seems to be &lt;span style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot;&gt; Delete&lt;/span&gt;. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:32, 2 January 2007 (UTC)}}

No idea what to make of this.  It has been around since 2004 and was apparently intended for VfD then but I cannot find it in any archive. It seems to me to be inappropriate for WB. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
* Sharp eyed [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] spotted that the VfD arc is actually on the talk page (keep an eye on him!). I wouldn't call it conclusive so lets see what happens this time --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
::'''Keep''' - Part of this book (OK only one part) is highly developed and apparently was a former book of the month.  It has potential if only someone would help save it. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 22:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
::: Actually, the [[Consciousness Studies]] is a seperate book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 18:53, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete'''. No meaningful content and is going nowhere (and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Unsolved_archive&amp;diff=21602&amp;oldid=21601 isn't supposed to] according to the original contributor]). The VfD discussion on the talk page seems to refer to [[w:Unsolved problems in biology]], not [[Unsolved archive]] or [[Unsolved problems in biology]] and all the comments on the talk page have timestamps predating the wikibook creation. It seems that the book was created as an archive for whatever reasons. This is, of course, unnecessary since everything is stored in the history. Furthermore it is a violation of the GFDL since it was copied without copying the history of past contributors. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 18:53, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. As per [[User:Swift]]. Good detective work, all! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:50, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
*Sorry to use your precious electrons. Feel free to delete the page. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 05:15, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
*Delete. As per User:Swift. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:36, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - This was a very, very early experiment on Wikibooks back well before anybody here had any idea what Wikibooks even could be, and in a sense I might want to keep it around to clearly demonstrate that Wikibooks wasn't exclusively for the development of textbooks, as some revisionist historians might try to claim.  I have seen this page before, and considered it a sort of quaint sideshow to Wikibooks.  Comments about dealing with the history tab and other features of MediaWiki software notwistanding, there were legitimate reasons to create this page all so many years ago.  Transwiki standards were non-existant and MediaWiki was quite primitive to use when this page was created, nor were naming standards established for Wikibooks and subpages weren't available.  All this said, however, I don't see the reason for maintaining this page.  The only possible alternative is to perhaps move the page to [[Unsolved problems in biology/Archive]], but that is only a suggestion.  This &quot;page&quot; isn't needed. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:56, 9 December 2006 (UTC)
*: Thanks for a very interesting comment. I would argue that if we want to leave some historical evidence, then an annal &amp;mdash; something like [[Wikibooks:History]] would be interesting &amp;mdash; could be better (or, at least, an important complement) since anyone looking for this type of content would have great difficulty finding it and understanding the background of it. The former could, however, be made easier by tagging it like [[Help:Textbook planning]] and categorizing.
*: As for your &quot;possible alternative&quot;, I think it would be a good compromise if anyone wants this kept. Actually, this is so good an idea that I'm considering changing my vote. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 22:37, 9 December 2006 (UTC)
*: Given these comments, I would strongly ask that the article be archived at [[Wikibooks:History]] as Swift suggested. I have found it really difficult coming back to Wikibooks after a year-long absence. I've been trying to keep up on current events, understand why past events happened the way they did, and it is tough. This could be very useful for me and for others who feel the insane need to understand everything they possibly can. *sigh* Thanks, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 17:56, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
* '''Very confused'''. Something ain't right here. The writing style is similar to [[Unsolved_problems_in_biology]], and that page links to that book as well. Perhaps there should be a whole VfD for the book, but a VfD for what seems to be a single page that didn't follow naming policy doesn't really seem... right. Basically, delete if this is a book. Keep if this is part of [[Unsolved problems in biology]] --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:10, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
*:As I tried to explain, this is similar because it is the &quot;archived version&quot; of a transwikied article from Wikipedia.  Your confusion is reasonable unless you understand the historical context that it comes from, which is why [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Unsolved_archive the links to this article] are so important to look at.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:07, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' per everybody. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:21, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of sigfpe's [http://sigfpe.blogspot.com/2006/12/evaluating-cellular-automata-is.html comonad articles] shows a simple zipper-like structure for lists.  I think that would be a good way to introduce the idea.  We don't have to take the comonad stuff, of course :-), but lists are simpler to think about than trees -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:19, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

== Solutions to exercises ==
I came up with this; it compiles and seems right, but it's unclear how one would check it's right. --[[User talk:Gwern |Gwern]] [[Special:Contributions/Gwern | (contribs)]] 03:50, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

 put :: a -&gt; Node a -&gt; Node a
 put n (DeadEnd _) = DeadEnd n
 put n (Passage _ a) = Passage n a
 put n (Fork _ a b) = Fork n a b

 get :: Node a -&gt; a
 get (Passage x _) = x
 get (DeadEnd x) = x
 get (Fork x _  _) = x

:Yes, that's the intended solution. What do you mean with &quot;how to check it's right?&quot; -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

::Exactly that. I mean, I took the type signatures, thought about it a little bit, fixed it until the compiled, but after that how do I know it ''really'' does what it is supposed to do? I have no data to really check it on. --[[User talk:Gwern |Gwern]] [[Special:Contributions/Gwern | (contribs)]] 01:54, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Why do you need to check something if you can prove that it's correct? :) I think the problem is that the specification of &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; has been rather vague. I changed it, is it better now? -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 12:19, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::::I think it looks better, though I'll go back and actually try it later. As for proofs, well, I'd need a proof that my proof is correct first. --[[User talk:Gwern |Gwern]] [[Special:Contributions/Gwern | (contribs)]] 03:50, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

== &lt;code&gt;retrieve&lt;/code&gt; ==
There's something wrong with this definition, I think. retrieve has the type &lt;code&gt;Thread -&gt; Node a -&gt; Node a&lt;/code&gt;, which is to say it returns &lt;code&gt;Node a&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;get n&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;Node a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is being returned where &lt;code&gt;Node a&lt;/code&gt; is expected.

:Oops, it's an error in the type signature. I corrected it to &lt;code&gt;Thread -&gt; Node a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;
:-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

== Regarding the Chain Rule ==
In the article &quot;We close this section by asking how it may happen that rules from calculus appear in a discrete setting. Currently, nobody knows.&quot; but doesn't sigfpe's blog give a reasonable answer with finite differences http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/09/finite-differences-of-types.html ? [[Special:Contributions/72.235.236.112|72.235.236.112]] ([[User talk:72.235.236.112|talk]]) 17:43, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

:Ah, sure, but his finite differences are even weirder. :-) What I mean is that it's not clear why these kind of rules have a meaningful interpretation; their interpretation in a calculus setting is very different, after all.
:-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 07:49, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

== Connection between Differentiation and Zipper ==

I have some problems with understanding.
When I make a hole in a data structure, then the root of the data structure is still the same (unless you made the hole where the root was).
However in the article it looks like additional to putting a hole into the datastructure, the hole is also made the root of the datastructure.
It seems, that the data type definition is the same, both for the &quot;hole in the middle&quot; and &quot;hole at the root&quot; interpretation.
Is this generally true?
How about a mutually recursive definition of a datatype? E.g. &lt;tt&gt;data A x = Node (B x) (B x); data B x = End | Cons (A x) (B x)&lt;/tt&gt;.
How about the second derivative of a datatype? The datastructure gets two holes, but they cannot be both at the root.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This project discusses the entire field of American Literature, meaning literature produced in the United States or written by authors whose primary residence or background is from the United States, starting with the earliest explorers and settlers and ending at the present time. A synthesis of chronological perspective and literary schools is attempted within this text.

== Welcome ==

This Wikibook is written with the beginning college student in mind.  The virtue of this format for presenting American Literature is that it is &quot;thinner&quot; than typical anthologies of the subject because it does not have to include entire original texts, but instead can link to them. Nor is this Wikibook obligated to provide synopses of major authors. Wikipedia already has these. This Wikibook, therefore, sets out to accomplish the third task of an American literature survey course textbook:  to paint the picture of the trends in the periods of literature, and discuss how authors relate to one another. 

For the earliest (before 1928) works of American literature, copyright issues are irrelevant. We provide the links to the works under discussion and urge the student to read enough of the work to obtain an appreciation for its intrinsic value. For later periods, copyright issues do still pertain, and the student will have to acquire copies of the works themselves, although I have quoted brief passages to illustrate the concepts discussed.

This book is still a work in progress.  If you would like to help with it, please look at the suggested guidelines on the Talk Page. Thanks.

==Can I help?==

First sign your contribotions with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
If you need photos/diagrams than must you use the images-tag (&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:xys.svg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

== [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table]] and the history section. ==

While I'm not against adding a history section here, what was added is in clear violation of copyright and can be found here instead:

http://www.wou.edu/las/physci/ch412/perhist.htm

That is clearly copyrighted material and needs to be removed completely from this article.  Any attempt to add it back will be deleted immediately because we simply can't have that on Wikibooks.  If you want to paraphrase it and do some scholarly research to elaborate on those ideas, but make it something original, you are welcome to do so.  

I do want to thank you, however, for trying to help improve Wikibooks.  These efforts are very much appreciated.  Just try to be a little more original next time.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:28, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Introduction ==

Black people know that things are happening to them that they can’t explain, and systems are compromising them in ways that they never imagined (until they get caught up in the system). Just like during “separate but equal,” Blacks always knew that equal was never equal, but separate was definitely separate. Today, there is no legal “separate” (but there is a separate), and equal is still not equal, but the real problem is that the black community, in the collective, haven’t figured out how to fight “colorblindness,” which is the new Jim Crow. Blacks are conflicted as to where the struggle is, and who is on the frontline, and they constantly ask each other, “What are you doing to help the struggle?” It’s hard to fight when most don’t know where the fights are, and which fronts to fight on. And those who are fighting, see “the frontline” based on where they are.

For those of us who maintain some constant involvement in the many, many conflicts that face Blacks in the 21st Century, individually and in the collective, what one fights for and who one is fighting for, seems to always be a point of contention for some people. While some understand the complexities of black struggle – that racism manifests itself on many levels and thus has to be fought on many levels – others see the “struggle” on the one level that they deal with, and think that fight is the only battle black people are facing. Thus, if you’re not in that particular fight, you’re not fighting at all.

==Life==

Langston Hughes was born February 1, 1902 in Joplin, Missouri.  After his parents divorced when he was young, Langston moved from place to place in the United States.  He became an avid writer while he was in school, writing for the school newspaper and yearbook as well as writing stories, poems, and plays.  During 1920 Hughes spent time with his father in Mexico.  To please his father he studied engineering at Columbia University, but he only stayed there a short time.  He became a crewman on a ship in 1923, and went ashore at Paris, living there for a few months with other black expatriates.  He returned to the United States and eventually graduated from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.  For most of his adult life he lived in Harlem, New York City.  Hughes died May 22, 1967 from complications arising from prostate cancer.

==Movement and Style==

Hughes was part of a movement called the Harlem Renaissance that included James Weldon Johnson, Wallace Thurman, Claude McKay, Countee Cullen, and Richard Wright.  This movement stressed pride in the black race and a desire to overcome racial discimination in the United States. It helped lay the foundation for the Civil Rights Movement.

He incorporated the rhythms of blues and jazz music in his poetry.  He also included elements of black folk culture and the music of the African American church.  The opening lines of &quot;The Weary Blues&quot; contain examples of these elements:

:''Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,'' 
:''Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,''
::''I heard a Negro play.''
:''Down on Lenox Avenue the other night''
:''By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light''
::''He did a lazy sway. . . .'' 
::''He did a lazy sway. . . .'' 
:''To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.''

In all his works Hughes celebrated his own blackness and demonstrated pride in his African American (and ultimately African) heritage.  In these lines from &quot;The Negro Speaks of Rivers&quot; Hughes looks wistfully back to the ancient past of the African people:

:''I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.'' 
:''I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.'' 
:''I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.''

Hughes attempted to record the positive qualities of African American people and hoped to inspire and encourage other African Americans to rise above the injustices and inequality then prevalent in the United States. In his book ''Montage of a Dream Deferred'' he wrote a series of poems linked by the idea that the dream of equality for African Americans had been deferred.  One of the poems, &quot;Democracy,&quot; presents this long-awaited aspiration in the opening lines:

:''Democracy will not come'' 
:''Today, this year'' 
::''Nor ever'' 
:''Through compromise and fear.''
:''I have as much right'' 
:''As the other fellow has'' 
::''To stand'' 
:''On my two feet'' 
:''And own the land.''

==Suggested Assignments==

#Read the poems &quot;I, Too, Sing America&quot; and &quot;Let America Be America Again.&quot;  Write a paragraph explaining the narrators' feelings about America during his own time and his dreams for America's future.
#Read &quot;The Weary Blues&quot; and &quot;Po' Boy Blues.&quot;  Write an essay detailing the relationship of each poem to actual blues music and it's presentation of the experience of African Americans.

The built-in capabilities of D (meaning the capabilities of the runtime library Phobos) for input from a ''console'' (alias ''terminal'' or DOS-Box) are very restricted.

Here is a simple program that demonstrates string input with &lt;tt&gt;din.readLine()&lt;/tt&gt; which reads a complete line of input. A line means all characters typed until the user pressed RETURN on keyboard. It doesn't mean a physical line in the console-window which is usually 80 characters wide.

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
import std.cstream; /* for din.readLine() */
import std.stdio;   /* for writef()/writefln() */

void main() 
{
   char[] name;

   writef(&quot;Hello friend. Please enter your name: &quot;);
   name = din.readLine();

   writefln(&quot;Thanks, %s&quot;, name);
}
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

== European History book ==

Hey there.  You offer a lot of useful insight, and I agree with you on a lot of points, but the issue for me has simply been time.  Being an undergraduate whose primary area of study is Business Administration leaves me with little time to keep up with and improve this book in the ways I'd like.  The outline of this book follows the AP European History cirriculum to a tee, and the information has largely been contributed to and assessed by a former teacher of mine who studied European History at both the undergraduate and graduate level at Notre Dame.

In an attempt to keep the book comprehensive, I'd ask that you not remove any of the existing sections (such as Rasputin, which, as you noted was relatively unimportant yet is very interesting and in that sense has its purpose).  Certainly, clarification and expansion would be excellent, and I'd be happy to help you as much as I can in doing so.

Thanks for your interest in the book, and I look forward to seeing your modifications to it.  If you don't mind, please keep me posted, and like I said earlier, I'll try to help out as much as I can.

:In terms of rush editing, moving or deleting — absolutely not, certainly. That’s why I am trying to discuss it beforehand.

:I do understand time constraints as well, quite busy myself. Wikipedia-wise I’ve just started big [[w:fortification]] and military engineering project on Russian Wikipedia, so it will take time to organise, plus I’m in the middle of big [[w:Cossack]] research. Once it gets cleared out, I’ll be able to come back here and start to do something.

:I also got a question about curriculum you’ve mentioned. Is it “AP” as in the “Associated Press” or some other? Is there link to take a look at it? [[User:TheUg|TheUg]] 02:07, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

::Sorry for eavesdropping. &quot;AP&quot; stands for &quot;advanced placement&quot;, and is a term used to describe classes in secondary school that are university-level. AP classes in secondary school can typically count towards university credits as well. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:::You can check out the standard cirriculum for the Advanced Placement European History at http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/eurohistory/ap-cd-eurohist-0607.pdf.  Remember, this book is primarily oriented toward people who have just begun delving into European History (i.e. those enrolled in an upper-level high school or introductory college European History course).  In that sense, it should be relatively simplistic and, perhaps most importantly, concise.  If you're looking to provide something more expansive or higher level, you might wish to create another Euro book for that purpose.


== help requested ==
I have recently finished to write a book on [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]] in Russian wikibook [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]]. I want to find somebody to translate it to English. Can you help me with this?
P.S. I am interesting to write some books on math and computer science. On math I am currently working on [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]] and on computer science on [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] and [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (all this is on currently on hold). In my English texts I have a lot of grammar mistakes, so I need somebody to correct one. I want that all that I am writing will be on English. It can be translating of written on another language text or original text. 

P.P.S. I have some material on math in Hebrew. Also hebrew wikibook has some material. It can be nice, while not mandatory, if you will know Hebrew too.

Я недавно закончил писать книгу в русском викиучебнике  [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]] . Я хотел бы найти кого-то ктобы перевёл бы его на английский [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]]. Не могли бы вы мне в этом помочь? 
P.S. Я хочу написать пару книг по математике и компьютерным наукам (программированию). По математике я начал работать над [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]], а по компьютерным наукам над  [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] и [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (пока я оставил это). Я пишу на английском со многими грамматическими ошибками, мне нужен кто-то, чтобы их исправлять. Я хочу, чтобы все мои книги были на английском. Это может быть как перевода с другого языка, так и оригинальный, изначально написанный на английском текст.
P.P.S. По математике, у меня часть материала на иврите, да и в ивритском викиучебнике можно взять. Было бы прекрасно, если бы вы владели также ивритом. Но вовсе не обязательно. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 16:02, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>rejected with ArbCom proposal</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{rejected}}

'''Arbitration''' is the last resort in solving dispute when all other methods have failed. Decisions are limited to individual cases and participants and do not set precedents. Parties to the dispute must agree to the help of arbitrators before the procedure may begin. Arbitrators' decisions are considered final and binding with no process for appeal.

== Arbitrators ==
The arbitrators should agree to run arbitration and be recognized by the parties involved in a dispute.  The number of arbitrators isn't important but should optimally be an uneven number (1,3,...) as to facilitate reaching a conclusion.

Arbitrators do not need to occupy any other function on Wikibooks but should be experienced Wikibookians with a good knowledge of the project's policies and guidelines. 

Wikibookians should remember that arbitration is a difficult job. Perfect solutions are rarely possible and in most cases none of the parties will be completely satisfied with the outcome.

== Process ==
Once arbiters have been selected and recognized by the parties, they must sketch out a process with a strict time-frame and clear rules. They hold sole power over managing discussions and may edit the arbitration pages at will for the benefit of the process.

A rough guideline for the process follows:
# '''Initiation:''' Arbiters set up a page outlining the arbitration; involved parties, disputed issues, agreements to arbitration and expected time frames for completion.
# '''Statements:''' Involved parties give their stance on disputed issues. Arbiters can ask direct questions for the purpose of clarification, offer the parties a chance to respond to accusations of wrongdoing, and modify the issues that are to be decided on in response to statements given.
# '''Decision:''' The arbiters will offer their findings and remedies.

The initiation of the process is voluntary, but parties must agree that the outcome is final. The process will be in conformance with the general decision process, where the parties give to the arbitrators the right to decide for them what the best outcome is.

The decision must respect the project's policies and guidelines and if need be administrative action may be required to enforce the final decision. 

== Past Arbitrations ==
*[[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny]] - The first attempt of an arbitration on Wikibooks, the process was usurped before it was completed. An alternative resolution to the problems described was found and agreed upon by those involved under a more general discussion within the Wikibooks community.

I have agreed to take on this situation as an arbitrator for the moment, as there have been some rather serious &quot;charges&quot; put up against [[User:Panic2k4]] that have resulted in his account being blocked on several occasions. As outlined at [[User talk:Panic2k4]], I've set up the following process to attempt to resolve this situation.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

The follwing four steps will be filled in by alternatively those who are pushing for arbitration, and then by the defendant, in this case [[User:Panic2k4]]:

#[[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Plaintiff Charges]]
#[[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Defendant Reply]]
#[[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Plaintiff Rebuttal]]
#[[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Defendant Rebuttal]]

These will each take place independently and once each step is completed, that page will be protected from editing and archived.  Any attempt to jump ahead will result in that content being deleted, as will any attempt at trying to edit/reply within these pages to turn them into a massive argument.  The whole point of doing this is to formalize the arbitration process and give people the opportunity to express their opinions without getting into the free-for-all typically found on most user talk pages.

This is really intended to be much more like a legal brief, and it should be considered something like that in terms of format and style.  There is no need for legal niceties or getting real technical, but make sure that very specific issues are presented both in the charges and rebuttal areas. After all this will be a final &quot;verdict&quot; on all of this:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Comments from [[User:SBJohnny]]==
I became involved in a user dispute a few months ago between Panic and Darklama, and responded to a &quot;request for comments&quot; on Panic's userpage. The dispute stemmed from Darklama's desire to make some changes and become involved with the C++ book. At the time, I was unsure what to think of either of them, in part because I know absolutely nothing about C++, and (using 20/20 hindsight) because Panic made it very difficult to understand the actual dispute by changing the topic to something else any time I thought I understood. 

After trying to talk to both of them, it quickly became apparent that Darklama was the party capable of keeping a cool head. I asked him to take a step back from the book and see what happens. He did so, and the events of the past few weeks have made me deeply regret giving that advice. At the time it was hard to see who was in the right or wrong, and Panic claims not to be a native English speaker, so I gave him undue benefit of the doubt

Things were quiet for a while, until another contributor tried to work on the C++ book. Panic made coments about every edit the new contributor made, and even went so far as to impose deadlines on completing his thoughts. He was warned by at least two users (not including me) about this behavior, but only became more shrill after these warnings. 

At one point he bacame frankly hostile, and I blocked him for 2 hours (I carefully chose to block him at a time of day he does not usually edit... this was an &quot;I mean it!&quot; block). My intended message was: &quot;this is unacceptable, and you've been warned about this&quot;. His response was to become even more hostile, and went right back to trying to intimidate his fellow contributors. I blocked him for 2 weeks in response, both to give him some time to think, but also to give the other contributors some breathing room to work on the book without harrassment. 

When he came back from his enforced break, Panic engaged in some rather odd dialog with me. It became apparent after a few days that he wasn't interested in a frank and/or objective discussion, but rather a cat-and-mouse contest of wikilawyering. When I had had enough, I told him so, in the hopes that he would turn his attention away from me and towards those he actually had the dispute with. 

A day or two later, he decided that my decision not to talk to him anymore meant that he could just go back to doing the same thing again. He announced his intention to do so, and then went about doing it. 

His choice of what to &quot;fix&quot; first was to move talk page conversations back to where they were. These pages had been moved around and reorganized over time by Panic, in what I can only interpret as an attempt to control (he might say &quot;organize and standardize&quot;) any editorial discussion about the book and its chapters. 2 users had spent a couple days trying to undo this mess... one was darklama, who went so far as to ask me if he could do &quot;page history merges&quot;. Again, I told him not to, because using admin tools in a content dispute you are a part of is absolutely taboo in my opinion. 

My second block of Panic was primarily pre-emptive (stopping the damage before it went too far), and partly punitive (it's hard to read this as anything but trolling, and he was specifically warned about this). He had been warned specifically about the talk page reorganizations, but had removed this warning a few days before [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Panic2k4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=701864]. He then announced [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Panic2k4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=707539] that he was going to reorganize the talk pages the way he liked them, and began doing so.

My impression of Panic is that he 
# Values debate over the creative process
# Has little respect for his peers on Wikibooks
# Is not interested in compromise
# Is convinced that he is in a &quot;battle&quot; with the community (am impression which I'm afraid particular format for &quot;arbitration&quot; will only serve to enforce)

Panic has asked me to &quot;close&quot; this statement, so please consider it closed. I hope we can keep this moving, rather than letting it stagnate.

==Comments from [[User:Darklama]]==

In disagreements with other people Panic has repeatedly [{{fullurl:Talk:C++ Programming/Functions|diff=677162&amp;oldid=673520}} misrepresented the community] through claims that the community agrees with him or that he represents the community's wishes. At times when he has gone out of his way to try to prove the community agrees with him by [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWhiteknight&amp;diff=606739&amp;oldid=606701 seeking out] the opinion of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASwift&amp;diff=606736&amp;oldid=606503 other people], he then refuses to accept their [[User_talk:Panic2k4#call_for_comment|opinions]] when its clear they disagree with him. When [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk%3ADecision_making%2FUnstable&amp;diff=701566&amp;oldid=701501 mediators or arbitrators] has than become necessary to resolve issues, if the decision is not as Panic wishes, he has than refused to accept the decisions. Fighting with other Wikibookians pretty much every step of the way and believes all his actions are in the right with [{{fullurl:User_talk:Panic2k4|diff=680748&amp;oldid=680743}} no intention] of [[Wikibooks:Decision_making#User_responses|conceding to the community's decision]].

Panic refuses to acknowledge or accept other people's point of view or decisions when it differs from his own point of view in various ways, including by misrepresenting passed administrative actions, pointing out lack of [[WB:PAG|policies and guidelines]], through attempts to prevent [[WB:FAITH|good faith]] edits by reverting and claims that discussion must take place first, using the GFDL and copyright laws as giving him certain rights, or by denying that mediation took place, as reasons to justify his continue obstructive actions and his right to be [[WB:CIVIL|uncivil]], [[Wikibooks:Wikipetiquette|disrespectful]] and to maintain editorial control of books above anyone else. One recent example involved Panic trying to force a [{{fullurl:Talk:C++ Programming/Functions|diff=677162&amp;oldid=673520}} deadline] on another Wikibookian under threats of reverting changes if he did not do as Panic wished.

As time has passed Panic has become increasingly hostile, accusing anyone who tries to take reasonable action that goes against Panic's wishes, of violating the GFDL, copyright laws, Wikiboooks policy or his rights. Attempts to clarify policies or guidelines has resulted in Panic trying to [{{fullurl:Wikibooks talk:Ownership|diff=706120&amp;oldid=706090}} subvert] changes he disagrees to with his own personal wishes even when it is clear that [[Wikibooks:Decision making|consensus]] is otherwise.

Panic has repeatedly bitten [[WB:BITE|new users]] and in the past established contributors before him, resulting in scaring people off and discouraging further attemps to contribute. I have repeatedly tried to give Panic the benefit of the doubt, but by his repeating the same or similar questionable actions time and time again, and with him making it clear he has no intent to change, leaves me with no doubt left that he is not here to work together with other Wikibookians in good faith as equals on books and I only wish to not be drawn further into his endless cycle of unproductive arguing and his way of doings things.

If I knew what I know now back when this all started, I believe I would of insisted on Panic taking his problems to an administrator or to the staff lounge, since his issues seem to be more of a problem with Wikibooks and how things are done rather then with a single individual. From the beginning with me, he has focused mostly on problems not specifically related to me, such as the forking of the book and his interpretations of what various policies and guidelines allow or don't allow. Which I think was one of the few mistakes I feel I've made in this whole situation.

Part of what Panic has used for his justifications has centered around an old book fork. Since Paddu was involved in the book at the time, I invited Paddu to provide any grievances he has with Panic concerning that rather then trying to rely on other people's interpretations. I also believe through Paddu's grievances with Panic, he can provide some insight into how long Panic has been problematic and a hindrance.

In short I believe Panic has:
* A long history of difficulty working together with other people and no desire to do so unless they agree with him and work on his terms.
* Little or no respect for other Wikibookians and their contributions (including additions, corrections and clean up)
* Through his actions demonstrated a desire to create conflict rather than direct his energy at improving books.
* Been counter productive and damaging to Wikibooks and its community and will continue to be so, as long as people are willing to let him.

Finally I don't believe Panic can be relied on to admit to what he has said or done, since in the past he has denied things and then later repeats it. Panic has not once that I am aware of bothered to try to clarify what he means or how what he does is not what he denies, which I can only assume from my own experience with him means he does not see a need to explain himself further or simply does not care that how people perceive him could get him into trouble. For example, he has denied mediation/moderation when he specifically chose SBJohnny to do so
[{{fullurl:Talk:C++ Programming/TOC2/Print Version|diff=621172&amp;oldid=621169}}] and than involved himself in a small [{{fullurl:C++ Programming/TOC2/Print Version|action=history}} revert war] with SBJohnny after having agreed to his mediation/moderation. Panic was [{{fullurl:User_talk:Panic2k4|diff=621712&amp;oldid=621696}} warned] back then as well. SBJohnny has tried to moderate since then until recently when he willingly offered to let someone else do it.

I do not believe SBJohnny was taking sides, but rather was acting on Panic's own actions and I believe his blocking Panic was considerably relaxed given the situation and SBJohnny would have had every right to block Panic indefinite if he had chosen to do so. I believe SBJohnny may have in fact tried way too hard to not let it come to needing to block Panic indefinitely. I believe unfortunately Panic will need to be blocked indefinitely, because of his [{{fullurl:User_talk:Panic2k4|diff=680748&amp;oldid=680743}} stated intentions] and he continues to be controlling, disruptive and uncivil. I believe while blocking Panic may be a first here, it would set the bar for what's required to be blocked very high.

I am satisfied with my provided information for now and will hold off any further information and log information if it is needed for clarification or &quot;evidence&quot; until later on in the process. I close my comments so this process may continue and only ask that anyone else who has something to say be given time to finish first as well.

== Comments from [[User:Whiteknight]] ==

I've been involved with this issue since the original &quot;request for comments&quot; that SBJohnny described above. At the time, newcomer Darklama was involved in a series of edit conflicts with Panic2k4, a seasoned veteran of the project. Unfortunately for the current proceedings, much discussion between darklama, SBJohnny and myself from that time until the present has occured on IRC, and there are therefore no records of those discussions. I would like to state for the record (though it be unverifiable) that the topic of Panic2k4 being blocked for his behavior was discussed between the three of us and others in the chat room for some time before the blocks were implemented by SBJohnny.  

After the initial block by SBJohnny (described above), and Panic2k4's subsequent return, I had received a number of complaints, from Darklama and from [[User:James Dennett]] (actually, I received complaints about panic's treatment of James Dennett from another user, not from James Dennett himself). [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=677150&amp;oldid=677023 I sent him this initial reminder], to which he sent me [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWhiteknight&amp;diff=677942&amp;oldid=676682 this initial reply] (minus the unrelated comment from User:Herbythyme, in between) and later I sent [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Panic2k4&amp;oldid this warning/reminder] and received [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWhiteknight&amp;diff=680700&amp;oldid=680688 this final reply]. I did not continue this discussion any further after that.

It is worth noting that at this time, Darklama was promoted into an admin and chose not to take any action himself, instead petitioning SBJohnny and myself to interceed into the matter. I declined initially to take action against Panic2k4, and I strongly urged SBJohnny to abstain from action as well. It was my thought at this time that the situation could be properly moderated and dealt with amicably. However, Panic's actions and responses to SBJohnny after this discussion displayed that the situation would not be solved peacefully. It was after my warning and SBJohnny's warning that Panic was blocked the second time.

Unfortunately, I've been relatively inactive since the middle of december, and cannot comment on the actions that occured after that. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:55, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Comments from [[User:James Dennett]] ==

I've been reluctant to post here; this arbitration process, necessary though it may appear to be, has been set up to be explicitly adversarial, and I fear that may not be likely to lead to a resolution that is satisfactory to all.

However, I would not wish the written records of events to be misinterpreted, and so feel that I must add my own comments here.  I have tried, in my own way, to accept some behavior from Panic that I would deem unacceptable in many other contexts, as his redeeming virtues from a Wikibooks perspective are his energy and has willingness to invest effort in writing and editing material.  However, it must be said that I have found Panic's particular contributions to the C++ book writing community to have negative value; while not being an expert, he is not open to corrections unless they are done almost exactly as he wishes.  For example, he threatened to reverts edits of mine correcting a particular error (equating pointers and arrays in C++, if that matters) because I had not corrected '''every''' instance of the problem, leaving some inconsistency; he explicitly stated that inconsistency (with notes on the work in progress) was worse than being consistently wrong.  My view of the wiki/cooperative approach is that a 90% complete fix is a valuable contribution, more so for the existence of others who can finish some of the &quot;busy work&quot;.

One issue to be very aware of in the context of considering Panic's relationship with the community is that, possibly unintentionally, Panic's characterizations of situations (in particular, disputes) can be very misleading.  Descriptions he wrote to users including SBJohnny of his interactions with me included statements about my views which were very inaccurate; I have been wary of correcting them, concerned at escalating a situation.  (By now I see that while escalation may well have been the result, that would be as a result of Panic's difficulties in constructive and '''cooperative''' conflict resolution.)

As will be clear from the above, I am not a neutral party here.  I was neutral, but circumstances have made it impossible for me not to have opinions on the conduct of those involved in this debate.  SBJohnny's actions have seemed intelligent and thoughtful throughout, and I would feel that it would reflect badly on the Wikibooks community if that counted for nothing.  -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 08:07, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Comments from [[User:Paddu]] ==

''Note: this was moved from the [{{fullurl:Wikibooks talk:Arbitration/Panic2k4_vs._SBJohnny/Plaintiff_Charges|action=history}} talk page] as was suggested by Rob Horning, with some comments from Panic removed.''

''Paddu also started providing some addition comments on Panic [[User:Paddu/comments_on_Panic2k4|here]] to avoid complications.''

I was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APaddu&amp;diff=98742075&amp;oldid=97977439 invited] to post at [[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Plaintiff Charges]] by [[User:Darklama]]. I'm posting my comments here since I've been inactive in Wikibooks (barring a few responses to comments on my [[w:User talk:Paddu|Wikipedia talk page]]) for quite some time and will remain so indefinitely.

[[#Comments from User:SBJohnny]]: I agree with the final summary of SBJohny except that I'd say that Panic probably values creative process over debates as long as each person's creativity is in an independent page, i.e. he only seems to value unwiki creative processes. He didn't like to debate with me and instead forked the C++ book so that he can have his say in one book and I can have mine in another -- quite violative of wiki principles. Since at that time there weren't enough administrators interested in avoiding the fork, I chose to stay away and encouraged others to contribute to Panic's fork only, since contributing to both the books would make a later merge more difficult. I also would like to add that right from his early days here Panic probably didn't understand how talk pages work and kept rearranging the talk pages of the C++ book, causing a concern that my comments/ideas were being made less prominent for others to discuss/build on.

[[#Comments from User:Darklama]]: I feel that even during Panic's initial days he probably misrepresented my opinion (at that time there wasn't much of a community for the C++ book apart from Panic and me) by rearranging the C++ book talk page. I think he might have been incivil to me but I can't say for sure as I don't remember much -- one should probably look at my (not that big) contribution history for such instances. [And of course one could say he has bitten and scared me off, though I wasn't a new user. :-(]

[[#Comments from User:Whiteknight]]: I think there would have been more people worthy of being called &quot;seasoned veterans&quot; had Panic had a more tolerant approach towards other contributors. If he has continued to monopolise the book, reverting contribution of C++ experts like James Dennett, as people seem to suggest, I feel he isn't worthy of the respect one would get on being a veteran contributor to a book.

Some of my own personal grievances against Panic include his pasting material from other books (whether GFDL'd or not), his forking the book instead of discussing to resolve issues, and his forking and rearranging talk pages. My issues with Panic are documented throughout most of my contributions to talk pages in the Wikibooks. Interested people could dig through [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/contribution_tree?user=Paddu&amp;dbname=enwikibooks_p my contribution tree] and get some evidence on what transpired between Panic and me. I'll try to post a few links of interest to this arbitration case soon. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 09:30, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

Here is the link to Panic's edits that reordered all the discussions in what used to be called [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]]—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming%2FArchives%2FArchive1&amp;diff=64712&amp;oldid=63941]. Note that the original discussion has been commented out (using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;-- and --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Here he started calling my proposals &quot;dead&quot; though with the kind of traffic Wikibooks was getting then, one should have waited at least 6 months to see if someone opposes/improves on my proposals and his rearrangements made sure not many would get the opportunity to comment on my proposal, but that is just a minor issue.
:The major issue here is that he commented out the original comments and added his own interpretations of what others said. In the English Wikipedia, these kinds of edits are a strict no-no — one should never remove/comment out others' comments, and never replace them with one's own interpretations of what was said; these reinterpretations will likely be inaccurate.
:I removed the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;-- --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, put his reinterpretations at the end and made clear the problems with the reinterpretations in this edit—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=64728&amp;oldid=64712] but he reverted and stuck to his stance that the proposals were dead, etc. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 14:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

He made edits like [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=65013&amp;oldid=65012] to the talk page which seem to distinguish between &quot;active contributors&quot; and others—very unwiki.
In [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=66052&amp;oldid=65486] he seemed to say that he was just requesting &quot;major&quot; contributors to comment and was not enforcing protections/etc., but from what others say, it looks like he might have prevented many from becoming &quot;major&quot; contributors in his view by reverting/scaring them off, and probably did revert even major contributors—at least I think he has reverted me while I was still a major contributor.
He insisted in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=65046&amp;oldid=65037] that I had not implemented highlighting, whereas all the C++ pages (and the one C page) that I started ([http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/contribution_tree?namespace=0&amp;user=Paddu&amp;dbname=enwikibooks_p] looks like a few pages have been deleted) used my proposed highlighting right from the beginning — he probably was so adamantly tied to the one-big-wikipage idea that he probably refused to consider the pages I started as part of the book.
[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=65453&amp;oldid=65171] and the next 2 edits show how his rearrangement of the talk page was counterintuitive even to someone who was an administrator at that time and had been at Wikipedia for at least a year prior to that [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;offset=20030706005350&amp;limit=50&amp;target=Dysprosia].
Panic says in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=65481&amp;oldid=65478]: &quot;I'm taking the road set by P3 &quot;move chapters to modules as they were finished&quot; (they aren't)&quot; which I hadn't understood until I was looking at it and thinking about it today. I had mentioned in the talk page earlier that I'd move content from [[Programming:C plus plus]] to things like [[Programming:C plus plus Hello World]], [[Programming:C plus plus &lt;some other thing&gt;]], etc. once the latter modules are complete. Panic had reinterpreted my comment and was talking as though I wanted sections to be finished within [[Programming:C plus plus]] and then move them to [[Programming:C plus plus &lt;something&gt;]], etc. I wonder why would anyone propose such a thing — edit a large wikipage with great difficulty and make them larger and when everything is finished split it into smaller pages. Had he not rearranged the talk page I might have clarified what I meant.
::In that edit he said &quot;...if the solution [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] indicated will work (transclusion), still waiting for him to give me a working example but&quot; but before that I had already showed him how transclusion works in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?oldid=prev&amp;diff=62418&amp;title=User_talk%3APanic2k4].
::[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=66171&amp;oldid=66170] seems to say he'd rearrange the page the way he wants and everyone who has commented has to verify if his version is a correct representation of what was said. Ha, ha, ha. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 19:18, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

A note that I forgot to add earlier: Since I stopped working at the C++ programming book a lot of page moves/deletes have happened so some of the pages referred to in the discussions that can be found from my contribution tree (including the ones I linked above) might be found at some other location or might have got deleted (so only administrators may view). -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 21:08, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:

* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

'''Broth''' is a liquid in which [[cookbook:meat|meat]], [[cookbook:seafood|seafood]], [[cookbook:Cereal Grain|cereal grains]], or [[cookbook:vegetable|vegetable]]s have been [[cookbook:simmering|simmered]] and strained out. Broth is used as a basis for [[cookbook:soup|soup]]s, [[cookbook:gravy|gravies]], [[cookbook:sauce|sauce]]s, and as a flavor base in many other dishes. Additionally, it can be eaten alone or with a [[cookbook:garnish|garnish]].  Broth that has been slowly simmered until it is clarified and substantially reduced (at least by 50%) is known as [[Cookbook:Consommé|consommé]], which has a substantially more intense flavor due to the reduction. Broths can be further concentrated into pastes or powders and sold commercially, the latter being bullion and often sold as bullion cubes. Their shelf life without preservatives is limited. Commercial preparations also often have large amounts of salt and or [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]] added. Bullion cubes in particular have more salt than flavor and will alter the final recipe in many cases if substituted for broth. When it is necessary to clarify a broth (i.e. for a cleaner presentation), [[cookbook:Egg White|egg white]]s may be added during simmering&amp;mdash;the egg whites will coagulate, trapping sediment and turbidity into a readily strainable mass.

Broth differs from soup [[cookbook:stock|stock]], in that stock requires [[cookbook:bone|bone]]s and water; whilst broth requires the meat instead of bones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parshift.com/ovens/Secrets/secrets025.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Broth is not cooked as long as soup stock and has a milder taste. Broth also contains less gelée, or [[cookbook:Gelatine|gelatin]] because bones are not used; however it is common for the terms to be used interchangeably.

In [[cookbook:East Asian cuisines|East Asia]] (particularly [[cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japan]]), a form of [[cookbook:kelp|kelp]] called [[cookbook:kombu|kombu]] is often used as the basis for broths called ''[[cookbook:dashi|dashi]]''.

      <comment>/* Comments from [[User:Paddu]] */ I am not a party in the arbitration and I don't want to be</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I post this comment on the discussion page because I do not, at this point in time, want to get involved in the arbitration process. I would like to suggest, however, that the charges by different plaintiffs be put in their own section. I see that all charges [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4_vs._SBJohnny/Plaintiff_Charges&amp;oldid=708577 as of this version] are by [[User:Darklama]]. Thus they would all go under the heading &amp;#61;&amp;#61; Darklama &amp;#61;&amp;#61; Or something like that. That way, the charges are just not &quot;Everyman v. Panic,&quot; but &quot;An Individual v. Panic&quot; &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 00:19, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

Past discussions involving Panic, relating to his forking of the C++ book can be found at [[User_talk:Mshonle/Fork issue]] and [[User_talk:Mshonle/Fork issue 2]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:00, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:Any factual information (such as links to discussions listed above) would be appreciated in this situation.  There is going to be a huge amount of reading material on this topic, as it involves some Wikibookians who have many edits and a long history of interaction.  Obviously this is far more complex than a typical Willy on Wheels vandal situation, as would normally be justification for a user block.

:In defense of why I set this up in this manner, it is already being an advisarial situation, so I'm just pushing that point out into the open.  I'm also trying to &quot;give his day in the court&quot;, so to say, with Panic, where nobody is being bullied over what they are saying.  Also very important, this is deliberately set up to level the normally unequal situation between user and administrator, which has been accused often on community fora like the VfD page.

:Not everybody is going to be happy here, but it will make a resolution of the issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:08, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Comments from [[User:Paddu]] ==

''Note: I moved Paddu's comments to the &quot;project&quot; side of this page as Robert seems to be suggesting. I have left Panic's comments intact to do with as Robert feels is approperiate. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:10, 9 January 2007 (UTC)''

I request that Paddu should move his comments to the project page if he thinks that we have still any unresolved dispute so that it can be addressed later, as it is, I consider all past action on my divergences with Paddu resolved after the said &quot;fork&quot;, if not this lines above marked as comment should be considered as &quot;his analysis of the problem&quot; and as interferences and removed ASAP, as they don't deal with recent events, or events that have a bearing on the discussion at hand. I don't want any information to be destroyed but this is not the place for it, not in such elaborated way (user is free to move it to his talk space, other users talk space but shouldn't be annexed to the actual proceedings).

If not I will exert my right to reply to it here also and probably make things even messier. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:52, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

: I change my request for this information to be removed, and ask that this page to be blocked from future edits but not removed, and that in the future all similar pages of the actual arbitration have all their talk pages blocked as to have users cross commenting the actual arbitration is nor useful, all users that want to participate should do that NOW, before the Arbitration gets to the next step. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:44, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

------

Please, &lt;big&gt;Please,&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Please,&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; stop trying to fight on this page.  I set up a formal debate format for this to be argued, and it is precisely these sorts of nested arguements that I was trying to avoid.  This is part of what led to this whole fight in the first place.  I have to partially agree with Panic at this point that this discussion has turned into an accusitory position, rather than talking about the format of this page or dealing with items like if this page needs to be closed or not.  If you want to say your piece about this, add a section on the &quot;project&quot; side of this page.  You don't need to expand this fight elsewhere.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:I am not a party in the arbitration and I don't want to be -- you can check that I never edited the project page. I saw that you had said above that some links would be useful so I added some, although I did add my own comments on the links as I thought that might be helpful in understanding those links from a 2 years ago period. I don't want to say anything in the project page. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 08:36, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The use of a '''stacked deck''' makes many things possible for the performing magician.  Essentially, a stacked deck, as the name implies, is simply a deck with the cards set up in a predetermined order.  A well-known stacked deck is known as the '''Eight Kings Chased''' stack.

Another common stack is called the '''Si Stebbins''' stack (or &quot;stacking system&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic Key fittings==
Once you have assembled you new clarinet, you need to learn to place your hands in the correct places on the keys and holes in the instrument. As a start, put your right hand thumb under the piece of metal that sticks out of the lower clarinet section. This allows you to hold your clarinet when you are playing the instrument. With the clarinet resting on your right hand thumb, place your left hand thumb on the hole in the back of the instrument. Then take your left hand's first three fingers, and place them firmly on the holes of your clarinet's upper section. Afterwards, take your right hand and place your first three fingers over the three holes on the lower clarinet section. Make sure you have all your fingers firmly in place. If you blow in to your instrument with the correct embouchure (mouth positioning), it will produce the lower G note.

==The notes==
If you take all your fingers off of your clarinet, your instrument will produce a middle octave G. Practice tonguing this note several times before you are ready to move on to the next note.

==Suggestions for learning notes==
If you are learning to play the clarinet, I would consider in purchasing a fingering chart for the references of the notes on the clarinet. Some notes may not speak because your mouth and your lungs are not yet fully developed. Stick to the middle C, D E,  F, G, A, and B if you are just beginning. The G note requires no fingers to play. Practice that note until it sounds reasonable to move to the next. Reading music is also an extremely useful skill, as it widens enormously the range of music you will be able to attempt, as well as allowing the novice clarinetist to use the many printed clarinet tutorial materials available, all of which require the ability to read music. Since the clarinet is most commonly a Bb instrument, the note that is written as 'C' actually sounds as 'Bb'; in the same way, all notes for the clarinet are written a whole tone sharper than they actually sound. This is for convenience in writing, and should not present any problems in practice for the novice clarinetist. However, it is important to be aware that when reading music written for 'C' instruments (where 'C' sounds as 'C'), it will be necessary to transpose.

[[Category:Clarinet]]
Also remember to tongue every long note. Keep a good embouchure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Crossing the break is a major step in a clarinetist's journey into accomplishing their instrument. The &quot;break&quot; is the end of the first register (called the '''chalumeau''' register) and the second register (called the '''clarion''' register). The first necessary thing a clarinetist must do is to know the notes that straddle the break.

*The first note we will learn is the middle A. For this note, leave all keys unpressed except for the key right above where your left index finger should be. Pressing this key alone should produce an A.

*For the next note, B-flat, finger the &quot;A&quot; but press at the same time the long key right above your left thumb. This key is called the '''register key'''. This key, pressed in conjunction with the &quot;A&quot; key, should produce a &quot;B-flat.&quot; This is the end of the chalumeau register, and the last note before the break. 

*The next note, &quot;B&quot; is produced by fingering a low &quot;E&quot; and pressing the '''register key''' also. To review a low E, there are two ways to produce this note. Finger all holes and either the bottom right fork key, or the left pinky key.

*To produce the next note, clarion C, finger a low F in conjunction with the register key. To review a low F, there are two ways: cover all holes plus either the top right fork key, or the center pinky key.

Players need to remember that when playing in the clarion register, they should keep their embouchure as free and open as the lower register. Don't &quot;clamp down&quot; when you get to the next register, because your tone will suffer, and it is easy to squeak this way. A good exercize to demonstrate this is to play a low F. Have someone come while you are playing the F and hold down the register key (so that the instrument goes up to a clarion C). If you feel yourself &quot;clenching down&quot; on your embouchure, you are playing incorrectly. You should feel no difference in your embouchure between the low F and the C. 

Next, practice going between the notes that require only keys being pressed (such as B flat or A) and that of the basic notes ( such as C, D, E, F, and G.) After practicing this technique for at least five minutes, now try going from the middle and basic G (no fingers) to the upper C (requires both hands) If you do not yet know how to play an upper C, concoct a fingering chart. In process of going from G to C, you simply put all your fingers down for the C, and lifting them up for the G. After you have mastered this, try moving on to another note, such as middle C, to upper C. After you accomplished C to C, move on to other notes that you think will challenge you. After you sit down and practice these transitions, it should seem seamless to you.

== '''Introduction''' ==

Robert Lee Frost is the only poet to receive four Pulitzer Prizes for his work.  He also received many honorary doctoral degrees, although he never actually earned a bachelor’s degree.  An avid teacher and a gifted writer, he is one of America’s most admired poets of the Twentieth Century.  He wrote in traditional poetic forms but with a twist--capturing the rhythms and vocabulary of ordinary speech. He was a great man and was very loyal too.

==''' Life''' ==

Frost was born March 26, 1874 in San Francisco, California.  When his father died during his childhood, he moved with his mother and sister to Massachusetts.  He attended Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, in 1892 but dropped out after a short time, working as a teacher and a factory worker.

Frost sold his poem “My Butterfly: An Elegy” to ''The Independent'' of New York in 1894.  The next year he married Elinor Miriam White, his high school friend.  The two of them taught school until 1897 when Frost entered Harvard University.  He studied there two years and then moved to a farm in New Hampshire that his grandfather bought for him.  He went back to teaching to support the family.

In 1912 Frost and his family moved to England, where he met Ezra Pound, who was one of the first people to review Frost’s work,  and other notable poets.  He published a book of poetry entitled A Boy’s Will in 1913.  He moved back to New Hampshire in 1915 and spent the remainder of his career as a professor in colleges in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Vermont, including the prestigious Amherst College.  During his years as a professor he continued to write poetry and plays.

Frost died January 29, 1963 in Boston, Massachusetts.

== Style ==

Frost’s work is noted for its conversational style and tone.  In fact several of his poems are written as dialogues.  In “The Death of the Hired Man,” for instance, a husband and wife are discussing a farm laborer who has returned, despite the husband’s begrudging attitude.  In this excerpt The wife, Mary, reveals that the hired man considers their place his home:

:''“Warren,” she said, “he has come home to die:''
:''You needn’t be afraid he’ll leave you this time.”''

:''“Home,” he mocked gently.''

:''“Yes, what else but home?''
:''It all depends on what you mean by home.''
:''Of course he’s nothing to us, any more''
:''Than was the hound that came a stranger to us''
:''Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.”''

:''“Home is the place where, when you have to go there,''
:''They have to take you in.”''

:''“I should have called it''
:''Something you somehow haven’t to deserve.”''

Although he generally used traditional meters and rhyme schemes--unlike many of his contemporaries, who used modernist techniques--Frost attempted to employ smoothly flowing language such as one might employ in everyday life, as he does in the last stanza of his well-known poem “The Road Not Taken”:

:''I shall be telling this with a sigh''
:''Somewhere ages and ages hence:'' 
:''Two roads diverged in a wood, and I'' 
:''I took the one less traveled by,'' 
:''And that has made all the difference.''
 
He avoided the stereotypical poetic language with its archaic and overly formal words, and used colloquial words and phrases, self-conscious narration, and the tone of a rural philosopher.  For example, in “The Pasture” Frost’s narrator address the reader with an invitation, as noted in the first stanza:

:''I'm going out to clean the pasture spring; 
:''I'll only stop to rake the leaves away 
:''(And wait to watch the water clear, I may): 
:''I sha'n't be gone long. You come too. 

Frost also balanced seriousness and humor, believing that humor was a perfect vehicle for conveying serious ideas.  That humor can take a dark and subtle form, as in his poem about the end of the world, entitled “Fire and Ice,” in which Frost employs etreme understatement:

:''Some say the world will end in fire;'' 
:''Some say in ice.'' 
:''From what I've tasted of desire'' 
:''I hold with those who favor fire.'' 
:''But if it had to perish twice,'' 
:''I think I know enough of hate'' 
:''To know that for destruction ice'' 
:''Is also great'' 
:''And would suffice.''

The real theme of the poem, of course, is that both passion and hatred are destructive forces in the world, and the almost trivial tone of the narrator drives the idea home more strongly than a straightforward telling would do.

Frost’s works are generally set in rural places and contain details of the natural surroundings.  Elements of rural life, such as rock walls (fences), birch trees, horses, and cows are prominent in his poetry and are often used metaphorically or symbollically.  These lines from “After Apple-picking” are typical of his rural settings and props that he employed:

:''My long two-pointed ladder’s sticking through a tree''
:''Toward heaven still,''
:''And there’s a barrel that I didn’t fill''
:''Beside it, and there may be two or three''
:''Apples I didn’t pick upon some bough''
:''But I am done with apple-picking now.''

The poem is about the way that a day of hard work sticks with us so much that even our unconscious mind replays it in our dreams.

A '''pasty''' (Cornish: ''pasti'', ''hoggan'', incorrectly written as ''pastie'') is a type of pie, originally from Cornwall, in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. It is a [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] savory pastry case traditionally filled with sliced meat and vegetables. The ingredients are uncooked before being placed in the unbaked pastry case. Pasties with traditional ingredients are specifically named '''&quot;Cornish pasties&quot;'''. Traditionally, pasties have a semicircular shape, achieved by folding a circular pastry sheet over the filling. The circular edge is then crimped to form a seal.

==Ingredients==

* 1 medium  [[Cookbook:Swede|swede]] ([[Cookbook:Rutabaga|rutabaga]], yellow turnip) (or similar root vegetable), peeled, cut into chunks and then thinly sliced.
* 4 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], prepared same as the swede
* 4 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], halved and thinly sliced.
* 2 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] round (beef skirt), sliced across the grain into roughly 1cm x 2cm strips .
* [[Cookbook:Pastry for Cornish Pasties|Pastry for Cornish Pasties]]
* 1 T plain flour (optional)
* 1 T milk (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|400°F 200°C Gas Mark 6]].
# [[Cookbook:Slicing|Slice]] the [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]]. 
# Lightly dust the prepared meat in seasoned flour (optional - makes a thicker gravy of the enclosed juices).
# Divide the pastry into 4 equal portions. Roll each into circles.
# Layer meat and vegetables on one half of each pastry circle to within 1&quot; of the edge. Season generously.
# Brush milk onto the edge of the pastry circles (optional).
# Bring the other half of the dough over the top of the mixture.
# Pinch and twist to seal the dough around the edges. 
# Make a couple of small slashes in the top of the pastry to allow steam to escape. 
# Brush pasties with the remaining milk (optional).
# Use pastry trimmings to make the intended eater's initial(s) on one end of the pasty. This is the Cornish housewife's traditional way of making and identifying individual pasties to suit each family member eg. less seasoning for young children or more meat for a hard-working son or anaemic daughter. Also, it enabled tin-miners and fishermen to identify their pasties if they had had to put them down somewhere half-eaten to attend to some urgent work.
# Place the pasties on a lightly-greased baking tray (or a double thickness of aluminium foil directly onto the oven shelf).
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] for approx. 45mins on the middle shelf.
# Best taken with a pint of bitter or stout or a large mug of strong tea.

==Rewarming==

* Place on a cookie sheet in the oven and make a tent with foil over them so only the inside is heated, and not the pie crust.
* By a campfire, just lay on a hot rock or on a plate tilted towards the fire; before long they are warm and ready to eat.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Vegetables - try sweet-corn or different types of beans.
* Use a pie crust that doesn't crumble too easily or the whole thing falls apart.



*These fillings are from the recipe book;  'Cornish Recipes, Ancient &amp; Modern',  referenced in the notes.

*Apple.
Peel and thinly slice, sprinkle with soft brown sugar.

*Broccoli.
Parboil, strain, fill well, and sprinkle a pinch of salt over. A little Cheddar cheese is good in this, instead of salt.

*Chicken.
Mix diced breast and leg meat, and continue as above,

*Date.
Chop some stoned dates, and fill well.

*Eggy.
Diced green or smoked bacon, (back is best) fresh parsley and 1 or 2 eggs, according to size of pasty. Top-crimp from each end, &amp; funnel beaten egg in before closing.

*Pork.
Pork, potato's, onion, pinch salt and fresh sage or thyme.

*Sorrel.
Scald sorrel leaves, fill pasty, serve with sugar and cream.

*Jam.
Any kind of jam can be used. Make smaller than normal, otherwise a lot of jam is needed!

*Mackerel.
Allow 1 or 2 for each pasty, clean and boil as normal. Skin and bone them, lay on pasty, fill with fresh parsley, lightly season and close.
Herring are good as well.

*Windy.
A method of using the pastry remnants. Just make an empty pasty, but omit the steam slit, split open while still hot and fill with jam, cheese and chutney, or whatever takes your fancy!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Minix2 is supposed to have a 'simple' memory manager, because 
a) it is intended for a single user, and b) it is supposed to run on an 8088, which
does not support virtual memory. 
The memory manager has a posix memory interface - i.e. it is used
when the functions fork() or exec() is called. 

Here is some discussion about some terms bandied about memory managers.

1. First fit algorithm 
a memory manager allocates memory so the most basic parameter would be the requested size.
The mm can search a list of non-allocated memory blocks , until it finds a contiguous
block of unallocated memory that is larger than the requested size, split it into a block
for use of the requested size, and a smaller unused block which is the rest of the block.
Then the requested size block is returned for usage.

The algorithm &quot;best fit&quot;, searches a list of unused blocks , until the nearest larger or
equal sized block is found, and returned , but the problem with this algorithm is that 
the unused part of the block that is returned to the free list tends to be small and
useless. 

One important aspect of any free memory allocation algorithm, is that once the
used block is returned, it must be compared with adjacent blocks to see if they are
also unused, and merged with the block before and /or after to keep the free block
sizes as large as possible. If this is not done, free block sizes quickly become too
small to use for some requests.

This requirement makes the &quot;quick fit&quot; algorithm , more complicated to implement than
simple &quot;first fit&quot; : quick fit is where lists of free blocks are kept according to 
size range , but when blocks are returned, these lists aren't useful for finding the
adjacent free blocks, which may be listed in a different size range.

There is also &quot;worst fit&quot;, where the largest free block is chosen always.

First three algorithms are described in The Art of Computer Programming, vol. 1 by D.E. Knuth.

'''Maples''' are trees or shrubs in the genus ''Acer''. There are approximately 125 species, most of which are native to Asia, but several species also occur in Europe, northern Africa, and North America. Maples are variously classified in a family of their own, the Aceraceae, or (together with the Hippocastanaceae) included in the family Sapindaceae. Modern classifications, including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification, favor inclusion in Sapindaceae.

The word ''Acer'' is derived from a Greek word meaning &quot;sharp&quot; (referring to the characteristic points on the leaves) and was first applied to the genus by the French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in 1700.&lt;ref name=&quot;gelderen&quot;&gt;van Gelderen, C.J. &amp; van Gelderen, D.M. (1999). ''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Maples are mostly trees growing to 10-40 m (30-130 feet) in height. Others are shrubs less than 10 m tall with a number of small trunks originating at ground level. Most species are deciduous, but a few in southern Asia and the Mediterranean region are evergreen. 

Maples are distinguished by opposite leaf arrangement. The leaves in most species are palmately veined and lobed, with 3-9 veins each leading to a lobe, one of which is in the middle. A small number of species differ in having palmate compound, pinnate compound, pinnate veined or unlobed leaves. 

Several species, including the Paperbark Maple (''[[../Acer griseum/]]''), Manchurian Maple (''[[../Acer mandshuricum/]]''), Nikko Maple (''[[../Acer maximowiczianum/]]''), and Three-flowered Maple (''[[../Acer triflorum/]]''), have trifoliate leaves. One species, the Boxelder (''[[../Acer negundo/]]''), has pinnately compound leaves that may be simply trifoliate or may have five, seven, or rarely nine leaflets. The Hornbeam Maple (''[[../Acer carpinifolium/]]''), has pinnately-veined simple leaves that resemble those of hornbeams (''[[../Carpinus/]]'' spp.).

[[Image:Maple7951.JPG|left|thumb|Red Maple (''[[../Acer rubrum/]]'') flowers]]
The flowers are regular, [[w:symmetry (biology)#Pentamerism|pentamerous]], and borne in racemes, corymbs, or umbels. They have five sepals, five petals about 1 to 6 mm long, 12 stamens about 6-10 mm long in two rings of six, and two pistils or a pistil with two styles. The ovary is superior and has two carpels, whose wings elongate the flowers, making it easy to tell which flowers are female. Maples flower in late winter or early spring, in most species with or just after the leaves appear, but in some before them.


Maple flowers are green, yellow, orange or red.  Though individually small, the effect of an entire tree in flower can be striking in several species. Some maples are an early spring source of pollen and nectar for bees. 

The distinctive fruit are called samaras or &quot;maple keys&quot;. These seeds occur in distinctive pairs each containing one seed enclosed in a &quot;nutlet' attached to a flattened wing of fibrous, papery tissue. They are shaped to spin as they fall and to carry the seeds a considerable distance on the wind. Seed maturation is usually in a few weeks to six months of flowering, with seed dispersal shortly after maturity. Most species require stratification in order to germinate, and some seeds can remain dormant in the soil for several years before germinating.&lt;ref name=&quot;gelderen&quot;/&gt;

Most maples freate extensive but shallow root systems, and tend to create very dry shade near the tree, so underplanting can be difficult.

==Ecology==
Maples tend to grow both as pioneer species and as subcanopies to larger trees. Most cast very dense shade, limiting undergrowth and underplanting.

==Culture and Use==

===Horticulture===
[[Image:Acer palmatum sango kaku.jpg|thumb|right|''Acer palmatum'' has over 1,000 cultivars. This cultivar is ''A. palmatum'' 'Sango kaku', sometimes called &quot;coralbark maple&quot;.]]
Maples are planted as ornamental or shade trees by homeowners, businesses and municipalities. The Norway Maple (''[[../Acer platanoides/]]'') is especially popular as it is fast-growing and extremely cold-resistant, though is also an invasive species in some regions. Other maples, especially smaller or more unusual species, are popular as specimen trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;gelderen&quot;/&gt;

;Cultivars
Numerous maple cultivars that have been selected for particular characteristics are usually propagated by [[../Grafting|grafting]]. Japanese Maple (''[[../Acer palmatum/]]'') alone has over 1,000 cultivars, most of which were selected in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;gelderen&quot;/&gt; Some delicate cultivars are usually grown in pots and rarely reach heights of more than 50-100 cm.

;Bonsai
Maples are a popular choice for the art of bonsai. Japanese Maple, Trident Maple (''[[../Acer buergerianum/]]''), Amur Maple (''[[../Acer ginnala/]]''), Field Maple (''[[../Acer campestre/]]'') and Montpellier Maple (''[[../Acer monspessulanum/]]'') are popular choices and respond well to techniques that encourage leaf reduction and ramification, but most species can be used.&lt;ref name=&quot;gelderen&quot;/&gt;

;Collections
Maple collections, sometimes called ''aceretums'', occupy space in many gardens and arboreta around the world including the &quot;five great W's&quot; in England: [[w:Wakehurst Place Garden|Wakehurst Place Garden]], [[w:Westonbirt Arboretum|Westonbirt Arboretum]], [[w:Windsor Great Park|Windsor Great Park]], [[w:Winkworth Arboretum|Winkworth Arboretum]] and [[w:Wisley Garden|Wisley Garden]]. In the United States, the aceretum at the Harvard University-owned [[w:Arnold Arboretum|Arnold Arboretum]] in Boston, Massachusetts is especially notable. In the number of species and cultivars, the [[w:Esveld Aceretum|Esveld Aceretum]] in Boskoop, Netherlands is the largest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;gelderen&quot;/&gt;

===Commercial uses===
Maples are important as source of syrup and wood. The Sugar Maple (''[[../Acer saccharum/]]'') is tapped for sap, which is then boiled to produce maple syrup or made into maple sugar or maple candy.  Syrup can be made from closely-related species as well, but their output is inferior.

Some of the larger maple species have valuable timber, particularly Sugar Maple in North America, and Sycamore Maple in Europe. Sugar Maple wood, often known as &quot;hard maple&quot;, is the wood of choice for bowling pins, bowling alley lanes, drums and butcher's blocks. Maple wood is also used for the production of wooden baseball bats, though less often than ash or hickory.

Some maple wood has a highly decorative wood grain, known as flame maple and quilt maple. This condition occurs randomly in individual trees of several species, and often cannot be detected until the wood has been sawn, though it is sometimes visible in the standing tree as a rippled pattern in the bark. Maple is considered a tonewood, or a wood that carries sound waves well, and is used in numerous instruments such as guitar and the drums.

;Agriculture
As they are a major source of pollen in early spring before many other plants have flowered, maples are important to the survival of honeybees that play a commercially-important role later in the spring and summer.

==Pests, Diseases, and other Problems==
Maples are affected by a number of fungal diseases. Several are susceptible to Verticillium wilt caused by ''[[../Verticillium/]]'' species, which can cause significant local mortality. Sooty bark disease, caused by ''[[../Cryptostroma/]]'' species, can kill trees which are under stress due to drought. Death of maples can also be caused more rarely by ''[[../Phytophthora/]]'' root rot and ''[[../Ganoderma/]]'' root decay. Maple leaves in late summer and autumn are commonly disfigured by &quot;tar spot&quot; caused by ''[[../Rhystima/]]'' species and [[../Powdery Mildew/]] caused by ''[[../Uncinula/]]'' species, though these diseases do not usually have an adverse effect on the trees' long-term health.&lt;ref name=&quot;phillips&quot;&gt;Phillips, D.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The first signs of life on Earth appeared in the oceans around 3,500 million years ago. Arthropods were the first creatures to emerge from the oceans to live on land about 420 million years ago. 

Smaller groups of arthropods are called classes. Insects form the Class Insecta, the most successful group of arthropods. Classes are divided into groups called orders. For example, butterflies belong to the Order Lepidoptera and beetles belong to the Order Coleoptera. 

Orders are made up of families. Ladybug beetles are in the Family Coccinellidae. Families are made up of groups called genera which are divided into even smaller groups called species. When people refer to a specific kind of insect, they are usually thinking of a species, such as the Monarch Butterfly.

==What do they look like?==
An insect’s body is has three main parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. Eyes, mouthparts, and antennae are located on the head. Legs and often wings are on the thorax. Females have an ovipositor at the tip of the abdomen for laying eggs. Some insects have a pair of sensory organs called cerci at the tip of the abdomen. A hard outer covering called an exoskeleton protects the soft inner parts. 

Most adult winged insects have two pairs of wings. Flies have only one pair of wings for flying and a pair of club-shaped halteres for balance. The hard, armor-like fore wings of beetles cover and protect the hind wings used for flying. Experts who study insects (entomologists) use the various arrangements of veins in the wings for identification.

==How do they defend themselves?==
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently. Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body. This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators. Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragon flies and mayflies. 

Unlike birds, insects need to warm up their flight muscles. They do this by vibrating their wings or basking in the sun before takeoff.

==What stages of metamorphosis do they go through?==

Because the exoskeleton is hard and cannot stretch, insects must shed (molt) several times as they grow. Many insects have four growth stages—egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The larva is an active feeding stage. The pupa is an inactive resting stage. During the pupal stage, the larva is transformed into an adult. This kind of development is called complete metamorphosis. Butterflies, flies, beetles, and bees undergo complete metamorphosis. Scientists believe the pupal stage evolved millions of years ago from a need to survive long periods of cold. Today 85% percent of all living insect species develop through complete metamorphosis. 

Other insects have only three stages—egg, larva, and adult, with no pupal stage. This is known as simple or incomplete metamorphosis. Grasshoppers undergo simple metamorphosis. Their young are called nymphs and often resemble small adults. Dragonflies and mayflies are aquatic insects. Their offspring are called naiads or water nymphs.

==How do insects affect people?==

Insects are seen as pests by most people. Some destroy crops and carry diseases that harm animals and human beings. Others are beneficial and most are harmless. Honey, silk, waxes, oils, natural medicines, and dyes are among the many useful products from insects. Without pollinators, such as bees, many plants would be unable to produce fruit and seeds and so would die out. Predacious insects, such as lady bugs, help control harmful aphid populations. In some countries, crickets, grasshoppers, and caterpillars provide nutritious food for humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Output and dates ==
The XForms 1.0 Recommendation says that ([[http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/slice8.html#ui-output output]]) is, like other form controls, responsible for converting the lexical (XML) values to localized, presentation values.

The recent XForms 1.1 working draft ([[http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-xforms11-20070222/#ui-output XForms 1.1 output]]) goes further, with an explicit example of handling dates in output.  

Even so, some XForms user agents still do not handle date formatting, so if your XForms processor supports XBL, here's how you can teach it to follow the appearance attribute.

== A declarative way of doing this ==
Here's an example of how to use Mozilla binding to make xf:output do this automatically.  To cause a date to be displayed in a human-readable format, you just use bind to declare its type as xsd:dateTime, and you use the appearance attribute to control the formatting.

It really ought to be something that XForms processors do already since converting XML lexical representation to human-readable presentation is the contract of form controls.

== Markup for your XHTML+XForms Page ==
&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;date.js&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;StyleSheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;output.css&quot; /&gt;
...
      &lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;date&quot; type=&quot;xsd:dateTime&quot; /&gt;
...
      &lt;xf:output appearance=&quot;full&quot; ref=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
=== date.js ===
Get this file from http://delete.me.uk/2005/03/iso8601.html
It converts between JavaScript date objects and ISO 8601 date lexical representation.

=== output.css ===
&lt;pre&gt;
@namespace xf url(http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms);
@namespace mozType url(http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xforms/2005/type);

* To offer a depiction of how these series of books would be structured I will briefly explain a concept here:
We would start from the beginning book aimed at parents or a preparatory school, explaining how to introduce numbers, giving several pages for the child to write the numbers. I think it is important that negative numbers should be immediately introduced though this is tentative. Operators can then be introduced after the child understands what numbers mean, an analogy such as money in a purse can be used and many others. Addition will be first introduced, the most effective algorithm will be used (in the UK most schools use only one, the column method, although I have heard there are many in the USA). Subtraction will soon be used and both the former algorithms will be concentrated on in questions until the child has gained a firm grasp. Multiplication will be introduced after this and many visual perspectives will be used to explain this, due to the lack of children in the UK actually knowing how to mentally do multiplication, a whole chapter will be dedicated to this with mental processes of multiplying certain numbers and a timetable being used (for the written method of multiplication, only one algorithm will be used as for most other operators). Prime numbers will then be introduced and their significance will be explained. After studying these many times, shapes will be introduced (for the sake progression I won't explain this part) then after this graphs and most other basic handling data sections will be explained. All of what was learned will be highlighted in several tests and implemented in all aspects of questions. This is followed by a big section about division (not highlighted). In this relatively small segment which I have touched upon it will probably scatter over 5 books or 20 booklets.

Although I would like for the books to be appropriate for their age I would not want to barrier young children progressing quickly and not to deter adults studying to affirm their knowledge or learn what they might of not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

'''''Epimedium''''', also known as '''Barrenwort''', '''Bishop's Hat''', '''Fairy Wings''', '''Horny Goatweed''', or '''Yin Yang Huo''' (Chinese: 淫羊藿), is a genus of about 25 species of herbaceous flowering plants in the family [[../Berberidaceae/]]. They are native to southern Europe, and central, southern and eastern Asia.

==Description==
Epimediums are low-growing perennials which form dense colonies over time through spreading rhizomes. The leaves are basal, evergreen or deciduous, 2-3 ternate or pinnately compound, held upright on slender but stiff petioles

The flowers are held on delicate racemes or panicles, perfect, bisexual, 4 petals and 8 sepals are distinct and in imbricate rows. The flowers of many species and cultivars have a &quot;spidery&quot; appearance.

==Species==
About 25 species, including:
*''[[../Epimedium acuminatum/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium alpinum/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium diphyllum/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium grandiflorum/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium leptorrhizum/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium perralderianum/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium pinnatum/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium pubigerum/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium sagittatum/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium sempervirens/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium setosum/]]''
*''[[../Epimedium sutchuenense/]]''
There are also numerous hybrids grown in the garden.

==Growing conditions==
Many species, hybrids, and cultivars are grown for ornament, particularly as ground covers for partial shade. They prefer a well-drained, humus-rich soil, but are somewhat adaptable to poorer soils if the drainage is good.

Epimediums need little or no maintenance, but many gardeners cut down the previous year's foliage (even on evergreen species) because the old foliage hides the flowers on many species and cultivars. For this purpose the foliage needs to be cut (not pulled), and care should be taken not to disturb the new growth, which is quite tender. Late freezes can also cause damage to new growth, so some shelter (such as conifer branches) should be applied if a hard freeze is expected.

==Uses==
The evergreen species are particularly good at keeping down weeds; and most species have attractively colored new foliage in spring.  One of the more popular cultivars is the Persian barrenwort ''E. x versicolor'' 'Sulphureum' (a hybrid of ''E. grandiflorum'' x ''E. pinnatum'' ssp. ''colchicum''), also known as the Bicolor barrenwort, which produces soft yellow flowers in the spring. 

Many species of ''Epimedium'' are reported to have aphrodisiac qualities. According to legend, this property was discovered by a Chinese goat herder who noticed sexual activity in his flock after they ate the weed. It is sold as a health supplement, usually in raw herb or pill form and sometimes blended with other supplements. The &quot;active ingredient&quot; in Epimedium is icariin, which can be found in standardized extracts to be from 5% up to 60% potent. Strengths above that are usually reserved for lab use. 

In addition to this mechanism, it also acts as a mild PDE-5 inhibitor. PDE-5 is an enzyme which is produced in a 'negative feedback&quot; loop. As more blood flows to the genitals, PDE-5 metabolizes the nitric oxide almost as fast as it is being produced to keep it in check. If the body does not produce enough of this enzyme, damage to the erect penis could result from too hard of an erection. This is called priapism. Viagra, a popular pharmaceutical, works by blocking the production of the PDE-5 enzyme. Horny Goat Weed produces small amount of PDE-5 inhibitors within safe levels.

White has set up a powerful pawn center. It's time for Black to counter-attack. [[/2...d5/]] is the main line and generate tension on both pawns. [[/2...e5/]] can transpose into the [[Chess/Scotch Game|Scotch Game]], but other continuations are also possible, either a center collapse after 3. dxe5 or a closed game after 3. d5.

To face the central tension, White has three options :
:[[/3. e5/]] closes the game. The pawn structure looks like a French Defence without the blocking Black's light square bishop.
:[[/3. exd5/]] simplifies the game, but won't prevent Black from playing e5.
:[[/3. Nc3/]] increases central tensions, which can be released with 3...dxe4 or maintained with 3...e6 (transposing to [[wikipedia:French Defence|French Defence]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
What is science? Is it forming experiments in a laboratory with test tubes, bottles, Bunsen burners, and other equipment? Science can happen anywhere, like at a archaeological excavation of Mendes, an ancient Egyptian city. Archaeologists and technicians use scientific skills like planning, observing, measuring, and recording data as they search for and discover artifacts. You will use these science skills and others as you learn about the world around you.

==Challenge== 
Excavations to unearth tools or other evidence of past human life often are slow processes. Care must be taken so the remains are not broken or destroyed as they are removed from the soil. Try to excavate a cookie without destroying the treasures within.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
[[Image:Inuktitut.png|left|220px|The Inuktitut syllabary (titirausiq nutaaq). The extra characters with the dots represent long vowels; in the Latin transcription, the vowel is doubled.]]

Inuktitut (Inuktitut syllabics: '''ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ''' ([http://www.gov.nu.ca/english/font/ fonts required]) is usually represented by a 60 letter alphabet of Inuktitut syllabics which are based on the Cree alphabet.  A dot over a syllabic indicates a long vowel.  In some dialects and in Inuinnaqtun, another language that many consider to be Inuktitut, the Roman Orthography system (Latin alphabet) is used.

==How many people speak this language?==

Around 30,000 people speak Inuktitut as their first language.  They are nearly entirely located in Northern Canada, with only around 220 speakers living outside of traditional Inuit lands.  Around 3,500 individual speakers are monolingual, while the rest have typically some degree of skill in English or French.  The successful preservation of this language (in contrast with others in the Eskimo-Aleut language family) is generally credited to the general isolation and remoteness of the Inuit people until the late 20th century.  Although a significant number of Caucasian people live in the territories where Inuktitut is spoken, nearly all native speakers are Inuit.  It should be noted that in Nunavut, a territory of Canada, all top government officials are expected to be able to speak the language fluently.

==Where is this language spoken?==
[[Image:Inukspeak.png|500px]]

==What is the history of this language?==
The Inuktitut language (literally meaning &quot;the Inuit way&quot;) has been spoken by the Inuit for the past 2000 years that they have lived in North America.  However it was not until the 19th century that it became a written language.  Moravian missionaries are generally credited as the first people to transcribe the language from oral to written by copying its phonetics in the Latin alphabet.  It was not until the late 19th century that the Inuktitut writing system was invented by linguist and missionary James Evans.  It is generally lacking some of the syllabics in the Cree language but still contains the majority of them.  The language's vocabulary has expanded in recent years to accommodate technological words from snowmobile to television.  It is recognized in the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Alaska as an official language, and is the language from which the territory Nunavut's ('''ᓄᓇᕗᑦ''' literally meaning &quot;our land&quot;) name is derived.  Before the creation of Nunavut in 1999 the language had been a minority in other recognized territories (one of many found in the Northwest Territories, for example), but it has been taught increasingly in recent years within the new region.

=Groundbreaking News=
It was Friday morning, and the students in Ms. Garcia’s science lab were waiting eagerly for class to start. Unlike most days in science class at York Middle School, this meeting would be a field trip to the north end of the school. Students were eager to observe work that would result in the long-awaited, new gymnasium. The students in group 4 - Ben, Emily, Maria, and Juan - peered out the windows. They saw construction equipment, including bulldozers and trucks, pull up to the school. With pencils and notebooks in hand, the interested students hiked out to the site. They watched as massive shovels moved hundreds of kilograms of dirt from one spot to another.

{{info|Construction efforts sometimes unearth prehistoric sites.}} 

==Buried treasure?==
All of a sudden, the power-shovel operator stopped the giant scoop in midair. He looked curiously into the hole he was making, and then he climbed from his seat high above the ground. He called some of the other workers over. They all stared into the pit. One of the workers motioned for Ms. Garcia and her students to come a little closer. Everyone was surprised at what they saw. A piece of broken pottery was sticking out from the loosened soil.

{{info|Much can be learned about ancient cultures from materials they left behind. Examples: 1. Archaeologists study pottery and other items to learn more about ancient humans. 2. Archaeologists work in the field to gather data.}}

==Science in Action==
One worker suggested that the pottery might be only one of thousands of pieces of trash that were buried long before the school was built. He thought that the pottery could perhaps be an ancient piece of art. Nonetheless, a decision was made to stop the excavation, at least for the moment.

Back in the classroom, the students talked excitedly about the find. This, they all agreed, was real science. '''Science''', they knew, is the process of trying to understand the world.

==Calling in the Experts==
Although the discovery was exciting, Ms. Garcia reminded the students that the piece of pottery might be something that was thrown out only decades ago. To be sure, however, the school’s principal called an archaeologist at the local college. An archaeologist is a scientist who studies the cultural remains of ancient humans. Cultural remains, known as artifacts, might be tools, weapons, rock drawings, buildings, or pottery, such as that found at the school. {{Side note|'''Science Online''' - Visit the Glencoe Science Web site at tx.science.glencoe. com for more information about archaeology.}} Dr. Lum, the students were told, would be at the school on Monday to examine the pottery. 

Ms. Garcia suggested that her students research more about the history of their area. This would help the students evaluate how this pottery might have originated from ancient cultures that once lived in the area. Ben and the others in his group quickly began their research. Maria thought that it would be a good idea to take notes on their findings. That way, they could compare what they found with what Dr. Lum told them on Monday. The others in the group agreed and put their science notebooks into their backpacks before heading to the library.

=Researching the Past=
At the library, Juan used an encyclopedia to begin his research. He found out that archaeology is a branch of science that studies the tools and other cultural remains of humans. There are two major branches of archaeology. One focuses on groups of people who lived before history was written. The other studies civilizations that developed since people began writing things down. To his surprise, Juan also discovered that archaeology covers a time span of more than 3 million years. About 3.5 million years ago, he read, the first ancestors of humans are thought to have appeared on Earth. 

{{info|Archaeology studies ancient people like those who came to North America about 12,000 years ago. 
One branch of archaeology studies the cultural remains of people who lived before history was written.
Archaeologists also study civilizations that have developed since written history began.}} 

The other students took turns finding out about the history of their area. Ben found that many scientists hypothesize that the first people came to North America from Asia about 12,000 years ago. Over thousands of years, these people migrated to different parts of the country. Emily and Maria discovered that the area around their city was settled about 2,000 years ago. After locating a few more sources of information, the students took notes on all the information they had gathered. Emily suggested that they also write any questions they had about the pottery or the science of archaeology. Juan, Ben, and Maria agreed, and each wrote a few questions. The group left the library eager to hear how its findings would compare with what Dr. Lum would tell them on Monday.

==Dr. Lum's Visit==
Dr. Lum arrived a few minutes before nine o’clock. When the bell rang, Emily’s hand shot up. She was hoping to be the first to ask the scientist about the pottery. However, before calling on her, Dr. Lum said she wanted to give the students a little background information and then she would answer their questions. 

Dr. Lum began by explaining how important it is to preserve prehistoric sites and remains for present and future generations. She also said that many archaeological sites, like the possible one on the school grounds, are found by accident. More scientific work would have to be done before construction on the site could continue.

==Technology==
Several kinds of technology would be used to study the area, such as computers and cameras. Technology is the use of knowledge gained through science to make new products or tools people can use. Dr. Lum told the students that a radar survey would be conducted to help study the find at the school. This type of technology, Dr. Lum explained, helps scientists “see” what’s beneath the ground without disturbing the site. Experts from other fields of science probably would be called upon to help evaluate the site. For instance, geologists, scientists who study Earth processes, might be contacted to help with soil studies. 

{{info|Computers and radar are two examples of technology used in archaeological research.}}

==Working Together==
Dr. Lum ended her talk by suggesting that the students go back to the site with her. There, she would examine what had been found. She also would try to answer any questions the students might have about the find. 

Maria and Emily led the group of curious students toward the north end of the school yard. Dr. Lum used her hand lens to observe the piece of pottery carefully. After examining the piece for awhile, she announced that she was sure the pottery was old and that an archaeological dig, or excavation of the site, was in order. The students asked if they could participate in the dig. Dr. Lum said she would welcome all the help they could give. 

=Digging In=
Weeks passed before the radar surveys were complete. The students in Ms. Garcia’s class spent most of their time learning about how an archaeological excavation is done. Maria reported to the class that the holes and ditches that were being dug around the site would help determine its size. She also added that it was important that the site be disturbed as little as possible. By keeping the site intact, much of its history could be retold. 

Finally, the day came when the students could participate in the dig. Each was given a small hand shovel, a soft paintbrush, and a pair of gardening gloves. Each student was paired with an amateur archaeologist. All of those involved were instructed to work slowly and carefully to excavate this important piece of their city’s past. 

{{info|A paint brush, along with other tools such as dental probes and toothbrushes are commonly used during archaeological digs.}}

==Clues to the Past==
Many pieces of pottery, along with some tools, were found at the school site. Before the artifacts were removed from the soil, college students working with Dr. Lum took pictures or made drawings of each piece. These were used to make maps showing the exact location of each artifact before it was removed. The maps also would be used to show vertical and horizontal differences in the site. 

==Lab Work==
Each artifact was given a number and its location and orientation in the soil was recorded. After the artifacts were cataloged, they were removed from the site. Dr. Lum told the students that she would take the finds back to her lab. There, they would be cleaned, studied, and stored for future analysis. 

{{info|After artifacts are mapped and excavated, they’re taken to a laboratory where they are cleaned and tagged for further study.}}

Dr. Lum explained that chemical analyses of the pottery and tools would be used to determine the exact age of each piece. Based on her knowledge of the area, Dr. Lum thought that the site was at least several thousand years old.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==
[[Image:Locust.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A locust is a type of grasshopper.]]
Locusts belong to the order Orthoptera. They make up several species of short-horned grasshoppers belonging to the family Acrididae. They are grasshoppers in their “solitary” form and locusts in their swarming or “gregarious” form.

They have six legs. The first 2 pair are walking legs. The hind legs are longer than the others and modified for jumping. The segment of the leg closest to the body is called the femur. It has powerful muscles that move lower parts of the leg.  

Locusts have 2 pair of wings that overlap the abdomen when they are at rest. They have large compound eyes. Their antennae are jointed and are various lengths depending on the species. 

Carolina Locusts are cinnamon-brown to grayish-tan in color. Their hind wings are black with a pale yellow border. The pronotum, just behind the head, has a high, narrow middle ridge. They are 1-3/8 to 2 inches long. In flight, they make a very fast purring sound, followed by a fluttering sound. 

Long-winged Locusts are related to Carolina locusts. They are brownish-yellow in color with brown-spotted forewings. Their black hindwings have a narrow yellow border.  They are usually 1-3/8 to 1-3/4 inches long.

American Desert Locusts (''Schistocerca americana'')  are a genus of grasshopper, many of which swarm as locusts. They are commonly called bird grasshoppers. The best known species is probably the Desert Locust (''Schistocerca gregaris'').
Desesrt Locusts (''Schistocerca gregaria'') can be as long as 3 inches in length. The male and female look very much alike with a small difference. Males have a boat-shaped tip on the abdomen. Females have two valves on the tip of the abdomen that are used when they deposit eggs. 
 
Red-legged Locusts (''Melanoplus femur-rubrum'') are about 3/4 to 1-inch in length. They can be dark brown to greenish-yellow or red-brown. The hind femora have either a herringbone pattern or black spots. The hind tibiae are bright red to yellowish with black spines. 

Australian Plague Locusts (''Chortoicetes terminifera'') vary in color from brown to green. The middle section of the body between the head and the abdomen (thorax) has an 'X' shaped mark. The wings are clear with a dark spot on the end of each wing.

==Where does it live?==
Desert Locusts are able to migrate very widely and are well known around the world. They are found in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. 

Carolina Locusts are found throughout North America, some have been found that are green in color . They live along roadsides and dry fields. Long-winged Locusts are found from southwest Kansas to Texas, west to New Mexico, and north to Idaho.

Red-legged Locusts are found on the Atlantic Coast south to Florida, west to Arizona, and north to Alberta, Canada. Their habitats are vacant lots in urban and suburban areas, fields, and open woods. They live along irrigation ditches in arid areas. 

The Migratory Locust is the most widespread locust species. It lives throughout Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It was once common in Europe but but is now rarely seen.

==What does it eat?==
Carolina Locusts eat grasses and other plants, and sometimes beans. Long-winged Locusts eat and destroy grasses that grow in plains. Red-legged Locusts consume grasses, weeds, and crops in the Southwest and soybeans in the Midwest.

==How does it defend itself?==
Locusts avoid predators by jumping away on strong legs. They raise the front part of the body on the walking legs and flex the joints between the femora and the tibiae. The tibiae of both walking legs suddenly extend, the legs straighten and push against the ground to propel the grasshopper into the air. When frightened by a predator, a large locust can cover about fifteen times the length of its own body.

Locusts use camouflage to blend into the surroundings. The coloring of different species often depends on the environment. Greenish colored species living in fields and forests can hide in green vegetation. Brown or tan colored species live in dry, sandy areas and easily blend with the colors of sand and dry dirt.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
Locusts undergo incomplete metamorphosis. Females lay eggs in the ground or on plants. There are three distinct, gradual stages of development—egg, nymph and adult. There is no pupal stage. When eggs hatch the nymphs called “hoppers” appear. They usually resemble the adult but have no wings and are not able to reproduce. In the adult stage, they live 3 to 5 months.  

The female Carolina Locust deposits 20 to 70 eggs in soft soil. Nymphs are speckled so they blend in with the ground, safe from predators. 

The eggs of the Red-legged Locust spend the winter in soft soil. In the South where weather is warm, nymphs appear in spring. By June, they are mature adults. They mature later in the summer in the cooler North.

Australian Plague Locusts usually mature and lay eggs within five to seven days after a rain event. Females make a hole in the soil and deposit 2 to 3 pods. Each pod contains 30 to 50 eggs. Eggs usually take around two weeks to develop. Nymphs become adults in 20 to 25 days.
 
Brown locusts have a drought-resistant egg stage and a short life cycle with 2 to 4 generations per year. Eggs are usually laid in dry soil. In the summer months eggs hatch about 10 days after a rainfall.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
A locust walks with 6 legs, using an alternating “tripod” gait. The front and rear legs of one side of the body form a tripod with the middle leg of the opposite side. The 2 tripods alternate with each other as the locust walks. This kind of walking provides more stability than a 2-legged gait or a 4-legged gait.

When overcrowding occurs in some grasshopper species, phase transformation takes place in each individual. There is a change from individual form to swarming form. This is a rapid and reversible change. The head widens, the body grows larger, and wings grow longer until the grasshopper has turned into a locust. Reproduction starts earlier and adults mature sooner. The differences between grasshoppers and locusts are so great that they were once thought to be two different species.

High population densities result from higher than average rainy seasons with dry periods in between. When too dry, habitats shrink and food becomes limited. Contact between individual locusts increases. When there are too many locusts in an area, “critical density” is reached and they take to the air in great numbers. 

Experts used to think locusts swarmed to migrate from one place to another. Now it is believed they swarm to look for food. When locusts swarm, there can be as many as 150 million in one square mile. An adult locust can consume its own weight in food each day. A million locusts can devour one ton of food.

==How does this bug affect people?==
The Australian Plague Locust is the most damaging locust species in Australia. It has a very large range and swarms often. This species mainly attacks pastures but sometimes damages crops. 

Desert Locusts are well known since Bible times as being the 8th plague sent by God against the Egyptians. 
Both male and female Red-legged Locusts transmit poultry tapeworms. They also transmit parasites that harm quail, turkeys, and guinea fowl.

== Generator script update ==

To go along with Dirk Hünninger's [[Talk:Haskell#PDF|efforts]] in using his [[de:Benutzer:Dirk Huenniger/wb2pdf|wb2pdf]] tool to make a better PDF version of the book, I figured out it would be good to put Kowey's script into use to keep the Print Version updated (the new PDF is generated from it). Since I could not get mvs to work, however, I chose to modify it so that it runs with [https://github.com/ianweller/mw mw] as a backend. This modified script is now uploaded at [[User:Duplode/Haskell/PrintVersion.hs]]. The first revision of the code [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Duplode/Haskell/PrintVersion.hs&amp;oldid=2308075] is pretty much equivalent to the original mvs one. On the top of it, I am trying to add some new features, which will be put online ASAP. Suggestions and contributions are welcome, of course! --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 07:45, 17 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Claymation''' (or stop motion animation) can be achieved with very simple tools. The following are steps in creating the ultimate claymation short film or movie.

To create animation you need the following,

==Camera==
A simple digital camera would be the ultimate way to create a animated movie. In the movie Corpse Bride, they purchased a 16 megapixel camera for their shooting. You can also use a movie camera, or a web cam.  (You could go out and purchase a professional animation camera). A film camera, will take hundreds of rolls of film. So If its a low budget project, stick to digital. If you are doing it film, do it with a professional animation camera. Don't forget to purchase a tripod! Without one, animating will seem impossible.

==Editing==
If you are going digital, you need a computer. I prefer a Mac, but a PC will do just fine. Macs come with all the software to make your own home movie! Then get an editing software for your clips. iMovie comes free with MacOSX. Next, if you are adding voices to your feature, get a good microphone. Last thing, you will need lots and lots and lots of disk space. A short film takes under four gigabytes!

==Story==
*[[/Script/]]
*[[/Story Boarding/]]
*[[/Animatics/]] (optional)

==Modeling==
*[[/Sets/]]
*[[/Props/]]
*[[/Clay Puppets/]]

Most amateur animators tend to just go out and buy some clay, but there are many to choose from. I can't tell you what exactly to buy, but make sure you buy all the same brand, or the clay figurines will all be slightly different colours. you can also build or buy an armature. An armature is basically a skeleton for your clayman. you can make these by just bending some aluminium wire to fit your model, or buy an armature from lots of leading brands such as stop mo tec armatures, which I would recommend, or armabenders armatures. you can buy stikfas from www.stikfas.com. you will find out what these are on the site. If you are a seasoned animator and are looking for something more, try buying a guide on how to make foam latex puppets on www.animateclay.com. Foam latex is a substitute for clay, which looks more professional and does not have fingerprints all over them. These things can be made easily and are a brilliant way to kick up your animation a notch.

But whatever you do, you must concentrate while making a model. You better consult some books on anatomy, this really helps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Wooden_hourglass.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An hourglass made of wood, glass and sand. Hourglasses are used to mark the passage of time.]]
==What is time?==
There are two main views of what time is. The first is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe. It is a dimension in which events occur in sequence and it can be measured just like length, height and width. Sir Isaac Newton, a very famous scientist who lived during the 17th century, believed this. This view of time is sometimes referred to as Newtonian time, because of that. Another view is that time is only a way humans sequence and compare events. In this view, time is neither an event nor a thing, and thus is not itself measurable. 

In the rest of this article we will discuss time based on the first viewpoint, assuming that time is a thing that exists and can be measured.

==Who invented it?==
Time was not invented. Before time, there was nothing. 

The first people to use a calendar to measure time that we know of were the [[Wikijunior:Ancient_Civilizations/Sumerians|Sumerians]] around 2000 B.C. Almost at the same time the [[Wikijunior:Ancient_Civilizations/Indus_Valley|Harappan]] civilization had achieved greater accuracy in measurement of time. Later on, the ancient [[Wikijunior:Ancient_Civilizations/Egyptians|Egyptians]] and [[Wikijunior:Ancient_Civilizations/Romans|Romans]] invented time keeping instruments like the sundial, the water clock and the hourglass. The famous scientist, Albert Einstein made some remarkable discoveries about how time and space are related to one another.....he called his theory, the Theory of Relativity.

[[Image:Senenmut-Grab.JPG|thumb|300px|left|An Egyptian calendar marking the passage of time through astronomical events.]]

==How does it work?==
Time is something that is all around us, and affects everything we do, yet is difficult to understand. Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years. We experience time as a series of events passing from the future through the present to the past. Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events. You can mark the passing of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens again and again regularly. Some examples of cyclical events are the passage of a pendulum and the rising of the sun. 

Today we can measure time very accurately with an atomic clock. It turns out that caesium-133 atoms have a very predictable cyclical event that can be monitored. This event happens 9,192,631,770 (over 9 billion) times every second. Atomic clocks are the most accurate time standards known. 

[[Image:Einstein_1921_by_F_Schmutzer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Albert Einstein, whose general theory of relativity changed the way we understand time.]]
==How dangerous is it?==
While time in and of itself is not dangerous, too little or too much time can result in a dangerous situation. Take for example the little bit of time that exists when a door is closing and your hand is between the door and the door frame.  If there is not enough time to move your hand out the way, then an insufficient time period makes the situation dangerous. 

On the other hand, if the time that the door takes to close is somewhat longer, then your brain will have enough time to react. You realize that pain is in store if you don't change the position of your hand. In this case, time is your friend.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, engaging in certain activities for too long a period of time can be dangerous.  For example, being outside without sun protection for too long a period of time can result in sunburn and other harmful effects.

==What does it do?==
Time allows things to change. Without time there is no before or after. A universe without time would function very differently from ours. The past cannot be changed, (so far as we understand) but the future is affected by the present. So people use time to create change. When you walk down a street, you are using time to create change. You change your location. You change your heart rate. You even change the street by walking on it. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Time is nature's way of keeping everything from happening all at once.'' - Anonymous
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==How does it vary?==
The world knows a little more about this now than 100 years ago. Scientists have discovered that time is not fixed. In other words, an hour here is not the same as an hour somewhere else. How can this be? Well, time has been found to be relative. When you move, time slows down. It's true. Unfortunately you can't tell because it doesn't slow down that much. Every time something moves, time slows down for it.

An experiment was performed by an airplane pilot with a very accurate clock in their airplane. The pilot set the clock to the same time as one on the ground and then took off. After flying as fast as they could, they landed and compared the clock to the one on the ground and found that the clock in the airplane had slowed down during the flight. Just a little but still it slowed down. That means that pilot didn't age as much as the people on the ground.

If your parents rode in a vehicle that traveled very close to the speed of light time would slow down for them so that you could be older than them when they stopped riding. 

Can time go backwards? Maybe.
Can time stop? Maybe.

==How has it changed the world?==
It would be better to ask &quot;What in the world hasn't changed because of time?&quot; Change itself could not exist without time.

==What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created?==

Time may have come before the creation of the universe. Some people believe that time began when matter and antimatter bumped into each other and created a huge amount of energy and light. If you had been there it would have sounded like a big bang. 

No one really knows what would have come before time but there are many theories, ranging from absolutely nothing to a different universe.

A '''griddle''' is a [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frying pan]] generally used on top of a [[Cookbook:Cooktop|cooktop]] for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] foods such as [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] or [[Cookbook:Pancake|griddle cakes]].

Griddles tend to be fairly thick. They may have a low rim or none at all, to facilitate flipping food with a [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]], and some have a gutter surrounding the cooking surface for collecting grease or drippings.  Some lack the long handle seen in other frying pans; these may have small handles on opposite sides, suitable for hanging over a fire.  A griddle may also be built into a cook top.  

They are available flat, or with ridges in the cooking surface.  Some are even reversible, with one type of surface on each face.  Seasoned cast iron is the traditional material for griddles, by they are available in a wide range of other materials, as discussed in the [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pots and pans]] article.

Aside from its role as a frying pan, the griddle is also quite often used as [[Cookbook:Bakeware|bakeware]] for dishes such as [[cookbook:Corn Bread|corn bread]] and [[cookbook:Biscuits|biscuits]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I found an apparent inconsistancy. this section:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/How_To_Assemble_A_Desktop_PC/Choosing_the_parts#Expansion_slot_interfaces

says &quot;PCI-Express 16x for mainstream graphics cards (4 times speed of AGP 8x)&quot;

but the last sentence in this section:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/How_To_Assemble_A_Desktop_PC/Assembly#Video_card

says &quot;PCI Express is 16x meaning it can handle the transfer of twice as much data as AGP 8x.&quot;

Which is it? 4 times faster or twice as fast?

I think it would be helpful if in the future more information is added about the Intel Core i7 and its advantages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">From the [http://www.octave.org/ Octave website]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of non-linear equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in Octave's own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The purpose of this collection of tutorials is to get you through most (and eventually all) of the available Octave functionality from a basic level. 

A longer and more advanced Wikibook related to Octave Programming is the [[MATLAB Programming]] Wikibook. Those familiar with MATLAB that want to jump into Octave should consult [[MATLAB Programming/Differences between Octave and MATLAB]].

Indeed, Octave is often viewed as a system for numerical computations with a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab, but that is available as free software under the GNU GPL, and that can replace it in many circumstances. This is why, only one advanced programming Wikibook is being written; but therein the differences between MATLAB and Octave languages are presented. 

The available tutorials are

=== The Current Directory and Defined Path ===

It is necessary to declare a current directory before saving a file, loading a file, or running an M-file. By default, unless you edit the Octave shortcut, the current directory will be .../Octave/work. After you start Octave, change the current directory by either using the toolbar at the left-hand side of the screen, or entering the path in the bar at the top.

The current directory is the directory Octave will look in first for a function you try to call. Therefore if you have multiple folders and each of them has an M-file of the same name, there will not be a discrepancy if you set the current directory beforehand. The current directory is also the directory in which Octave will first look for a data file.

If you still want to call a function but it is not part of the current directory, you must define it using Octave's 'set path' utility. To access this utility, follow the path:

file &gt; set path... &gt; add folder... 

You could also go to &quot;add folder with subfolders...&quot;, if you're adding an entire group ,as you would if you were installing a toolbox. Then look for and select the folder you want. If you forget to do this and attempt to access a file that is not part of your defined path list, you will get an 'undefined function' error.

=== Saving Files ===

There are many ways to save to files in Octave.  

*save - saves data to files, *.mat by default
*uisave - includes user interface
*hgsave - saves figures to files, *.fig by default
*diary [filename] - saves all the text input in the command window to a text file.

The files are saved in your current directory, as seen on the top of the window. By default the current directory is .../Octave/work.

=== Loading Files ===

Likewise, there are many ways to load files into the workspace

To load a saved .mat file, type:
 &gt;&gt; load ''filename''
The file must be in a recognized directory (usually your current directory, but at least one for which the path has been set).

The data in the .mat file is stored with the same name as the variable originally had when it was saved. To get the name of this and all other environment variables, type &quot;who&quot;.

To open an .m file, you can use file -&gt; open, or type
 &gt;&gt;open ''filename''

For instructions on how to open a ''data'' file, see [[Octave_Programming/Basic Reading and Writing data from a file|Basic Reading and Writing data from a file]].

=== File Naming Constraints ===

Octave for [[w:Microsoft Windows|Windows]] retains the file naming constraints set by [[w:Disk Operating System|DOS]].  The following characters cannot be used in filenames:  
  ''' &quot;  / : * &lt; &gt; | ? '''

You're also not allowed to use the name of a reserved word as the name of a file.

Example:

''while.m'' is not a valid file name because ''while'' is one of Octave's reserved words.


When you declare an m-file function, the m-file must be the same name as the function or Octave will not be able to run it. So for example if you declare a function 'factorial' as:

 function Y = factorial(X)

= Benoni Defence =
Black threatens to exchange the c pawn against a central pawn. The objectively best solution for White is to advance the pawn and play [[/3. d5/]], gaining space in the center. To avoid this, White may play [[/3. Nf3/]], protecting the pawn. This move allows Black to exchange the pawns or to increase pressure by playing 3...e6. Additionally, 3.Nf3 may transpose to a Maroczy Bind Sicilian. The last option is [[/3. e3/]] but this leads to a blocked game for white (both bishops are blocked by pawns and Black will get a lead in development). Notice that if white takes with 3. dxc5 Black will not lose material. With the moves 3...Na6 or 3...e6, Black will equalize easily.

==About me==
I am Heir_Of_Eragon. My real name is Chris Speciale. Anyway, I am a huge fan and just help and drop by every now and then. Look at all the pages of the website, and change any type (except for the discussion/chat stuff). I've already added some stuff to this encyclopedia. I know a lot about HTML. My interests are video games, computers, reading, and writing. I've written a whole 5-book series already all copyrighted. Once I find a publisher it will all be published. So be on the look out for the book series of &quot;Cherro Astronomer&quot;. Written by Chris Speciale. I'll be watching everyone. Kind of... But I just love to help people. I work at the library, volunteer at events at schools, volunteer at the church, and anything else I could help with. So I help make this encyclopedia a BIG encyclopedia.
==My first wiki events==
The first day i found this site was if I remember correctly, September 27th, 2006. Sometime in Sept. The edit i made was on an article called [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]].

==My wish==
To see the world. I want the biggest journey ship anyone could every imagine of viewing. Like the one below. 
[[Image:SpaceboyShip.JPG]]
==I am a fan of...==
*Spongebob Squarepant
*Avatar
*Fairly Odd Parents
*NASA
*Wikipedia
*Christopher Paolini
*Inheratance Trilogy
*Eoin Colfer
*Artemis Fowl Series
*Star Wars
*Dan Brown
*J.K. Rowling
*Harry Potter Series
*Tom Kenny
*Any science.

==My contributions==
I have made many contributions to this encyclopedia. Most of them were when i had no account for this site. I mostly work on the &quot;list of&quot; pages. My most recent edit on the list of topics is &quot;list of schools in USA&quot;. Sometimes I go on &quot;Wikibooks&quot; and help out there. There are a lot of books I've read.

==What I have done==
I look at the news everyday. I learn something everyday that makes me more intelligent. Like the great Artemis Fowl, or the legendary Dan Brown. He knows a lot and is my idol.
==My future==
To join NASA and search the stars.
==Goodbye==
'''Bye'''</text>

== Life ==

Wilella Sibert &quot;Willa&quot; Cather was born about 1876 on a farm in Virgina, but her family eventually moved to Red Cloud, Nebraska.  Baby baby baby She attended the University of Nebraska and contributed writings to the ''Nebraska State Journal''.  She worked as an English teacher in Pittsburgh from 1901 to 1906 and then got a job at ''McClure's Magazine'' in New York City.  Her first novel, ''Alexander's Bridge'' was published in serial form in that magazine.  In 1908 Cather was named managing editor of ''McClure's''.  She worked at McClure's until 1912, at which time she devoted herself to writing.  Cather died in 1947 in New York.

The early writing of Willa Cather was influenced by Henry James until another author, Sarah Orne Jewett urged her to develop her own style and to write about her home in Nebraska.  Some critics, such as H. L. Mencken praised her for writing about ordinary people in ordinary language.  She is also known for the clarity of her writing.  

She presents the relationships between her characters subtly, as in this passage from one of her novels:

:''People can be lovers and enemies at the same time, you know. We were... A man and woman draw apart from that long embrace, and see what they have done to each other... In age we lose everything; even the power to love.'' --''My Mortal Enemy'', Part II, Ch. 4

== Awards and Honors ==

*Cather won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1923 for her novel ''One of Ours'', which was inspired by her brother's letters from the field during World War I.
*She won the Howells Medal from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1930 for ''Death Comes for the Archbishop''.
*She received honorary degrees from the University of Nebraska, the University of Michigan, the University of California, Columbia University, Yale University, Princeton, and Creighton. 
*She is a member of the Nebraska Hall of Fame.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Scope of Arbitration ==
At some point the scope of what is to be arbitrated will have to declared. It would help to verbalize the particular over-riding questions to be decided by arbitration. I would suggest &quot;Was the block of Panic2k4 on 3, January 2007 warranted? Further, what actions should be taken to address the related situations that led to the block?&quot; --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 17:01, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

: I concur; an attempt to say what we're doing here would be helpful: what is being arbitrated, and what is the goal of arbitration.  Some kind of current status summary in a prominent position would also be valuable. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 19:46, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

== Plaintiff and Defendant == 
I suggest a vocabulary change. From &quot;plaintiff&quot; and &quot;defendant&quot; to just &quot;pro&quot; and &quot;con&quot; or &quot;supporters&quot;, and &quot;opposition&quot;. I don't think we want to go throwing legal terms like these around casually. Also, as Panic2k4 has pointed out, in a real legal proceeding he would probably be the plaintiff in this action. Also, thinking of process in the future. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 17:01, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
:I agree fully with this suggestion --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:08, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
:: It is all about sides but it can be seen from both ways, I can be &quot;defendant&quot; from a &quot;plaintiff&quot; accusation of wrong doing (It is the now the established format) that will lead to the requested discussion about the penalty I was imposed as I also seek reparation for abuse. But I read somewhere that SB Johnny was given the chance to change things before the process began, as it has already started there is no ways things that already have been said to be erased and I must have a chance to contest the accusations made, the only thing that would stop the process is one of the parties to concede defeat and if I was that party I should be penalized for wasting every one's time like increases of and renewal of the blocking time. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
::: Nobody's time is that valuable here that you can be penalized for wasting it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:20, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

== Agreement to Arbitration == 
Perhaps a section where parties sign to specifically agree to arbitration in this document should be added. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 17:01, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
:Definitely in my view --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:09, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

:By initiating the proceeding parties have already agreed, a formalization would be only more text to be read. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

:: There is value in having things all together in one place. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 19:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

::: Yup but the agreement is implied, it is like this, did you state that you are agreeing to discuss this topic (this conversation we are having?), by only participating in it you are agreeing in being a part of it, or not ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: It seems to be a matter of concern to me that one of the parties to this arbitration would object to affirming his recognition of the arbitration on the arbitration page itself. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 20:02, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

::::: If any objection is expressed on agreement (at the start) then the Arbitration should be ended, but it seems that this isn't the case, I have asked directly about it and you can see by the other party comment that he is addressing the subject at hand. This process is still experimental but it is a improvement on the normal way things are done. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:13, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::: Actually, I disagree. The &quot;normal&quot; way things are done is that users discuss substantive issues and reach a mutually acceptable solution through good faith consensus-building and compromise. This process is in no way better than that. This process is, at best, a necessary evil. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 05:47, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

== Deciding when to end &quot;stages&quot; of arbitration ==

I think what has been said against Panic has pretty much run its course, although I'm willing to entertain keeping the &quot;comment&quot; period open a bit longer if there is somebody else willing to participate.

Sometime tomorrow I'm going to &quot;freeze&quot; the plaintiff section (assuming no objection) and allow Panic to start addressing these complaints in an orderly fashion, without interference from those who might disagree with him.  There will be room for a rebuttal, but let's try to keep this under control.  Those who might be sympathetic to Panic are also encouraged to join into the discussion, but I would strongly recommend that they talk with Panic about how he wants to proceed for now.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

== jguk's views on arbitration ==

I have tried to post this to textbook-l, seemingly without success. I attach my comments below:

It's indeed unfortunate that this issue has come to the fore. I also agree with comments I have seen that we do not want this to be a general precedent such that any admin action can result in what seems to be a formal process.
 
As far as I can see, the following has happened:
*Panic has engaged in behaviour in relation to the C++ book that other authors of that book have taken objection to 
*SBJohnny has come in as someone not involved in the C++ and reviewed the situation 
*That resulted in a short block of Panic's account 
*Such action has been consistent with policy since I've arrived on Wikibooks, and that policy has in effect been written down and is described as &quot;enforced&quot; on [[Wikibooks:Be civil]], although I note that that policy has not been explicitly cited by SBJohnny 
*It is clear from [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] that SBJohnny's actions as an admin are subject to review by other administrators 
*Rob Horning has decided to formalise a review of that.

It would be useful if the following could be clarified, indeed I can foresee problems if they are not:

*Had Panic and SBJohnny both agreed to the form of arbitration proposed by Rob, with Rob as sole arbiter, in advance of setting up the arbitration proceedings? 
*Is it accepted that SBJohnny acted in good faith and in compliance with Wikibooks policy (even though he, arguably, may have come to the wrong conclusions)? It is important to ask whether SBJohnny is actually at risk if Rob decides that the block was wrong 
*What is Rob's remit - what is it he is actually going to decide? Is it whether Panic should refrain from editing the C++ book, or some other restrictions should be put on his account? 
*How long will Rob's decision hold for - if it places restrictions on Panic, would they be subject to review in the event of good behaviour - if it places no restrictions and/or vindicates Panic's position - what if Panic's behaviour gets worse in the future? 
*I will give notice now that if any user voluntarily enters into binding arbitration with another user, and then goes on to edit contrary to the decision made, I will see that as a breach of Wikibooks:Be civil that may result in a long-term block. Is that what is intended? 
*To what extent are users who are not parties to the arbitration, including future users, bound by Rob's decision?

I should end with my personal views on the subject:

*As far as I can tell, SBJohnny has acted in good faith and consistently with our Wikibooks:Be civil policy. Therefore I do not think he should be at any risk of sanction. 
*It is right, if he is concerned by SBJohnny's blocks, that Rob should review the situation. I gather from textbook-l that he did correspond with SBJohnny before removing the block, but it is unfortunate that he did not allow SBJohnny to remove it himself, which would have made it clearer that there was a review of the block, not a wheelwar. 
*Some arrangement needs to be worked out between Panic and the other authors of the C++ book. They have failed to find one themselves. This leaves two options: (1) an arrangement is imposed; (2) Panic is asked to no longer contribute to the book. 
*If an arrangement is to be imposed, it needs the buy-in of the major active contributors to the C++ book. It also needs to bear in mind that there will, hopefully, be future contributors, and any agreement should be such that their buy-in is likely. 
*Wikibooks exists to provide and write textbooks. If any user's presence on the site is detrimental to that aim, then we should ask that user to leave, and back that up by blocks if necessary. I pass no comment on whether this is applicable in this case. 
*I really don't like the formalisation occurring on Wikibooks:Arbitration. If parties agree how a dispute between themselves will be arbitrated and that they will accept binding arbitration, then let them go down that route of resolving the disputes. I'd have preferred it if Rob had asked SBJohnny for his explanation for the block, and if he still has concerns tell him what they are and invite a response. If he was still displeased, there are other active admins he could have bounced his concerns off.

[[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:13, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

: I agree with some of [[User:Jguk]] comments and notes, I will try to address some of them on my reply, I ask that the Arbiter and SBJohnny to avoid providing further comments on the subject on the table (other parties may), outside of the formal areas, as I will, since we are participating in the process (and it has already began) so to keep thing clear and clean. As I see Wikibooks:Arbitration as still under evolution and debate as such this (the active arbitration) is a prototype for similar processes in the future. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:05, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

::I'd add that I hope this is not the prototype for similar processes in the future. Come the end of the day, this boils down to whether Panic and the other contributors to C++ can find a way of working together in the future. (What has happened in the past and whether anyone is to blame for it is, to my mind, irrelevant.) That way of working together may need to be imposed from above rather than agreed between Panic and the other contributors. Either way, I very much hope a way of Panic and the other contributors working together can be found. I'm also conscious that if, for whatever reason, and regardless of whether any blame is attached or not, that is not possible, Panic would need to be asked to cease contributing to the C++ book. That would be a last resort. I hope we're not there yet, but if we are, then we should be honest about it. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 23:17, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

::: It is my personal view that you are probably jumping the gun (hope it is the right expression), as I view the problem I can (and I am) no longer contributing to ANY Wikibook as an author (as in adding my own content), and probably the result will not change that factor but will see, you are also prejudging my actions and placing blind fate on any administrator (they are humans and so they will make mistakes), this process will only provide a way a common user may recur from an &quot;adminsitrative&quot; decision (this is VERY important) I to hope that we (Wikibooks users) will hall find harmony but I'm probably more of a realist and can see that if no chance is given to provide some sense of justice to the users, we (the community) will A) be misleading the users B) fail to get more momentum and will only survive on passing users until they realize the unwritten limitations they are imposed. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:32, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

:I would like to note that I am not trying to be acting here as a God/King of Wikibooks, as I am neither.  I am just another lowly ordinary Wikibookian who, however, does have some experience with this project and has been recognized as having a sort of leadership role here.  Certainly my ideas and opinions are not followed by everybody, nor am I in a position to be like [[User:Jimbo Wales]] here.

:My main goal here was simply to formalize this discussion that was seemingly getting out of hand here and starting to become something of admin vs. admin and wheel warring.  I know that Johnny has not been entirely thrilled (and has said so on my talk page) about what I've done here, although I should note that I've only done one action that &quot;reversed&quot; his previous actions, and that was only to unblock Panic after both Johnny and Panic agreed to a general cooling off period for edits, specifically on the C++ Wikibook.

:As far as what actions may happen here, I would like to come to a concensus, which is why I have the 4-part series of &quot;suggested actions&quot;.  This may be a &quot;long term block&quot;, or perhaps something much more benign, perhaps related to a &quot;probationary period&quot; or some other action.  I don't know right now, but I would strongly suggest that everybody involved here try to be a bit creative and work out a compromise.

:The ultimate goal here in formalizing this discussion was to make it so somebody outside of Wikibooks, like either Jimbo, a steward, or some other WMF board member could come in and see what all the fuss is with reading just a few pages.  That has happened more or less, as can be seen with the conclusions that [[User:Jguk]] has been able to come up with.  That is a good thing, and I hope that in spite of complaints about this process that some of those involved will see the merit of going this way rather than trying to expand the fight.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:57, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== I'm done. ==

I think there is more than enough here for Robert to work with, and I'm not going to hang around for another seven (''seven???'') stages of show trial. I hope this can be resolved quickly and peacefully. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:53, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
:Are you suggesting that Robert uses the information you've all written so far to make a decision?  If so, I would agree.  This shouldn't go on for ever and each party has been allowed plenty of time to raise their arguements and provide evidence.  If each party agrees that they've finished then Robert should be allowed to make the decision.  This is just my opinion though.

:::Calm down here Johnny.  You've spelled out your opinion on this whole thing very clearly, and I'm not trying to attack what you've done here.  Frankly, I think this is going on a very speedy course, and being surprising civil other than perhaps some very pointed personal attacks going both ways, but this is intended to air out those issues anyway.  Had you not written the rebuttal, I would have moved right on to the opinion, but I do feel that Panic does deserve to write a reply to your rebuttal.  One of the things about this whole process is that it is simply going to take some time, as it has been deliberately structured to try and &quot;cool things down&quot; and force everybody to try and write down what has been on an emotional sleeve.&lt;p&gt;I hope that you would be willing to help participate in the next area where you would recommend some sort of corrective action to help encourage better behavior, as I don't want to come up with the specific &quot;punishment&quot; or actions directly if possible.  I would rather this come to a concensus unless there is an absolute impass here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:35, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== Can we call this to an end? ==

The last edit on the defendant rebuttal page was made over a week ago, and I dont see any indication of  people here trying to continue this process any further. The last comment on the discussion page by Rob was even longer ago then that. I think that so far as the issues are concerned, all the complaints on both sides have been aired, and all the further steps in the arbitration (arbiter passing judgement, proposing and rebutting punishment, etc) should be bypassed.

If the point of this arbitration hearing was to put the whole issue onto the table, then we have succeeded. If the point of this arbitration hearing was to pass judgement and lay punishment, then perhaps we need to sitback and ask ourselves how bloodthirsty we need to get. I propose this conclusion, if people are willing to agree on it:

#The arbitration be closed immediately.
#No further &quot;Action&quot; be taken against either [[User:SBJohnny]], or [[User:Panic2k4]].
#[[User:Panic2k4]] not be blocked, and not be restricted from editing any page, like a normal user.
#[[User:Panic2k4]] be warned not to engage in activities that got him here in the first place. Ignoring this warning could lead to further (and much more permanent) action being taken.
#[[User:SBJohnny]] be warned not to engage in disciplinary action against [[User:Panic2k4]] in the future, considering the potential bias that might exist between these two users.

What i'm saying, basically, is that all that can be said about the past has already been said. The issues have been aired, and anything further would amount to a witchhunt or some kind of vendetta. Let us use this learning experiance to move past our issues, and start doing what we should be doing: writing textbooks. I hope everybody can agree to this. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:19, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:Did Rob excused himself for the arbitration ? I don't like some of your proposed actions and several are in simple error or are just contradictory but I will not comment any more on this until the Arbiter takes an action on the subject. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:40, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

::Rob hasn't spoken about this matter, to my knowledge, since 18 January. I think that this is one of the most generous ways to end this process, and I don't imagine that if the rest of the process is allowed to continue that you will be given as fair a deal. It's my impression that many in the community think that you should be punished in some way, and the fact that I am offering a resolution that apparently doesn't punish you in any way is one of the best ways that this could end for you. If you dont want to take this offer, that's fine by me. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:48, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Since what your are proposing only differs from the present situation in 2 or 3 points (and will not address the core problems), I would like to wait for Rob a bit more and see the process go forward.
:::It is clear that at present the ones involved aren't being damaged (more) by the arbitration nor is it intended to validate any kind of witchhunt or vendetta, the human resources used are low 2 Users and an Arbiter each has its own timing to participate so it is not a time intensive task for anyone, I'm the only user that has some freedoms restricted at present, by ending the arbitration in your proposed way, it will be subverting what was attempted here and will not address any of the 2 users problems. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:33, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

== Arbitration Over ==

I am declaring this arbitration hearing over. I have spoken to a large number of wikibookians on this matter, and acting on (a) what I perceive to be the will of the community at large and (b) my best judgment as a long-time wikibookian, I am calling an end to this. Because of my involvement with this case and the involved parties, I will not be making any decisions on the matter. I have instead asked [[User:Withinfocus]], another long-time and trusted wikibookian to act on the matter instead. Any decision that [[User:Withinfocus]] makes on these matters have my full endorsement.

[[User:Robert Horning]], for all his good intentions, has not met his obligations on this matter, having left this hearing open for far too long. Since it began, this arbitration has served as a festering wound for this community, causing a large amount of stress, dissatisfaction, and unhappiness among some of our most active community members. I am not prepared to have this dissatisfaction continue or spread any further then it already has. I am going to make the following demands, in addition to any decisions that [[User:Withinfocus]] makes:

#[[User:SBJohnny]] not take any disciplinary action against [[User:Panic2k4]] now or in the future, should [[User:Panic2k4]] return.
#If I so much as hear a single complaint against [[User:Panic2k4]] (should he return), or find any unhappiness with the way collaboration is occurring at the [[C++ Programming]] book, I will rain down page protections and user blocks like so much fire and brimstone. 
#This case cannot be retried, appealed, or reviewed without clear and overwhelming insistence from the community, something that nobody asked for when we started this in the first place.

The community is sufficiently tired of all the associated drama and nonsense surrounding these issues that my demands here should not be too hard to deal with. If any user has issue with my decision here, or my actions, they may take it up with me on my user talk page. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:18, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

== Appeal ==

Hi guys,

I would like to have a change made in this page. The page is mentioning a possibility for appeal with the stewards of the WMF board. At least for the stewards, there is ''not'' such a possibility. Stewards do not have a mandate to file an arbitration case or any verdict. Stewards have been elected by the Wikimedia community to handle ''administrative'' tasks, and not to arbitrate. For the Wikimedia Foundation Board (which one? of Trustees, Advisory Board?) I assume that they are not interested, as they already have enough to do. I assume that this is a community issue, that has to be taken care of by this community. Please remove the sentence, it is creating a dangerous precedent. Thanks, [[User:Effeietsanders|Effeietsanders]] 19:22, 23 August 2007 (UTC) (steward)
: At this point the dispute has been resolved, without (as far as I know) intervention from stewards. As far as I know no one plans to ask for their involvement. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 20:33, 23 August 2007 (UTC)
:: I did ask at the time but was ignored (intentionally or due to active stewards not monitoring the their emails) or in the only case I reached one, the steward asked for a clean decission from the community (a consensus one way or another to examine the subject, that didn't happen), as for resolved it is a to optimistic view of the outcome. The situation was bypassed by common agreement of the involved parties, but there isn't yet a consensus on the way of addressing similar problems in the future...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:22, 23 August 2007 (UTC)
:Well, how the case ended is not really mattering :). It is specifically about the factual &quot;This decision is available for appeal to the Wikimedia Stewards, and presumably the WMF Board of Trustees.&quot;, which is incorrect, and could lead to wrong conclusions. Especially for future cases. Hence my request. [[User:Effeietsanders|Effeietsanders]] 23:30, 23 August 2007 (UTC)
::Ok so your view or the point you are making is that if the active community does reach an agreement the buck stop there, there is no chance of appeal (are you basing that interpretation on any written policy or guideline ?). If this a correct assumption do you propose any other kind of impartial solution (you must keep in mind that if the user is blocked his ability to provide or defend his &quot;case&quot; next to the community will be diminished).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:45, 23 August 2007 (UTC)
:::I think what he or she is saying is that the stewards and WMF don't get involved in community issues. Its up to the community to resolve matters and any appeal would have to be with the community, there is no next step. If you look at [[m:Stewards policies|Stewards policies]] or [[m:Steward handbook|Steward handbook]] you'll see that even in times that they are asked to get involved they should make sure there doing so on behalf of what the community wants, in accordance with the policies and guidelines of the project before acting, and should generally only do so if there are no active local administrators or bureaucrats to do the job. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:13, 24 August 2007 (UTC)
::::Well if it only depends on what the community wants, if we decide that it should be a step, then it falls under that ruling (if we make it a policy to do so that doesn't go against any more generic ruling of Wikimedia), the problem is that there isn't a viable way of determining what should constitute the community (in general terms) and the best method we have is participation on discussions, and that  make it fall under the discretion of a few active members that were aware of the discussion and willing to participate, in no case it should be considered a final decission (that is why we can update policies and even reverse actions from time to time), any decission  we make is done because it gathered a consensus from the participators in that particular time), so the problem here is determining the reasonable use of what constitutes &quot;final&quot; and the purpose it serves for the community in general not only to the ones involved on a particular decission.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:26, 24 August 2007 (UTC)
::::::First of all I said &quot;'''and'''&quot; meaning it depends on all of those things, not just one of them. Second individual projects don't define the responsibilities of stewards, thats defined at Meta through I believe a global consensus by all involved project community members to apply for all projects. Thirdly Stewards have global access to the sysop and/or bureaucrat tools and follow local policies/guidelines regarding things like deletion policy, undeletion policy, blocking users, unblocking users, whose eligible to vote or be involved in decisions regarding deletions, undeletions, blocking and unblocking, and any policies regarding use of the sysop/bureaucrat tools. The only requirement for stewards as I understand it is to do there best to act in the same manner as each community would expect the local administrators and bureaucrats to act when making a decision and nothing more. This can take some time because a steward would have to read all those policies and guidelines and any related pages that may be linked to and possibly read past decisions and discussions to understand how things work in a community and the best way to respond. So 99% of the time your likely to get a response from a steward such as &quot;take it to the local admins&quot;, &quot;discussion it with the community&quot; or &quot;where is the page that a decision on the matter was reached at&quot;. It works much like the US government does, the state government doesn't define the responsibilities of the federal government. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:07, 27 August 2007 (UTC)
::Of course, how exactly appeals are done within your community is fine. And if you are looking for an impartial judge, sure, but stewards are not suitable for that, and I think neither the Board is. Personally I think that it is not bad to have some final decision at which is no appeal possible, just to finish finally the discussion. But of course that was not the point I was trying to make :) If someone could remove the sentence about the appeal for now, please. I suggest that you guys think just calmly on appeal stuff, just as long as you dont go to stewards etc, and check with the people you have in mind before appointing them as appeal court. [[User:Effeietsanders|Effeietsanders]] 19:40, 24 August 2007 (UTC)
:::Hum I think the the strong opposition for the formation of an fixed appeal court (even more if formed by community members) was the trigger for that selection, since the stewards as you said &quot;have been elected by the Wikimedia community to handle ''administrative'' tasks&quot; (and this tasks can be defined in each community) as for the &quot;not to arbitrate&quot; part is it written on the definition of the possible task they may perform ? (no one should be obligated to do anything on Wikimedia, but some tasks are taken as a compromise, for instance we have on Wikibooks a minimum of activity to stay with the administrative flag).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:21, 24 August 2007 (UTC)

::: If this is what he said then I have to say I disagree; although there are separate policies on each project for a lot of things, stewards as I understand them are involved with all projects at once as a kind of link; in such a case, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to follow 9-10 different sets of guidelines at once. If something happens involving two different projects, and each has a different set of actions or abilities dictated by policy, which set of policies would they follow?

*reset ident
What I said is supported by common practice and what is written down in [[m:Stewards]], [[m:Steward handbook]] and [[m:Steward policies]].&lt;br&gt;
I think we all agree more or less with your view that Stewards &quot;have been elected by the Wikimedia community to handle ''administrative'' tasks&quot;. I would put that this tasks are to be performed across projects based on valid community decisions (this is the only restriction), Stewards have a special value because they should be neutral at all times and are supra-community (they can act across all the projects).&lt;br&gt;
So if the Wikibooks community choses to give Stewards a special ability, it is within the scope of the rules that they may perform it, in this sense I disagree with the interpretation that we are defining special responsibilities (as in obligation), only giving the power for  accepting to perform the task (as all the Stewards tasks, they can but they may chose not to perform them). I also disagree with [[User:Effeietsanders|Effeietsanders]] view that they are unable to arbitrate, the only wording against it is on [[w:Steward policies]], but it deals with using personal judgment if not explicitly requested or forced to do so. If we define it as a task they may perform, it will then becomes a community decission that they can do so.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:57, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

---

I don't really understand the reluctance on the part of Stewards to get involved on this level, although I can see that making decisions like this is something that can be fraught with all kinds of peril in terms of having people flame at you in all kinds of manners and demand all sorts of action that may or may not be reasonable or even possible.  I speak from experience here too!

As originally conceived, the Stewards were supposed to be some sort of &quot;arch-Administrator&quot; who was to act on all Wikimedia projects as a whole.  And for the most part they do exactly that.  Much of this was to off-load some of the tweaking that up until the Stewards were created, this was all done by the MediaWiki development team (who still have direct access to the Wikimedia servers).  As fellow administrators, Stewards certainly can and should help with policing the actions of other administrators and step in when things have gone too far.  While [[User:Effeietsanders|Effeietsanders]] may not wish to step in and perform some major actions on Wikibooks, that hasn't stopped other individuals from doing exactly that, primarily concerned with content deletion and restoration.  And they have invoked their &quot;Steward&quot; credentials to make it happen, although admittedly the ultimate trump card as &quot;chair of the WMF&quot; has been invoked as well.

There is a huge need for somebody to review the actions of Wikimedia communities.  In the more recent past, this responsibility was taken on by Jimbo himself, until it simply got way out of hand and he was &quot;forced&quot; to create the Wikipedia ArbCom.  The process of creating that group made it seem initially that they had &quot;jurisdiction&quot; over all Wikimedia projects, although in practice it has been only for en.wikipedia and not for other Wikimedia projects.  Some other language editions of Wikipedia have set up similar arbitration groups, but it has pretty much stayed with just Wikipedia.

Who might become a sort of ArbCom appeal has been debated before, with discussions on Foundation-l even point out strongly that it should fall upon Stewards, but with many Stewards like Effeietsanders has pointed out goes well beyond the normal duties of a Steward.  And is in many ways more than they agreed upon in the first place when they agreed to become a Steward.  As many of the Wikimedia projects (like Wikibooks) are growing enough to require more complex levels of organization, it is inevitable that this issue is going to present itself more frequently in the future, even though in this one situation the issue is moot as it has been more or less resolved by the community.

Keep in mind, all I wanted to convey was that a Steward might be interested to review the process, and that there were individuals who did have an ultimate authority over any decision I or any other Wikibooks administrator may make in an arbitration process.  I don't think that &quot;fact&quot; has changed, even if those in a position to make a difference and reverse an arbitration decision are refusing to get into the process.  Nothing that was mentioned in the arbitration process suggested that any Steward or even WMF board member had to really do anything, and inaction is precisely what did happen.  Suggestions that Stewards could reverse decisions by admins has been on the [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] (on previous versions of that page) and elsewhere, including on Meta and published on Foundation-l.  This is not a new concept that I created out of whole cloth just on this page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:20, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

:On one hand, I know what you are saying: we have this group of people who are at a higher level of trust and responsibility, and likely have enough global knowledge and good-sense to act as overseers for problems. However, having open an appeal to an external source really undermines the legitimacy of any decisions we make here on Wikibooks. Also, if that route were open, imagine how much traffic it would receive? How many people on how many projects, seeking immediate intervention, would skip all forms of process and go directly to the top? The board would become inundated with requests to resolve petty disputes overnight.
:Beyond that, saying that the wikibooks community is not the final word in a decision-making process really undermines this project. What power do we have to do anything, if everything can be appealed to an external authority?
:I've proposed an addition to the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] policy that there is no further appeal, and all decisions made by the wikibooks community be considered &quot;final&quot;. At least, final in the sense that the decision has been made but is always open to be reconsidered at a later time. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:30, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

::I disagree that &quot;all decisions made by the Wikibooks community be considered 'final'&quot;.  Even defining that community or if a decision has been made can be up for a dispute, but more to the point, there are some very real reasons to seek an appeal, including gross abuse of authority by administrators and bureaucrats.  I know of at least one Wikimedia project (non-English language) that had a very &quot;active&quot; bureaucrat that pushed their POV on a large number of pages and &quot;stacked the deck&quot; by appointing a large number of like minded individuals as administrators.... promoting most of them to become bureaucrats as well.  Anybody with a contrary POV not only had their content reverted, but also had their accounts blocked by the cabal.  Indeed, it was a similar accusation (on a much smaller scale) that prompted this whole issue to go into arbitration in the first place.

::Simply put, there are times that '''*somebody*''' has to step in and enforce some sanity and some of the basic foundational rules for Wikimedia projects:  NPOV, no original research, etc.  In the past Jimbo himself took on that responsibliity, but nobody else has taken up the torch.  That is my point.

::Regardless of if it is stated explicitly on our policy page or not, the WMF board does have ultimate authority over who is permitted to use this project, what kinds of content can (or can't) be permitted, and who has authority to make those decisions.  They also have the ultimate decision to simply &quot;pull the plug&quot; and kill at least the web access to the project... until we decide to get a data dump and restart the project elsewhere on our own dime.  That through inaction the WMF doesn't want to use this authority is besides the point.  It is like the Queen of England...  She (and her immediate predecessors) haven't used the veto authority to kill acts of the House of Commons for nearly a century.  But the authority is still there to kill any act if in her opinion, and hers alone, is going to be a threat to English society.  I hope that the WMF would step in as little as possible and let individual projects decide their own general direction.  Actions by WMF board members here on Wikibooks have been disasterous in the past, and I hope those kind of actions are rare, even historical events.  But they have happened in the past and I see no reason why they won't happen again in the future, even if it isn't any current member of the WMF board of trustees.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:21, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

:::Barring monstrous catastrophe of the type that we haven't seen on this project nor are likely to see because of our infrastructure, it's not even an issue. We have been very cautious about appointing new bureaucrats around here, and we have also been careful not to land in a situation where we only have one or two. Also, the bureaucrats that we do have show a tremendous amount of restraint in promoting RFA candidates. In the course of regular business, there simply is not and should not be any appeal that is external to this project. Yes, on a hypothetical level there is always the authority of the WMF board, but you know as well as i do that they have a standing de facto policy against interfering with the workings of a project. Vandalous power abuses are already against policy here, and if they occur we don't get the WMF board to &quot;appeal&quot;, we ask the stewards to come in here and implement our policies when we are inable to do it ourselves. To that effect, what you are talking about isn't a level of authority, it's an administrative safety net against policy abuses that can't be handled directly by the community. 
:::The simple fact is that the stewards are not a decision-making body, and the WMF doesnt involve itself in the workings of a project. Saying that the WMF board will not act in an appeal is no different from saying that there is no appeal available beyond the community here. I find no reason, therefore, to not  make this point clear. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:42, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

::Ha, but then we go back to the beginning. Imposing a &quot;final&quot; and indisputable decission is flawed at the start, just because there is no  greater legitimacy to impose that artifact in any policy/decission. Since the people discussing any decission can't name themselves the community. The community is by default an open definition that includes but is not restricted to the actual parties that will reach a decission at any given time (and time is of major importance if we intend to define a final decission).

::: I would say that this issue would be exacerbated if a steward were to step in and intervene on a community decision. That being said, I think that it would be worthwhile to have some organized way in which to settle disputes, and ''only failing that'' would the stewards be invoked. I know we have tried (with little success) to develop some sort of dispute resolution policy here, and the resulting chaos had a significant impact on the project. Allowing someone to make the decision (and, more importantly, to have that decision stand in the community without wheel wars) if our internal mechanisms fail is, in my opinion, a necessity for the stability of the project in the event of a major controversy, even though I also hope we never have need for such intervention. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 14:42, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

::As for making it harder to skip it to a top decission, that can be worked out by setting a working method to enable the appeal (and refuse access to it in any other event). We must not disregard that common rules will still apply, if actions are being done in bad faith the problem is a still born and we should not have to worry, the policy can be tweaked and improved at any time to correct such things so abuse will be prevented...
::Can you elaborate on that definition of &quot;final in the sense that the decision has been made but is always open to be reconsidered at a later time&quot;, to me this isn't what I take for final. It justs defuses the problem relegating it to a future and undefined method of appeal (that is worst that just removing the final word for any policy/guideline).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:22, 28 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Hornickels' Glazed Onion Canapes'''

This recipe is a slightly modified version of the onion canapés that I find very enjoyable. Notice that the recipe is for 8 canapés and may need to be doubled or tripled to meet needs.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]]
*2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*8-10 [[Cookbook:Cracker|crackers]]
*[[Cookbook:Sour Cream|Sour cream]]

==Procedure==
#Prepare all ingredients by finely dicing the onion and melting half the butter in a small saucepan.
#Turn the burner up to gas mark 5 or medium heat. Add the diced onions into the saucepan.
#Slowly caramelize the onions, adding in the rest of the butter as needed to keep from burning.
#Once caramelized, add the brown sugar and the honey. Combine thoroughly until all the onions are glazed.
#Place onions attractively onto the crackers and finish with a small dollop of sour cream.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Keep an eye on the onions, they burn easily.
*All measurements are not exact, play around to see what you like.
*Makes 8-10 canapés.

This is definitely one we need to get going! I think we need to take out the useful phrases section and put that on a different page, it's too heavy to put straight in at the start. [[User:Kijog|Kijog]] 19:37, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

Right - here goes... A vague lessonplan to teach welsh...

I think each lesson should include the following:

* Introduce topic and what is to be learnt
* Short Vocab list (20words?
* Dialogue (we could get this recorded as a finishing touch and add a sound file)
* Grammar explanation and Tricky bits
* Exercises and Answers
* Recap

So:

====Lesson 1====

* Introductions, Verb to be.
* Dialogue (a few lines)
* How to say I am, you are, he is etc. (Note: Also say about the copula (''ydw i'' etc.) [[User:AledJames|AledJames]] 11:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
* ''Mae'' stays the same for plural nouns.
* Exercise: Construct simple sentences: I am John, He is a teacher. (link to vocab list of occupations)
* Answers [[User:Kijog|Kijog]] 11:31, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

add as and when...

==== Sound ====

Note about sound files: They have to be encoded in .ogg, right? I'm not entirely sure how you would go about doing this [[User:AledJames|AledJames]] 11:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

Yeah, i suppose that's a bridge we are going to have to cross when we get there. I have seen them before (.ogg) on other pages but I don't even know what software you need to play them with.... [[User:Kijog|Kijog]] 12:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

==Numbers==

I've found a table on the Wikipedia article [[w:Welsh language|Welsh language]] which has the base-20 and base-10 numbers set out next to each other. I've requested it comes over through transwiki, [[User:AledJames|AledJames]] - would you mind if we replace the non-table list we have? [[User:Kijog|Kijog]] 12:07, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

Very well, do it
[[User:AledJames|AledJames]] 11:38, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

Just wondering: do you really want to suggest people should &quot;complete&quot; the material on numbers before beginning the first lesson? People usually find the base-20 system both difficult and annoying. It isn't something I'd expect to see covered before learning how to ask somebody's name, for example. How do I add a signature to this without a button? Will it happen automatically...?

== Proposed Lesson Layout ==

Hey everyone, I'm quite new to wikibooks and all the standard conventions, so please forgive me if I completely do something wrong. I'd quite like to contribute to this book and still trying to figure out naming conventions/creating templates/etc. so we can make this book featured! Please bear with me while I learn the wikicode.

I'm working on a proposed lesson layout based on the teaching conventions adopted by the WJEC. I'll include my thoughts below, although they need to be organised better and perhaps subdivided more, but this gives a rough idea of my idea for the flow of the book.

So this rough type of page hierarchy and restructure:
* Lessons
** '''Introductory Lessons'''
*** Brief History of the Welsh Language
*** The Alphabet
*** Brief Preview of Mutations and Other Grammatical Features
*** Greetings
*** Numbers 1-10
** '''Mynediad'''
*** Basic conversation and present tense (First and second person pronouns)
*** Expanding present tense (all pronouns), more verbs, definite article
*** Negative present tense
*** 'Mynd' present tense to go, introduction to soft mutation
*** Possession using 'Oes' and 'Mae' patterns
*** Expanding numbers
*** Telling the time
*** Dealing with money
*** The Perfect Tense (Dwi wedi siarad)
*** Past tense of 'go' 
*** Past tense of 'do'
*** Past tense of 'cael'
*** Past tense patterns, the stem
*** Asking for things
*** Expressing necessity
*** Soft Mutation
*** Telling Time
*** Possessive pronoun 'his' and 'her' (introduction to aspirate mutation)
*** Possessive pronoun 'my' (introduction to nasal mutation)
*** Describing, using adjectives
*** Basic commands
** '''Sylfaen'''
*** The Imperfect Tense (Roeddwn i)
*** The Future Tense (Byddaf i)
*** The Future Tense - Short Form (Tala i)
*** The Conditional (Baswn i)
*** Hoffwn/Gallwn/Dylwn
*** The Passive Voice (Dwi'n cael fy nhalu)
*** Comparisons (mor a, yn fwy, y fwya, etc.)
*** Irregular Comparisons (gwaeth, gwell, etc.)
** '''Canolradd'''
*** Irregular commands
*** Concise impersonal (Agorir yr ysgol, talwyd y plant)
*** Verbs and preposition combinations (anfon at, ymweld a, etc.)
*** Personal prepositions (iddo fe, iddi hi, etc.)
** '''Uwch'''
*** Points of Formal Welsh (Rywf, etc.)
*** More on prepositions
*** Noun clauses
*** Examining word patterns and spellings (plural endings
* Grammar References
** Mutations
** Gender
** Verb Tables
** Preposition Tables

==Text==
I don't think it makes sense to call Welsh &quot;One of the oldest European languages surviving&quot;, as it's really no older than any other (and has changed more than some – cf the &quot;q&quot; to &quot;p&quot; shift).  It has one of the longest-surviving literary heritages (though a good deal less than Greek or Latin) – is that what is meant?

'''Cheese sauce''' is a variation of [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|Béchamel Sauce]].

==Ingredients==

*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 or 2 cloves of crushed &amp; minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (optional)
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]
*½ teaspoon mustard (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] as desired

==Procedure==
# Melt the butter in a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]. Add the flour and garlic and [[cookbook:whisk|whisk]] together over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, to make a white [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]]. Do not allow to brown. Remove from heat and allow to cool nearly to room temperature.
# Add hot milk to the roux and whisk to combine. (This will also work with a hot roux and room temperature milk.) 
# Add the salt, cheese and mustard and heat till just simmering and cheese has melted.
# If desired, you may bring the sauce to a [[cookbook:boil|boil]]; once the cheese sauce has come to a boil, lower the heat to low and very slowly [[cookbook:simmer|simmer]] for about 45 minutes. Stir it every so often to avoid sticking to the bottom (a whisk is appropriate here). Do not allow the sauce to brown. The longer the sauce is simmered, the smoother it becomes due to the cooking and swelling of the starch grains.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These are my comments that continue from [[Wikibooks talk:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Plaintiff Charges#Comments from User:Paddu]]. I'm leaving them here after Panic threatened to make that page messier. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 21:11, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
:Just a few hours ago (yesterday, as per UTC+5:30) I found that Panic had pasted the content I contributed to [[Programming:C plus plus Variables and Expressions]] (since renamed to [[C++ Programming/Variables and Expressions]] and deleted—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=C%2B%2B+Programming%2FVariables+and+Expressions]) into [[C++ Programming/Variables]] without credit, instead of moving the page there. Now that the original page I contributed to is gone, there is a violation of my copyright under the GFDL since the page history showing my contribution is deleted and only available to admins. I have [[User talk:Hagindaz|requested]] the deleting admin to undelete the page history and place a redirect to [[C++ Programming/Variables]]. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 21:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
::This is the copytight infringing edit (no reference to where the text was pasted from, and no credits)—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/Variables&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=225719]. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:36, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

The following continues from my comments about [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]] at [[Wikibooks talk:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Plaintiff Charges#Comments from User:Paddu]]:
:I tried to again restore the talk page to its normal chronological format in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=68183&amp;oldid=68175], again making sure Panic's rearranged info. isn't lost (since I treated that as his comment and didn't change it — nobody is supposed to change anybody else's comment, at least in the English Wikipedia). In that edit I also responded to a few of Panic's comments (including one where he seems to be derisive of &quot;the female group&quot;). I came down from my stand and made it clear that I will archive some of the discussions into subpages in the next few edits [archiving into subpages, not commenting out using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is the correct way to archive talk pages, at least in the English Wikipedia].
:I was quite furious in my response to calling the &quot;common programming errors&quot; proposal dead since I'd proposed it only a month ago and was very sure I was going to implement it. I would've, except that I left the project after the fork and negligible admin action to avert/revert it.
:''After this it looks like the history of [[Talk:C++ Programming/Archives/Archive1]] is actually the combined history of what used to be originally [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]] and [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus/archive1]]. Hence though I'll be giving diff-links for single edits to one of the original pages, there might be intermediate versions in the current page history which are actually versions of the other original page.''
:I created a new &quot;archive1&quot; page shown in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;oldid=68208] from some of the sections in [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]]. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming%2FArchives%2FArchive1&amp;diff=68184&amp;oldid=68183] is the edit removing the archived sections — I also brought back some discussion that Panic had removed, and marked a few more sections for archival.
:I created a new [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus/single page]] to archive the sections marked—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive3&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68224] and removed those from the main talk page—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=68196&amp;oldid=68194]. Note the 2 sections marked &quot;(continued)&quot; in the diff—I was willing to discuss below Panic's P1/P2/etc. and put whatever he had enclosed in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; into subpages as archives.
:[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming%2FArchives%2FArchive1&amp;diff=68214&amp;oldid=68208] is the next edit to the &quot;archive1&quot; page, just to clarify. [The text is removed from the main page in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming%2FArchives%2FArchive1&amp;diff=68218&amp;oldid=68212].]
:[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming%2FArchives%2FArchive1&amp;diff=167386&amp;oldid=68214] is the next edit to the [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus/archive1]] page, a minor formatting. These 2 versions are shown in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;offset=20041117220857&amp;limit=100&amp;action=history] with 1 intermediate version of [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]] but the diff. page says &quot;(27 intermediate revisions not shown.)&quot;. Dunno what's up. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 19:03, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

:Next edit to main talk page—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming%2FArchives%2FArchive1&amp;diff=68223&amp;oldid=68218]
:Next archival—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=68228&amp;oldid=68223] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive3&amp;diff=68265&amp;oldid=68224]—I thought it was better to have the discussions at one place instead of being split into &quot;archive1&quot; and the main page. May be I should have avoided this, so that all the P1/P2/etc. would have been on the main page and Panic might've been more satisfied.
:I made a few more minor edits to the main talk page and then Panic had this to say—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=68248&amp;oldid=68245] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=68251&amp;oldid=68248] (note the 3 hour deadline). My response was these edits—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?action=history&amp;title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming%2FArchives%2FArchive1&amp;limit=6&amp;offset=20041117222531&amp;dir=prev] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive3&amp;diff=167388&amp;oldid=68265].
:Now Panic came up with the fork—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Archives/Archive1&amp;diff=68323&amp;oldid=68322]. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 19:33, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
:''I don't have much time now so I'll give a shorter summary about other links I want to give''
:Dysprosia and I tried to oppose the fork but it was too late. Panic had forked an old version of the talk page too (without some of my replies, probably to make it look like as far as the forked book is concerned, his ideas are unopposed). I took the matter to the [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge|Staff Lounge]] but there was minimal response and no admin action to revert the fork in spite of Jimbo's mail about it. Ultimately I gave up and directed all edits to Panic's fork of the C++ book and his fork of the talk page. Here are some relevant edits: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?action=history&amp;title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming%2FArchives%2FArchive1&amp;limit=11&amp;offset=20041118063846&amp;dir=prev]
:These are my edits to Panic's fork [[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]] (the space in front of 'C' might be a deliberate attempt to make sure not many would visit his fork so he can have his say, but I'm not sure about this) of the talk page complaining of forking the talk page without my replies: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;diff=68511&amp;oldid=68509], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;diff=68773&amp;oldid=68511] which were only reverted: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;diff=69397&amp;oldid=69393], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;diff=69403&amp;oldid=69397]. His edit summary says &quot;moved&quot;, but it only looks like he removed those and never put them anywhere. The page says archived discussions were to be kept in [[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/- (Archive)]] (why should he come up with his own convention of naming archive pages), but he didn't add my comments to that page, currently at [[Talk:C++ Programming/Conventions/Archive1]]. I added some myself—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Conventions/Archive1&amp;diff=68514&amp;oldid=68508] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Conventions/Archive1&amp;diff=69407&amp;oldid=68514].
:[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?action=history&amp;title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming&amp;limit=19&amp;offset=20041122200413&amp;dir=prev] has my edits to the fork's talk page inviting people to the Staff's Lounge discussion and alerting people that some replies to the comments here aren't present in the page, and also some discussion about Panic allegedly pasting copyrighted content into the book. I recall that some portions of Panic's contributions were similar to some of the text in the English Wikipedia; I had complained about this too at the Staff Lounge. Panic moved the tag I added and gave an ultimatum of 7 days to remove the tag.
:I restored the tag I added earlier but Panic kept reverting. He violated the 3-revert rule followed in the English Wikipedia. I didn't want to do that so I left the C++ wikibook—[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?action=history&amp;title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming&amp;limit=10&amp;offset=20041123081336&amp;dir=prev].

** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page.

The manual is now in a condition that it is actually usable, so I think we don't need to repeat everything here. It would be room for a very simple, first introductory tutorial though. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 08:19, 25 March 2009 (UTC)

Friends tend to be similar to each other, particularly in their interests and attitudes.  As a result, one of the best ways to meet people and make friends in college is to join clubs or student organizations that reflect your interests.  Members of those organizations are also likely to share your interests, increasing the odds of those people becoming your friends.

==Proximity Matters==
Many individuals feel that they choose the people with whom they surround themselves. Research is starting to show that may not be the case. Using students in an introductory psychology course, research is beginning to indicate that proximity is important too.&lt;ref name=&quot;Back2008&quot;&gt;Back, Mitja D., Stefan C. Schmukle, and Boris Egloff. 2008. “Becoming Friends by Chance.” Psychological Science 19(5):439-440.&lt;/ref&gt;  The students were randomly assigned a seat number, then were asked to step forward beginning on the right hand side of the classroom and introduce themselves. The rest of the class was asked to evaluate the person introducing him/herself on two scales: (1) &quot;How likeable do you find this person?&quot; and (2) &quot;Would you like to get to know this person?&quot; The researchers then tested what the relation to sitting near each other had on the students' friendships one year later. What they found was individuals had a higher chance of becoming and remaining friends by just sitting near each other as opposed to individuals who sat nowhere near one another. While friendships are heavily determined by like-minded thinking, simply being near someone can lead to the creation of a friendship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Back2008&quot;/&gt;

==Spouse?==
Meeting one’s spouse in college, while it can and does happen in some cases, is not as common as one might think. As one statistic showed, only 10% of people felt college was their best chance of meeting a spouse, leaving 90% of people believing love can be found elsewhere. Recent research suggests that it is more likely college students will meet their spouses later on in life (through work, friends, etc.).  Also, given the recent trend in college students returning to live with their parents after college - 83% do for some period of time - this also reduces the odds of marriage. Of the 17% of graduates who do live on their own after college, 42% of them are married or living with someone they met in college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roksa&quot;&gt;Roksa, Josipa, and Richard Arum. &quot;Life after College: The Challenging Transitions of the Academically Adrift Cohort.&quot; Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning. 44:4, p8-14 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinberg2011&quot;&gt;Steinberg, Stephanie. &quot;Saying 'I do' while studying at the 'U'.&quot; CNN. 8 Aug. 2011. http://www.cnn.com/2011/08/04/living/married-college-students&lt;/ref&gt;

The low percentage of people meeting their spouse in college may also be related to maturity differences between men and women, since women are more likely to settle down at a younger age than men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wei&quot;&gt;Wei , Clarissa. &quot;For some, getting married in college is worth it.&quot; USA Today. 2 Mar. 2012. http://www.usatodayeducate.com/staging/index.php/ccp/for-some-getting-married-in-college-is-worth-it&lt;/ref&gt; While still relatively low odds, there are certain groups that are more likely to meet their spouse in college: Caucasians are twice as likely as African Americans and men are more likely to marry a former classmate than are women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dustin&quot;&gt;Dustin, . &quot;Getting Married in College.&quot; Engaged Marriage. Accessed: 2 Mar. 2013. http://www.engagedmarriage.com/marriage-preparation/getting-married-in-college&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley's]] first romantic entanglement is an enthrallment with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] which visibly continues throughout the first four books. She remains unattached and taken with Harry until she hooks up with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]], a Ravenclaw student. That relationship ends in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], after Ginny breaks up with him and Michael shifts his attention to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]]. Then Ginny begins dating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]]. She breaks up with Dean in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], finally winning the affection of the only boy she has ever loved, Harry. Unfortunately for Ginny, Harry ends their relationship to protect her from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. They continue to love each other, despite being separated, and Harry finds solace in studying the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] to feel a connection to her at Hogwarts. They both take part in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]], after which we see that Harry plans that they will reunite. In the Epilogue, we learn that Harry and Ginny have reconciled, Harry has married Ginny and they have three children.

== Event Details ==

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosophers' Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] first sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] in King's Cross train station as Harry and the Weasley boys ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the twins]]) are preparing to leave for Hogwarts. Excited about being close to the famous Harry Potter, she demands to go over and see him, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|her mother]] refuses to allow it. She is excited again when he returns from Hogwarts, ecstatically jumping up and down at the sight of him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Ginny's enthrallment with Harry has grown, as she is uncharacteristically nervous and silent during Harry's stay at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]]. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] insults Harry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|Flourish and Blotts]], Ginny leaps to his defence. At Hogwarts, she seems particularly emotionally fragile when Harry is nearby, although that may partially be from her manipulation by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]'s diary. On Valentine's Day, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]], in an ill-starred attempt to &quot;cheer up&quot; the school, hires a number of dwarfs to dress as &quot;Cupids&quot; and deliver love poems to students. One of these costumed dwarfs has a poem for Harry; Ginny's apparent embarrassment as she witnesses Harry receiving it strongly suggests she was the sender.

When she tries unburdening herself to Harry about what has been happening with the diary, Percy barges in, interrupting her. Finally, as Ginny lies near death in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]], Harry destroys Riddle's diary, restoring her life force, and, with assistance from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]], rescues her, and tries to shield her from any disciplinary consequences of Tom Riddle's actions. In what remains of the book, she seems to be able to converse with Harry more normally, in contrast to the almost fearful way she had acted previously.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

The rescue from the Chamber of Secrets changes the dynamic between Harry and Ginny. On meeting Harry again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Leaky Cauldron|The Leaky Cauldron]], Ginny blushes thereby still confirming her feelings for him, and she seems to be self conscious about him having saved her life. However, over the coming days and school year, she becomes her normal self, and seems able to converse normally with Harry still. The effect the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] has on Harry in the Hogwarts Express, and the similar, though not as marked, effect it has on Ginny, may seem to provide some common ground between them. And by the book's end, she is no longer as overwhelmed by her feelings for Harry and more often acts herself in his presence.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Ginny blushes on first seeing Harry when he arrives at the Burrow, indicating her feelings for him have not changed, though Ginny is still now less shy around Harry and is able to converse more naturally. She later shows subtle jealousy when she learns Harry had asked Cho to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]. When Ron suggests Ginny should attend the ball with Harry she appears disappointed, admitting that she had already accepted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]]'s invitation. She seemingly remains unattached for the remainder of the book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

After the organizational meeting of what later becomes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] reveals that probably the only reason [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]] and his friends had shown up is because he was dating Ginny. Ron takes an instant dislike to Michael, says that he had thought Ginny was waiting for Harry, and asks how long that had been going on. Hermione says that while Ginny had earlier been waiting for Harry, she had given up on him. She had then met Michael at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], and had started going out with him. Harry, bemused by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] smiling at him, is not concentrating on the fact that Ginny has stopped waiting for him, but he does ask Hermione if that's why she is now talking to him; she had always been so repressed in his presence before. Hermione says that yes, it is. Hermione also says that Ron's anger at Michael is the reason that Ginny hadn't told him about it, she had known Ron would be over-protective, and didn't want to get into a fight. 

Now freed of the burden of waiting for Harry, Ginny is able to form a friendship with Harry, one that becomes closer over the school year, and they develop more understanding of each other. In the battle of the department of mysteries, Ginny has her ankle broken and is rendered unconscious, whilst screaming in fear, causing Harry to be concerned for her.

Late in the year, when Gryffindor beats Ravenclaw in Quidditch, Michael Corner sulks about his house's loss and isn't happy that Ginny was the winning Seeker, after she had replaced Harry earlier in the year on the Gryffindor team. On the Hogwarts Express back to London, Ginny tells Ron and Harry that because of his sulking she had broken it off with with Michael, who was now seeing Cho. Ron is pleased by this news and suggests next time she should pick someone better, while hinting at that being Harry. Ginny then reveals she's started seeing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]]. This, of course, leaves Ron angry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Ginny remains involved with Dean Thomas. Ron catches them kissing and is quite incensed at Dean's taking this liberty with his sister. Ginny accuses him of merely being jealous because he does not have anyone to snog with (kiss) himself.

Harry gradually realizes he is in love with Ginny and is jealous of Dean, but he keeps his emotions hidden, largely out of fear that his showing feelings for Ginny would damage his friendship with Ron. He spends most of the year fighting his feelings and himself over this matter, while wishing for Ginny to break up with Dean. In an initially unrelated incident, Harry takes some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis]] potion prior to his meeting with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]. Hidden under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], he accidentally knocks into Ginny in such a way that she thinks Dean deliberately shoved her; luckily (as is always the case with Felix Felicis), this finally prompts Ginny to break up with Dean. 

During the Quidditch victory party, Harry, caught up in the excitement, seizes the opportunity to kiss Ginny in front of the entire Gryffindor Common room. They soon become lovers, laughing at how everyone is now talking about them. Ginny later admits him how she had never actually given up on him at all, never stopped loving him or hoping he might turn to her, and had always hoped they'd be together. She explains how Hermione helped her overcome her shyness around Harry, helping her to just be herself, because this could cause him to take more notice of her. It was because of Hermione's advice that Ginny had stopped waiting for Harry and started going out with Michael Corner. The couple's happiness is short-lived, however. After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s funeral, Harry regretfully ends their relationship, telling Ginny that if [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] learns about their romance, he will use her to get to him, just as did with his godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. Ginny is devastated, but she accepts Harry's reasoning. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

While preparing for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur's]] wedding, Harry happens to let slip to Ginny that he has been given a mission that will end up with him killing Voldemort. Ginny is apparently taken aback by this, and does not seem to accept Harry's trying to turn it into a joke. She later shows jealousy over Fleur's little sister batting her eyes at Harry.

Although Harry has ended their relationship, Harrry and Ginny are still deeply in love with each other, presumably forever. Because of this, Harry does not resist when Ginny gives him his &quot;birthday present&quot;, a kiss unlike any Harry has received before. This upsets Ron, who knows how distraught Ginny was when Harry had ended their relationship a month before. Harry, aware that it was Ginny's idea, but unable to tell this to Ron and feeling guilty, simply says that it will not happen again. Because of this, their ongoing shared glances must be furtive, and on Harry's part at least, very quickly terminated. 

When Ginny returns to Hogwarts at Neville's bidding, on Harry's return there, we do see she is obviously pleased when she sees him, as she welcomes him with a bright smile. She shows jealousy when she vetoes Cho Chang's offer to show Harry the Ravenclaw common room, instead volunteering [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] for that job. On his way to meet Voldemort and his doom, Harry does pass Ginny and believes that she senses him despite his being hidden under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]. Ginny's scream of grief is afterwards the loudest of the shocked and distraught voices when she and the others see the seemingly dead body of Harry being carried in Hagrid's arms. When Harry has defeated Voldemort, she is one of the first people to reach him to celebrate his victory. After the celebrations have ended we see that she is leaning, exhausted, on her mother. Harry, evidently equally tired, does not want to bother her just yet, and thinks to himself that they will have &quot;hours and days and maybe years in which to talk&quot;. 

In the epilogue, we learn that Harry and Ginny have married and have three children, James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna.

== Notable Consequences ==

Ginny's announcement that she is going to the Yule Ball with Neville, when Ron suggests that she could go with Harry, causes a bit of a crisis for Harry; Harry must find someone to go to the Yule Ball with, as he is required to lead off the dancing, and his first choice, Cho Chang, has just turned him down. Ron, having been turned down both by his first choice ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]]) and his second (Hermione), is equally in trouble. In desperation, Harry asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]], who accepts, and who suggests her sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Padma Patil|Padma]] as a date for Ron.

At the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Harry realizes that anyone he becomes close to is likely to become Voldemort's target. To protect Ginny, he reluctantly ends their relationship. While Ginny understands and accepts his reasoning, she seems to feel that there may be better ways to approach this problem. 

In the epilogue of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', we see that with Ginny, Harry has finally found what he has wanted all his life: a family.

== Analysis ==

We see that Ginny has set her heart on Harry; Ginny is apparently trying hard to get Harry interested in her as early as the second book in the series. Due to her and Harry's immaturity at that time, however, her initial attempt is doomed. Harry is not ready to welcome romantic entanglement from any quarter at this point. At twelve years old, Harry shares the young male disinterest in relationships, and at eleven years old, Ginny does not yet know how to ease into a relationship in a more mature way. By the time Harry is ready to consider a relationship, Ginny is already involved with someone else.

Ginny's attachment to both Michael Corner and Dean Thomas, however, seems rather less than it might be. Her attachment to Michael is slight enough that his being sulky after Ginny had won the Quidditch match from Ravenclaw was enough to end their relationship. The sulking does imply a certain lack of commitment on his part; one would have expected him to be happy in his girlfriend's victory, rather than sullen in his house's defeat. Perhaps it was because of that lack of attachment that Ginny dumped him. Dean was dumped because of his habit of helping her over and through obstacles that she didn't need help with, triggered by one final, accidental shove by Harry from under the Invisibility Cloak. Granted that the irritation is repeated, still it does seem as though it is a relatively small one, and one that could be dealt with if there was any real attachment there. Given that, in retrospect the reader does come to realize that Ginny hadn't really given up on Harry, and was likely simply marking time with the available others while watching to see if Harry takes notice or becomes available.

As mentioned repeatedly, Harry chooses to break off his relationship with Ginny, out of fear that Voldemort would attack Harry by attacking Ginny. A more mature viewer would say that a better way of securing Ginny's safety is to keep her by Harry's side. It was while they were separated that Voldemort used Sirius to lure Harry into a trap, for instance. If Harry and Ginny are physically close to each other, it is less likely that Voldemort would be able to deceive Harry as to what was happening with Ginny.

#Why does Harry end his relationship with Ginny?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

As mentioned, at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Harry shows his concern for Ginny's well-being by ending their relationship. He knows Voldemort often fells his victims by targeting their friends and loved ones, just as he did with Harry's godfather, Sirius Black. Ginny sees Harry's decision to end their relationship to protect her as being noble, but she also believes it is the incorrect way to handle the situation. It seems unlikely to the reader that their relationship has truly ended, despite Harry's saying it has; and as we find out in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', Ginny clearly is not prepared to end the relationship, though she seems willing to put it on hold for a while. This is proven by  her &quot;birthday present&quot; for Harry, and also by their eventual marriage. For more information, see also the entry for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]].

Surprisingly, of the five close relationships portrayed in the series (Harry and Cho, Harry and Ginny, Ron and Lavender, Ron and Hermione, and Hermione and Viktor Krum), the relationship between Harry and Ginny at first glance would seem to be one of the least convincing. The reader does not feel the early-relationship urgency that is common to young lovers when they finally do get together, leaving some readers to wonder just how serious Harry and Ginny are. The same lack of urgency characterizes Harry and Cho's doomed relationship, foreshadowing the breakup late in Harry's fifth year; meanwhile, the physicality of the relationship between Ron and Lavender seems more in line with what we would expect from a couple of this age. It is possible that the author intends this lack of heat to indicate Ginny's &quot;serene certainty&quot; that she will get her man in the end, or it may be that the author believed that love scenes of the expected intensity would derail the main plotline of the book, or be seen as inappropriate in context.

Set against that, though, is the fact that Harry and Ginny's romantic entanglement, the longest running of all the relationships within the story arc, actually runs through the entirety of the seven-book series. We see the seeds of it planted from their first scene together at King's Cross Station in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''. In some form and varying degree their subplot is featured throughout each following book in turn, though their greatest development doesn't come until later in the series when both characters are around their mid-teenage years. This would suggest the author is evolving the narrative with pace of the evolution for the characters themselves, and that both the story and the personalities involved must reach a certain maturity before they are ready to come to full fruition. It's interesting to note that this plot was given the most direct focus on the romantic aspects of the dynamic involved; this is something we often see lacking or underdeveloped in many of the other couples. This is especially true of the final two books where Ginny is used liberally throughout as both a love interest, and symbolic beacon of hope during Harry's darker times. They also have one of the more sexually based of the teenage relationships. The combination of the romantic aspect represented by Harry's seeing Ginny as a beacon of hope, and the sexual exemplified by Ginny's farewell kiss at the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' illustrates that this is a more adult oriented relationship than any of the other depictions. The shift from an immature and more sexually innocent romance with Cho, to a more sexually suggestive relationship with Ginny, is one of the key indicators in demonstrating Harry's journey from boy to man for the reader. 

This romantic journey is vastly different in structure, execution, focus and narrative than that of Ron and Hermione, the other central and long running love story of the series. The contrasting styles of the two stories adds to the differing dynamics of the main trio of characters as individuals, thereby once again illustrating their differing approaches to emotional matters. Ultimately Harry and Ginny are about giving Harry someone he feels to be an equal on many levels, a person who can help bring his arc to a definitive conclusion. She is not only a friend and girlfriend; she is also a way to truly give Harry what he has yearned for, a real family. Not only will he gain a closer relationship with the Weasley family he will marry into, but he will be able to fulfill his dream of having his own core family unit.

We should note certain parallels between the beginning of Ginny's feelings for Harry, and Severus Snape's feelings for Lily Evans. Both characters developed those feelings as children, at about the same relative ages for each pair. As Harry and Ginny did, Severus and Lily cultivated a friendship that lasted their first five years at Hogwarts, with the additional difficulty that their Houses were competing with each other for school honours. The starkest of those parallels is in Severus Snape's love for Lily remaining unrequited, as he waited before and during his school years for his love to be returned. Yet, Ginny's own diligent wait before and during her school years was rewarded in having her love for Harry eventually reciprocated, and a future built from it. This is an even more poignant layer to add to Severus Snape's tragic love story.

While it is tempting to suggest parallels between Harry and Ginny, and the relationship between Harry's parents, what we see of their relationship would suggest James and Lily's relationship, in at least its initial stages, more closely matched that of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]].

''When I visited San Antonio, TX, years ago, my cousin took me to the Texas Folklife Festival, where he introduced me to fajitas, telling me that they were originated by poor people who cut &quot;beef skirts&quot; (skirt steak) across the grain to make this tough cut much more tender.''

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* 1 inside skirt steak, cut into 3 equal pieces
* 4 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], wedged

*1/2 cup olive oil
*1/3 cup soy sauce
*Juice of two limes
*1 tsp red pepper flake
*1/2 tsp freshly ground cumin
*4 scallions
*3 tbsp dark brown sugar

==Procedure==

#Combine last 7 ingredients in your friendly neighborhood blender until smooth.
#Pour in marinade into a gallon size zip-top plastic bag. Add skirt steak and seal, removing as much air as possible. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. 
#Remove steak from marinade and place down on the coal area of a preheated charcoal grill. Cook for 60 seconds per side.
#Remove and wrap tightly with aluminium foil. Let rest for 10 minutes.
#Meanwhile, drop a 10&quot; cast iron skillet down on the coals.
#Once pan has heated, toss veggies with vegetable oil. Place in the skillet and cook 2-3 minutes.
#Remove and keep warm.
#Slice steak as thinly as possible across the grain. To serve, place a portion of the sliced steak and vegetables inside the tortilla. Roll up and serve with remaining ingredients.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trigonometry in Algebra is the study of triangles and how their measurements of different side and angles relate to each other.

Trigonometry is most well known for it's trigonometric functions, namely sin (sine), cos (cosine), and tan (tangent).  They are used in relation to angles to discover the measurements of sides in right triangles.

&lt;math&gt;Sin(x) = Opposite Side/Hypotenuse&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;Cos(x) = Adjacent Side/Hypotenuse&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Tan(x) = Opposite Side/Adjacent Side&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;sin(x)/cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Note: In trigonometric functions, x represents the measure of an angle (in degrees or radians) in relation to the sides of the right triangle in question.  


Other trigonometric functions include csc (cosecant), sec (secant), and cot (cotangent).  They are as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Csc(x) = 1/sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Sec(x) = 1/cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Cot(x) = 1/tan(x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;cos(x)/sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

While these functions exist to determine the missing length of a side, they assume that the measure of the reference angle is known.  If the measure of the sides of a triangle is known, then it is possible to discover the measure of a reference angle with the use of inverse trigonometric functions.  They are as follows:

&lt;math&gt;sin^{-1}(Opposite Side/Hypotenuse) = x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;cos^{-1}(Adjacent Side/Hypotenuse) = x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;tan^{-1}(Opposite Side/Adjacent Side) = x&lt;/math&gt;

Note: x is the measure of the reference angle in degrees or radians.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] is a pretty Ravenclaw student who is a year ahead of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]. She becomes his first serious crush, and although she also appears attracted to him, she has already begun dating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], a student in Hufflepuff, by the time Harry asks her out. That relationship tragically ends with Cedric's death at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. 

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|the next book, ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] she begins a tentative relationship with Harry, although she is still grieving Cedric's death and is emotionally fragile. Their relationship endures several upsets, but finally ends after a dispute about Cho's friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecomb]], who betrayed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]. At the end of the book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] reveals that Cho is now dating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]], Ginny Weasley's former boyfriend.

== Event Details ==

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] becomes interested in Cho, who is a year older, when he sees her playing as Seeker for the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Cho seems to reciprocate Harry's interest and patiently waits for him to make the first move, as girls usually do. Harry finally works up the nerve to ask her to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], but she has already accepted an invitation from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], although she seems to genuinely regret having to refuse Harry's invitation. Cho and Cedric are a couple for the remainder of the book, although occasionally, Cho may wistfully wonder what might have been with Harry. Cho and Cedric's relationship ends when he is murdered during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s command.  She shows a great amount of bereavement at Cedric's death as she silently cries during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] speech at the end of the year feast.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Cho tries to connect with Harry several times, possibly to ask about Cedric's final minutes. The first time, on the Hogwarts Express, she is thwarted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]]'s ''Mimbulus Mimbletonia'', which has just coated Harry's compartment with stinksap. The second time, she is driven away by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], who accuses her of supporting a particular Quidditch team only because it is trendy. Finally, the two meet in the Owlery, when Harry is sending a message to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]]. Harry is heartened when she supports him over an unjust accusation by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]].

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] convinces Harry to secretly teach real [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] to students, as opposed to the nonsense [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] is offering, Harry is stunned by how many want to study with him, but is heartened, and chooses to continue the group, largely because it includes Cho. After the initial meeting of the group, later called [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], Cho seems to want to stay and have a word with Harry, but her friend is impatient to leave. Hermione then comments that Cho could scarcely take her eyes off Harry all the time she was there, and Harry suddenly realizes just how beautiful [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] is.

During Harry's classes in the Room of Requirement, Cho gets rather flustered whenever Harry is around, messing up a simple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|Disarming jinx]] three times in a row. In the last lesson before Christmas break, Harry finds that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] has decorated the room with streamers, bobbles, and mistletoe. He manages to get the more embarrassing decorations removed, but there are still streamers and some mistletoe up when class starts. After class, Cho remains behind to have a few words about Cedric; she manages to maneuver herself and Harry under the mistletoe, and they kiss. Harry, later, in conversation with Ron and Hermione, says that it was very wet, because she had been crying; Hermione says Cho does that often, and inquires about how Harry behaved. Harry's attempts to comfort Cho receives lukewarm approval from Hermione.

When there is a Hogsmeade weekend on 14 February, Cho drops a few hints. Harry finally clues in and invites her to go to Hogsmeade with him. She accepts, and suggests Madam Puddifoot's tea shop as a good place to spend some time. Harry takes Cho to Madam Puddifoot's, but then is extremely disconcerted to find that it is full of snogging couples, deeply entangled in each other, and particularly dismayed to find that the only open table is adjacent to one occupied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Roger Davies|Roger Davies]], a handsome Ravenclaw student cut from the same mold as Cedric. Harry's dismay and confusion is increased by Cho's revelation that Roger had earlier asked Cho out; we believe that Cho had mentioned this either to make Harry jealous, or to try to let Harry know that she felt he was better than Roger somehow, but it has the wrong effect, making Harry feel even more inadequate in the face of the competition he is getting for Cho's favours. In the face of this discomfort, and Cho's insistence that Harry tell her more about how Cedric died, Harry is less than tactful when he has to excuse himself for a promised meeting with Hermione. Cho, incensed, storms off.

Cho, hurt, then does not pay any attention to Harry at dinner, or over the next few days. Hermione tells Harry that he was a bit tactless, making it sound as if he was going from Cho to another girl. Harry wonders at this, and Hermione explains that he should have made it sound as though he was reluctant to go see Hermione, but he had promised, and he would really like Cho to come too... Harry doesn't understand why he has to insult Hermione to compliment Cho.

However, when the interview with Harry appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|''The Quibbler'']], an apparently repentant Cho comes up to Harry in the hall as he leaves [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]], tells him that the interview was a really brave thing for him to do, and kisses him on the cheek before hurrying away again.

Their reconciliation does not last long, however. The next meeting of Dumbledore's Army is rudely interrupted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], with news that Umbridge has been told about the DA and is sending the Inquisitorial Squad to capture its members. It turns out that Dumbledore's Army was betrayed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]], Cho's friend. After Dumbledore's departure, the next time Harry and Cho meet, Cho attempts to defend Marietta's actions, and says that Hermione's placing a jinx on that piece of parchment they had signed was really sneaky; Harry responds that it was not sneaky, it was brilliant. Cho and Harry stalk off in their separate directions, and do not speak again in this book.

On the Hogwarts Express headed back to London, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] tells Harry that Cho was now going out with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is amazed at this, as he had thought Ginny was going out with Michael. Ginny says that he was upset that Gryffindor had won the final Quidditch match over Ravenclaw, and got all sulky, so Ginny had ditched him and he had run off to comfort Cho. Harry finds that he is not at all upset by this revelation.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Cho's character does not play a significant part in this book. We see her in passing a few times, usually fleeing from Harry's presence as quickly as possible, but Harry is no longer interested in her; he has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Harry Potter|become interested in someone else]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Cho returns to Hogwarts for the final battle against Voldemort after receiving a message from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] via the fake galleons Hermione charmed for Dumbledore's Army communications.  She offers to take Harry to Ravenclaw Tower to show him a replica of Ravenclaw's lost diadem (a possible [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]) but is thwarted by Ginny Weasley, who volunteers [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] in Cho's stead. Cho seems mildly disappointed by this.

== Notable Consequences ==

Harry's relationship with Cho is his first real exploration of this sort of relationship, and features his first kiss, which no doubt will remain special to him despite being flavoured heavily with Cho's tears for Cedric. Luckily for him, it seems to have no lasting negative effect; Harry does not mourn his loss when she moves on.

Cho and Harry's relationship seems to show only that Harry is not yet really ready for a relationship, especially not one as demanding as this. However, it is preparation for his later relationships. For details on that, see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Harry Potter|Harry's Relationship article]].

We are given no information whatsoever on Cho's relationship with Michael Corner. Our information shows Michael is either in Ginny Weasley's year, or more likely in Harry's year, so is two years, or more likely one year, younger than Cho. Whether this would indicate a general preference for younger boys on Cho's part is unknown. &lt;!-- Re: year: please see comment in Overview of the Michael Corner article. --&gt;

== Analysis ==

Cho's relationship with Cedric is quite normal, as far as we can tell; the two of them are going out together, enjoying each other's company, though Cho seems to be somewhat wistful on occasion that she had not chosen Harry. We should recall here that Harry, though not yet being portrayed as The Chosen One, has not yet fallen on the bad side of the Ministry; he is The Boy Who Lived, and additionally he has somehow been chosen as the second Hogwarts Champion in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], making him something of a catch. It is a little curious that Cho feels about him romantically, given that he is a year younger than her; girls do mature more quickly than boys at that stage, so we would expect Cho to be interested in boys older than herself.

Her eventual relationship with Harry, though, is not a healthy one. She is not prepared to move on from Cedric's death, and throughout the year, she continues to mourn him. As late as Christmas, Hermione tells us Cho is always weeping. It seems that what she wants from Harry is more of Cedric. She keeps asking Harry about Cedric, about how he died; she seems to see Harry as a source of more information about Cedric, almost as a surrogate Cedric. Harry does not want to deal with this; he feels that he at least partially caused Cedric's death, and going over the circumstances surrounding that only make him feel that guilt more sharply. What Cho needs at this point is someone who will be able to help her move on past Cedric; and Harry is not able to do that for her. The breakup in early March comes as more of a relief to him than anything else.

Why bring Cho into the story at all? The fact is that, as we enter the fourth book, Harry is maturing; he is getting to be of an age where boys start noticing girls (and vice versa). As such, it is important for him to have a love interest, but possibly it is too early for him to be connecting with Ginny, who is the girl he will eventually marry. At the risk of seeming coarse, the girl that Harry needs at this point, to keep out story moving ahead properly, is one who will put him off the whole idea of romance for a while, so that he will not get too distracted from his quest in the next few books. With the death of Cedric in Harry's presence, we have a ready-made candidate in Cedric's girlfriend. It is certain that at the age of sixteen, Cho will be unready to move on after Cedric's death; she will idolize her dead hero, and will want to try to keep his memory alive. Hermione very accurately limns the feelings Cho is having, after the Christmas meeting of Dumbledore's Army. Among other things, she still feels as though she might be disloyal to Cedric because she is going out with Harry. One thing Hermione does not mention, because Harry has not mentioned it to her, is Cho's continual pestering of Harry for details about Cedric. We can see that this is an attempt by Cho to stay close to Cedric, to learn more about him, perhaps as a way to offset the guilt she feels about going out with his competitor. Of course, Harry is deeply disturbed by this concentration on Cedric, in part because of his role in Cedric's death, and in part because he has always felt inadequate compared to Cedric. Cho's dwelling on Cedric and his abilities deems to be pointing up Harry's shortcomings, and the suggestion that there is still competition for Cho's affections, in the form of Roger Davies, disquiets Harry still further. Cho is thus ideally placed to be set aside after one final climactic spat, and Harry can move on with no regrets.

It is a point of interest to the student that Cho is being set up for this role as early as the middle of book 3. The author has clearly planned out the details of the plot line sufficiently by the middle of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' to know that for narrative reasons, Harry will need a temporary love interest two years later, in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', and expends the effort to create the necessary ground work for that love interest.

== Analysis ==

Natalie McDonald is the only real-world character to appear in the Harry Potter series. A family friend had written to ask what was going to happen in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', because Natalie, then 9 years old, was dying of leukemia and was not expected to survive the 11 months until the publication date. Due to a breakdown in communications, the author did not receive the request until the day after Natalie had passed. However, a friendship between the McDonald family and the author did result, and the author added this character to the book in Natalie's honor. (Story in [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1100-macleans-bethune.html ''Maclean's'', 6 November 2000, by Brian Bethune, thanks to Accio Quote])

{{Closed|1=I am &lt;span style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot;&gt;closing&lt;/span&gt; this as '''delete'''. Please see the bottom for my rationale -[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)}}

I don't believe there is any hope for this book to become truly NPOV. In nearly every sentence there are signs of muslim-POV (&quot;great Prophet (SAS)&quot;, &quot;Rationally speaking, It was necessary that by God's permission the Prophet (SAS) had appointed someone(...)&quot;, &quot;No intelligent person can believe that the Omniscient, all-wise God has ordered people to obey transgressors, adulterers, homosexuals, wine-drinkers and those who forsake prayer and fasting are entitled to rule over the muslims.&quot;).

Again, Wikibooks is not for advocacy and books made only for muslims from muslim point of view should be move elsewhere. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

* '''Weak delete''' I'd prefer to see an attempt to NPOV-ify this bok, but its religious assumption is so entrenched that such efforts might amount to a rewrite. How about putting up a NPOV banner on the page, contacting contributors and attempt to raise awareness among interested parties to see if it can be fixed. OK, there is little hope of success, but it would be nice to go out of our way a bit. You know; to show that we care. &lt;code&gt; :-)&lt;/code&gt; --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 09:08, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
** I think that the contributors want to see it in current shape. And as for me... well, I do not care about ''such'' books. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:12, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
**: Have you asked them?
**: &quot;I do not care about ''such'' books&quot; Woha! Getting a little intolerant to certain subjects, are we? &lt;code&gt;;-)&lt;/code&gt; --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:53, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Unlike the book above, I do think that this book is irreparably the victim of a bad POV. This book is clearly about advocacy for a particular viewpoint. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:06, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
* '''Don't Delete'''. I will do my best to make it NPOV as possible, Ok? This document actually targets muslims. Most of the point of views are left to human intelligence and not a particular point of view: &quot;No intelligent person can believe that the Omniscient, all-wise God has ordered people to obey transgressors, adulterers, homosexuals, wine-drinkers and those who forsake prayer and fasting are entitled to rule over the muslims.&quot;  So we can not consider this as not being NPOV. For example, if one believes in God, then believes in a Merciful God, God cannot be Evil! Any Intelligent human knows that. But if you consider these facts as being in a particular point of view such as God being the Creator of Earth and Heavens, then There is a serious problem in the NPOV! Then NPOV means everyone has the right to tell anything, and we have ommited the human inteligence and reasoning here. We can write a statement and leave the reasoning for the reader to think. If you still think statements like the mentioned one, is not NPOV then I have to remove it from wikibooks, myself. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Believer|Believer]] ([[User talk:Believer|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Believer|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;
*:I understand your point, but your argument disregards people who are not muslim, and who do not think like muslims think. If I do not beleive the way you believe, then your statement implies that I am not intellegent. NPOV, by definition, should not mean different things to different groups of people, that it should not be biased for or against any disputable viewpoint. There is a difference in saying &quot;Muslims believe that god is fantastic&quot; and saying &quot;If you don't believe that god is fantastic, you are stupid&quot;. Also, there is a difference between a book that explains the religion and tells facts about that religion, and a book that tries to convince people to accept that religion. Now, if you think you can make this satisfactorily NPOV, then I will vote to let you try. If it doesnt meet the general standards of NPOV (and i'm sorry to say that I dont think it will), then I am sorry but it must be deleted. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:59, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' -- The statement: &quot;''...if you consider these facts as being in a particular point of view such as God being the Creator of Earth and Heavens, then There is a serious problem in the NPOV!''&quot; leads me to believe that there will be no constructive way to re-do this book in it's current form, and it would be better to just start from scratch. (BTW: I'm not an atheist, but I do recognize that my non-atheism is in fact a POV. NPOV is neither &quot;Numerically-(demographically)-signifigant Point Of View&quot; nor &quot;Not-your Point Of View&quot;. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:08, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. I agree, I only was hesitant because that user had promised to fix the problem. No user = no fix. This is a violation of policy, and needs to be deleted. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:19, 16 October 2006 (UTC)--[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|Discuss this]]) 23:19, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. I am strongly against deleting this page. I have only read the introduction so far, but that alone has explained to me better than anything before the difference in beliefs between Sunnites and Shiites. I agree that many parts are written with a strong point of view, but for me that means that we have to remedy that, and not delete it! I also disagree with the opinion that this is the original contributers job, as I think he has presumably already put some effort into formulating it neutrally. I for one will be working towards a more neutral form of the article, and hope to get some help from others here. Regards [[User:Sean Heron|Sean Heron]] 14:03, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' If you are willing to work to fix this book, by all means try. It is definately better to fix bad material then to delete it outright. However, the point stands that the book--as it stands currently--is in violation of project policy, and if it is not fixed soon (by you or somebody else), it ''must be deleted''. Good luck, if you are going to try. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:06, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. The page seems to have changed slightly recently but I'm in favour of keeping it.  There are many books here with, in my opinion, a horrible bias but this book's not as bad as some.  Has potential. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 22:36, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
*: '''Comment''' There has been no activity by {{user|Sean Heron}} this past week since he joined on the 16th and did some edits on [[Imamat]]. I have [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sean_Heron&amp;diff=660690&amp;oldid=651186 contacted] him on his user page and asked about the future of this. I too liked the direction this was heading in but if it has already stalled, I'd say the potential has fallen again. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:16, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

=== Resumed ===
'''This has now had a month for an editor to work on and so is returned here for a decision'''

*'''Comment'''  Sadly no editing has taken place in this time so I suggest it can be closed quite quickly as delete unless there are fresh views --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:20, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' My vote stands as before - '''keep'''.  The book cites some of its sources and what's there makes for interesting reading.  Why the rush to delete everything in sight? [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 13:56, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
*: A rush to delete things here is based upon the huge amount of cruft/POV we have accumulated by only a few years of laxity. If the contributor makes only minimal attempts to create the book, then appears to abandon it, and that book is POV or otherwise incompatible with WB in its current form, we shouldn't keep it around just because somebody somewhere might come and fix it. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' for me. The loss of the 10 lines written here will not harm anyone; the subject of who is the rightful heir to Mohammed has been covered in greater detail and with greater eloquence than what we've got. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:*'''Comment''' given this has been in VfD since mid September (only 2006 I grant you) how can this be called a &quot;rush&quot; even on Wikibooks? (you should be aware that some of my postings may contain &lt;font color=red&gt;'''humor'''&lt;/font&gt;) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:28, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

: '''Proposal for compromise'''. It seems that some would like this deleted for its lack of content, while others want it kept for its potential. All seem to agree that the version at nomination is unacceptable. Were it not for the policy violations, this page would have been kept since there exists no community consensus between deletionists and inclusionists. As a compromise, I suggest we put up a nice message at the top with something like:
:: ''This page was nominated for it's violation of Wikibooks' [[WB:NPOV|NPOV]] policy (see [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Imamat or Successorship After the Last Prophet of God|the discussion arcive]] for details). It narrowly survived after the offending content was blanked. Some useful material for future contributors may lie in the page history, but any work on this must adhere to NPOV or it will be deleted.''
: My vote still stands as delete, but this compromise would satisfy me. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:46, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:: I don't think this is a very good idea -- we end up with a blank page and a POV history. There are no grounds for compromise here; the material violates NPOV, is extremely basic, and poorly written. We have two inactive users who want it and one active user who thinks it could possibly be turned into something useful eventually. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:31, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::: &quot;''we end up with a blank page''&quot;. Xania seems to disagree. The page ''ins't'' blank and what is there ''is'' interesting.
::: &quot;''the material violates NPOV''&quot;. Do you think the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=The_question_of_the_successorship_of_Muhammad&amp;oldid=663191 present content] violates NPOV? As you mentioned, the ''history'' is POV, but it contains seeds for future work and the state of the history is not a criteria for deletion.
::: I agree that it doesn't seem likely that {{User|Believer}} or {{User|Sean Heron}} are coming back to fix this. But another user has expressed the opinion that this book is currently a valuable stub. I don't see the need for it, but neither the gain in deleting it.
::: Could you please either explain why the current state of the article warrants its deletion, or why the past state should determine it's deletion? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 09:08, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

* '''Support''' Kudos to you [[User:Swift|Swift]], as I see the problem, this compromise will resolve the block to the deletion that is now only defended by [[User:Xania]] (since the parameters for the first poll were changed and this constitutes a new call for objections to a delete), this would solve the problem (no delete), but [[User:Xania]] could also agree in giving a more extensive timeout for the evolution of the work (some months) failing that, another VfD, if not we risk having a book that no one wants to take on and will remain stale forever. Any way the proposed tag will only leave to the interpretation of a future users what constitutes a good enough time/change to put it here again, we can address this by  providing a new extended timeout... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 08:12, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
::Xania would like to keep this book but isn't especially interested in it.  If the majority here want it deleting then that's no problem.  I think our decision should be 'delete' or 'keep and anything in between is just wishy-washy. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Thanks, Panic, but I don't think that any extensions should be given (I didn't even like the first one and think we should have voted keep and then revisited this a little later). This has been going on for far too long. I really think we can solve this by seeing the merit in each others arguments (of which neither side is void of) and compromising. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 09:23, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

'''Closing Rationale'''

I have reviewed these comments thoroughly.  No work has been carried out on this since it was placed on hold (prior to that it was actually closed as delete and then re-opened by someone wanting to work on it).  In practice the only current vote in favour of keeping is Xania's.  Swift's compromise is very good indeed if a compromise were needed.  However Kellen's view, Swift's restatement of delete and previous views such as Johnny's and Whiteknight's leave me quite happy with closing this as a delete.  I will put it out of our misery shortly!  I'm sure the topic will return in some form - at some stage in the future it would be good to think we could achieve a quality book in this field.  This is not that book. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

{{Closed|1= &lt;span style=&quot;background:green; color:white&quot;&gt; Closed&lt;/span&gt; as '''Keep'''. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)}}

Came across this one while wandering.  Given past VfDs this looks like it might be a candidate as it is a constructed language.  Equally it is pretty stubby and has been so for quite sometime.  I am unsure but felt it could be listed --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:05, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Keep'''. Haven't the deleted ones been mostly unnoteworthy? This one has a [[w:Toki Pona|Wikipedia article]] and seems to have a non-negligeable Internet [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=FTq&amp;q=%22Toki+Pona%22&amp;btnG=Search presence]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:33, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. I've heard of &quot;Toki Pona&quot; before, and even though I'm not as reliable a source as google, I tend to think that if it's come across my desk, that it must be at least minimally notable. If we ignore the idea of notability for a moment, are there any other reasons for deletion? I dont hink I can find any myself, but I haven't devoted alot of time to looking. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:55, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' IMO, this is all dependant on its stubbiness. This seems pretty dead, although there was one anonymous contributor to the whole book, there hasn't been any other active contributors for about a year. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 05:37, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:*That was my issue as much as anything - one chapter completed a year ago and nothing more really? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:16, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' the stub. If any new contributor came along to write this book they would have to spend less than 10 minutes replicating the material here. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:14, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Very Strong Keep''' --- at least as long as we don't have a stub deletion policy.  The main problem in the past with constructed languages in the past here on Wikibooks was somebody trying to &quot;invent&quot; one here, using Wikibooks to advertise that new language.  It was deleted for reasons of original research, which this languages does not suffer from the same problems.  While this book certainly hasn't seen much progress, that is not justification to delete this book, and stubs are permitted on Wikibooks.  This is a pretty good outline as well, on the whole, and certainly the starting point for somebody else who might want to work on this book.  Deleting this book will waste far more disk space on the server farm than keeping this book here in its current state.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:00, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' Not made up by the author so it is Wikibooks material unlike some recent languages we've seen. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 13:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== Life ==

Jack London was born January 12, 1876, in San Francisco.  He was a voracious reader as a child, borrowing book after book from the public library.  By age 14 he left home and became a wanderer.  He worked aboard a ship for awhile and also spent time hopping trains.

By continuing his childhood practice of reading library books, he educated himself and eventually enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley when he was 19 years old.  He had already begun to write seriously and hoped to make a living at it.

During his travels London had adopted socialist views and in 1901 ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Oakland, California, as the Socialist Party candidate.  He was writing steadily, producing numerous novels, short stories, and essays in a span of just a few years.

In 1910 he purchased a tract of land in Sonoma County, California, and poured his time and energy into his home there, which he named Beauty Ranch.  In 1913 it was destroyed by a fire, and London discovered that he was in very bad health.  His few remaining years were bleak, and he died on November 22, 1916.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Don't know if the person who created this recipe is looking but how much yeast in in your packages? I've had ones with 7g and others with 11g. Does it matter?

== Yeast Measurement. ==

Rather than buy packets of yeast, i buy the 4 oz. jar of Fleischman's rapid rise. I updated the recipe, reducing the 5 cups flour to 3½. Also, i made careful adjustments to the steps need to mix the ingredients.

== Olive oil? ==

Why is there olve oil in th eingredients list, yet there is nothing in the instructions on when to add it, how to use it, etc?

      <comment>Total rewrite to include all tenses</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Conjugation of verbs is relatively simple for the learner, as Welsh makes great use of compound tenses, meaning very few tenses involve using non-infinitive forms of the verb. Note that this article uses the North Walian pronoun for ''he'', '''o'''; the South Walian pronoun '''e''' is also correct.
==Compound tenses==
These tenses are those most commonly used in spoken Welsh.
===Present===
The present tense is formed from the present tense of '''bod''' (to be) as shown in the table below, '''yn''' and the infinitive. Welsh has no distinct continuous tenses, this tense translates both as ''I do'' and ''I am doing''. To negate sentences, use the negative form of '''bod''', and use the inquisitive form of '''bod''' to ask questions.
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Person
!Affirmative
!Negative
!Interrogative
|-
|fi ''(I)''
|(Ry)dw i
|(Dy)dw i ddim
|(Y)dw i?
|-
|ti ''(you,'' informal'')''
|Rwyt ti
|Dwyt ti ddim
|Wyt ti?
|-
|o ''(he)'' / hi ''(she)''
|Mae o/hi
|Dydy o/hi ddim
|Ydy o/hi?
|-
|ni ''(we)''
|Rydyn ni
|Dydyn ni ddim
|Ydyn ni?
|-
|chi ''(you,'' plural/formal'')''
|Rydych chi
|Dydych chi ddim
|Ydych chi?
|-
|nhw ''(they)''
|Maen nhw
|Dydyn nhw ddim
|Ydyn nhw?
|}

'''Brawddegau enghreifftiol – Exemplar sentences'''
*Rydw i'n darllen – ''I read'' / ''I am reading''
*Dwyt ti ddim yn bwyta – ''You don't eat'' / ''You are not eating''
*Ydy o'n cerdded? – ''Does he walk?'' / ''Is he walking?''

===Imperfect===
The imperfect is formed exactly like the present, but this time using the imperfect forms of '''bod''' as listed below.

'''Brawddegau enghreifftiol – Exemplar sentences'''
*Roedden ni'n yfed – ''We were drinking'' / ''We used to drink''
*Doeddech chi ddim yn dod – ''You weren't coming'' / ''You didn't used to come''
*Oedden nhw'n mynd? – ''Were they going?'' / ''Did they used to go?''

===Future===
The future is once again formed using the future forms of '''bod''', in the same way as the present and imperfect tenses.

*Bydda i'n siopa – ''I will shop'' / ''I will be shopping''
*Fyddi di ddim yn gwneud – ''You won't do'' / ''You aren't going to do''
*Fydd hi'n aros? – ''Will she stop/stay?'' / ''Will she be stopping/staying?''

'''N.B.''' – Just as in English it is also possible to form a more colloquial future tense by using the present tense of '''mynd''' ''(to go)'' '''i''' and the infinitive. The infinitive must take a soft mutation.&lt;br&gt;
'''Brawddegau enghreifftiol – Exemplar sentences'''
*Rydyn ni'n mynd i hoffi – ''We're going to like''
*Dydych chi ddim yn mynd i '''dd'''od – ''You're not going to come''

===Conditional===
Whilst the conditional is strictly not a tense – it is a mood – it is formed in the same way as the three tenses mentioned so far. The conditional forms of '''bod''' are below. (You should know the drill by now!)

|-
|nhw
|B(u)asen nhw
|F(u)asen nhw ddim
|F(u)asen nhw?
|}

'''Brawddegau enghreifftiol – Exemplar sentences'''
*Baswn i'n dod – ''I would come''
*Fasen ni'n mynd? – ''Would we go?''

==Perfect tenses==

===(Present) perfect===
Translating to ''I have done'', this is formed just like the present tense except '''yn''' is replaced by '''wedi'''.

===Pluperfect===
Translating to ''I had done'', this is formed just like the imperfect tense except '''yn''' is replaced by '''wedi'''.

===Future perfect===
Translating to ''I will have done'', this is formed just like the future tense except '''yn''' is replaced by '''wedi'''. Note that the ''going to'' future cannot form a perfect tense.

===Conditional perfect===
Translating to ''I would have done'', this is formed just like the present tense except, you guessed it, '''yn''' is replaced by '''wedi'''.

==Simple tenses==
This is where things get ugly; simple tenses require the verb to change. These make use of the ''verb stem'', something that is relatively unpredictable in Welsh. The stem is sometimes formed by removing the last vowel and every consonant afterwards from the infinitive, but more often than not this is not the case; the stem may be the same as the infinitive or include other letters that were not there before.
Also note that in continuous tenses the subject pronoun may be included or omitted.

===Present===
This is very rare in spoken Welsh, usually only appearing in writing. The following endings are added to the stem:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Person
!Ending
!arbed
!to save
|-
|fi
| -af
|Arbed'''af'''
|I save
|-
|ti
| -i
|Arbed'''i'''
|You save
|-
|o/hi
|''(generally none)''
|Arbed
|He/she saves
|-
|ni
| -wn
|Arbed'''wn'''
|We save
|-
|chi
| -wch
|Arbed'''wch'''
|You save
|-
|nhw
| -ant
|Arbed'''ant'''
|They save
|}
The ''you'' forms ('''arbedi''' and '''arbedwch''') also serve as the imperative.

===Preterite===
This is the most common simple tense in Welsh; it serves a separate purpose to the imperfect, referring to completed actions in the past. This one you will need to know.
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Person
!Ending
!arbed
!to save
|-
|fi
| -ais
|Arbed'''ais'''
|I saved
|-
|ti
| -aist
|Arbed'''aist'''
|You saved
|-
|o/hi
| -odd
|Arbed'''odd'''
|He/she saved
|-
|ni
| -on
|Arbed'''on'''
|We saved
|-
|chi
| -och
|Arbed'''och'''
|You saved
|-
|nhw
| -on
|Arbed'''on'''
|They saved
|}
Notice that '''arbedon''' can mean both ''we saved'' and ''you saved'', for this reason '''arbedom''' is often encountered in the ''we'' form.

===Future===
This tense is incredibly rare and it is unlikely that you will need to know it.
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Person
!Ending
!arbed
!to save
|-
|fi
| -a
|Arbed'''a'''
|I will save
|-
|ti
| -i
|Arbed'''i'''
|You will save
|-
|o/hi
| -ith
|Arbed'''ith'''
|He/she will save
|-
|ni
| -wn
|Arbed'''wn'''
|We will save
|-
|chi
| -wch
|Arbed'''wch'''
|You will save
|-
|nhw
| -an
|Arbed'''an'''
|They will save
|}

==Yes &amp; no==
Welsh has no specific word for ''yes'' or ''no'', instead the main verb in the question must be repeated. To say ''yes'' the repeated verb is the interrogative form (minus any pronoun). To say ''no'' add '''na''' before this verb ('''nac''' before a vowel).

'''Cwestiynau ac atebion enghreifftiol – Exemplar questions and answers'''
*Wyt ti'n hoffi cerddoriaeth pop? Ydw. – ''Do you like pop music? (Yes) I do.''
*Fasai o'n mynd i Ffrainc? Na fasai. – ''Would he go to France? (No) he wouldn't.''

==Irregularities==

===Cael – to have/receive===
If you were to look up '''cael''' in an English–Welsh dictionary, the primary translation would be ''to have''. It is natural therefore to think that '''dw i'n cael''' translates as ''I have''. It does not. '''Cael''' conjugated as any other verb means only ''to receive''. To indicate possession a totally different conjugation is used. Note that when a noun follows '''gan''' a soft mutation takes place.

This isnt 8-12 year old stuff this is high school stuff espaically this page you may want to boost the age up a lot time very theoretical stuff I would reccomend getting rid of it all together.

:Can you provide more insight about the herr theoretical stuff that a 8-12 years old can't understand about that page ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:32, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

&quot;The world is not certain that time is powered by anything. Then again, maybe it is.

Shortly before you were born it was discovered that time is not fixed. In other words. An hour here is not the same as an hour somewhere else. How can this be?

Some people believe that time began when Matter and Anti-Matter bumped into each other and created a huge amount of energy and light. If you had been there it would have sounded like a big bang.
Anyway, Matter won the fight and that is what you are made of. If Anti-Matter had won, you would be made of something different.
No one really knows what would have come before time but the universe was probably a very quiet place with nothing to see.&quot;

That stuff isnt it makes sense but its theory and not stuff 12 year olds would understand.


&lt;br&gt; This module is a train wreck.  I know saying that goes against Wiki policy, but it is.....it needs a'lot of work.  If the goal is to aim this toward kids ages 8-12, then a'lot needs to be done here.  I'll pitch in. [[User:Buddpaul|Buddpaul]] 23:57, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

This could be a great module....clocks and watches (and maybe calendars) should be addressed. [[User:Buddpaul|Buddpaul]] 00:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

At the very least, get rid of the standard sections. They do not apply, and will make the page constricted and uninformative.[[User:Palmtree3000|Palmtree3000]] 22:41, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

I read this page and understood it and I'm a 5th grader.

== Perception-Based Description of Time ==

Someone added this to the article.
:''On the other hand some people believe that time does not actually exist outwith your own perception. Allow me to explain:- 1) Time is merely a measurement system devised by people to help us all to become more efficient in our day to day life style. 2) As we are self aware we can gather a perception of time, the longer you are self aware the longer you perceive it. 3) Time has no physical properties, everyting that exists is made from the elements, time has no elements. 4) You can't feel, see, hear, smell or taste time, you can only be aware of the passing of time. 5) The case of the pilot's clock losing a little time can only mean that some other physical force has altered the way in which the clock measures time. 6) It is impossible to change something that does not exist, so time can't be altered, and people don't get younger. 7) time is in your head, not in the physical world around you, not even in outer space. 8) Finally, time can't go backward or forward for any reason.''
I wasn't sure what to do with it, but felt that it wasn't really appropriate for this article as written, being more of an argument against the bulk of the article. So I'm putting it here. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:21, 23 January 2010 (UTC)</text>

This is a simple program i wrote to show how you would use controls in your game, and how to code an extremely simple menu, it is thoroughly commented but there may be easier / faster ways of doing things than im aware of, if you see anything you could improve on, please feel free.

To compile this, you will need a few files(that i did not write) that you can download at
http://www.psp-programming.com/tutorials/c/lesson04.zip I believe theese codes were written by Yeldarb, anyway nice work.

Somebody please do a public service and wiki format this, looks fine during edit if you want to copy/paste, like i said, just give me some kind of credit.

&lt;/source&gt;

Feel free to comment/edit this code or more thoroughly describe what's happening, just leave credit where credit is due.

Note: using recursion (i.e. in the startMenu() function) is a very good way to crash your system. The reason is that when a function is called the system does so by pushing a pointer to the function onto the system stack followed by any arguments to that function in reverse order (reversed from how they appear in the source code). It's normally not a problem because programs do not usually make many successive function calls. But consider what would happen in the case of the startMenu() function: Every time the cursor goes off the end of the menu list a new function call is pushed onto the stack ( (4byte function pointer) + (4byte integer) = 8 bytes ). You say that's not a problem? Well let me ask you- what would happen if the user just holds down the up/down d-pad key and lets the cursor scroll through the menu list for a while? Those 8 bytes will be added to the stack every four startMenu() calls. So after a while the system stack will outgrow the available memory on the PSP(32mb on the phatties, 64mb on the slims). When that happens the system will barf and hang. Then the user must reset his PSP to recover. Now, maybe you think that's unlikely to happen, and in this case that's true, but consider what would happen in similar situations if you were pushing more/bigger arguments onto the stack. What would happen if this forced the user to reboot his PSP while doing something to the firmware? It would brick the PSP.

Even if things do not get quite that out of hand code like this can still be slow because the PSP's MIPS32 CPUs use what is called a Register Window to store function calls and arguments instead of an orthodox stack like the IA32 architecture. When the window of registers fills up the CPU will dump the overflow out to memory until it needs it again. That is a (relatively) slow operation even if your program never totally fills up all available RAM.

The point is that recursion is logically elegant, but a very dirty practical solution. I would recommend, instead of recursively calling the startMenu() function when the cursor runs off the end of the menu list, that the startMenu() function be changed to return an invalid menu position (i.e. -1) when the cursor goes needs to loop. Then, wherever the startMenu() function is called, the code should check the return value to see if it's invalid. If so, then simply call startMenu() again. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// we'll put these in a global struct for now, ideally we'd wrap this whole menu up in a class...
struct main_menu_attributes
	{
	char cursor[5] = &quot;=-&gt;&quot;; // What to use as our cursor
	int cursorColor = ColorBlue;
	int MinMenuop = 1;
	int MaxMenuop = 4; // Number of options in our menu
	} mm_attribs; // global variable of type main_menu_attributes

//
//  renamed startMenu() to something more appropriate
//
int displayMenu (int argMenuop)
	{
	// Check to make sure an invalid option wasnt passed to startMenu()... and makes the list roll over
	// never execute without a correct value to keep from displaying incorrect cursor positions
	// Print the new menu
	int cursorY = (Menuop*10)+110; // 110 appears to be the pixel height for the menu so that the cursor appears next to the menu (centered on screen)
					// 10 appears to be the pixel height of a character/line of text, so multiplying the Menuop by 10 moves the cursor by
					// an entire menu row at a time
	clearScreen(ColorBlack);
	printTextScreen(120, cursorY, cursor, cursorColor);	// print the cursor first
	printTextScreen(150, 120, &quot;Start Game&quot;, ColorGreen);	// print the first menu item's text to the frame buffer
	printTextScreen(150, 130, &quot;Load Game&quot;, ColorGreen);	// print the second menu item's text to the frame buffer
	printTextScreen(150, 140, &quot;Multiplayer&quot;, ColorGreen);	// print the third menu item's text to the frame buffer
	printTextScreen(150, 150, &quot;Password&quot;, ColorGreen);	// print the fourth menu item's text to the frame buffer
	sceDisplayWaitVblankStart();				// I have no idea what we're waiting for (if that's what we're doing here)
	flipScreen();						// flipScreen() will put the stuff we just wrote onto the screen that the user is looking at
	return 0;
	}

//
// take input from the user. assuming the rest of the program code has been set up,
// the user can hit the 'HOME' button to leave the program and get back to the XMB
//
int startMenuCtrl ()
	{
	int command_code; // no need to waste CPU time initializing this since it will not be used until after it is set by calling getMenuInput()
	// Start a control loop
	while (1)
		{
		// display the screen
		startMenu(Menuop);
		// get user input
		command_code = getMenuInput ();
		// if the input is inappropriate (goes off the menu list) then loop it before displaying again

		else if (Menuop &lt; MinMenuop)
			{
			Menuop = MaxMenuop; // if the user overstepped in the up direction then loop back to the bottom
			}
		else;
		// if the input is appropriate then the menu will be re-displayed as usual
		// now we execute depending on what the user chose (if he chose anything at all. if not, then we stay here in this loop and wait)
		executeCommand (command_code);
		}		
	}

//
// this function will grab the user input and translate it for us into a simple integer (makes dealing with it easier)
//
int getMenuInput ()
	{
	int rtrn = 0; // we stick our return value in here

	sceCtrlReadBufferPositive(&amp;pad, 1);
	if (pad.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_DOWN)
		{
		rtrn = 1;
		}
	if (pad.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_UP)
		{
		rtrn = 2;
		}
	/*
	if (pad.Buttons &amp; /*whatever button you want to use for &quot;OK&quot;*/)
		{
		// we won't touch Menuop because the user isn't moving the cursor
		startMenuCtrlDelay ();
		rtrn = /* whatever code you want to use for the button that was pushed */
		}
	// and so on and so forth for all the button handlers
	*/

	return rtrn; // the rtrn code we're returning will tell whoever called us what the user's input was
	}

//
//  moved all the command code into a nice, easy-to-read switch
//
int executeCommand (int command_code)
	{
	switch (command_code)
		{
		case 1: // user hit d-pad UP
			{
			Menuop--;				// move the cursor up one
			if (Menuop &lt; mm_attribs.MinMenuop)
				{
				Menuop = mm_attribs.MaxMenuop;	// if the user overstepped in the up direction then loop back to the bottom
				}
			else;
			startMenuCtrlDelay ();			// wait for a moment so that we don't take input faster than the user can let off of the d-pad
			break;
			}
		case 2: // user hit d-pad DOWN
			{
			Menuop++;				// move the cursor down one
			if (Menuop &gt; mm_attribs.MaxMenuop)
				{
				Menuop = mm_attribs.MinMenuop;	// if the user overstepped in the up direction then loop back to the bottom
				}
			else;

			break;
			}
		/*
		case /*your command code here*/:
			{

		*/
		default: // unhandled input- consider it homework
			{
			// print a warning message and continue as normal
			break;
			}
		}
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

There are more functions in this code, but it's not the absolute number of function calls that's the problem with recursion- it's the ''depth'' of the function calls that causes problems.
On a further note, main() has always been required to return an integer value on POSIX systems. The only system/compiler which doesn't require it is Windows and Visual Studio.

Well I'm sorry this seems like a 'test' apparently the life of Human Puppets means nothing to, even though its a factual event that happens everyday. So, this seems like an experiment to you? Is it wrong for me to inform people on the life of Human Puppets and their masters. How do you know this isn't factual? I have plenty of witnesses that can tell you this is true. I'm sorry being a Human being isn't worthy enough for you website. How do you know that when you read the encyclopedia Britanica that what you're reading is fact?..someone wrote it. And, what is wrong with theories? Some of our greatest theorys came from average people. Remember Enstein? Or mabey you should go look him up in the encyclopedia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">PROBLEM:
Jeep Cherokee Rear Hatch latch is stuck closed or open. Unable to open or close rear hatch normally.

RESOLUTION:

There are several methods you can try to open a stuck rear hatch:

Method One:  Press inwards with the palm of your hand just above the handle at the same time you push in or pull up on the latch mechanism.  Sometimes a slap of your hand in the same location works better.  This method may help free a sticky latch mechanism. Only a temporary fix...go to Method Three. 

Method Two: Note this will not work on latches with the plastic lift handle. Look underneath the Jeep between the bumper and the gas tank.  You are now looking at the bottom side of the cargo floor.  You should see the two metric 15mm nuts that secure the striker bracket to the floor of the Cherokee.  This bracket holds the hatch closed.  A tow hitch bracket or gas tank skid plate may block your access to the striker nuts. If you can see the nuts, use a metric socket and socket wrench to remove the nuts securing the striker plate.  The hatch should now swing open.  You can now reinstall the striker to the floor and retighten the two nuts. 

Method Three: For hatches with the plastic handle this problem may occur because of extreme heat. Spray the handle with cold water to cool the area and the hatch will then open.

Method Four: If rear hatch is stuck closed, sit in the cargo area and remove the plastic trim cover on the inside of the rear hatch to access and adjust/repair the latch mechanism. If hatch is unable to be closed remove the plastic trim with hatch raised. 
The plastic cover on the inside of the rear hatch is attached with four Phillips #2 screws along the inside top and 4 more along the sides (2 each side) and approximately 10 snap fasteners spaced around the inside. The 4 screws at inside top are accessible from inside the vehicle, the 2 screws on either side are not accessible when the hatch is closed.

To remove the plastic cover:

(1) Remove the 4 screws at the top.
(2) Along the lower edge of the rear window, using your fingers, gently pry the edge of the plastic cover away until the 4 snap fasteners pop free along the lower edge of the rear window. You will have to pull the plastic about 3 inches from the window before the fasteners release.
(3) This will allow you to pry the plastic cover open far enough use a flashlight and examine the latch mechanism.
(4) Reach in and down and manually pull the latch lift bar up to release the latch and open the hatch.

Once the hatch is open you can remove the side screws, pry the rest of the snap fasteners free and completely remove of the plastic trim cover on many Cherokees.  1997 thru 2001 Cherokees have an inner hatch grab handle that requires a T30 Torx socket wrench bit to remove.  Pry the little rectangular cover off of each end of the grab handle.  Use the T30 Torx bit to remove two screws that secure the handle.  Once the handle is removed the tailgate plastic trim panel can be fully removed.  

Now that you have the hatch open, the plastic trim removed, and can access the working parts, lightly lubricate the hatch handle mechanism and the locking mechanism with some Lithium grease. Inspect both mechanisms for misadjusted or loose connections. Rod connecting latch and handle can be adjusted at this time. Mark where the threaded end of the rod connects to the metal arm moved by the handle. Unclip the retaining clip that attaches the end of the threaded rod to the mechanism. Use a needle nose pliers to pull it out. Now reattach such that the rod has less play, and clip the retaining clip back in place. Apply a small amount of spray lubricant on the external parts of the latch.  

Finally, test the tailgate for proper function and reinstall the plastic trim panel and any other parts that were removed.

{{BookCat}}

PROBLEM:
Rear hatch won't close because lock mechanism is stuck (sprung) in closed position while hatch is open preventing the closure of the hatch.

RESOLUTION:

This problem usually happens when hatch is slammed shut.
The hatch won't close because part of the lock mechanism is stuck in closed position while hatch is actually open.
There is an easy fix that doesn't require forcing any of the components of the lock.
While holding the rear hatch handle in open position (lift handle up) - use screw driver to lightly push the lock mechanism down (not up).
It will reset easily - feather touch.
If you don't hold rear hatch handle open (up) - it will not reset.
Don't force anything because it may be a different problem that I have described.

== Basic Assumptions ==
{{TOC right}}
This  section was created as to permit the analysis of hypothetical situations that one, and possibly an indeterminate number of people, may face when faced with general survival situation, in a somewhat insulated set-up. Stranded in a what may be an uninhabited remote place (e.g. an island, new unexplored landmass, specific will covered to provided for any plausible alternative) that has may have edible vegetation and possibly animal life. 

Do not automatically assume that access exist to any man-made objects other than (perhaps) the clothes on ones back, a common objects most people carry around in daily life. As we covered in previous sections, it may make note of small advantages given by items and knowledge that you may and should have on your person (such as pens, paper, keys, the contents of your wallet and so on), but will not require these elements. When standing next to a wreck (plane, car, ship or bus), consider it a major bonus and a source of useful material.

==Immediate Survival==
===Your safety first===
Before anything else, make sure you are safe and well. That means making sure the ground is stable and that nothing is about to fall on you, that you are physically well and that any situation-specific hazards have been taken care of (e.g. the boat is not about to capsize, the plane that you may have crashed in is not on fire or that you are not in it).

====Others====
If you were injured, assess the gravity of the situation and call for help, don't move unless you are forced to, don't make demands of others or be hysteric, if it hurts scream, consider that others will only help you if you are indeed in need of help. As others can be useful to you, you are also useful to others. If among strangers take in consideration that this will be your first impression on them.

For those who are conscious, obtain name, current physical/emotional state and any important information (medical conditions, allergies, etc.).  Keep track of this information for future reference. Write it down if you can, this information will be useful for future relations and decision making. Avoid adding in writing any personal remarks or negative observations, if you need to do it in a short-form code that you understand by that others reading it will not take offense or use it against you at a later date. Keeping a log of events is extremely useful not only to keep one's sanity but for future rescuers, at times it can even serve as a distraction from an asher reality. It can even be the basis for a best selling book, plenty of examples abound.

Other survivors are a resource, sharing the same goal, but also rely on the few resources available. So after you attend to your personal safety you should determine how many people are with you (naturally, if you are still doing [[wikipedia:Triage|triage]] you may want to hold off on the headcount, as you may have less people later if adequate medical attention cannot be provided), and if they need immediate help. Don't put yourself at risk of injuries, at this point you are on your own, no social structure exists, be as helpful as you can without entering in conflicts and becoming emotional, the other survivors are strangers to you, assess priorities according to how useful others will be to you later on. Don't give orders, but request help and work in tandem by joining efforts with other fit survivors to bring safety to all.

====Shelter====
Finding or making shelter is important because it allows a person to stay protected from the elements, and even wildlife. Depending on the environment shelter may be the number one priority.

There are however two major possibilities where the threat of the environment may not be readily apparent:
# Warm or arid environment.
# Cyclic environment (day/night or winter/summer).
# Contaminated or radiated environment.

A warm climate may feel relatively comfortable, but it may also cause you to lose a lot of body fluid - if water is not nearby this could be dangerous and shade would be a good idea.

Cyclic environments may surprise you with storms or vastly different conditions during day and night or summer and winter. However you may find warning hints to this in the environment itself - if dead leaves cover the ground its because cold winter comes around every year or if the air is not very moist it can mean rapid changes in temperature come nightfall or dawn etc..

If the environment is partially dangerous be careful with the food and water you take in even if it means going hungry and watch the wildlife for signs something is wrong. If a place makes you feel even slightly bad leave it for a vastly different kind of place, for instance you might go from low grounds to higher grounds or the other side of a mountain.

The next priority after finding shelter is water.

====Water====
It is your most critical resource as a human may potentially survive only hours without water, but easily days or a month without food. The length of survival mostly depends upon climate conditions and physical exertion.

Water may usually be obtained from places of condensation like mountain tops and glaciers, vegetation or deep from the ground through wells.

Procuring resources may also help elevate you to a position of leadership through your obvious contribution and the trust it creates or through the raw power the resources give you. From this position you can then continue to help the group.

If the weather is harsh for instance because of arid conditions consider sleeping in the shadow in the day and working and traveling only at night.

If the water may be contaminated fresh but potentially poisonous fluid may be obtained from plants and animals, water may be filtered through old and flayed clothes or water may be boiled for 10 minutes.

====Food====
Food is also essential for survival. This is especially important during winter, as one has higher calorie-burning needs. 

After a while food begins to claim your attention. You want to be ready before that if possible since it may take time to grow crops or find the non-poisonous fruits.
Remember that finding one nut is not the same as feeding the entire group for an extended period of time. You need to find and secure a large area for foraging or a slightly smaller area for growing foods.

For longterm survival you will need to get to know the area and environment, in the short-term you may be able to hunt or gather plants for feeding.
Plants may be poisonous, to test this use the look, rub, taste and eat procedure:

# Look at the plant - does it look fresh and are other animals willing to eat it? If not do not eat it.
## a Bright warning colors may also indicate a poisonous plant.
# Rub a small amount of sample on your skin.
## a Observe the patch for minimum 3 hours, if there is any discomfort or rash do not eat it.
# Now you may taste a small piece of the plant, do not eat or swallow.
## If the plant tastes foul, bitter or just a little strongly - do not eat it.
# You may now eat a small bit of the plant.
## Wait 8 hours minimum and if there is no discomfort you may try larger portions.

Do not let the group eat the same unknown plants, if you must get yourselves poisoned by your ignorance there is still no reason to kill or discomfort everybody at the same time - although it surely would seem hilarious in those last flower induced death.

====Other resources====

===== Moral =====
It should not be overlooked what the will to live means in a life and death situation. Stories of heroic feats of survival by regular people with little or no training are not uncommon. Even with a strong understanding of the way we may be mentally affected, even a trained survival expert may feel the crushing effects of psychological strain during duress.

Understanding the effects of stress will reveal that while it may not always seem like it, stress is a necessary evil and belongs not only for malice but for good as well. It serves as a measuring stick for our success, it presents one with challenges, and it is a good way to show us how far we can bend and not break.

Reality sometimes has a nice way of pointing out that things could indeed be much worse. On the flip side of the coin too much stress can be a awful thing. The carnage that stress can breed within a human being is almost without limits. Too much stress can lead to forgetfulness, increased propensity to making mistakes, lessened energy, outbursts of rage, and carelessness.

Emotions are hard wired into our brains. Survival situations are bound to invoke strong emotional reactions from anyone involved. There are a few emotions that most often accompany this type of event. They drastically lessen our ability to combat the situation. It is not something that initially comes to mind when thinking of surviving but they are as important as any other survival skill.

There are 6 emotions that must be overcome to allow a chance at survival and have a good time, in general.
;Fear : Once placed into a survival situation one of the initial reactions for anyone is fear. It is a perfectly normal reaction, however fear is the enemy. It drastically lessens our ability to make clear decisions, which ultimately will lessen the chance for survival. In an effort to minimize our fears, we can train in realistic situations to condition ourselves to have the mentality needed to increase our confidence and more effectively manage fear. 
;Anxiety : Typically anxiety and fear run hand in hand with one another. It may start as a uneasy feeling in the pit of our stomach but by the time the mind is added into the situation it may quickly spiral out of control. Anxiety will oftentimes take over the mind and quickly make it difficult to make decisions with any clarity. Anxiety must be fought through in order to focus on the tasks at hand. Typically once some of the critical survival needs have been met, anxiety will be easier to keep at bay.
;Anger : It is inevitable that in a survival situation there are going to be problems. With the endless possibilities of things that can go wrong and probably will, to imagine that tempers may flair should not come as a surprise. Anger can sap one’s drive necessary to want to survive. Finding other ways to channel this emotion will prove more useful than losing ones temper. 
;Depression : An overall sense of malaise is not uncommon in wilderness. Being alone in the wilderness trying to survive is almost certainly bound to bring about a depressed state. Overwhelming depression can lead to the body shutting down and not unlike anxiety can also cause a human being to give up hope. Staying positive can allow one to combat this. 
;Guilt : Often accompanying a survival situation is loss of life. The guilt may not even come from someone taking responsibility for the person’s death, rather a sense of guilt as they are alive and the other person is dead. 
;Boredom (and Loneliness) : An often unanticipated side effect of being in a survival situation. Boredom and loneliness can both contribute to lowering morale. It is important to be able to keep your mind busy and your spirits up. It may be one of the most critical skills to survive.

==The first steps of building a social structure==

===The Roster ===
For future reference, and in case of an emergency, you need to find out who your &quot;go-to&quot; guys/girls are. You will need to figure out who are your fighters, who your nature boys and girls are, and the smart guys/girls. Considering your position you may be one of the above mentioned three.

'''A fighter''' would be a person who is skilled in some kind of combat, any kind of weapon (if you have any such weapons) or is just a relatively strong/able person. You'll need him/her to help keep watch over the camp at night, scout the island, and just handle any kind of danger to the rest of the population.

'''A nature boy/girl''' is a person who understands nature and is used to working in the wild. The nature boy/girl should have knowledge of animal behavior, plants, and wilderness survival. You'll need  him/her to find food, help organize the camp site and in many cases the nature people can be just as useful for the camp's defense as the fighter.

'''The smart boy/girl''' is necessary to the group just as the mind is necessary to the body. The smart person or persons should have a vast knowledge in engineering and technology, and can design and build just about anything the group needs. You'll need the smart people to help build the camp as well as to eventually find a way to get back home (if that appears to be possible - this manual does not guarantee such an occurrence).


Although less important, it may be helpful for future reference to know who does not have any any of the above three traits. 

'''The unskilled laborer''' is anyone with no specialized survival skills for this situation, at least in the early days of rebuilding civilization, such as an accountant, lawyer, or nuclear physicist (at least until complicated finances, complex law, and nuclear power plants are rebuilt). These are common, and you are likely to have a couple in your group of survivors.  To keep them busy and to free up time for those with more important skills, these laborers should be used in tasks which are easy to teach but time consuming.  Primarily, they should be used for gathering firewood, gathering building materials, and testing edible plants (as explained in the Food section), after given specific instructions on how to acomplish these tasks, by those with knowledge regarding those subjects.

===Scouting the Area===
After the incident is over (the plane crash, shipwreck, etc...) and all the injured are being taken care of, the first thing you need to do as leader is to put together scout team(s) to gather knowledge of the area, to find ways to gather things in the area such as food (fruit, vegetables, edible animals, etc.), water, possible building materials for the future and to look for any nearby dangers. If you have a useful skill or trait (like being able to identify plants or being relatively strong), you may want to join the scout team. The scout team may also find something important that may or may not be beneficial to the group: like an aggressive tribe or a hidden hatch, either way it is important to mark all things of that nature. 

It may be useful to mark the path you take (trailblazing), so that the scouting party can find the base camp again (rather than getting lost further and further away from base camp, or getting stuck going around and around a big circle).
Also, if you find something useful that cannot immediately be carried back to camp by the scout team, the trail marks can help you find it again.

Reminder: Always use the [[wikipedia:Buddy system|buddy system]] when leaving the camp, and tell others where you are going and (if possible) roughly when you plan to return.

===Setting Up the Base Camp===
While the scouts are looking for food and materials, those left at the camp should start by trying to create a camp fire. The fire is needed: to keep the camp illuminated at night, (depending on where one is) to keep warm when it gets cold, also to ward away aggressive animals.  As an added bonus it will create a large amount of smoke that could get the attention of nearby ships and planes. If you are fortunate the ship/plane you came in on may have some dry matches left behind. If the wreck you came in on is extremely serious you may want to use the broken parts as fire burning material however you may want to leave the plane/ship alone on the off chance you can repair it later (Note: this assumes that you have access to a ship/plane wreck. This manual does not guarantee that.). If your skill sets involve building or cooking then you may want to stay to set up camp.

Rather than have the one person who knows how to tie knots do all the knot-tying from now on, encourage that person to teach everyone the more useful knots.

Another idea, once the camp is established and the immediate necessities taken care of.  A base perimeter should be made.  Think of this as a safe zone from animals, who may try to steal your food, or other predators (man or animal).  

Find the highest ground available, and set-up a signal fire, ready to be set a blaze at the first sign of rescue.  You may also use that mirror from the make-up compact now to reflect light at the cockpit of the vessel you see.

===Organizing Supplies===
That is, stockpiling weapons and ammunition you may have, storing spare parts and such (canteens, backpacks, paper, books, writing utensils, eating utensils, etc.), and so on. Part of this may include requisitioning supplies. DON'T FORCIBLY TAKE POSSESSIONS. People should contribute for the good of the group. Doing otherwise will not help you make friends and influence people. And having friends in this situation could save your life.

A better way to put this is to take a an inventory. Your wife's mirror in her make-up compact has now just become a signal mirror and 1/2 of a periscope.  Nothing is insignificant, and when there is no WalMart nearby, nothing should be wasted.

This may be better served being done immediately after taking a health assessment of the group.  As stated before, all contributions should be voluntary, while explaining that there is power in numbers and sharing resources, rather than &quot;strking out&quot; on one's own to fend as an individual.  Those who choose to remain independent and not share are simply nailing their own coffins shut.  Their choice is their own, remind them.

Lighters, pocket knives, keys, leather belts, strong prescription vision glasses, all now have alternate uses for survival.

== Later Days and Secondary Projects ==
After having a basic campsite built with roofed shelters, a campfire going (with the necessary fuel to maintain it), water security (even storage) and there is an organized method of collecting or hunting for food, you may notice that there is a large increase in down time. Although it is good for your fellow castaways to get their rest, too much downtime can lead to depression, boredom, hopelessness and possibly a dangerous amount of unrest. It may sound mean but the leader must keep the castaways busy to reduce the problems mentioned above. A wise man once said “if you can give a man one thing give him something to love, if you can't do that give him something to hope for, and if you can't even give him that, give him something to do” this saying can mean a lot in this kind of situation.

The effort and planing may depend on the situation, specific project and resources, consider the urgency and expenditures before selecting a new task. 

=== Extended Exploration ===
After things have settled down, you may wish to conduct extended exploratory trips to gain information about your surroundings. This could mean, but does not necessary implies a travel by sea, week-long hiking trips, and so forth.

=== Governance ===
Governance is about establishing and maintaining a lasting leadership structure. Even if you have a fairly small group of people (say, less than 10), you may need a form of official government. This goes especially if the group is anything but close friends. Its tempting to think we are evolved enough to do everything by consensus and there is no need for the rigidity of formal structures. Keep in mind that once people settle into a habit they develop a certain resistance to any change so while getting that water may seem really important right now, this issue is no less immediate.

Leadership is absolutely essential for survival (short-term and longterm), without it there won't be any rebuilding of civilization as much as there will be back to scratch. Leadership, mind you, does not mean that a guy is in command; if you end up putting the emotionally charged but charismatic/strong fool in the seat you might as well have anarchy.

Giving power to the alpha males and/or females of the group means the quieter voices don't get a fair say. Structure does not have to mean hierarchy. Of course democracy creates politics but until we are all in perfect harmony it is the best system possible.

The &quot;leader&quot; doesn't have to have dictatorial powers though, but he may be the guy who is told to think on a plan while the rest scouts and take responsibility for the outcome. One should try not to get too much status from the function and think of it as a necessary duty, even sacrifice for maintaining social order and moral in face of failure.

Governance is a *hard problem* as proved by the struggle so many countries, communities and societies have with it.  Democracy has however evolved and there are some good new styles of democracy which would work well in a community.

Most people know only two kinds of system, the one where the strongest are in command or the one with the more popular guy (democracy) - considering your situation the prevalent system structure may have proved to be catastrophically flawed, maybe you should adopt a new one.

One such style is Direct democracy which comprises a form of democracy and theory of civics wherein all citizens can directly participate in the decision-making process.  Direct democracy in its traditional form is rule by the people through referendum. The people are given the right to pass laws, veto laws and withdraw support from a representative (if the system has representatives) at any time.

The main objection to Direct Democracy is that deciding all or most matters of public importance by direct referendum is slow and expensive, and can result in public apathy and voter fatigue.  The solution to this is Delegated Democracy.

In delegated democracy all people have a vote on all issues as with direct democracy but they can delegate their vote in any area to any other person.  If I vote on a topic my vote is counted if I do not bother to vote and I have delegated votes in that field to someone else then my vote is added to their tally.

Some examples:
- Nina is a great cook and nutritionist and I trust her with regards to running the kitchen and feeding us.  Therefore I delegate my votes on food buying and cooking to Nina thus if there is ever the need to vote in this area Nina will cast my vote on my behalf.
- My friend Naoise knows a lot about money and is trustworthy and I think has a good balance between investing and being too cautions. I would delegate my investment votes to him in most instances. 
- If friends decided to delegate their votes to me on certain areas where I feel confident (community, governance :-), education) I would be honored to vote on their behalf.

Remember you can always still vote yourself and you can always move your vote from one person if you feel they no longer adequately represent you.

Inventing a new system (one that has not been tested so far) is a very hard preposition but making a point may be required, to do so use science, when the group has time to spare organize two equal teams with each their command structure/command rules and see who wins at at a friendly game - work from there.

Indeed more importantly the system you begin now may stand for the next hundred years, think of your responsibility to the future and the precedence you set for it.

== Communal Living ==
Living communally was the first social structure that emerged from human social interactions, it can be beautiful but it has its costs in terms of restriction to individual freedoms. In a fully participated community the good of the many will always surpass the good of the few. Yet the alternative of each of us living alone and alienated is just as unsatisfactory. For tens of thousands of years humans lived together in tribes. Mimicking small scale biologic evolution, from single cell to multiple cell animals these social structures arose from the benefits to the survival of individuals in a hostile environment, permitting large gains and opening the door to specialization and the conquering of the environment.

The cornerstone of any organisms is reproduction, an extension of the biologic imperative for the survivability of the gene-pool. Even today the basic social unit is still the family. The sixties and seventies with the a sexual revolution and civil freedoms saw the first wave of experimental modern communes, a rediscovering of the tribal life. Many of these failed as individuals had become acculturated to a different set of priorities and appealing ideologies that had started to arise from in the 20's (World War 1) that were only possible in a industrialized and consumerist society. The reasons for failure in this attempt to revive more closely netted social structures are many. Competition with the outside, the legal frameworks had evolved toward a different structure permitting and empowering complex politic power games, endangering established hierarchies and ownership structures.  

Living communally is more efficient in all regards, the imperative to share, save and to think ahead to needs of future generations emerges as part of the mutual preservation spirit, something that has been lost in the present mainstream social setup that is mostly about the selfish self to a point that it is putting our Planet's at risk, especially in face of the demographic pressures created by industrialized lifestyles that have lost any contact with the natural world. 

In a community an appliance can be shared among many people - do 20 people really need 20 dishwashers.  We can share cooking, cleaning, childcare and can create together.

=== Ownership ===
After watching many communes go down the tubes and seeing past effort go to waste many are understandably reluctant to commit energy and money to something without a clear idea of what might happen to it.  This is what makes communal ownership so important. 

If the commune is incorporated as a Limited Liability Partnership all those involved in it can legally have a share of it.  That way if one wishes to leave one can sell out or if it does not work and needs to be wound up any assets will be shared out among those who contributed.

==Suggested Projects==
=== [[/Plant crops/|Plant crops]] ===

=== Shifting cultivation ===
 
Shifting cultivation here means the cultivation of hominids and crops for human consumption on freshly burned vegetation area or forest within a fewer number of years than the time that area is left to natural regeneration.&lt;Ref&gt;Conklin H.C. 1961, The Study of Shifting Cultivation If Current Anthropology, vol. 2, no. 1, Chicago.&lt;/Ref&gt;
 
This is the oldest form of food production as proto humans have developed it over millions of years. During this long span of time, shifting cultivation developed into a complex process, requiring the coordinated interaction of larger groups of people. This way of life can be traced back to Africa and / or China, where the forerunners of Homo erectus (the erect man) had a nascent rise more than five million years ago. Later they spread out across the world, including northern Europe, less than one million years ago. But it is much less than one million years ago that Homo sapiens (the man who knows and can) came from Africa to Eurasia. They were knowledgeable and experienced people already. Shifting cultivation is highly community-forming. The smallest unit was the clan – the cultivation team – and often several clans would cooperate with one another. The manager, or Kuningas, had many functions. It was not only practical, but also political and religious. Cultivation was mobile; the clan moved to new forests to burn and grow food crops. They had no monumental construction. It is therefore difficult to trace them archaeologically, even from the study of Terra Preta (charcoal-rich soil). The swidden ranged from single ones onsite to periodic settlements, punctuated by moderately long abandonment. This rest period was required for necessary forest regrowth. Surveys of mountain caves and other natural settlements have revealed many cultural layers upon one another with natural forest regrowth in between. This stratigraphy indicates cultural development. Here in random order I will mention a few such places: Catalhöyük in Turkey, Altamira in northern Spain, Jericho in Israel, Kostenki Voronezh in Russia, Skara Brea on Orkeney, and the cave Vistehola at Jæren in Norway.
 
Nowadays we are accustomed to excess in stationary conditions. We are trained and raised in the European tradition, which considered shifting cultivation as a simple, primitive form of life without significant cultural organization. This attitude is probably the reason why researchers have thoroughly investigated shifting cultivation. There are many characterizing features of shifting cultivation that are widely considered “primitive” and “self-taught”.
 
They were nomads who want to have a few things to carry, for their skill and knowledge was not a heavy load. '''Shifting cultivation is the foundation of today's society: our values, customs, ideas, and conventions.''' 
Arable farming is too young to have influenced the development of mankind's history to any significant degree, yet we still feel its effects in our daily lives. The declining tropical rainforest is the site of most of today’s shifting cultivation practices.
 
“The oldest of all farming methods is shifting cultivation. It has been in Sweden since old times and it seems to permeate every subject the further back in time we go. It is the oldest of all cultivation systems, at least in forested areas” ref&gt;Arenander E.O. 1923, Germanemas jordbrukskultur ornkring KristifØdelse // Berattelse over Det Nordiska Arkeologmotet i Stockholm 1922, Stockholm. &lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Kauran Karjalan ahoille, Rukeheni Ruotsin maalle, -Vehnät viskoan Virohon - Kylvän ohrat Suomen maalle - Hernehet Hämehen maalle - Jost Vilja virtoavi - Vilja vierahan kätehen&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Kaukonen V. 1984, Elias Lonnrotin Kanteletar, SKS, Helsinki.110&lt;/ref&gt;; Oats in Karelia svedjer - Rye on Swedish land - Hveat returns Estonia – Barley grows on Suomi fields - peas on Hämä fields, - Here the grain flows, - The grain is always next.

The extended family was the normal social structure of the Vikings, &lt;ref&gt;Sjovold T. 1979, The Viking Ships in Oslo, Oslo. .&lt;/ref&gt; but has since become uncommon in most parts of the Nordic countries &lt;ref&gt;Winberg C. 1975, Folkøkning och proletarisering, Gøteborg. Wikipedia, oppslagsverk på intemett.&lt;/ref&gt; It has since remained where shifting cultivation was still the dominant means for nourishment, some still exist in some remote places in Karelia. &lt;ref&gt;Tornberg M. 1972, Storfamiljinstitusjonen i Finland II Nord-Nytt&lt;/ref&gt; (Eastern part of Finland where the Finns kicked out the Soviets communists, who tried to invade Finland, before the 2.WW.)

=== Multipurpose Center ===
If you are going to set up a village-type camp, it may prove beneficial to construct (or designate, in the case of a cave or natural open area) a large multipurpose center. This can be used for &quot;camp&quot; meetings, spirituality and organized sports and recreation activities (such as soccer or dancing).

      <text xml:space="preserve">AROSTCP is the TCP/IP stack of choice for AROS based computers.

It is a port of the AmigaOS AmiTCP TCP/IP subsystem to AROS by Neil Cafferkey.

Since its initial port it has undergone a number of changes based on work by AROS developers, as well as backported changes from the MorphOS port (Pavel Fedin - SonicAmiga) it spawned.

==AROSTCP Files==

AROS has a Network prefs located in the Prefs directory. Please use it to set up internet/ethernet use.

AROSTCP is located in 'Extras/Networking/Stacks/'. It consists of the following directories and files:

'''C/''' contains networking executables, mostly as known from UNIX/Linux.

 AROSTCP
  The AROSTCP executable. Don't run directly, use startnet/stopnet instead (see below).
 arp
 dhclient
 hostname
 ifconfig
 logger
 ping
 resolve
 route

'''S/''' contains start and stop scripts
 Package-Startup
 startnet
 stopnet

'''db/''' contains configuration files, see [[Aros/User/Networking#AROSTCP_Configuration_Database|AROSTCP Configuration Database]].
 general.config
 group
 hosts
 inet.access
 inetd.conf
 interfaces
 netdb
 netdb-myhost
 netdb-myhost.example
 networks
 passwd
 protocols
 services
 static-routes

==AROSTCP Environment Variables==

AROSTCP uses a few Env: settings to control its most basic operation.

Currently the following options exist..

  '''SYS/Packages/AROSTCP'''
                   
                   This is an [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/AROSAppPackages AROS package file] which tells the AROS package subsystem where
                   AROSTCP is installed.  If it is incorrect AROSTCP will fail to load.
                   During system boot this variable is used to set up paths and
                   assigns needed by an application.

  '''AROSTCP/Config'''
                   
                   Points to the location of AROSTCP's configuration files.
                   These will be used to configure the stack to a users preference.
                   By default the configuration is in &lt;AROSTCP DIR&gt;/db but it is
                   preferred to copy these files and customise them to suit -
                   see &quot;AROSTCP Configuration Database&quot;

  '''AROSTCP/AutoRun'''  
                   
                   when set to true this causes the AROSTCP stack to load during boot.
                   by default it isn't enabled so that users may manually configure the stack
                   and confirm it is working before enabling boot time operation.  
                   
                   '''If you don't use the AutoRun feature you should start AROSTCP by going'''  
                   '''to its directory and typing &quot;execute s/startnet&quot;'''


[[Image:AROSTCP-Warning.jpg]] Presently the SetEnv command wont make the AROSTCP drawers to store the settings in - so you may need to manually create them before hand using

    &gt;makedir ENV:AROSTCP
    &gt;makedir ENVARC:AROSTCP

==AROSTCP Configuration Database==
===Configuration Database Location(s)===
The Configuration files are installed to &quot;&lt;AROSTCP DIR&gt;/db&quot; by default - and unless the &quot;AROSTCP/Config&quot; Env variable is set, AROSTCP will attempt to load them from there.

It is preferable however to leave these files, and customize a copy which will not get overwritten when updating AROS/AROSTCP. From hereon in we will refer to this location as &lt;db Dir&gt;.

To do this enter the following at a shell prompt..

     &gt;cd &lt;AROSTCP DIR&gt;
     &gt;makedir &lt;db Dir&gt;
     &gt;copy db &lt;db Dir&gt; ALL
     &gt;SetEnv SAVE AROSTCP/Config &lt;db Dir&gt;

.. substituting &lt;AROSTCP DIR&gt; with the location AROSTCP is installed to (for instance &quot;SYS:Extras/Networking/AROSTCP&quot; by default), and &lt;db Dir&gt; with a location of your choice for your personalised config files (i.e. &quot;SYS:Storage/NetConfig&quot;).

===Customising the Configuration Database===

Most modern home networks provide DHCP addressing/configuration to ease setup of internet access for users. If you use this on your network - or arent sure then this is the configuration option you should most likely use.

For more advanced/experienced users there is manual ip configuration for a brief summary of configuration options required to get AROSTCP working with custom IP address etc.

====Basic Configuration - DHCP ====

AROS has a Network prefs located in the Prefs directory. Please use it to set up internet/ethernet use.


====Basic Configuration - Manual IP ====

AROS has a Network prefs located in the Prefs directory. Please use it to set up internet/ethernet use.


At a bare minimum the following files will need to be edited to enable operation on your network.

  &lt;db Dir&gt;/interfaces
  &lt;db Dir&gt;/static-routes
  &lt;db Dir&gt;/netdb-myhost

These will provide the necessary information to allow AROSTCP to correctly configure your hardware and network environment.

=====&lt;db Dir&gt;/interfaces=====

This file contains lines to configure the network hardware on your system. each line consists of the following:
  &lt;interface name&gt; DEV=&lt;hardware driver&gt; UNIT=&lt;hardware driver unit no.&gt; &lt;further configuration data&gt;

i.e.

  eth0 DEV=pcnet32.device UNIT=0 IP=192.168.0.10 UP

Would provide an interface named &quot;eth0&quot; which uses unit 0 of pcnet32.device (PCNet32 compatible controllers), configures it for the IP address 192.168.0.10, and sets the device to go active (UP) immediately.

=====&lt;db Dir&gt;/static-routes=====

At the moment this file only provides the IP address of your gateway device (DEFAULT GATEWAY) - so make sure and change it to suit your network.

You can add any routes your network needs to this file.

=====&lt;db Dir&gt;/netdb-myhost=====

netdb-myhost provides name resolution details for your network environment.  If your IP address' DNS name cannot be resolved from the nameservers, then you will need to specify it in here.

presently the following data is needed:

  HOST 192.168.0.10 thisarosbox.mynetwork thisarosbox

specifies the hostname for the interface we configured in &lt;db Dir&gt;/interfaces which has the IP address 192.168.0.10

  DOMAIN mynetwork 192.168.0.

This is the network our machine belongs to.

  NAMESERVER 192.168.0.2

The NAMESERVER option lets us specify DNS servers which AROSTCP will use to resolve names (such as www.aros.org)

depending on your configuration this will be set to one of the following -:
# Your private network's DNS servers IP
# Your routers IP address if it can forward DNS requests
# DNS server address's provided by your ISP.

N.B: It is perfectly legal to list more than one NAMESERVER line for multiple DNS servers.

====Basic Configuration - Linux hosted: tap.device====

To be able to use networking under AROS Linux hosted, a &quot;tap.device&quot; has been created,
which attaches a Linux tunneling device on the hosting machine to AROSTCP inside the
hosted AROS system.

=====Linux Tap/Tun Configuration=====

You need 'tunctl' to create a tunneling network device under Linux.
You might need to install it - it can be found e.g. as part of the uml-utilities package.

A command line to create the device might look like this:

  tunctl -b -u arosuser -t aros0

This allows a user called 'arosuser' access to a newly created network device called 'aros0'.

Next, assign an IP address to the device, and bring it up:

  ifconfig aros0 192.168.0.20
  ifconfig aros0 up

tunctl also creates a linux filesystem entry, e.g. /dev/net/tun (see tunctl help for more), 
you might need to set access privileges for your user, e.g.:

  chmod 666 /dev/net/tun

This allows read and write access for all users.

Now you're ready to run AROS.

Finally, after running AROS and starting AROSTCP, you might need to set a route to the hosted AROS system.
Use the IP address from your &lt;db Dir&gt;/interfaces configuration (e.g. 192.168.0.188):

  route add -host 192.168.0.188 dev aros0

=====AROSTCP Configuration for tap.device=====

The general configuration is done as usual (see section [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/User/Networking#Basic_Configuration_-_Manual_IP Basic Configuration - Manual IP]).

Use these values where appropriate:

* &lt;db Dir&gt;/interfaces : &quot;tap.device&quot; should be used as the interface device driver. The unit number is the same as the Linux network device's number that was created with tunctl.
* &lt;db Dir&gt;/static-routes : The DEFAULT GATEWAY Address to be used is the IP address of the tunneling device under Linux.

====Advanced Configuration====

To be written ..

==AROSTCP Supported Platforms==

AROSTCP has been successfully compiled and tested on the following systems-:

* x86 32bit 
* x86 64bit 
* SAM440EP

====Efika====

==Network Troubleshooting==
===Configuration and Basic connectivity issues===
====Check your environment====
Before doing anything, its best to check AROSTCP has the correct ENV settings

  # Check the package file ENV:SYS/Packages/AROSTCP points to the location
    AROSTCP is installed to.
  
  # Check that ENV:AROSTCP/ exists
  # Check if ENV:AROSTCP/Config is set and points to your network config.
  # Check if the ENV:AROSTCP/AutoRun option is set and disable to manually test.

After checking, change to the directory AROSTCP is installed to and type

  &gt;execute s/startnet

AROSTCP should now load, and return you to the command prompt.

====Check your Interfaces====
Now you may wish to verify your network card is operational using

  &gt;ifconfig -a

which should output something similar to the following

  lo0: flags=8&lt;LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 1536
          inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0x0
  eth0: flags=863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,SIMPLEX&gt; mtu 1500
          address: 00:0c:29:37:ef:6d
          inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255

Look for the &quot;UP&quot; flag which will tell you if your interface is running,
and if not check if inet = 0.0.0.0.  If this is the case AROSTCP likely
couldn't load the driver for your interface so check your interfaces file
is configured correctly for your hardware.

If there is a correct inet address but the interface isn't &quot;UP&quot; - try the
following command.

  &gt;ifconfig &lt;the interface name .. i.e. eth0&gt; &lt;the inet address to use&gt; UP

Then check your interfaces again.
====Check your Gateway====
If your connected to the internet via a router its IP address should be
stored in &lt;db Dir&gt;/static-routes.

We can check if its working by trying to ping it 

  &gt;ping &lt;ip address of gateway/router&gt;

Which should respond and inform us of received packets (ones sent back)

If you do not get packets back then check your cabling is correct.

The next step requires an external IP address (i.e. one from an internet based site)
here I will use www.yahoo.com's current IP [69.147.114.210]

  &gt;ping 69.147.114.210

Again, you should get packets received from this operation signaling success.

If it returns &quot;no route to host&quot;, you may have an incorrect setting in db/static-routes or an incorrectly configured interface - so please check.

====Check Name resolution====

DNS server s are stored in your &lt;db Dir&gt;/netdb-myhost file

To test they are working simply ping an external site by name ..

  &gt; ping www.yahoo.com

And you should get returned packets.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Atoms===
The atom was, until comparatively recently, thought to be the fundamental building block of matter, and for the purposes of this textbook, we will treat it as though it were. 

The atom consists of three types of particles: the electron, the proton, and the neutron. 

The protons and the neutrons are contained within a very small amount of volume in the center of the atom called the ''nucleus''. Protons have a net positive charge of 1 ''e'', where ''e'' is the fundamental unit of charge, equal to about &lt;math&gt;1.6\times10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt; coulombs. Neutrons have no net electric charge and are very slightly more massive than a proton.

Electrons are in orbit around the nucleus of the atom, and have a net negative charge of -1''e''. Their mass is much less than that of the proton and neutron, and so the electrons are generally left out when determining the mass of an atom.

The electrons are, in microscopic terms, astonishingly distant from the nucleus. If we take a hydrogen atom (1 electron and 1 proton) to be about an angstrom in diameter (1 angstrom is &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; meters), then the approximate diameter of the nucleus is &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;m.
In more familiar terms, if the nucleus was an inch in diameter, the first electron would be about 830 feet away.

'''Masses'''

Proton:  &lt;math&gt;1.6726\times10^{-27}&lt;/math&gt;kg

Neutron: &lt;math&gt;1.6749\times10^{-27}&lt;/math&gt;kg

Electron:&lt;math&gt;9.1094\times10^{-31}&lt;/math&gt;kg

'''Charges'''

Proton:  +1''e''

Electron:-1''e''

Neutron: ''0''

where ''e''=&lt;math&gt;1.6022\times10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt;C

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Fields===
When dealing with electromagnetic phenomena, it's very helpful to use the concept of a '''field'''.

In this context, we will consider a field to be an extended region of space where certain conditions apply to each and every point in that region. Generally, the strength of the conditions will vary depending on position within the field. The fields we will be discussing in this section of the text are electric and magnetic fields.



'''The Electric Field'''

We can define the electric field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; to be the electrical force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_e&lt;/math&gt; acting on a test charge with a net postive charge of &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;, or

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}\equiv \frac{\mathbf{F}_e}{q_0}&lt;/math&gt; (3)

Then, an electric field exists at a given point if, at that point, a test charge experiences an electric force. An electric field is measured in units of newtons per coulomb (N/C).
Note that a charged particle produces an electric field, and therefore, the test charge must be of very small magnitude so that we can safely ignore its effects on the larger field. The charged particle creating the electric field is called the '''source particle'''.

Now that we know the magnitude of the electric field at a given point, we can calculate the force on any particle with a charge of ''q'' at that point simply by rearranging equation 3:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_e=q \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; (4)

Consider a particle with charge ''q'' placed at a distance of ''r'' from our test charge with its charge of &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;. Then, by Coulomb's Law, the force exerted on the test particle is

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{12}=k_e\frac{qq_0}{r^2} \mathbf{\hat r}_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

and using equation (3), we can determine the electric field generated by the particle with charge ''q'' at the location of our test charge to be 

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=k_e\frac{q}{r^2} \mathbf{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt; (3)

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector pointing from ''q'' towards our test charge.

===Interpretation===

You might suppose that an electric field is just a mathematical device, and you may think it is pretty useless.  It certainly seems that way just looking at the field from a single, stationary point charge.  Why should we not just see what force it exerts on a particle and be done with it without going through an intermediate field?  What if we had 100 charged particles, and we wanted to know the force on another particle?  We could add up all the forces, or fields, it is really the same problem, but it is more convenient to factor out the q.  This is a relatively weak argument, because it's a just a little bit more convenient.

One real reason is that the equations for electrodyamics are very elegant when written in terms of E.  Another is that there is a magnetic force also, which it is useful to keep separate.  Finally, and probably most importantly, the electric field is real.  For example, there is energy associated with an electric field, which is completely independent of any force it provides.  There is also momentum stored in fields, and light is made up of these abstract fields, but light is real.  Even though we can't see the field, it is there because physical quantities depend on the field, so it seems; fields are more than just mathematical devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Electricity===


'''The Electric Force'''

Using the concepts of atoms and fields, we can begin our discussion of electric forces.

The first important idea is that of '''electric charge'''. An object can be said to have an electric charge if it has more protons than electrons, or vice-versa. If you rub a balloon on your hair, both the balloon and your hair will become charged, resulting in the balloon lifting up your hair in defiance of gravity. 

As we already discussed, there are two types of fundamental charged particles: the proton and the electron, with positive and negative charges, respectively. When you rub the balloon against your hair, one becomes positively charged and the other becomes negatively charged, as electrons are moved from one object to another. If you charge a glass rod by rubbing it with a piece of silk, you'll see that the silk is attracted to the glass rod. This is because electrons have been stripped off the glass and transferred to the silk, resulting in opposite charges. Furthermore, if you bring two similarly prepared glass rods in close proximity, you'll feel a repulsive force, as both objects have the same, net positive charge. From these observations, we can conclude that '''identical charges will repel each other and opposite charges will attract each other'''. 

There are only these two types of charge. We have never found a particle with a charge that is attracted or repelled by both positive and negative charges. 

This motion of charge from one object to another can also occur within a single object, where the motion of charge is called '''electrical conduction.''' An object that allows charges to move within it easily and without much resistance is called a '''conductor''', whereas an object that resists the motion of charges is called an '''insulator'''. In general, metals tend to be excellent conductors, which is why if you take apart a piece of electrical equipment, you'll see that the wires are all made of copper. You'll also see that they are coated with rubber, which is an excellent insulator, in order to make sure that the charges are moving in the proper direction, and that someone can touch the wires without receiving a shock.

There is another method to charge an object without direct contact, called '''charging by induction'''. This requires the concept of '''grounding'''. If a conductor is connected to the earth by another conductor, it is said to be grounded.  We can treat the earth as an infinite reservoir of charges, that is, we can give or take as many electrons as we want and the earth will not acquire any charge, as there are so many electrons in it. 
Consider an uncharged conducting sphere that is surrounded by an insulator so that it cannot be grounded. A negatively charged rod is brought near the sphere. The repulsive force on the electrons in the sphere will push them away from the side nearest the rod, leaving a net positive charge in that area. If we then ground the sphere, some of the electrons will leave the sphere, due to the repulsive force from the rod. If we then remove the ground, the sphere is left with an excess of positive charge. This positive charge will then redistribute uniformly over the sphere. 
Note that the negatively charged rod never actually touches the sphere, and therefore, loses none of its charge. Charging an object by induction requires no physical contact with the inducing object. 
If we then bring this positively charged sphere near, say, a neutral wall, we will find that our sphere will stick to the wall. This is because the net positive charge will cause the electrons to move towards the sphere, resulting in a net negative charge in a small region on the wall.

We can mathematically determine how strong the force of attraction or repulsion between two charged objects will be, and as it turns out, the electric force is proportional to the inverse square of the distace between the charges. If we have two charges, then the magnitude of the force  between them is given by 

&lt;math&gt;F_e=k_e\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt; (1)

where &lt;math&gt;k_e&lt;/math&gt; (the Coulomb constant) is equal to &lt;math&gt;8.9876\times10^9 N\cdot m^2\cdot C^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;, ''r'' is the distance between the objects in meters, and ''&lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;'' are the charges of the objects as measured in coulombs. This relation will then give the force and its direction in newtons. 

Note: The Coulomb constant can also be written as 

&lt;math&gt;k_e=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the '''permittivity of vacuum''', with a value of &lt;math&gt;8.8542\times10^{-12} C^2\cdot N^{-1}\cdot m^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  This notation is mainly for historic reasons and, as we will see, because the &lt;math&gt;4 \pi&lt;/math&gt; will cancel out somewhere else.  Why &lt;math&gt;4 \pi&lt;/math&gt;?  Because &lt;math&gt; 4 \pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the surface area of a sphere, and it will be useful to enclose a point charge in an imaginary sphere.

If we want the direction of the force in addition to its magnitude, Coulomb's Law becomes 

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{12}=k_e\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} \mathbf{\hat r}_{12}&lt;/math&gt; (2)

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is the force exerted by &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector directed from &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; towards &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, by Newton's Third Law, we can see that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, or the force exerted by &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to  &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{F}_{12}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To develop the electric potential (or voltage), begin with a single point charge, Q, at the origin, of charge q.  The electric field is 

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{kQ}{r^2} \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

The curl of this is easily shown to be zero, and by a well-known theorem of vector calculus, if the curl of a function vanishes over a region of space, then that function may be written as the gradient of a scaler.  Hence, there exists a scaler field, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, such that

&lt;math&gt;E(\mathbf r) = -\nabla \phi(\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt;.

We next find the work done by the field as it moves a test particle, q, from point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf b&lt;/math&gt;.   y the force field, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F =q\mathbf E&lt;/math&gt;.
If you do not know vector calculus, you can skip this paragraph and only remember the result, but I suggest you learn vector calculus (divergence, gradient, and curl) because all of electromagnetism is written with vector calculus notations.  The curl of E is zero (you may do this out).  This means that E can be written as the gradient of some scalar function, let us call it &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.  By the fundamental theorem of calculus (for gradients),

&lt;math&gt; \int q \nabla \phi(x,y,z) \cdot d{\mathbf{r}} = q \phi + C&lt;/math&gt;,

where C is an arbitrary constant.  This states that the work done by the electric force is simply the change in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; times the charge.  This should sound familiar -- &lt;math&gt;q\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the potential energy!  We specify &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; at one point, and it determines &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; uniquely, which is exactly the same as selecting a zero for gravitational potential energy.  Conventionally, we say &lt;math&gt;\phi(\inf) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, but this is not always true if the charge extends to infinity.  However, this only happens in bogus textbook problems, so in real life, it is always safe to say &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; drops off to zero at infinity.  We are allowed to select a reference point, because it is only the difference in potential energy we care about; there ''is'' no physical way to determine C, so we don't care what it is.

To generalize to anything more than a point charge is easy.  It is just the superposition of many point charges, and our result holds true for any distribution.

Now, it is conventional to say that &lt;math&gt;\nabla \phi&lt;/math&gt; is ''negative'' E, because it means things travel to lower potentials, and it cancels out a minus sign somewhere else.  Just watch out for this, and keep track of your minus signs.

To apply this to Coulomb's law, we just take the integral of the electric field and get the potential.  We stick on a minus sign for the convetion and we have,

&lt;math&gt;\phi_{point source} = \frac{kq}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

How simple.

There are two main advantages to using potential.  The first is that it will come in handy later when we want to solve Maxwell's equations, but the second reason is that it is a scalar, not a vector.  It is much easier to only remember one component instead of three.  You find the potential of a charge distribution, then take finding the E field is as easy as taking a derivative.

Potential is an interesting thing, because it is a scalar function, yet it uniquely represents a vector function, E, which has three times as many numbers!  Well, it just so happens that the three components of an electric field are not independent, because they are radially symmetric around a point charge, so the curl is zero.  This constraint is just enough to tell us that we only need one number to represent all three components of E.

I would like to point out that the potential only can be used (without modification) when the charges ''are not moving''.  If they move, then if a particle goes around in a circle, it may end up with more energy than it had before!

Gauss' Law relates the amount of charge contained within a volume to the electric flux passing through the surface of that volume. It was developed by [[Carl Fredric Gauss]], an 18th century mathematician. Electric flux can only truly be described by mathematics, but has an intuitive meaning as well. Essentially, electric flux is the amount of 'electric field' going through a surface. Think of a cage which is immersed in a flowing river, where the cage is meshed so that the water runs through it fairly unabated. The 'flux' is the amount of water passing through the cage's surface at any one moment. For this discussion we shall not concern ourselves with electric fields which change in time, so consider the electric flux to be constant in time.

When using Gauss' law we create something called a &quot;Gaussian surface&quot;, or just the &quot;Gaussian&quot;. A Gaussian is an imaginary surface which is completely enclosed.

Electric Flux
(Flux: field line flow)
Φ: how much field passes through a surface
S. Uniform Field (parallel field lines)
Φ=E A cos (theta)
Where theta is the angle measured between direction of field lines and direction for the normal to the surface.

    &lt;math&gt;\Phi_f = \int_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{dA}&lt;/math&gt;
where F is a vector field, dA is the area element of the surface S, directed as the surface normal, and Φf  is the resulting flux.
For a surface that encloses the field generator

Gauss' Law

    &lt;math&gt;\Phi = \oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = {1 \over \epsilon_o} \int_V \rho \cdot dV = \frac{Q_A}{\epsilon_o}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric field, &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the area of a differential square on the closed surface &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; with an outward facing surface normal defining its direction, &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}_A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; is the charge enclosed by the surface, &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; is the charge density at a point in &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;, &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_o&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; is the permittivity of free space and &lt;math&gt;\oint_S&lt;/math&gt; is the integral over the surface &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; enclosing volume &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;.

Capacitance (c)

Capacitance is a measure of the amount of electric charge stored (or separated) for a given electric potential. The capacitance is usually defined as the total electric charge placed on the object divided by the potential of the object:

        &lt;math&gt;C = \frac{Q}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

or, according to Gauss's law, the capacitance can be expressed as the electric flux per volt

       &lt;math&gt;C = \frac{\Phi}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

where

    C is the capacitance in farads
    Q is the charge in coulombs
    V is the potential in volts
    Φ is the electric flux associated with the charge Q in coulombs

Conductors have equal and opposite charge
[[Image:Dielectric.png]]


	The charge (aka current) is split up
Each capacitor will have part of the total charge that is available for the group (there is a certain amount of charge in each branch there will be charge and when you add the charge of the branches that will be the total charge.)
Voltage is split up
Each capacitor in series gets a part of the total available charge
	They all acquire the same voltage
Each parallelel branch gets the same voltage as all other
Total equivalent Capacitance 

    &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{total} = V \cdot \left(\frac{1} {R_1} + \frac{1} {R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1} {R_n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Binary is a counting system used by computers to do mathematics. Instead of using 0 to 9 as digits, it only uses 1s and 0s. This is because it is easier for a computer to represent numbers with only ones and zeroes (on and off) rather than with 10 different digits.

When you use normal numbers to do normal math, you are using what is called &quot;base ten.&quot;  In base ten, every time you get to 10 in a column you have to regroup to the next column.
Example:
Tens|Ones
     9
    +1
    __
    10   Regroup here.

In base ten, also known as decimal, each column has a &quot;place value&quot; 10 times the column to the right. For example, if there was a two in the tens column, that would be 2x10=20.  But the column to the left of the tens has a value ten times higher, 10x10=100. So if there was a 5 in that column, it would be equal to 5x100=500.

In binary, or &quot;base two,&quot; you regroup each time you get to two. So the column to the left of the ones column must have a place value twice as large.
Example:
Sixteens|Eights|Fours|Twos|Ones
    1      0     0     1    1    
To convert this number, 10011 (binary), you would multiply each digit by its place value and add all those results together.
Example:
1x16=16 |
0x 8= 0 |    
0x 4= 0 |    
1x 2= 2 |    
1x 1= 1 |   

16+0+0+2+1=19
Here we see that the binary number 10011 equals the decimal number 19.


== Uses of binary numbers ==

Computers use binary numbers because in the simplest electrical systems, electricity can only be &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off.&quot;  In a computer, all of the different systems report their data to the main system by using pulses of &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off.&quot;  Binary numbers are also very useful to programmers because the computer often needs to ask &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; or &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; style questions to the different systems, programs, or even the user.  When binary numbers are used in this way, &quot;1&quot; means &quot;on,&quot; &quot;yes,&quot; or &quot;true&quot; and &quot;0&quot; means &quot;off,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;false.&quot;

'''Juniper Berry''' - actually the cones of certain juniper trees, especially ''Junperus communis''. It is used as a spice in [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European cuisines]], and is the flavour in gin.

The berries are added either whole or slightly bruised to a variety of dishes as a spice. They are added to [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]] and [[Cookbook:Choucroute|choucroute]] for added flavour and crunch.

{{spice}}

'''Nigella''', also ''kalonji'' (कलौंजी or कलोंजी - Hindi), ''kezah'' (קצח - Hebrew), ''charnushka'' (Russian), çörek otu (Turkish), ''habbah Albarakah'' (حبه البركه - Arabic), ''siyah daneh'' (سیاه‌دانه - Persian).

Nigella is a small, black seed of the plant ''Nigella sativa''. Is is used as a spice across the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]] and [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asia]], providing a bitter taste and a faint smell of [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]]. It is one of the spices that make up the Bengali Five-Spice Mix, [[Cookbook:Panch Puran|Panch Puran]].

Nigella is often used in vegetable dishes. The seeds are roasted with other whole-seed spices such as [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] and [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] before being added to the main meal to simmer for a while. Nigella is also traditionally sprinkled on top of some types of [[Cookbook:Naan|naan]].

== Overview ==

'''''Eloise Midgeon''''' may be a Hufflepuff; very little is mentioned about her, except that she is plagued by a terrible acne problem.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

It is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 13|mentioned in passing]], in talking about the medicinal effects of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bubotuber|Bubotubers]], that Eloise Midgeon had tried to jinx her acne off. &quot;But [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] fixed her nose back on in the end.&quot;

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Immediately after publication of the Educational Decree banning student groups, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] that nobody in the newly formed Defence Association could possibly have told [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] about the group. She had had them all sign a piece of parchment that was charmed so that if anyone betrayed the group, they would get skin blemishes that would &quot;make Eloise Midgeon's acne look like a couple of cute freckles&quot;. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Eloise Midgeon is mentioned here as being removed from the school for reasons of her perceived safety, as a result of general fear and uncertainty spreading through the Wizarding population due to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s return.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

Whether it is a weakness, or simply an accident of nature, Eloise Midgeon is always used as an example of a person with really bad acne.

We gather that her judgment in dealing with her acne is somewhat suspect, as she apparently manages to charm her own nose off while trying to get rid of it.

name=Bubotuber|
type=Magical plant|
features=Black and sluglike|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Bubotubers''''' are the ugliest plants [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] has ever seen, looking like thick black slugs sticking vertically out of the plant pots.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Bubotubers, despite their extreme ugliness, seem to have at least one valuable product. Large, shiny swellings grow on the plant; these are full of a yellowish-green liquid, the &quot;pus&quot;, which smells strongly of petrol (gasoline). The raw pus can have unpleasant effects on the skin, so the harvesters must wear dragon-hide gloves; but when properly prepared, it is an excellent cure for the more stubborn forms of acne.

== Analysis ==

Bubotubers are quite a minor sidelight into the world of magic. In this book, they are used for two things: first, to show, by making the plants in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]] classes more dangerous, that Harry's class has advanced further in their studies, and second, to provide a reasonable noxious substance for inclusion in the hate-mail later directed at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]. One suspects that this work with bubotubers may be somehow associated with the jinx that Hermione later lays on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]].

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 13|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Blast-Ended Skrewts''''' are creatures that look like deformed, shell-less lobsters, with no visible head, that periodically boost themselves forwards with an explosion in their tail.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] has somehow secured several hundred of these creatures just after they hatch, and proposes to have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s class look after them as they grow. And they do grow through the course of the book, developing shells and bad tempers, though it seems that we never discover what exactly they eat, apart possibly from each other – though we started the year in early September with several hundred, by the end of October they have started killing each other (by Hallowe'en there are only twenty left, in individual boxes), and only three grow to maturity. Of these three, at least one is in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] maze, where it is reportedly over six feet long. One of them evidently does not survive its time in the maze, as later Hagrid asks the Trio if they want to visit the two remaining Skrewts.

The Skrewts come in two varieties: one with an apparent stinger, which Hagrid presumes is male, and one with suckers which might be for sucking blood, which is presumed female.

They have caused many injuries to the students who look after them.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] describes the Skrewts as &quot;highly dangerous crosses between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Manticore|manticores]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fire Crab|fire crabs]].&quot;

== Analysis ==

It is difficult to say exactly what the purpose of Blast-Ended Skrewts is in our story. Largely they seem to be used to highlight the character differences between the Trio, who assist Hagrid in caring for these creatures even as they grow and become more dangerous, and the rest of the class, who cower in Hagrid's hut while Hagrid and the Trio round up escaped Skrewts. They are also used to show Hagrid's continuing child-like enthusiasm for the more dangerous of magical creatures. They provide some insight into the sorts of effort required to determine the characteristics of newly-discovered or newly-created magical species. On a smaller scale, they provide a hook which Rita Skeeter can use to schedule an interview with Hagrid, and also a dangerous creature for Harry to face in the Third Task maze. Of all of these, it seems that the illumination of character is the only one that can be considered useful to our story; Rita could have hung her interview request on pretty much anything Hagrid chose to do, and there were already large numbers of dangerous creatures available to the Tournament organizers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Using esp for automatic variables? ==

Actually, I would think that programs use ebp for automatic variables, because if esp is used, the offset used will keep on changing as you push and pop things. For example:

 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 sub esp, 4
 mov dword [esp+0], 123 ; using our variable
 push 321
 mov eax, [esp+4] ; we have to use 4 as an offset, because [esp+0] contains 321.
 push 432 ; and now the offset to the variable is 8
 add esp, 8 ; offset is back to 0
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret

However, I could use [ebp-4] as long as I like to reference the variable.

[[User:Wj32|Wj32]] 10:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
:My experience looking at compiled code under the debugger would seem to bear this out; auto variables are always referenced as offset from ebp for exactly this reason.

EBP is not needed for execution at all, if other information is pushed and popped, the compiler can still calculate the location of the local variables based entirely on esp (it just needs to keep track of how the stack is modified). The real explanation of why ebp is used can be found here http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2007/03/12/fpo.aspx , here http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=91 and here http://mituzas.lt/2009/07/26/on-binaries-and-fomit-frame-pointer/ . Actually, gcc has a flag to avoid generation stack frames, -fomit-frame-pointer, but may hinder the later obtention of backtraces in x86 --[[Special:Contributions/213.37.221.151|213.37.221.151]] ([[User talk:213.37.221.151|talk]]) 03:20, 5 January 2010 (UTC)

:One thing never mentioned in the article is that in modern compilers, not even is the order of declarations of auto variables not mirrored in their allocation on the stack, a specific offset from ebp may, at some times, be one auto variable, sometimes another... and some auto variables are always in registers, never appearing on the stack at all. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:42, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

== Isn't EBP-4 the first local variable? ==

the tutorial uses&lt;BR&gt;
;a = [ebp - 12] = [esp], b = [ebp - 8] = [esp + 4], c = [ebp - 4] = [esp + 8]&lt;BR&gt;
to explain&lt;BR&gt;
;int a,b,c;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

Wouldn't it be&lt;BR&gt;
;a = [ebp - 4] = [esp], b = [ebp - 8] = [esp + 4], c = [ebp - 12] = [esp + 8]&lt;BR&gt;
though,&lt;BR&gt;
seeing that right there at the &quot;crude&quot; graphical representation of a stack it says that the first local variable is at ebp - 4?&lt;BR&gt;
[[User:Nothingist|Nothingist]] ([[User talk:Nothingist|talk]]) 07:54, 28 August 2009 (UTC)
:this page appears to backup this up, that ebp-4 = 1st local parameter, ebp-8 = 2nd local parameter:
:http://www.cs.uaf.edu/2008/fall/cs301/support/x86/index.html

== C and Pascal calls -- differences ==
HI,&lt;BR&gt;
There are 2 things not mentionned here :&lt;BR&gt;
1- in C you push parameters from right to left and the caller is supposed to restore the stack&lt;BR&gt;
2- if you use pascal (or WINAPI) style, parameters are push from left to right and the callee restores the stack (that's what Microsoft says)&lt;BR&gt;

So, a standard C function call 
   MyFunction(10, 5, 2);
will create this code
   push 2
   push 5
   push 10
   call MyFunction
   add esp, 12

And MyFunction should be
   push ebp
   mov ebp, esp
   sub esp, nn ; local variables
   ...
   mov esp, ebp
   pop ebp
   ret ; or ret 0

if MyFunction2 is declared as _pascal (or __pascal or WINAPI ...)
   _pascal MyFunction(10, 5, 2);
will create this code
   push 10
   push 5
   push 2
   call _MyFunction@12  ; C compiler add @12 because 12 bytes are pushed

And _MyFunction@12 should be
   push ebp
   mov ebp, esp
   sub esp, nn ; local variables
   ...
   mov esp, ebp
   pop ebp
   ret 12; pop the three parameters

Pushing parameters from right to left lets you use '...' in functions parameters ( ex: printf(const char *format, ...); ).&lt;BR&gt; 
You can't do that in Pascal !&lt;BR&gt;
The pascal form generates a smaller code (only one 'ret nn', instead of an 'add esp, nn' on each call) and you can control parameters.

ps. Don't hesitate to correct my spelling ;)</text>

'''Violets''' ('''''Viola''''') are a genus of plants in the family Violaceae, with around 400-500 species throughout the world, mainly in the temperate Northern Hemisphere but also in Hawaii, Australasia, and the Andes in South America. They are typically found in moist and slightly shaded conditions such as hedgerows.  

==Generic Characteristics==
Most violets are small perennial plants, but a few are annual plants and some are small shrubs. They typically have heart-shaped leaves, and asymmetrical flowers with four upswept or fan-shaped petals, two each side, and one broad, lobed lower petal pointing downward. The shape of the petals defines many species, for example, some violets have a &quot;spur&quot; on the end of each petal. Flower colours vary in the genus; many are violet, some are blue, some yellow, some white, some cream; some are bicolored, often blue and yellow. Flowering is often profuse, and may last for much of the spring and summer depending on the species.

One quirk of some violets is the elusive scent of their flowers; along with terpenes, a major component of the scent is a ketone compound called ionone, which temporarily desensitises the receptors in the nose; this prevents any further scent from being detected from the flower.

==Species==
See [[w:List of Viola species|List of ''Viola'' species]] for a more complete list.
*''[[../Viola arvensis/]]'' - Field Pansy
*''[[../Viola banksii/]]'' - (Australian) Native Violet
*''[[../Viola biflora/]]'' - Yellow Wood Violet or Twoflower Violet
*''[[../Viola canina/]]'' - Heath Dog Violet
*''[[../Viola hirta/]]'' - Hairy Violet
*''[[../Viola odorata/]]'' - Sweet Violet
*''[[../Viola pedunculata/]]'' - Yellow Pansy
*''[[../Viola pubescens/]]'' - Downy yellow violet
*''[[../Viola riviniana/]]'' - Common Dog Violet
*''[[../Viola stagnina/]]'' - Fen Violet
*''[[../Viola tricolor/]]'' - Wild Pansy or Heartsease
*('''Note:''' Neither ''[[../Saintpaulia/]]'' (&quot;African violets&quot;) nor ''[[../Erythronium dens-canis/]]'' (&quot;Dogtooth violet&quot;) are related to the true violets.)

The genus includes the Dog Violets, a group of scentless species which are the most common violets in many areas, the Sweet Violet ''Viola odorata'' (named from its sweet scent), and many other species whose common name includes the word &quot;violet&quot;. Several species are known as pansies, including the Yellow Pansy of the Pacific coast.

The Common Blue Violet ''[[../Viola sororia/]]'' is the state flower of Rhode Island, Illinois, and New Jersey.

Australia is home to a number of violets, including ''[[../Viola hederacea/]]'', ''[[../Viola betonicifolia/]]'' and ''[[../Viola banksii/]]'', first collected by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander on the Cook voyage to Botany Bay.

The modern [[../Pansy|Garden Pansy]] (''V. × wittrockiana'') is a plant of complex hybrid origin involving at least three species, ''[[../Viola tricolor/]]'' (Wild Pansy or Heartsease), ''[[../Viola altaica/]]'' and ''[[../Viola lutea/]]'' (Mountain Pansy).

==Uses==
[[Image:Violet_toporas.jpg|thumb|Sweet violet]]
When newly opened, violet flowers may be used to decorate salads or in stuffings for poultry or fish. Soufflés, cream and similar desserts can be flavoured with essence of violet flowers. The young leaves are edible raw or cooked as a somewhat bland leaf vegetable. Flowers, leaves and roots are also used for medical purposes, being rich in vitamins A and C. 

A '''candied violet''' or '''crystallized violet''' is a violet flower preserved by a coating of sugar syrup. Hot syrup is poured over the fresh flower (or the flower is immersed in the syrup), and stirred until the sugar recrystallizes, and is dried. This method is still used for rose petals, was applied for orange flowers in the past (when [[Cookbook:almond|almond]]s or orange peel are treated this way they are called as pralines). Candied violets are still made commercially at Toulouse, France, where they are known as ''violettes de Toulouse''. They are used as decorating or included in aromatic desserts.

Violets are used to flavour the liqueurs Creme Yvette, Creme de Violette, and Parfait d'Amour.

===Medicinal use===
Violet flowers are also used to make an herbal tea that is used in Chinese herbal medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introducing Terms==

In &quot;Matrix multiplication&quot;, 2nd paragraph, the term ''vector'' is introduced. This might cause confusion to readers new to matrices, as 
the definition follows ''after'' the exaples (&quot;A matrix with just one row is called a row vector [...]&quot;). Probably a better place to introduce the term is above, in &quot;Introduction&quot;, where you have an example of a 1 x 6 matrix. In this context I'd also suggest the addition of an m x 1 vector to point out, that vectors are not just of the form 1 x n.

After the examples in &quot;Multiplication of non-vector matrices&quot; you add the note: &quot;Multiplication of matrices is generally not commutative, i.e. generally AB ≠ BA.&quot;. I consider this to be too late; already the first two examples in &quot;Matrix Multiplication, Exercices&quot; have tho multiplications with reversed factors.

I didn't edit right away, as you maybe followed your approach intentionally for didactic reasons.

== Square matrix required==
should mention that a matrix must be square to have be inverted and compute a determinant....--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] ([[User talk:Billymac00|talk]]) 01:04, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

== Newton-Leibniz ==
Maybe the comment introducing Leibniz as Newton's greatest rival should be removed as historically imprecise and because it put these two great mathematicians in a questionable light. It is not mentioned in Wikipedia pages, and I have no source available at the moment, but my understanding is that Nweton and Leibnitz were not (at least initially) personally very active in the &quot;Newton-Leibniz rivalry&quot;, which was mainly a rivalry between their countrymates.

== Matrix Multiplication ==

At Matrix Multiplication
The first example is a 2x1 matrix being multiplied by a 1x2 matrix which yielded a 1x1 matrix [as indicated in the Note].
Further down at Multiplying non-vector matrices it is indicated at Ex.No.4 a 2x1 matrix multiplied by a 1x2 matrix is a 2x2 matrix.
There appears to be some confusion or conflict that requires explanation.</text>

= Benoni Defence =
Here the most popular opening is the [[Modern Benoni|Modern Benoni]]: [[/3...e6/]]. This will surrender some space to White, and invariably create a weakness on d6, but in return Black gets excellent play on central dark squares, a queenside majority, and use of e5. The Modern Benoni was a favorite of counterattacking players in the 1970s and 1980s, and World Champions Tal, Fischer, and Kasparov used it in their repertoire. Black's main ideas are to advance the queenside majority, create a support point on e5, and to pressure the queenside in general. White, meanwhile, is trying to effect e4-e5, target d6, kingside attack, and sometimes simply squashing Black with his extra space. The Modern Benoni, however, suffered a large defeat with the arrival of the Taimanov Variation, 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.f4 Bg7 8.Bb5+!, which rendered the Benoni all but unplayable. Thus, most players will choose to play a different move-order to reach the Benoni, by going to the Nimzo-Indian first, 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6, and if White plays 3.Nc3, then Black satisfies himself with 3...Bb4, but if White avoids this with 3.Nf3, then 3...c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nc3 g6, and White will have to satisfy himself with either the old main line, 7.e4 Bg7 8.Be2, the current main line, 7.h3 Bg7 8.e4 O-O 9.Bd3, or the Fianchetto Variation, 7.g3 Bg7 8.Bg2.

The Benko or Volga Gambit was revived by Hungarian-American GM Pal Benko in the early 1970s (it enjoyed a brief period of popularity in the mid-1950s). This usually runs 3...b5 4.cxb5 a6. Black's development speeds up and obtains a more compact pawn structure: one pawn island vs. two. He also gains strong queenside pressure using a kingside fianchetto and his two open files on the queenside. This pressure may last into the endgame. However, today it is judged as +/= because Black has no tactical chances, and practice has shown that White can weather the storm, keeping his extra pawn. Alternatively, the Zaitsev line is very sharp and complicated, when White plays 5.Nc3 axb5 6.e4 b4 7.Nb5.

Alternatively, ...e5 and ...d6 are played together in order to close the center and keep it solid. The idea is to build up a solid wall that both players will have trouble breaking. The problem is that White has a huge space advantage and can play for pawn breaks on either side of the board.

The '''whiteflies''', comprising only the family '''Aleyrodidae''', are small hemipterans which typically feed on the underside of plant leaves. While feeding damage can cause economic losses, it is the ability of whiteflies to transmit or spread viruses that has had the widest impact on global food production.  In the tropics and subtropics, whiteflies  (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)have become one of the most serious crop protection problems. Economic losses are estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  While several species of whitefly cause crop losses through direct feeding, a species complex, or group of whiteflies in the genus ''Bemisia'' are important in the transmission of plant diseases.  ''Bemisia tabaci'' and ''B. argentifolii'', transmit African cassava mosaic, bean golden mosaic, bean dwarf mosaic, bean calico mosaic, tomato yellow leaf-curl, tomato mottle, and other Begomoviruses, in the Family: Geminiviridae.  The world-wide spread of emerging biotypes, such as ''B. tabaci'' biotype B, also known as, 'B. argentifolii', and a new biotype Q, continue to cause severe crop losses which will likely continue to increase, resulting in higher pesticide use on many crops (tomatoes, beans, cassava, cotton, cucurbits, potatoes, sweet potatoes).  Efforts to develop integrated pest management, IPM, systems aimed at environmentally friendly strategies to also reduce insecticide use will help re-establish the ecological equilibrium of predators, parasitoids, and microbial controls that were once in place.  New crop varieties are also being developed with increased tolerance to the whiteflies, and to the whitefly-transmitted plant diseases.  A major problem is the fact that the whiteflies and the viruses they carry can infect many different host plants, including agricultural crops and weeds.  This is complicated by the difficulty in classifying and detecting new whitefly biotypes and Begomoviruses.  Proper diagnosis of plant diseases depends on using sophisticated molecular techniques to detect and characterize the viruses and whiteflies which are present in a crop. A team of researchers, extension agents and growers working together are needed to follow disease development, using dynamic modeling, to understand the incidence of disease spread.

==Description==
&lt;!--physical description of the pest--&gt;

==Symptoms and Signs==
Whiteflies feed by tapping into the phloem of plants, which carries food down the plant to the roots.  Plants have vascular tissues that carry water Xylem up the plant, where it combines with photosynthesis to produce the needed food for plant growth.  The plants lose turgor and wilt, and may react to the whiteflies' toxic saliva. As whiteflies congregate in large numbers, they overwhelm plants quickly. It can get so bad that when you tap a leaf, a swarm of whiteflies will go airborne before re-settling under the leaf. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes [[../Sooty Mold/]] growth and can ruin a cotton crop with its stickiness. 

In 1997 [[../Tomato Yellow Leaf-Curl Begomovirus/]], (TYLCV) was discovered in the USA, in Florida. This plant disease is the worst viral disease of tomato.  The disease is transmitted by the whitefly, ''Bemisia argentifolii''.  The whitefly is also been shown to transmit almost all of the 60 known whitefly transmitted plant viral diseases. 

==Ecology==
They have an unusually modified form of metamorphosis, in that the immature stages begin life as mobile individuals, but soon attach to the plant, and the stage before the adult is called a '''pupa''' (though it is not a true pupa in the sense of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis). 

==Species==
&lt;!--bulleted, linked list of species addressed in WMOG--&gt;

==Control==   
Whitefly control is difficult.  The greenhouse whitefly has developed resistance to many pesticides.  The USDA recommends &quot;an integrated program that focuses on prevention and relies on cultural and biological control methods when possible.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://whiteflies.ifas.ufl.edu/wfly0082.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  They advise use of yellow sticky traps to monitor infestations and only selective use of insecticides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This documentation was written by Andrew Lindesay (http://www.lindesay.co.nz) in 2006 as part of supported code in the LEWOStuff framework, but this material has been transcribed here.  It was written around the time of WebObjects 5.2 and 5.3 on the 1.4 JVM.

AXIS provides a number of handlers for ultimately executing the WS.  This generally works in the WebObjects environment out of the box.  However, in the case of a servlet deployment, the URLs are manipulated by the servlet container so they look something like this.

  ...ects/FOO.woa/ws/FooService&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;;jsessionid=abc.i1&lt;/font&gt;?wsdl

If a client starts a session on a WS invocation then you want all subsequent requests to return to this same servlet container (Here we assume a redundant deployment where there are a number of servlet containers.) where the session resides.  However the servlet-container's HTTP adaptor typically only knows this by looking at the modified URL.  Unfortunately, the default WSDL generated by AXIS would have a section like this.

&lt;pre&gt;...
&lt;wsdl:service name=&quot;FooService&quot;&gt;
  &lt;wsdl:port name=&quot;FooService&quot; binding=&quot;impl:FooService SoapBinding&quot;&gt;
    &lt;wsdlsoap:address location=&quot;http://foo.co.nz/FOO/WebObjects/FOO.woa/ws/FooService&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/wsdl:port&gt;
&lt;/wsdl:service&gt;
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

A WSDL like this does not contain the modified URL caused by the context having a session in the location for the service.  The example handler ''LEWOWebServicesWSDLLocationHandler'' below which is supplied in LEWOStuff will correct the location supplied in the WSDL to contain the session information.  To install this handler for use in WebObjects, locate the ''server.wsdd'' file within your project and modify the following section so that it appears as follows.

&lt;pre&gt;...
&lt;transport name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;
  &lt;requestFlow&gt;
    &lt;handler type=&quot;HTTPActionHandler&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;handler type=&quot;URLMapper&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;handler type=&quot;java:nz.co.lindesay.common.webobjects.LEWOWebServicesWSDLLocationHandler&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/requestFlow&gt;
&lt;/transport&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You then need to put the following class into your project.

&lt;pre&gt;
package nz.co.lindesay.common.webobjects;

/**
 * &lt;P&gt;This class is an AXIS request handler that is designed to
 * manipulate the outbound WSDL that is generated for a
 * request.  The manipulation undertaken here is to modify the
 * location of the actual service.  The reason for doing this is
 * that if you have a web service deployed into a servlet 
 * container as a WO application, the session'ed URLs can look
 * a bit like this.&lt;/P&gt;
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;&lt;TT&gt;http://foo.co.nz/FOO/WebObjects/FOO.woa/ws/FooService;jsessionid=abc.i1?wsdl&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;However, once the URL is returned as a location for a service
 * from AXIS, the session part at the end is removed and if you are
 * using a multi-container deployment, the subsequent requests will
 * not arrive at the correct servlet container.&lt;/P&gt;
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;By installing this AXIS handler, this problem is resolved.
 * To install it, locate the &quot;&lt;TT&gt;server.wsdd&lt;/TT&gt;&quot; file in your
 * WO project and add the following line to the &quot;&lt;I&gt;requestFlow&lt;/I&gt;&quot;
 * handler list as the last item in the list.  This should be the
 * request flow in the HTTP transport section.&lt;/P&gt;
 *
 * &lt;P&gt;&lt;TT&gt;&amp;lt;handler type=&quot;java:nz.co.lindesay.common.webobjects.LEWOWebServicesWSDLLocationHandler&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

'''Cider vinegar''' - also '''apple cider vinegar''', '''ACV''', is a type of [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] made from apples. Cider vinegar has a unique flavour, coming from the apples used to make it. Some recipes require cider vinegar, although other vinegars may be substituted.

Being made totally from apples, cider vinegar is [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten free]] unlike, say, [[Cookbook:Malt vinegar|malt vinegar]]. However, some commercial brands add wheat-derived substances such as [[Cookbook:Caramel|caramel]] (as colouring), so it is important to read the labels when purchasing.

Cider vinegar isn't hard to make; in fact, it's easier to make cider vinegar than it is to make cider! The basic procedure is to make cider from fresh apples, but use no preservatives and keep the lid open to let oxygen in. A recipe follows.

==Ingredients==

* 4kg (8 lb) fresh [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]]

==Equipment==

* two 3 litre fermenters (can be large bottles or food-grade plastic buckets)
* apple crusher or juice maker
* food-grade siphon hose (from hardware store or homebrew shop)

==Procedure==

# Wash the apples to remove obvious dirt, and cut out any bruised or bird-struck bits.
# Crush the apples, or put them through a juice maker, and collect the juice in one of the fermenters.
# Cover the fermenter with a cloth, or plug the opening with cotton wool if narrow, to keep out dust and insects. Don't worry that the fermenter isn't full, as it should be for making cider. With vinegar, air space is good, as it brings oxygen to the bacteria.
# Set aside somewhere to ferment, not too warm or too cool (about 18-22°C / 64-72°F is best). 
# Allow the juice to ferment. It should start getting bubbly within a couple of days. Note the progress, so that you can tell when fermentation has peaked and is slowing down.
# When the fermentation is slowing down and not bubbling so vigorously, siphon into the other fermenter carefully. Try not to get too much of the gunk that has settled to the bottom, or the froth on top - the aim is to get a clear cider without too many floating chunks!
# Set the second fermenter aside to ferment for two to three months. After a while, you should see a white film forming on top. Don't despair - this is the ''vinegar mother'', a structure built by the vinegar-making bacteria ([[w:Acetobacter|acetobacter]])
# After a couple of months, you can draw off two thirds of the vinegar for use, and top up with fresh, clear cider made in the first fermenter. 

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Use only glass, stainless steel, or food grade plastic when making cider vinegar. The acids in apple juice, and further created by fermenting to vinegar, will leach chemicals from other plastics and corrode some metals.
* Cider vinegar is better when made with a blend of apples including cider varieties - e.g. sharps and bitters, not just sweets - but pretty much any apples will do.
* Apple juice that is free of preservatives can be used instead of crushing fresh apples. Just add [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] to get the initial fermentation going, and stir occasionally for the first two weeks to help encourage the acetic bacteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Samba''''' is a [[wikipedia:free software|free software]] re-implementation of [[wikipedia:Server Message Block|SMB/CIFS]] networking protocol released under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html#TOC1 GNU General Public License]. As of version 3, Samba not only provides file and print services for various [[wikipedia:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]] clients but can also integrate with a [[wikipedia:Windows Server domain|Windows NT Server Domain]], either as a [[wikipedia:Primary Domain Controller|Primary Domain Controller]] (PDC) or as a Domain Member. It can also be part of an [[wikipedia:Active Directory|Active Directory]] domain.

Samba runs on most [[wikipedia:Unix|Unix]] and [[wikipedia:Unix-like|Unix-like]] systems, such as [[wikipedia:Linux|Linux]], [[wikipedia:Solaris Operating Environment|Solaris]], and the [[wikipedia:Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] variants, including Apple's [[wikipedia:Mac OS X Server|Mac OS X Server]] (it was added to the Mac OS X client edition with version 10.2). It is standard on nearly all distributions of Linux and is commonly included as a basic system service on other Unix-based systems as well.

Samba has a 10-year development history, and as a result Samba-3 is both a robust and mature ''Enterprise Class'' project. It has been deployed in organizations small and large as a stand-in replacement for more expensive ''Microsoft™ Windows&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Windows is a registered trademark of the Microsoft Corporation. [[http://www.microsoft.com/windows http://www.microsoft.com/windows]]&lt;/ref&gt; based solutions. Because Samba is freely available under the GPL, it can scale with network environment it was deployed to function in without the need to worry about restrictive per-seat, or per-user licenses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cross compile Samba ==
If you want to compile Samba e.g. for an embedded system you need to cross compile Samba on your host PC.

After you have downloaded the Samba sources from [http://www.Samba.org Samba.org], unpack these sources and enter the samba-&lt;version&gt;/source/ directory. Then you need to set the CC environment:

&lt;pre&gt;
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH&amp;#61;/&lt;path_to_compiler&gt;/lib
# export LDFLAGS&amp;#61;-L/&lt;path_to_compiler&gt;/lib
# export CPPFLAGS&amp;#61;-I/&lt;path_to_compiler&gt;/include
# export CC&amp;#61;&lt;path_to_compiler&gt;/bin/&lt;your_compiler&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

as an example see the following for a mips compiler:

&lt;pre&gt;
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH&amp;#61;~/home/me/my_prj/linux/mips_compiler/lib
# export LDFLAGS&amp;#61;-L/~/home/me/my_prj/linux/mips_compiler/lib
# export CPPFLAGS&amp;#61;-I/~/home/me/my_prj/linux/mips_compiler/include
# export CC&amp;#61;~/home/me/my_prj/linux/mips_compiler/bin/mips-linux-uclib-gcc
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: CPPFLAGS are not flags for a C++ compiler! CPPFLAGS means C-PreProcessor, thus CPPFLAGS are the options for the C-preprocessor.

Now entering the samba-&lt;version&gt;/source/ directory and run 'configure':

&lt;pre&gt;# ./configure --host&amp;#61;i686 --target&amp;#61;mips-linux-uclibc&lt;/pre&gt;

After the configure script has ended, run make in samba-&lt;version&gt;/source/

&lt;pre&gt;# make&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Configuring Samba ==

After you have installed Samba, you need to configure it:

Samba is configured by editing the smb.conf file, which is generally located in /etc/samba/. There is usually a smb.conf.example file that is well commented and will help you on your way to configuring the server. Just edit it and save it as smb.conf for an easy way get the server running. There are also a few graphical editors out there such as [http://www.rbroom.com/consulting/docs/samba/swat.8.html SWAT], which is a graphical, web browser based way of editing smb.conf.

== Using Samba ==

To start samba, start its two daemons, '''smbd''' and '''nmbd'''. 

Your computer's shared directories and files should now also be viewable on your windows network (My Network Places). 

To view windows shares in the Linux environment run the '''smbtree''' command.

=== Decide before what you really want ===

This topic forks in two branches:

- Server (File, print, etc.)

- Domain Controller

Of course it is an oversimplification. You can combine these approaches, but for now keep it simple to avoid unnecessary trouble.

=== Server ===

- A file server consists in computer shares - files, printers, devices, queues, etc. - in a network controlled by smbd daemon.

It's a role of smbd take care of grant or deny controlled access to these parts.

==== Server KISS ====

There are many forms to configure and install samba. Better is to keep it simple, focusing your needs. To a hurry sysadmin, or even poorman, I recommend some basic approach, delaying complexities and security tuning for future iterations.

Shortly, it is a Standalone Server for centralized tasks: file and print serving. 

Backup your original in smb.conf:

 # cd /etc/samba
 # mv smb.conf smb.conf.orig
 # touch smb.conf

and insert these lines in the new one:

 [global]
 workgroup = SAMBAGRP
 netbios name = SAMBAKISS
 security = SHARE
 passdb backend = guest
 
 [data]
 comment = Public Data
 path = /srv/myshares
 read only = no

This approach requires just one account - guest - to connect. To add guest account, follow script:

#Create guest account on Unix system 
#Block local access changing shell to false 
#Eliminate password from guest account
adduser script fits well

 # adduser --home /dev/null --shell /bin/false --no-create-home --uid 65533 --disabled-password guest

#Create or map samba account
 # smbpasswd -a guest
 New SMB password: (type ENTER)
 Retype new SMB password: (type ENTER)
 Added user guest.

=== Domain Controller ===

[TODO]

== Managing Samba ==

=== Basic Check ===

It's a good idea to check samba running parts in a host machine, before start:

 $ ps ax &amp;#166; grep .*mbd

Usually there are two process, '''nmbd''' and '''smbd''', (number of smbd instances and path of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_%28computer_software%29 daemon] may vary). It indicate that samba is running.

 $ ps ax &amp;#166; grep mbd
 29402 ?        Ss     0:03 /usr/sbin/nmbd -D
 29404 ?        Ss     0:00 /usr/sbin/smbd -D

Another way (more sophisticated) requires root privileges:

 $ sudo smbcontrol nmbd ping
 PONG from pid 29402
 $ sudo smbcontrol smbd ping
 PONG from pid 29407  (number of smbd daemons may vary)

Samba main parts are daemons named '''smbd''' and '''nmbd'''. 

*'''smbd''': take care of files, logons, shares, etc
*'''nmbd''': deal with names 

When you are using samba suite, you are sending requests to these daemons, mostly to smbd.

=== Database moves ===

Samba uses files to keep its controls. There are two types of files in focus: flat files and trivial database files.

User database have to be created and initialized and the main configuration file prepared with shares and system parameters. It's better to get a nice reading on [http://us1.samba.org/samba/docs/ existent documentation] before try to implement a real production site, identify and possibly write down instructions.

Its is common to start a samba server based on a fire-up and forget philosophy, and later (at an year basis) have to recover in a hurry the same server and find out you can't remember how to add users, tune, etc.

=== Tasks to Write Down ===

*Check smb.conf
After configure or change smb.conf, it is recommended test modifications before start.
You can do it running and reading possibly error messages or abnormalities

  $mybox:~$ sudo testparm

*Start/Stop samba

Actually, depending on your distribution, you will start samba running a previous prepared batch  file, that resides on startup script set.

Debian based distributions use:

 $mybox:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/samba start      # starts samba

 $mybox:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/samba stop       # stops samba

* Restart and check in one step

 # /etc/init.d/samba restart &amp;&amp; ps ax | grep mbd

*Add/Remove users
[TODO]
 Using smbpasswd to
 - add user
 - change password

*Check log files
[TODO]

*Backup smb.conf and tdb databases
[TODO]

      <comment>Improvements to Samba Wikibook.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Marz, I have reorganized the existing content at the [[Samba]] Wikibook. You had one page with new content tacked on to the old with a ever lengthening Table of Contents. I have taken the existing material and placed it in individual chapters. I hope this will allow the page to Wikibook to scale better. I've added some content--mostly things I've imported from Wikipedia and WikiMedia Commons to improve the 'look and feel' of the Wikibook. All of your existing content is still present, unless it was a simple ''[TO DO]'' placeholder. I will be adding new content shortly, especially as it relates to using Web-Based GUI's to perform operations in Samba. I hope to make the Wikibook a ''practical'' guide to Samba administration, not just a re-hash of the Samba HOWTO. I hope you approve of the measures I have taken, and intend to take, with the Samba Wikibook. &amp;mdash;[[User:Wikijeff|Wikijeff]] 04:00, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Suggested Guidelines ==

Welcome to any and all co-authors for this Wikibook on American Literature.  In order to make this book consistent, I propose the following guidelines and structure.  Please see the modules on [[American Literature/20th Century/Robert Frost|Robert Frost]] and [[American Literature/20th Century/Langston Hughes|Langston Hughes]] which are practically complete.

#At ths stage of the game, I am not numbering any of the modules, because I want to leave room for inserting others easily.
#As you can see from the Contents, I have arranged the book chronologically.  Unless another writer is willing to re-do the entire order, I suggest we keep it that way.  I would hate to see the organization get muddled.
#Each chapter should begin with 
##a discussion of the various movements and styles of that century and 
##a list of the major literary figures and works of that century.
#Each module within the chapter should be about a particular writer.  It should include:  
##an introduction on the significance of the writer, 
##a brief biography of the writer, 
##a brief critical discussion of the writer's works, 
##a list of the writer's awards and honors (especially literary ones),
##a list of some or all of the writer's works, and
##a list of external links to high-quality sources, especially for the writer's works.
Of course, it should be associated with other Wikimedia projects, too.[[User:Logophile|Logophile]] 06:24, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

== Section Headings ==

Updated subject headings to conform more with standard divisions of American Literature anthologists.[[User:DanQuigley|DanQuigley]] ([[User talk:DanQuigley|talk]]) 05:35, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

== Orphaned pages ==

The following are pages that do not have links to them from the main book page but are currently within the American Literature hierarchy.  Their location is not consistent with the table of contents listed at [[American Literature]].  Their location indicates they are 20th century writers but there are three periods in the table of contents dealing with the 20th century.  I note them here so a future contributor to this book will be aware of their existence for incorporation.

Some authors, though, span time periods, literary movements, and even centuries. Robert Frost is an excellent example of this; his work was not entirely modernist work, but it wasn't exactly romantic, either. He exhibited the feeling of much modernist work (for instance, &quot;The Woodpile&quot;), but he also held a more rigid poetic structure than a typical modernist poet. Furthermore, his life lasted from the 1870's to the 1960's. Unless I have completely misunderstood what is being asserted here, perhaps we can find another way of categorizing these authors. One option is to simply link to them in every category where they fit.  [[User:Cqbarton|Cqbarton]] ([[User talk:Cqbarton|talk]]) 16:29, 29 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Choosing a program */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

There are 19 medical schools in Australia, typically offering the Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree, though some may offer a Bachelor of Medicine (BMed) instead. There is the opportunity to pursue research towards a higher Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree, but this degree is higher than and not equivalent to the standard qualification in the United States.

Australia's medical programs are divided into two types, Undergraduate Entry and Graduate Entry. Undergraduate entry degrees are typically 6 years in duration and are commonly entered directly from high school, while Graduate entry degrees are typically 4 years in length, and a current Bachelor's degree is required for entry. Note however that the Graduate entry programs still confer a Bachelor degree in Medicine, they are graduate entry, not postgraduate degrees themselves.

The undergraduate-entry programs tend to draw more from school-leavers, while the graduate-entry programs draw a wider age range of entrants, from diverse academic backgrounds.

'''Universities with undergraduate-entry medical programs only'''
*Bond University
*James Cook University
*University of Adelaide
*University of Newcastle
*University of New South Wales*
*University of Tasmania
*University of Western Sydney
&lt;small&gt;* UNSW offers a limited number of places for graduates of its Bachelor of Medical Science program only.&lt;/small&gt; 

'''University with both undergraduate and graduate-entry'''
*Monash University

'''Universities with graduate-entry medical programs only'''
*Australian National University
*Deakin University
*Flinders University
*Griffith University
*Notre Dame University, Fremantle
*Notre Dame University, Sydney
*University of Melbourne
*University of Queensland
*University of Sydney
*University of Wollongong
*University of Western Australia

==Undergraduate entry process==
The processes involved in gaining entry into an undergraduate medical course in Australia vary between universities and states. Typically an application must be made to the relevant state tertiary admission centre. 

Whether an applicant is successful or not depends upon their performance 

===UMAT===
Most universities require applicants to sit an aptitude test called the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT). The Australian Council of Educational Research (ACER) developed UMAT The UMAT is divided into three sections:
#'''Section 1''' tests problem solving, logical reasoning
#'''Section 2''' tests empathy 
#'''Section 3''' tests visual spatial skills.  

Applicants are then ranked according to their score. The 

Several training courses have been created in response to the competitiveness of the UMAT.   

Universities which require applicants to sit the UMAT for entry into their course:
*Monash University
*University of Queensland
*University of New South Wales
*University of Tasmania
*Bond University
*University of Adelaide
*University of Western Sydney

===Interview===
Many universities require applicants to sit an interview for the purpose of ascertaining their suitability to medical school

==Graduate entry process==
All the graduate entry programs share a similar application process at this time. Candidates are first required to sit the GAMSAT (Graduate Australian Medical Schools Admission Test), which is held yearly in March. Candidates typically sit the test in the year prior to the one they wish to start their medical degree, and the cutoff for the exam is typically in January. The GAMSAT is conducted by ACER (the Australian Council for Educational Research), which also handles the subsequent admissions process. When candidates receive their GAMSAT scores (typically in June), they apply centrally through ACER, listing their preferences for courses, and ACER forwards their applications to the relevant universities. If the applicants meet the requirements set by individual universities they are offered interviews. The interviews typically take place in September or October. Universities notify candidates of their success in October or November, and the programs start in the new year.

===Bachelor degree===
===GAMSAT===

The GAMSAT is divided into three sections:

*Section 1: Reasoning in Humanities and Social Sciences (100 minutes)
*Section 2: Written Communication (60 minutes)
*Section 3: Reasoning in Biological and Physical Sciences (170 minutes)

Sections 1 and 3 are multiple choice exams, while Section 2 involves the production of two essays. The GAMSAT is about 6 hrs in total duration, and is held on one day in a central location. Testing centres are limited to the capital cities and Townsville (and a few overseas locations), so some travel may be involved.

===Choosing a program===
Though they share the same application process, the individual universities set varying criteria for selecting candidates. Most take into account three factors: GAMSAT score, GPA (Grade Point Average) and performance in the interview. A few of the programs require additional material, such as a portfolio of extracurricular activities or a personal statement. Candidates should make their preferences based on which combination of factors will best help in their individual case, but should also take into account the location of the school (particularly the challenges of relocation) and their personal preference for a particular university's program, university life, campus or reputation. Visiting a number of schools before choosing preferences is a good idea.

{| border=1
|+ '''Selection criteria by university'''
!University!!Location!!Criteria for interview offer!!Criteria for entry
|-
|Australian National University||Canberra, ACT||50% GAMSAT, 50% weighted GPA (minimum GAMSAT pass Sec. I,II,III)||GAMSAT, interview
|-
|University of Queensland||||GAMSAT (minimum required GPA: 5.0)||50% GAMSAT, 50% interview (GPA used as tiebreaker)
|-
|University of Sydney||Camperdown, NSW||GAMSAT (minimum required GPA: 5, GAMSAT: 50 each Sec. I,II,III)||performance in interview only (GAMSAT, GPA used as tiebreaker)
|-
|University of Wollongong||Wollongong, NSW||GPA, GAMSAT, portfolio (minimum required GPA: 5.0, GAMSAT: 50 each Sec. I,II,III)||
|}

===The interview===

==After graduation==
===Internship &amp; residency===
All Australian medical graduates are required to complete 1 year of internship in a public hospital in order to obtain full medical registration. Choice of hospital to complete internship depends on individuals preferences during their final year of medical school. The exact mechanism varies by state and territory. Most recent medical graduates complete internship in the state of their medical school, though individuals can apply for internship in any state or territory.

Prior to 1997, medical graduates received a provider number entitlement at the completion of internship. A provider number is required in Australia for medical practitioners to be able to access Medicare, the universal health system in Australia. Patients are able to see medical practitioners with a provider and use medicare to cover the cost of the consultation. Legislative changes in 1997 resulted in cessation of access such that graduates are now only able to gain provider number entitlements after completion of vocational post graduate medical training, a further 4 - 6 years of study after internship.

===General practice===
===Specialist training===
Medical specialist training in Australia is conducted by the various professional colleges. Registered medical practitioners must generally complete at least two years of postgraduate residency before they can enter a training program with one of the colleges. After completing training, and passing examinations they become eligible for fellowship as a medical specialist. A fellowship is the last year before you become a fully fledged doctor. 

The professional colleges include:

*Royal Australasian College of Surgeons
*Royal Australasian College of Physicians
*Australian and New Zealand College of Anesthetists
*Royal College of Pathologists of Australia
*Royal Australian College of General Practice

== Overview ==

'''''Reducio''''' is a charm that makes things small.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This spell seems to reverse the action of the engorgement charm [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Engorgio|Engorgio]]. The first time we see this charm used, it is used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] to reduce a spider back to its normal size after it has been used in a classroom demonstration.

== Analysis ==

Like many spells, there must be a mental component to this spell; it is necessary to control the size that you want the object to shrink to, so that size must be controlled mentally.

== Questions ==

== Naming pages ==

Hi - can you take a look at the changes I've made to [[Ancient Warfare]] as far as the subpages go (I've moved the pages you created to link with the change.  The policy is for pages of books to be named as subpages (ie &quot;Ancient Warfare/Subpage&quot;) in this way.  If I can help let me know - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:45, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Including scripts */ the Include() part has changed. We now use Include('counter.py') instead of Include('../counter.py')</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Home page==
For the moment we'll ignore the CDs and begin writing the home page

Create a new folder &lt;tt&gt;mycds&lt;/tt&gt; in your Karrigell distribution, under the &lt;tt&gt;www&lt;/tt&gt; folder. With your favorite text editor, save this text in a file called &lt;tt&gt;index.ks&lt;/tt&gt;

 def index():
     print &quot;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My CD collection&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&quot;

In your browser ask &lt;tt&gt;localhost/mycds/index.ks/index&lt;/tt&gt;

The extension &quot;ks&quot; (Karrigell Service) means that the script is a Python script where functions match urls : here, &lt;tt&gt;index.ks/index&lt;/tt&gt; means that the function &lt;tt&gt;index()&lt;/tt&gt; will send the data back to the browser

In fact
*if you don't specify a function name, the &lt;tt&gt;index()&lt;/tt&gt; function in the script will be run, so you could have asked &lt;tt&gt;localhost/mycds/index.ks&lt;/tt&gt;
*and if you don't even specify a script name in a folder, the script called &lt;tt&gt;index&lt;/tt&gt; will be run. So all you have to type really is &lt;tt&gt;localhost/mycds&lt;/tt&gt;

Notice the &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; statement in the &lt;tt&gt;index()&lt;/tt&gt; function. In Karrigell scripts, the &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; statement sends the content to the browser ; by default, this content is supposed to be HTML code

==Adding a page counter==

The page counter will print the number of times that the page has been seen. We'll use a file, &lt;tt&gt;counter.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, to store the number of visits and increment it for each visit

 def index():
     print &quot;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My CD collection&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&quot;
     try:
         visits = int(open('counter.txt').read())
     except IOError:
         # first visit : the file does not exist
         visits = 0
     visits += 1
     out = open('counter.txt','w')
     out.write(str(visits))
     out.close()
     print &quot;%s visits&quot; %visits

Each time the page is reloaded, you will see the number of visits incremented by 1

Notice that the file is opened by the usual &lt;tt&gt;open()&lt;/tt&gt; function ; relative paths are converted to absolute paths relatively to the script directory

==A ''better'' page counter==

A page counter should not increment if the same user repeatedly reloads the same page. This requires a way to identify the browser which is sending the request. For this task, web programming provides session management, and Karrigell has a very simple implementation of this concept

Use the built-in &lt;tt style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Session()&lt;/tt&gt; function

Karrigell scripts are run in a namespace prepared by the framework : among the names available in scripts, you have this &lt;tt style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Session()&lt;/tt&gt; function, which returns an object specific to each individual client (it uses cookies). This object is an ordinary Python object, to which you can set any attribute you like

Here, for a new client, we will create an attribute user to the session object. If a client requests the home page and his session object already has this attribute, the counter will not be incremented

 def index():
     print &quot;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My CD collection&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&quot;
     try:
         visits = int(open('counter.txt').read())
     except IOError:
         # first visit : the file does not exist
         visits = 0
     '''if not hasattr(Session(),&quot;user&quot;):'''
         visits += 1
         out = open('counter.txt','w')
         out.write(str(visits))
         out.close()
         '''Session().user = None'''    # create attribute user
     print &quot;%s visits&quot; %visits

==Including scripts==

This page counter could be used in other parts of the application, so it's better to put it in a separate file : save this part of the script in &lt;tt&gt;counter.py&lt;/tt&gt;

 try:
     visits = int(open('counter.txt').read())
 except IOError:
     # first visit : the file does not exist
     visits = 0
     if not hasattr(Session(),&quot;user&quot;):
     visits += 1
     out = open('counter.txt','w')
     out.write(str(visits))
     out.close()
     Session().user = None   # create attribute user
 print &quot;%s visits&quot; %visits

To include this script in the home page, change the script &lt;tt&gt;index.ks&lt;/tt&gt; to this :

 def index():
     print &quot;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My CD collection&amp;gt;/h1&amp;gt;&quot;
     '''Include('counter.py')'''

&lt;tt style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Include()&lt;/tt&gt; is another Karrigell built-in function : it takes a script url as argument, an inserts the result of this script's execution in the page

To make &lt;tt&gt;counter.py&lt;/tt&gt; even more modular, the file name could be passed as argument to &lt;tt style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Include()&lt;/tt&gt; :

 def index():
     print &quot;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My CD collection&amp;gt;/h1&amp;gt;&quot;
     Include('counter.py','''counter_file='counter.txt'''')

The keyword argument to &lt;tt style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Include()&lt;/tt&gt; will be in the execution namespace when &lt;tt&gt;counter.py&lt;/tt&gt; is run. Rewrite &lt;tt&gt;counter.py&lt;/tt&gt; with this parameter :

 try:
     visits = int(open('''counter_file''').read())
 except IOError:
     # first visit : the file does not exist
     visits = 0
 if not hasattr(Session(),&quot;user&quot;):
     visits += 1
     out = open('''counter_file''','w')
     out.write(str(visits))
     out.close()
     Session().user = None   # create attribute user
 print &quot;%s visits&quot; %visits

==Logging in/out==
Let's add the link for users to log in to the application

 def index():
     print &quot;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My CD collection&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&quot;
     &lt;b&gt;print '&amp;lt;a href=&quot;login&quot;&amp;gt;Login&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;'&lt;/b&gt;
     Include('../counter.py',counter_file='counter.txt')

The link leads to the reference &lt;tt&gt;&quot;login&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. It is a relative url to the base url, &lt;tt&gt;host/records/index.ks/index&lt;/tt&gt;, so it resolves to &lt;tt&gt;host/records/index.ks/login&lt;/tt&gt;, meaning that the link will invoke the execution of the function &lt;tt&gt;login()&lt;/tt&gt; in the script &lt;tt&gt;index.ks&lt;/tt&gt;

This function will generate an HTML form asking the user's login and password, and submitting these values to an authentication test

 def login():
     print '&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Login&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;'
     print '&amp;lt;form action=&quot;check_login&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&amp;gt;'
     print 'Login &amp;lt;input name=&quot;login&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;'
     print 'Password &amp;lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;passwd&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;'
     print '&amp;lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Ok&quot;&amp;gt;'
     print '&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;'

The attribute &lt;tt&gt;&quot;action&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; for the form is &lt;tt&gt;check_login&lt;/tt&gt;. Again, this means that the function &lt;tt&gt;check_login()&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;index.ks&lt;/tt&gt; will be run

Unlike &lt;tt&gt;index()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;login()&lt;/tt&gt;, this function will take arguments : the submitted login and password. The arguments must be called like the names used in the input fields of the form : &lt;tt&gt;login&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;passwd&lt;/tt&gt;.  For the moment we'll use a very simple test to see if the user is allowed to log in

 def check_login(login,passwd):
     if login==&quot;john&quot; and passwd==&quot;doe&quot;:
         Session().user = login
         print &quot;logged in&quot;
     else:
         print &quot;try again&quot;

Inside this function, if the test succeeds, the attribute &lt;tt&gt;user&lt;/tt&gt; of the session object is set to the user's login

For the moment, all we have is the result of the test. After the test, we should be automatically sent back to the home page. The HTTP protocol provides a redirection feature, and Karrigell implementation is once again very straightforward : a built-in exception called &lt;tt style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;HTTP_REDIRECTION&lt;/tt&gt;

Change the function &lt;tt&gt;check_login()&lt;/tt&gt; like this :

 def check_login(login,passwd):
     if login==&quot;john&quot; and passwd==&quot;doe&quot;:
         Session().user = login
     '''raise HTTP_REDIRECTION,&quot;index&quot;'''

This means that after the function is run, the browser redirects to the specified url, here the one that matches the function &lt;tt&gt;index()&lt;/tt&gt; in the script

We can now change the home page to welcome the authenticated user with his name, and allow him to logout :

 def index():
     print &quot;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My CD collection&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&quot;
     &lt;b&gt;logged = hasattr(Session(),&quot;user&quot;) and Session().user is not None
     if logged:
         print 'Logged in as %s&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;' %Session().user
         print '&amp;lt;a href=&quot;logout&quot;&amp;gt;Logout&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;'
     else:&lt;/b&gt;
         print '&amp;lt;a href=&quot;login&quot;&amp;gt;Login&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;'
     Include('../counter.py',counter_file='counter.txt')

The logout function will only set &lt;tt&gt;Session().user&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;None&lt;/tt&gt; and redirect to the home page :

 def logout():
     del Session().user
     raise HTTP_REDIRECTION,&quot;index&quot;

==Summary==
The programming style used by Karrigell is based on '''namespace''' : in the scripts, instead of importing modules or using environment variables, a number of built-in names are available for the most common tasks. So far we have covered session management with the built-in name &lt;tt style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Session()&lt;/tt&gt;, inclusion of scripts with &lt;tt style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Include()&lt;/tt&gt; and HTTP redirection with the built-in exception &lt;tt style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;HTTP_REDIRECTION&lt;/tt&gt;

This makes programming with Karrigell extremely straightforward, thus easy to code and to maintain

While other formats are available (see the documentation for pure-Python scripts, CGI, Python Inside HTML, HTML Inside Python) I suggest to use &quot;Karrigell Services&quot; to group most of the application logic in one script ; peripheric modules can be imported or included

In the [[../Managing_The_Database/|next section]] we will write the code to manage the CD database

      <text xml:space="preserve">=About this Unit=
From the [http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gceapplied/science.html AQA Specification]:

&lt;blockquote style='border: 1px solid blue; padding: 2em;'&gt;
You need to produce a portfolio of evidence which shows that you can plan and conduct an investigation and present your findings in a suitable way for a chosen client.

Your portfolio of evidence should... demonstrate knowledge of the following: •  how to plan an investigation; •  how to carry out the investigation; •  recording and processing the data obtained; •  evaluating and drawing conclusions from the investigation; •  presenting the outcomes of the investigation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=How you will be assessed=

This unit is assessed through the work you complete for your portfolio.

The marking criteria are found in the AQA specification.  

'''Most suggestions below have suggestions for a client's problem which needs to be addressed. This is an important aspect of the Unit 7 task - the investigation must meet a realistic requirement. Changes to the suggestions below, or additional suggestions, are welcome - this is a wiki after all!'''&lt;ref&gt;Teachers or candidates reading this article of suggested investigations need to be aware that the specification is clearly based around the needs of a client who needs to know something for a purpose.  All the investigations appear to be about a particular scientific observation, feature, phenomenon or principle.  None appear to be linked to client with a problem that needs solving.  When undertaking this Unit 7 investigation the list of ideas suggested here need to be translated into a problem that needs solving - the specification is APPLIED science and should not simply be based on an investigation out of context.

Here is a list of suggestions for Science Investigations. Please add/amend/extend the list as you see fit. This is essentially a [[w:Brainstorming|brainstorm]]...

==Chemistry==

===Non-coalescing drops===

'''Client:''' Some industries will mix liquids by cascading one liquid into another, assuming mixing will be complete. These drops may prevent complete mixing and need to be investigated.

Recent research has shed light on this phenomenon: The fast-moving shiny drops that skid across the surface of soapy water. Detergents play a crucial role – but how does the concentration of detergent affect the drops? What about ‘non-ionic’ detergents? What about a surface of anionic detergents and drops of cationic ones?

Challenges: Making drop-producing apparatus, Researching the chemistry of detergents, Assessing the numbers of drops

===Viscosity kinetics===

'''Client:''' Chemical producers who rely on reactions in solution will need to know how viscosity might affect rates of the reaction.

Many chemical reactions depend on molecules colliding, so slowing the rate of collisions will slow the rate of the reaction. In solution, the viscosity of the solvent can affect the reaction by slowing the collision rate, but it does not work for every reaction. The reaction between calcium carbonate and acids is highly dependent on viscosity, but when acids react with thiosulphate the viscosity seems not to be a factor.

Challenges: Assessing the viscosity of solutions, Researching and investigating the kinetics of reactions.

===Marble chip reaction with acid===

'''Client:''' Chemical industries using heterogeneous reactions will need to know how the rate of reaction can be altered.

How is the rate affected by various factors (e.g. surface area, temperature, concentration, stirring, viscosity, ionic strength). Estimation of surface area of marble chips.

===Sodium Thiosulphate and Hydrochloric acid reaction (‘disappearing cross’)===

'''Client:''' Chemical engineers wishing to check if turbidity is a useful surrogate measurement for whether a reaction has reached completion.

How does the reaction respond to changes in acid concentration (it is first order for thiosulphate concentration but varies from first to zero order with acid).

===How can we assess the amount of oil contamination on beaches?===

'''Client:''' Various groups will want to assess oil contamination, and a simple quick method would be appreciated.

The method used solvent extraction. Sand samples were laced with oil and the efficiency of recovery was measured. The sensitivity of the method was also estimated.

===Synthesis and isolation of propanoic acid from propan-1-ol.===

'''Client:''' Chemical suppliers who want to investigate production of this chemical.

Trialling different methods.

===Making biodiesel from waste vegetable oil.===

'''Client:''' Motoring enthusiasts who want to make their own environmentally-friendly and cheap fuel.

Using methanol and sodium hydroxide it is possible to make diesel fuel from old chip fat.

===Analysing the gases remaining after burning a candle in a gas jar.===

'''Client:''' Motor vehicle engineers who want to check the composition of exhaust gases.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is easy; it is readily absorbed with NaOH.

O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is harder; an oxygen probe is very useful but otherwise oxygen could be absorbed by, for example, the slow reaction of steel wool.

CO is challenging; it will be absorbed by CuCl solution but it is in very low concentrations.

===Extraction of caffeine from tea.===

'''Client:''' Suppliers or independent analysts who want to assess the caffeine content of tea products. Chemical suppliers who want to provide pure caffeine to clients.

&lt;ref name=IB/&gt;This method usually involves solvent extraction with a chlorinated alkane (e.g. dichloromethane or 1,1,1,-trichloroethane). With care it is possible to recycle the solvent and avoid health and environmental damage.

==Physics==

===Shear-thickening fluids===

'''Client:''' Manufacturers of military flak jackets are investigating if jackets can be made flexible at low strain but rigid at high strain by incorporating shear-thickening fluids.

Corn starch mixed with water has bizarre properties - under low strain it behaves as a liquid but if hit with a hammer it solidifies and shatters. What composition achieves the best transition from fluid to solid? What force is required to achieve the transition?

===Mpemba effect===

'''Client:''' Ice-cream manufacturers who want to reduce time by freezing their product from warm samples instead of cooling to room temperature before freezing.

Strangely, under the right conditions, warm water will freeze faster than cooler water. Various reasons for this have been proposed, but it is still a prime example of an experiment that defies intuition.

Challenges: Research the literature on the phenomenon. Establish conditions under which the effect is observed. Monitor the experiment closely to discover what causes the effect. Use the information discovered to design a change the conditions so that the effect is no longer observed.

===Studying the impact of air rifle pellets in gelatin.===

'''Client:''' Forensic laboratories investigating wounding incidents. Air rifle manufacturers concerned about safety.

The student made ballistic-concentration gelatin and assessed the velocity of the air rifle pellet and its subsequent penetration into the gelatin target.

===Making a vee-notch flowmeter from a plastic milk bottle and calibrating it.===

'''Client:''' People who might require a cheap method to assess flow rates of running water e.g. environmental surveyors, central heating engineers.

This is a very simple experiment, but challenging to do well. The student will need to measure the water level exactly as well as measuring the flow rate by collecting water over a measured period of time.

==Biology==

===Thermal death point of cell membranes.===

'''Client:''' Farmers who would like to predict which crops would fare better in conditions of increased summer temperatures.

Using a colorimeter, it is easy to assess damage to the cell membranes of beetroot samples by the amount of pigment they release to the medium. This correlates to the temperature at which the beetroot is incubated. Red cabbage seems to require a higher temperature which may reflect the mediterranean origins of brassicas. Non-pigments plants could be assessed by measuring the amount of protein/salts/carbohydrate/etc they release.

===Peroxidase activity.===

'''Client:''' Health food suppliers who wish to promote the anti-oxidant properties of various foods.

The peroxidase activty of various organisms can be assessed by measuring the rate of oxygen production (either collecting the gas and measuring its volume, timing how long an enzyme-impregnated circle of paper takes to rise to the surface, or datalogging the decrease in mass of the sample as gas is released). Organisms compared could be: animal/fungus/plant or different varieties of pepper. The effect of temperature or other conditions on the enzyme could also be studied. Lead cations and nitrate anions are both inhibitors, although the latter is not well known as an inhibitor.

==Psychology==

===Investigating the colour perception of a range of subjects.===

'''Client:''' Paint and dye manufacturers who would like to identify if different client groups would use different names for the same colour.

There are interesting gender differences in identifying greens and pink.

==References==

      <comment>moved [[Karrigell Tutorial/Managing The Database]] to [[Karrigell/Managing The Database]]: Merge</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Database engine==
Karrigell can use any database engine (MySQL, SQLite, etc) using the appropriate module. For this example we will use a very simple module that stores the data we need : for each CD in the collection, the artist name and the title of the album

Copy this in a module called &lt;tt&gt;simpledb.py&lt;/tt&gt; :

 def read(filename):
     records = []
     try:
         for line in open(filename):
             records.append(line.strip().split(&quot;#&quot;))
     except IOError:
         pass
     return records
 
 def save(records,filename):
     out = open(filename,'w')
     for items in records:
         out.write('#'.join(items)+'\n')
     out.close()

When you import the module in a script you simply use its functions &lt;tt&gt;read()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;save()&lt;/tt&gt;. The information is stored in a list of tuples

For our CD collection application, the information will consist in only 2 values : the artist name and the CD title. If we call the database file &lt;tt&gt;mycds.db&lt;/tt&gt; the code to print all the CDs in an HTML table will simply be :

 simpledb = Import('simpledb')
 cds = simpledb.read('mycds.db')
 for (artist,title) in cds:
     print artist,title

Notice the way you import the module &lt;tt&gt;simpledb.py&lt;/tt&gt; : you can't use the usual &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; statement, because in a shared environment like a web server, there are issues with the resolution of module names to files in the file system. Karrigell uses a built-in function &lt;tt&gt;Import(&lt;i&gt;module_url&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; for user-defined modules ; for the modules in the standard Python distribution, you can safely use &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt;

==Home page with the CD list==
We can now modify the &lt;tt&gt;index()&lt;/tt&gt; function to print the list of CDs:

 '''simpledb = Import('simpledb')'''
 
 def index():
     print &quot;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My record collection&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&quot;
     
     # login / logout
     logged = hasattr(Session(),&quot;user&quot;) and Session().user is not None
     if logged:
         print 'Logged in as %s&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;' %Session().user
         print '&amp;lt;a href=&quot;logout&quot;&amp;gt;Logout&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;'
     else:
         print '&amp;lt;a href=&quot;login&quot;&amp;gt;Login&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;'
 
     &lt;b&gt;# print existing records
     cds = simpledb.read('mycds.db')
     if cds:
         print '&amp;lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;'
         print '&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Artist&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Title&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;'
         for (artist,title) in cds:
             print '&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;%s&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;%s&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;' %(artist, title)
         print '&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;'
     else:
         print &quot;No CD in the collection&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&quot;
 
     # prompt logged in users to enter a new record
     if logged:
         print '&amp;lt;a href=&quot;new_cd&quot;&amp;gt;Enter new CD&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;'&lt;/b&gt;
 
     # page counter
     Include('../counter.py',counter_file='counter.txt')

Notice that &lt;tt&gt;simpledb&lt;/tt&gt; is imported at the module level, not inside the function &lt;tt&gt;index()&lt;/tt&gt; : the names defined at module level are available in the functions, exactly like in ordinary Python scripts

==Adding new CDs==
For logged-in users there is a link to enter new CDs in the database. The href attribute of this link is &lt;tt&gt;new_cd&lt;/tt&gt;, so we must write a function &lt;tt&gt;new_cd()&lt;/tt&gt;

This function will print a form to enter the CD artist and title, and submit the data to another function which will actually write the information in the database, then return to the home page

At this stage you shouldn't have problems to understand the code below :

 def new_cd():
     print '&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;New CD&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;'
     print '&amp;lt;form action=&quot;insert_new_cd&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&amp;gt;'
     print 'Artist &amp;lt;input name=&quot;artist&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;'
     print 'Title &amp;lt;input name=&quot;title&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;'
     print '&amp;lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Ok&quot;&amp;gt;'
     print '&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;'
 
 def insert_new_cd(artist,title):
     cds = simpledb.read('mycds.db')
     cds.append((artist,title))
     simpledb.save(cds,'mycds.db')
     raise HTTP_REDIRECTION,&quot;index&quot;

Add these functions to &lt;tt&gt;index.ks&lt;/tt&gt; and enter a couple of CDs in the database. Each time you are back to the home page you should see the collection growing

==Editing records==
Logged-in users should be able to edit the information about a CD : on the list they should see a link &quot;Edit&quot; sending them to a page where the information will be available for editing

This requires that the information about the CD is carried from the home page to the edition page. For this we could append the information about the CD (artist + title) to the link, for instance : &lt;tt&gt;href = edit?artist=Beatles&amp;title=Revolver&lt;/tt&gt; ; but database engines usually provide record identifiers, that is, integers which identify the record

In our simple database we can use the index of the item in the list as identifier, so that we can rewrite the code to print the CD collection this way :

    # print existing records
    simple db = Import('simpledb')
    cds = simpledb.read('mycds.db')
    if cds:
        print '&amp;lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;'
        print '&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Artist&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Title&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;'
        '''for num,(artist,title) in enumerate(cds)''':
            print '&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;%s&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;%s&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;' %(artist, title)
            &lt;b&gt;if logged:
                print '&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;edit?num=%s&quot;&amp;gt;Edit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;' %num&lt;/b&gt;
            print '&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;'
        print '&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;'
    else:
        print &quot;No CD in the collection&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&quot;

The function &lt;tt&gt;edit()&lt;/tt&gt; will receive one argument called &lt;tt&gt;num&lt;/tt&gt;. All arguments passed to functions in Karrigell Services are bytestrings, so before using this argument &lt;tt&gt;num&lt;/tt&gt; as the index in a list don't forget to convert it to an integer

 def edit(num):
     cds = simpledb.read('mycds.db')
     artist,title = cds['''int(num)''']
     print '&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;New CD&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;'
     print '&amp;lt;form action=&quot;update_cd&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&amp;gt;'
     print '&amp;lt;input name=&quot;num&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;%s&quot;&amp;gt;' %num
     print 'Artist &amp;lt;input name=&quot;artist&quot; value=&quot;%s&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;' %artist
     print 'Title &amp;lt;input name=&quot;title&quot; value=&quot;%s&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;' %title
     print '&amp;lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Ok&quot;&amp;gt;'
     print '&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;'
 
 def update_cd(num,artist,title):
     cds = simpledb.read('mycds.db')
     cds[int(num)] = (artist,title)
     simpledb.save(cds,'mycds.db')
     raise HTTP_REDIRECTION,&quot;index&quot;

==Removing records==
The final step is to enable deletion of CDs from the base : once again, edit the function &lt;tt&gt;index()&lt;/tt&gt; like this

    # print existing records
    simpledb = Import('simpledb')
    cds = simpledb.read('mycds.db')
    if cds:
        print '&amp;lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;'
        print '&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Artist&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Title&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;'
        &lt;b&gt;if logged:
            print '&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;'*2&lt;/b&gt;
        print '&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;'
        for num,(artist,title) in enumerate(cds):
            print '&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;%s&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;%s&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;' %(artist, title)
            if logged:
                print '&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;edit?num=%s&quot;&amp;gt;Edit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;' %num
                &lt;b&gt;print '&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;remove?num=%s&quot;&amp;gt;Remove&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;' %num&lt;/b&gt;
            print '&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;'
        print '&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;'
    else:
        print &quot;No CD in the collection&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&quot;

and add a new function, &lt;tt&gt;remove()&lt;/tt&gt;:

 def remove(num):
     cds = simpledb.read('mycds.db')
     del cds[int(num)]
     simpledb.save(cds,'mycds.db')
     raise HTTP_REDIRECTION,&quot;index&quot;

==Summary==
We now have a complete application to manage our CD collection. The structure of the application in the script index.ks is as clear as in any Python module :

 simpledb = Import('simpledb')
 
 def index():
     ...
     # login / logout
     ...
     # print existing records
     ...
     # prompt logged in users to enter a new record
     ...
     # page counter
     ...
 def login():
     ...
 def check_login(login,passwd):
     ...
 def logout():
     ...
 def new_cd():
     ...
 def insert_new_cd(artist,title):
     ...
 def edit(num):
     ...
 def update_cd(num,artist,title):
     ...

D's classes only support single inheritance and interfaces. While interfaces are sufficient to reproduce many of the uses of multiple inheritance, there are some things they don't suffice for. Mixins were originally added to the language to fill in many of these other cases.

== Regular Templates ==

Before discussing mixins, it is necessary to discuss the normal syntax for templates. The class and function template syntax discussed in the previous two chapers is actually a shorthand for the regular syntax. A &quot;normal&quot; template looks like this:

 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;template&lt;/font&gt; Foo(A, B, C)
 {
     A a;
     B b;
     C c;
 }

A template consists of a name (Foo), a parameter list (A, B, C), and a series of declarations (a, b, c). When a template is instantiated, the parameters are replaced with the arguments provided by the instantiation. The declarations are placed at the same scope as the template.

 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;alias&lt;/font&gt; Foo!(&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;real&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[]) F;
 F.a = 10;
 F.b = 5.8;
 F.c = &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&quot;hello!&quot;&lt;/font&gt;;

Since the above example is not very useful, here's what the long form of the &quot;min&quot; function from the previous section looks like.

 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;template&lt;/font&gt; min(T)
 {
     T min(T t1, T t2)
     {
         &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;if&lt;/font&gt; (t1 &lt; t2) &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; t1;
         &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;else return&lt;/font&gt; t2;
     }
 }

This also shows another interesting feature of D's templates. If a template contains a single declaration, and that declaration has the same name as the template, then one can refer to that single member implicitly. Combined with ''implicit function template instantiation'' (discussed in the previous section), the following are all equivalent:

 min!(&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;).min(1, 2); &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;// long form&lt;/font&gt;
 min!(&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;)(1, 2); &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;// with the single-element rule&lt;/font&gt;
 min(1, 2); &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;// with IFTI&lt;/font&gt;

== Mixins ==

Normally, when a template is instantiated, its declarations are inserted into whatever scope the template exists in. With a mixin, the declarations may be inserted into the current scope. A trivial example looks like this:

 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;template&lt;/font&gt; Foo()
 {
     &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; i;
     &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[] s;
 }
 
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/font&gt; S
 {
     &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;mixin&lt;/font&gt; Foo;
 }

(Note that if the template's parameter list is empty, then the mixin may elide the &lt;tt&gt;!()&lt;/tt&gt;.) The result is that the struct S has two members: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; i&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[] s&lt;/tt&gt;.

Mixins may also be named, allowing the same mixin to be mixed-in to the current scope more than once. Here's a more complex example.

 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;template&lt;/font&gt; Writer(T)
 {
     &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; write(T t)
     {
         writefln(t);
     }
 }
 
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/font&gt; S
 {
     &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;mixin&lt;/font&gt; Writer!(&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;int&lt;/font&gt;) IntWriter;
     &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;mixin&lt;/font&gt; Writer!(&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[]) StrWriter;
 }

 S s;
 s.IntWriter.write(12);
 s.StrWriter.write(&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&quot;hello!&quot;&lt;/font&gt;);</text>

Wikibooks is an excellent way of getting a class to work together and produce in-depth articles in their field of study.

There are books for every level of student on the Wikibooks' bookshelves and, being a young project, many of these books need much more content. Several universities and schools have already produced excellent books by working together:
*[[Engineering Acoustics]] ''([[w:Purdue University|Purdue University]])''
*[[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]] ''([[w:Old Dominion University|Old Dominion University]])''
*[[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]] ''([[w:Old Dominion University|Old Dominion University]])''

==Evaluation tools==
Students can register their own accounts, which hides the IP address, increasing the level of privacy. This also gives each student a user page to let other Wikibookians know what they're working on, and a talk page for communication with other users of the wiki.

==Ideas for assignments==
Why not organize your homework around Wikibooks?  Ask each student to contribute a paragraph, a page, or a chapter. You can easily track the progression of a particular page with the history tab, and [[Special:Contributions]] lets you see what each user has written.

This is an age where low-income students frequently have access to the internet but lack the funds to buy textbooks. The aim of Wikibooks is to supply textbooks to the world free of charge so that anyone, from Zaire to Detroit, can have open access to knowledge. Your gift of knowledge in these formative years of Wikibooks may become one of the most valuable things that you do in your life.

==Getting started==
*Read [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]].
*Add your project to [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]].
*[[Help:Starting a new page or book|Start a new book]] or edit an old one.
*[[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance|Ask for help]] if you need it.

== Recipe contributions ==

Working through some general &quot;housekeeping&quot; I noticed that while you have contributed a number of recipes many of them state a &quot;source&quot;.  Without clarification and licensing these probably constitute a copyright violation and as such cannot be left on Wikibooks.  I hope you will login again before these get deleted to review the situation.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:02, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
:In practice these have now been deleted as copyright violations.  Please feel free to contact me should you have any queries but could I ask you to be careful with any future contributions - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:45, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Honeysuckles''' (genus ''Lonicera''; syn. ''Caprifolium'' Mill.) are arching shrubs or twining vines in the family Caprifoliaceae, native to the Northern Hemisphere. There are about 180 species of honeysuckle, with by far the greatest diversity in China, where over 100 species occur; by comparison, Europe and North America have only about 20 native species each. Widely known species include ''[[../Lonicera periclymenum/]]'' (European Honeysuckle), ''[[../Lonicera japonica/]]'' (Japanese Honeysuckle, White Honeysuckle, or Chinese Honeysuckle) and ''[[../Lonicera sempervirens/]]'' (Coral Honeysuckle, Trumpet Honeysuckle, or Woodbine Honeysuckle).

==Generic Characteristics==
The leaves are opposite, simple, and from 1&amp;ndash;10 cm long; most are deciduous but some are evergreen. Many of the species have sweetly-scented, tubular flowers that produce a sweet, edible nectar. The fruit is a red, blue or black berry containing several seeds; in most species the berries are mildly [[poison]]ous, but a few (notably ''[[Lonicera caerulea]]'') have edible berries.

==Cultivation and uses==
''Lonicera xylosteum'' (Fly Honeysuckle) is a common homeopathic remedy, used for asthma, breathing difficulties and syphilis. ''Lonicera periclymenum'' (European honeysuckle) is an uncommon homeopathic remedy, used for irritability with violent outbursts.

Wood cuttings from the species ''Lonicera tartarica'', native to Eurasia, are sold as cat toys. The wood contains nepetalactone, which is the active ingredient found in catnip. Many breeds of cats react to the scent of the wood and will paw, lick or rub against it.

''[[../Lonicera japonica/]]''  and ''[[../Lonicera maackii/]]'' (Amur Honeysuckle) are considered invasive species in the United States and in New Zealand. Honeysuckle can be controlled by cutting, flaming, or burning the plant to root level and repeating on two-week increments until nutrient reserves in the roots are depleted. Honeysuckle can also be controlled through annual applications of glyphosate, or through grubbing if high labor and soil destruction are not of concern.

Honeysuckles are also eaten by children, who remove the blossom by hand to suck at the sweet nectar in the center.

Another name for honeysuckle is '''woodbine'''; and '''eglantine''' is used in Milton's ''L'Allegro''.

During Victorian times, teenage girls were forbidden to bring honeysuckle home because it was thought to induce erotic dreams.

==Pests and Diseases==
The plant is eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species - see [[w:list of Lepidoptera which feed on Honeysuckles]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Intro =
I have been racking my brain to imagine a way to improve the general mood people have on this subject and also to modify any perception they have of me, and so this is an effort to avoid being boring and to provide you a swell read, this will not be the end of Wikibooks, this is not the beginning of the end of Wikibooks this is only part of the beginning of Wikibooks, you (fellow users), should take a step back and see that we are also creating history (in a very small scale) here, collaboration and cooperative developing is the future, this is indeed the beginning of the end of a world were International Corporations, Governments and other selfish and controlling entities decide what people should know about and in what format, we are now at the start of an era were content will be produced by the masses for the masses, but I hope that they hurry up the next phase were they will be ranking all this content because most of the stuff is really a waste of time.

An Arbitration, this stuff is serious, but people do give so much more importance to this simple problems than they merit, it is a minority indeed the ones that can have a dispute or resolve a conflict and keep their sense of humor intact... and so with all the respect possible and intended, I will now start my rebuttal of the accusations presented against me...

= The &quot;problem&quot; =
We are here in this situation at present, well, because of me, even if some people do consider me &quot;the problem&quot;, I must assure you I'm not, and will try to prove to you that the reality is not as it has been depicted to you or as you are perceiving it (no you are not entering the TwilightZone),  I don't like conflicts nor actively seek them (I'm lead to believe that they do seek me, trough), but probably because I can't let a wrong deed pass or something that I don't think proper without a comment and I'm not here to socialize or make friends (yep, this is a bit of a social network but I really, really don't have the time or inclination to get into it) and so I have no problem agitating the water. I can pass also for being a bit crazy, but I assure you I'm not, I'm fully aware that I'm fighting a decision of an administrator that probably has many supporters and I'm fairly unknown or do have a bad reputation (I personally don't care but I can understand that as a problem, so I will grant you that I may be a bit crazy, but aren't we all), and this is why I'm taking the time to try to explain you a bit about me, since most of you have probably never exchanged a word with me (please don't start now, it is fine as it is), and when you do it is only to deal with &quot;problems&quot; I'm involved with (well in a few years people tend to step on a few toes if they are active), ok that's enough about me.

So the problem is (I will tell you now, just bare with me), after what I see as a bunch of misunderstandings, probably some abuse (not by me, well you did expect me to say that didn't you?) and because I DO have a bad reputation. I got blocked, well, not this one time but tree times now, at the last block I had no choice but to push the envelope further (I seem to do it a bit more than others and then get even more of a bad reputation, well we will see), but I can live with it, I'm not fighting only for my sake but to improve the infrastructure to all Wikibookians, heck I see myself as the &quot;creator&quot; of the &quot;fork problem&quot; (hmm well that didn't end well and the infrastructure in that respect is almost as bad or worse), so one more discussion if for the good of the community will not scare me, my only problem is the time consumption this kind of processes lead to, this kind of policy making and discussion is not why I chose to participate on the Wikibooks project, but, because I haven't just yet lost all my trust in the project and see that the biggest problem we have is the lack of interest of most users, on just getting involved.

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Panic2k4 Block log]
* 22:56, 3 January 2007 [[User:SBJohnny]] blocked &quot;Panic2k4&quot; with an expiry time of 2 weeks (same reason, different week.)
* 23:04, 10 December 2006 [[User:SBJohnny]] blocked &quot;Panic2k4&quot; with an expiry time of 2 weeks (continued disruption, see user's talk page)
* 22:43, 9 December 2006 [[User:SBJohnny]] blocked &quot;Panic2k4&quot; with an expiry time of 2 hours (trolling)

Please take note of the dates that they may be important to reconstruct the events, I will try to give them in all steps, but I will deal the subjects in order of relevance to me, not chronological and not in order to the actual discussion on the table

== [[User:Whiteknight]] ==
I place my self at the mercy of this &quot;court&quot;, because I have wronged and made huge mistakes (well probably not so many as they try to convince you but at least two and one was not that great) and so I must make reparations to the people I've so greatly &quot;annoyed&quot;, first and foremost I will address the one I mostly wronged, and who I most respect of all persons that have taken the time to express their views, he in his magnanimousness (maybe he probably didn't noticed), decided to spare me from his wrath, he is [[User:Whiteknight]], it was with real dread that I have read his fantastic report on the subject that have placed me on this situation and his words couldn't be more correct and ring with more truth, truly a fantastic report of the events and an example to be fallowed.&lt;br&gt;
(I must remark that some of the report doesn't deal directly with the issue under discussion, and the user doesn't seem to be doing any accusation, it is only a correct, complete and probably instructive report of the events, or at least the ones the user has taken notice, one that I will make use further on. I also take this chance, since the user commented on the first stage of the proceeding, and since it is my understanding and he seems to indicate so on some of his posts outside of the arbitration, I have broken some of his warnings, I request him to state what and where in the next step if he wishes and if they aren't addressed in Error 1 or Error 2, if he doesn't wish them on the log of the Arbitration and as I don't seem to have big problems talking to him, please leave them in my talk page, at least I will try to see what I could have done differently, txs)

=== Error 1 ===
What made me fear so much his comments on the matter was that I indeed was rash in a comment I made to him, after he spent time sending me a warning ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=677150&amp;oldid=677023 here]) I was very rude on my reply as can be seen [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Whiteknight&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=677942 here]], for it I'm truly desolated and will presently take the chance to apologize, I was way way out of line, but as I said this was an error and I admit it, I take the chance to publicly correct it (had I made the same remark to SBJohnny I probably would have been blocked for yet another reason). My reply in this case is important as part of a sequence of events were I was becoming a bit out of control due to a interference from Darklama (he did got me going for a moment there), but this I will explain later on.
(the issue is not related with the problem that brings us here, but should be noted for the record as part of a sequence of events, the post and consequent conversation was about a tag for deletion, VfD, I added to a page Darklama created on the book namespace consisting on a copy of content from several other pages, it was in my view a duplication of content inside the book namespace and could constitute a corruption of the contribution history since it was intended as a replacement on the book, he did not only added it to his new TOC but to the &quot;main&quot; TOC replacing the original pages, he later moved the page to his user space and that was probably what [[User:Whiteknight]] saw and motivated the first post)

== [[User:James Dennett]] ==
I have nothing but respect for the user, I consider it a very welcomed contributor the the [[C++ Programming]] book, I recognize him as fellow author as he has for a long time contributed his own content and insights to the project, I even think that I was responsible for his participation (I may be wrong), due to some posts I made to the newsgroups related to the book topic asking for participation on the book, I recognize the users extensive and deep knowledge on the subject (I do know he has more knowledge and experience on the subject than I do), I see in him as in myself the willingness to invest effort in writing and editing, and to foster the evolution of that particular project.

It is with some pain that I have read the user comments and his views regarding myself, I never did engage the user in any other subject before this post [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Functions&amp;oldid=676885 here]], regarding his contributions to the book or in any other matter, and he has been contributing even before the &quot;fork&quot; (2004).

I take his comments very personally and think he was lead to those observations not only because he was unaware that other problems existed, and (as I was before I run into my first problems with Paddu) he didn't seem very interested in the social structure and wasn't actively engaged on Wikibooks as a whole, until now (if he was I didn't noticed), I've noticed that the user seemed to be unaware for example how to use templates or that he should signing his posts (as I was at the start, and I also didn't particularly care about understanding these nuances) or to avoid changing other users signed posts, this provided me with a feeling that the user was willing to participate on the content but didn't give much importance to the particulars (I have no problem with that), and I value his contributions very much. My feeling is that the users interpretation of my post were not probably one of an user with more experience on Wikibooks and he was, as I, a casualty of an attempt to fabricate an event and instrumentalized with intention by other parties in specific due to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28internet%29 darklamas interference after my post], that was the only instance that I've stepped out of character and I'm very sorry in having been lured into a more hash debate on that same talk page (and  committing Error 1). Because I could see the matter form the user point of view I took the first and even the second block without contesting their validity, and since then I have watched darklamas actions with much distrust.

The user also mentions another problem on another post I made, were I stated that he didn't have the time to correct the problem (It may have been my wrong interpretation of the post he made in his talk page) but I don't see that as a problem, he changed my statement as he felt was correct and I do think that he may be giving more importance to what I said that he should but I have no problem in having him correcting the post and can even empathize with him that because of  his views of the events he took it as attempt of attack (it was not my intention, I was expressing my interpretation of his post not more no less), anyway I took in my hand the page changes the user made and corrected them as can be seen [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/Functions&amp;action=history here]] and the user accepted the changes as can be seen [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Functions here]] and after the first block  I asked apologies for any wrong doing to the user as can be seen [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJames_Dennett&amp;diff=679897&amp;oldid=679296 here]]. (as a side note I would encourage readers to examine the history and the posts made to the users talk page).   

=== Error 2 ===
Taking in consideration the user knowledge of what was going on, I should have avoided engaging Darklama on the same page I was addressing the user and by doing that getting him involved and  giving the user an impression that his contributions weren't of value or in error (on content), I still affirm that they were on format (but I will address them later with the user if he so wishes, they are not a factor on the problem nor do I have any dispute with the user, I think the perception of the problem the user has of events are valid and I tried to address them, but I think it is was based on lack of experience and I didn't break custom practice at Wikibooks as I will extend on the examination of block 1).

== [[User:SBJohnny]] ==
Now that I have addressed the issues that I think were of an higher importance to me and should merit an extra attention I will address the issue that generated this proceeding. I must start by stating that in no way my participating in this process is intended to humiliate or degrade [[User:SBJohnny]] image in the community and not even is it meant to evaluate the user's performance in the past or in other subject, not even on the one that lead to me being blocked, the issue at hand only relates to the outcome or the &quot;sentence&quot;, I don't see that as a reevaluation of his decision and is intended to address my rights to recur from that decision, since I and the user didn't agree on the outcome. Any other results will be up to the Arbiter and the Wikibooks community, I had annexed a request that was based on my interpretation of events, I don't think that even it should be taken in consideration in the outcome of the Arbitration, it is probably a subject that would have to be addressed in a broader discussion as such I will proceed to state facts and try to reply to the accusations and statements he did commit to this Arbitration.

I still can't understand how the user can make some affirmations if he doesn't have a conscious intention in provoking confusion on the readers (to say the least), but once more I will try to point out were his logic is flowed and why (this is not the first time I do so, I assure you I didn't lure him into that position, I have repeatedly stated and tried to show that some of his comments regarding me were not correct, alas, this will be the last time, but I really wish to understand his motivations).

Reading his comments one notices that he mentions the dispute between me and Darklama, that is correct as I and Darklama have been having been discussing Darklama's changes to the structure of the book since I posted my first messages on Darklama's talk page [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADarklama&amp;diff=584432&amp;oldid=191012 here]] (in 14 September 2006) (when the Darklama deleted some content on a few pages, and did start to reformat the book), but then [[User:SBJohnny]] states that Darklama wishes to make some changes and become involved in the book, well, to be honest he should have said that Darklama did made some changes and that I did not objected to his participation (he could even saved me some trouble by pointing out that I did not made any revert of Darklama's changes until just before block 3, but I see how that could be hard to manage since I'm a Wikibooks demon), my objections to Darklama's changes are stated on my talk page since I and Darklama were able to establish the bases for our dispute (and it was going more or less well, until block 2, but I'll deal with them by steps later), as can be seen on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Panic2k4#call_for_comment my talk page, this statements] predate any involvement of [[User:SBJohnny]], even the call for comments for the dispute and clearly show that since then the [[User:SBJohnny]] misrepresented my views and intentions, as an later example you can see [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk%3AOwnership&amp;diff=698434&amp;oldid=698427 here]] (there are many more, even in his previous comments), (I've tried to be politically correct and avoid calling it a plain lie, as I can't attest to the user's memory recall capabilities, and I wish not to be involved in personal attacks, heck, this here are probably the first words I write about his person).

[[User:SBJohnny]] seem to understand his involvement on the &quot;dispute&quot; as moderation (but it's clear he was not) and that a knowladge of the topic of the book was necessary (as it will be clear it wasn't). I admit to have called users (in this case 3 administrators) to comment on the problem, from all tree, [[User:SBJohnny]] was the more unfriendly on his comments (he clearly didn't agree with any of the points I was making, and that wasn't a requirement) but did came into the discussion with a clear premade idea about my defense for an abuse of the be bold policy (I will not get into it now as it is outside of the scope of the Arbitration), calling the defense I was making against the alterations as a &quot;shot down&quot; of any changes Darklama wanted/wants to make (that was clearly incorrect) more information on that can be seen [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Panic2k4 my talk page]], one of the things that irked me was that after, he did clearly started an indirect personal attack to me stating and I quote  ''&quot;Follow [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick this] policy and you'll have no worries.&quot;'', this is, as is correctly stated on the talk page of that policy ''&quot;just a passive-aggressive proxy for personal attacks&quot;'' and very unbecoming of any wikibooks user, let alone an administrator, and clearly wasn't intended to solve anything, only to shush me, (am I'm to agree with the last line of the policy, is this the kind of helping hand one wishes on Wikibooks?!?), more, as [[User:SBJohnny]] continues thinking he is &quot;moderating&quot; it becomes clear that he is intent on only providing protection and validity for the other party actions, and as he clearly states the help he provides is directed on &quot;picking on me&quot;, this is sad and out of character for the user as I can't believe someone that acts in this way could be welcomed and granted administrative rights (I would like very much to comprehend what lead the user to treat me in that &quot;special&quot; way), that culminated in a [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Panic2k4#We.27re_done_talking_now fantastic post We're done talking now], (what did he expect after that), I had the right to revert the changes I hadn't agree with and that Darklama (with knowledge of that) performed during the strange block 2. Even if [[User:SBJohnny]] states that he asked the user not to do so, until now no action was done on my behalf, why am I so lucky to get such differentiated treatment ?!?&lt;br&gt;
(I don't think any answer from my questions will be provided during this arbitration, but I think only a blind person can't see that something very strange was happening, what aggravates me even more is that even if some or all of my points were incorrect a simple analysis of the actions Darklama performed was clearly an abuse of standard policies, any of the administrators that commented could have resolved and diffused the situation, geezz he starter moving and deleting content of the book, I really can't begin to comprehend how/why was this allowed, the restoration of disputed changes should occur even if talks are under way, if agreement if reached, reversion is always possible, by allowing changes to remain future contributors may be allowed to build upon contested pages/structures, this even considered common practice as can be seen [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AWindows_Programming&amp;diff=688819&amp;oldid=688814 here]] )  

*I did never became hostile except on Error 1 and Error 2 but never did break Wikibooks guidelines or policies, I may have been incorrect at most.
*I don't &quot;bite&quot; newcomers. (but I'm generally well feed and have all the shots in order)
*I don't like but did never avoided discussions related to the stated events.
*I think that wikilawyering is only a trow-in almost as bad as the one used for personal attacks, I can even become offended by being called, addressed or compared to a lawyer :), but I do seem to have an understanding of the GFDL that [[User:SBJohnny]] and Darklama don't agree with.
**What is the cover page
**authors vs contributors
**having Wikibooks generating print versions without the GFDL and/or the authors list
*It should by now be clear that I do respect Wikibookinas, what I refuse to do is give special treatment to administrators or specific users.
*I will not compromise on GFDL matters, the license is the core of what we do here and was the base for my participation on the project, I even have taken personal compromise in getting other authors to contribute content and that the license would be used. (I'm open to changing my interpretation if proven wrong or with valid arguments, and I don't use it to justify any user bashing or any evil deeds, but it seems the reverse is open game)
*I'm not in a &quot;battle&quot; with the community. I do think we (the community) have a need for clear policies and guidelines and need to be more clear in specific points.

=== block 1 ===
Since SBJohnny depict the 3rd block as a the result of a sequence of events and not on one specific charge I will address the other blocks. I have tried to explain to the other user the reasons of the post that lead to block 1, I will now show that it is a common practice and that the interpretation SBJohnny tried to extract from it is a bit overdone. 

It is common practice if another editor doesn't &quot;like&quot; (he must have a more valid justification) any contribution, he is entitled to revert it (it is a corner stone of the be bold guideline, without it the guideline couldn't exist), in this particular case the user did [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming%2FFunctions&amp;diff=673519&amp;oldid=673517 several edits] (very small, and during 3 distinct edits), consisting on changes of the meaning of phrases or just word replacement, I saw it (at the second edit) and noticed that they broke the logic of a single statement, I knew the user and did know who I was addressing (see comment to him above), for respect to him and his contributions I didn't revert (that would have been cleaner and would have avoided the exploitation of the event), and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Functions&amp;oldid=676885 gave user the chance to explain the logic behind that change in a very simple way] (and did not force him to do anything as is alleged), as I said somewhere else the &quot;obligation&quot; was simply to provide a feedback or not, like &quot;call me in 3 minutes or I will call you back&quot;, it is common practice for programmers to ask for control of a structure before they commit changes to it, in projects with several contributors or even when programming and so again I state that there were problems with my actions.

If anyone is guilty of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28internet%29 trolling] on that matter is darklama it is clear that the intent was to cause disruption, in the form of posting a messages that are inflammatory, insulting, or off-topic, with the intent of provoking a reaction from others. (well, he succeeded, but not even his actions would be worth a block or interpreted as a violation of Wikibooks policies or guidelines)

=== block 2 ===

On this one I'm as clueless as you are, I can't understand it, the only explanation to it is a reevaluation of block 1 but not on the reasons [[User:SBJohnny]] presented, he stated [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=680964&amp;oldid=680796 here]], fantastic, I did not cause any problems on this because Christmas was at the door and the community could be best served if I kept my mouth closed on this one.

The problem is bigger yet, this block resulted (probably on some offsite conversation, I'm now led to believe) since I was talking with another user (yup it was darklama) talk page, and explaining the problem of block 1, this violates my freedom of expression and even if your interpretation was correct, my point of view had the same value as yours, since I was talking to a third party on a private page, that is, by [[User:SBJohnny]] action any person that disagrees with any policy can't talk about it or express the wish for changes (not the problem here but the final result is that).

=== block 3 ===

Well this one was tipping point, as it was now clear to me that [[User:SBJohnny]] was (I will not call it moderator since on Wikibooks that entails that some power of decision is given to him by the disputing parties) acting as mediator (a forced one at that), and his actions only seemed to be directed at me and was actively validating Darklama actions and even enforcing them and acting only on the the other users behalf and with a excellent timing at that, he did not engage me to clear any of the reasons he used to decide any of the  previous block with me (action was taken on the spot and I don't think any of the 2 blocks were intended on stopping disruption of Wikibooks), after the post [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=707539&amp;oldid=706744 '''We're done talking now'''], I was left with no solution to the ever increasing problems I had and that were aggravated during block 2, and so my last resort was to as was my right revert the changes (my option is based on comment of other administrators and common practice), I only reverted part of the changes made during block 2 and it was my intention not to initiate a revert war (this were my first reverts during all this time) and I informed Darklama that I would do them also as a way to bring the user to the table again (we were doing more or less fine up to block 1 and his actions on block 2).

The user made mention to a warning he made that validated the block, I can't find or remember such warning, probably I suffered from the same problems Darklama experienced during his actions on block 2. (strangely enough only I got diagnosticated)

My actions in no way violated any guideline or policy and were minor, even if they didn't fallowed standard policy, compared to darklamas previous changes to the work. 

(I don't provide more information as it is readily available on my talk page and most of the participants, even the Arbiter  know this facts already, I only stated some more relevant events as to demonstrate and be clear that not all that was said on the accusation seems to agree with the way I see the events)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== [[User:Darklama]] ==

I do think I can understand [[User:Darklama]], I've also been a newcomer with even less knowledge about Wikibooks that he seems to have in such a small time(heck, he is an administrator and I even voted in support), at the time our roles were reverted in a similar situation (not in the particulars) I was the new user full of ideas and Paddu defended the existing structure but at least the solution we found did not cause any problem to both parties and ended the dispute. I have no personal problems with Darklama, only a divergence that is, for some time now, clearly stated and for what I can say, well defined in the evolution of the format of the book and some interpretations about more general legal matters, but since the second block, I have some suspicions about his behavior and the specific the way he has gone about &quot;resolving&quot; the problem, I will not address any of Darklama accusations, I did just that on the reply to SBJohnny, they are only an amplification for what SBJohnny wrote (or see it has the reverser, SBJohnny is a tuned down report of the same things, you pick what best suit you), a funny thing though, Darklama was the first to write in the Plaintiff Charges (well it's probably my paranoid side acting out), but since the event involving the other user (James Dennett) and going to the trouble of contacting Paddu, I think I can have some reasons to see some webbing and plotting, heck I even don't have a problem if they did talk about me being blocked or discussed how to proceed on IRC, I think that SBJohnny was pretty clear in his actions, how does [[User:Darklama]] puts it on is comments ''&quot;I do not believe SBJohnny was taking sides&quot;'', well, I let the readers decide on that one.

The user actions immediately after block 2 were abusive in relation the what we had agreed and against the &quot;normal&quot; way to resolve issues, as an example you can look how such edits are considered by actual policies [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AStaff_lounge&amp;diff=690202&amp;oldid=690175 here]], they were even more grave as the user was aware that I was opposed to the alterations and took advantage of the administrator actions (he his also an administrator), no action was taken against the user due to his alterations of the work. 

As a solution to my divergences with Darklama I can only propose an Arbitration or a moderation (I like the first better because all things are stated more clearly, but it takes to long and his to formal, we can probably ask the moderation to address in a similar fashion), I'll be opened to a similar process if the users wishes, since I don't trust my self control to continue being civil in case of an escalation of events, I have done all I could.

'''Timeline'''&lt;br&gt;
'''23:27, 14 September 2006'''(+- hours) Panic's [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADarklama&amp;diff=584432&amp;oldid=191012 first posts to Darklama].

== [[User:Paddu]] ==

Ha, the third element of the axis of good in the fight against the evil empire... (it calls to my mind images of North Korea :)

Well I don't have anything in particular to say about Paddu comments, as I said before (couldn't find the post), I don't have any personal hill filling about Paddu and consider our dispute closed as the time of the &quot;fork&quot;, my problems and probably Paddu's are more how the Wikibooks community let our dispute evolve at that time, we did try everything, the time to address that problem has passed and the user did stop to participate on Wikibooks and I can't be blamed for it as the other work remained there and the solution was not an imposition of anyones will, it was a mean to end the dispute and did just that, any way, I see his involvement as an irony of destiny, his situation was similar to the one I am on dealing with Darklama, I'm defending format as he was, but the time to discuss the problem as I said has passed I think none of us were truly satisfied with the outcome.

I take this chance to inform Paddu that I even took into my hands to defend his points of views for the original work and tried to show the administrator that forced the merge that your vision (objective) was not the same, not even the intended audience. I'm even sorry &quot;my&quot; version or &quot;my&quot; vision substituted &quot;yours&quot; in the end, on that regard you can still read all my argumentation of that time to avoid the merge. (Paddu had a more restricted approach to the evolution of the book, this is a bit more technical but I will only say that some of the things I added and are now part of the book were not wanted on the &quot;version&quot; Paddu defended, the structure is also was different, Paddu, wanted a hands-on approach a kind of FAQ with a step by step introduction to the language) my first contribution to Wikibooks and to the book can be seen [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC1&amp;oldid=48486 here]].

The involvement of Paddu in this case is yet another example of the somber actions of Darklama, but I think in the long run it will probably backfire, he (Paddu) is a very picky (as he do have low level of threshold to changes), I remember him causing a stir because I was archiving post with 30 days in a full page. I can positivity say that if doesn't start calling &quot;Broddy Murder&quot; because Darklama moved his posts he will be very out of character :), If Darklama thinks I'm leading him to desperation because I don't like some of his changes, he surly would love to have met Paddu when I was in that similar situation, my solution was the &quot;fork&quot; and so I can understand in part Darklamas motivations.&lt;br&gt;
(Paddu's talk page may also provide some more information, take the chance to also check it's history)

A [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Paddu&amp;oldid=711957#Moved_from_Panic.27s_talkpage... &quot;funny&quot; post of mine] can still be seen on Paddu's talk page, if Paddu takes the time to read all this mess and understand what my divergence is with Darklama, he will be having a laugh about it all. (I don't remember if Paddu had a sense of humor but other people will may find it funny in relation with the problem, I do)

= Closing words =
I think I have addressed all the problems but probably not all accusations made, as some don't even merit a response, I'm plainly evil and my motivation is the downfall of Wikibooks, I will savagely attack any who wish to participate on the project and if the events don't speak for themselves I don't think anything I may say will make you see them differently.

I wish that any of the parties of the accusation that think I didn't address any specific and &quot;reasonable&quot; accusation to state it on the next step of the Arbitration, I wish that if I stated something wrongly or made a bad assumption that they will clarify it, not only to me, but to any other reader, some of the events are particularly murky and others do seem to show bad intention, at least that is how I have become to see them, I truly think I have a good feel on how and why some events were presented and I'm even able to understand some of the view points that lead to some actions I don't think were proper (that was why I pushed this thing so far)

I did no personal attacks (if I did it was not my intentions and I tried to avoid doing them) and made clear where I was making interpretations and not stating facts so to prevent further confusion, regarding Darklama in particularly as I have stated before I have now a great level of mistrust as for SBJohnny, I can't piece it together the user seems to be one thing but his  actions and some comments sometimes are very out of character or at least that is how I perceive it.

I did not try to evolve other users on this or related problems, I have only asked some users that were already partially aware of the problem to check this page, and I never talked to another Wikibookian outside of the Wikibooks structure (anything I have written so far on all subjects are public record).

People that write books, should have fun doing it... but this is not writing books, this is more like politics and I hate politicians.</text>

This book is intended as a sophomore level university text book.  The coverage of subject material assures that the reader has a working knowledge of higher level languages in general and is familiar with a reasonable modern program development environment.  The purpose of the book is to introduce those already familiar with programming to a more system-oriented language that provides the programmer with a greater degree of freedom (and therefore responsibility). 

Our undergraduate Computer Science curriculum requires that our students learn at least three high level languages.  The first two semesters of the degree program use Java.   The course for which this book is designed follows early in the  sophomore year. This book assumes successful completion of those first two  courses and as such this book does not need to focus too much on general program structure, flow control or syntax.  Where structure, syntax and flow control are mentioned, the emphasis should be on how C differs from Java.

The rationale for developing this book is to provide students with a means to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contribute
&lt;li&gt;collaborate
&lt;li&gt;critique
&lt;li&gt;learn through explication and teaching&lt;/li&gt;

During the summer, we as a group will be in a position to decide if a) the book has value on its own and therefore should be more permanent b) has some components of merit that can be merged into existing wikibooks or c) should be discarded as an interesting but futile experiment. :-)

==Command Line Compilation with gcc==

== Compiling A Single-Source &quot;C&quot; Program ==

The easiest case of compilation is when you have all your source code set in a single file. This removes any unnecessary steps of synchronizing several files or thinking too much. Lets assume there is a file named 'single_main.c' that we want to compile. We will do so using a command line similar to this: 

cc single_main.c 

Note that we assume the compiler is called &quot;cc&quot;. If you're using a GNU compiler, you'll write 'gcc' instead. If you're using a Solaris system, you might use 'acc', and so on. Every compiler might show its messages (errors, warnings, etc.) differently, but in all cases, you'll get a file 'a.out' as a result, if the compilation completed successfully. Note that some older systems (e.g. SunOs) come with a C compiler that does not understand ANSI-C, but rather the older 'K&amp;R' C style. In such a case, you'll need to use gcc (hopefully it is installed), or learn the differences between ANSI-C and K&amp;R C (not recommended if you don't really have to), or move to a different system. 
You might complain that 'a.out' is a too generic name (where does it come from anyway? - well, that's a historical name, due to the usage of something called &quot;a.out format&quot; for programs compiled on older Unix systems). Suppose that you want the resulting program to be called &quot;single_main&quot;. In that case, you could use the following line to compile it: 

cc single_main.c -o single_main 

Every compiler I've met so far (including the glorious gcc) recognized the '-o' flag as &quot;name the resulting executable file 'single_main'&quot;. 
 

== Running The Resulting Program ==

Once we created the program, we wish to run it. This is usually done by simply typing its name, as in: 

single_main 

However, this requires that the current directory be in our PATH (which is a variable telling our Unix shell where to look for programs we're trying to run). In many cases, this directory is not placed in our PATH. Aha! - we say. Then lets show this computer who is smarter, and thus we try: 

./single_main 

This time we explicitly told our Unix shell that we want to run the program from the current directory. If we're lucky enough, this will suffice. However, yet one more obstacle could block our path - file permission flags. 
When a file is created in the system, it is immediately given some access permission flags. These flags tell the system who should be given access to the file, and what kind of access will be given to them. Traditional Unix systems use 3 kinds of entities to which they grant (or deny) access: The user which owns the file, the group which owns the file, and everybody else. Each of these entities may be given access to read the file ('r'), write to the file ('w') and execute the file ('x'). 
Now, when the compiler created the program file for us, we became owners of the file. Normally, the compiler would make sure that we get all permissions to the file - read, write and execute. It might be, thought that something went wrong, and the permissions are set differently. In that case, we can set the permissions of the file properly (the owner of a file can normally change the permission flags of the file), using a command like this: 

chmod u+rwx single_main 

This means &quot;the user ('u') should be given ('+') permissions read ('r'), write ('w') and execute ('x') to the file 'single_main'. Now we'll surely be able to run our program. Again, normally you'll have no problem running the file, but if you copy it to a different directory, or transfer it to a different computer over the network, it might loose its original permissions, and thus you'll need to set them properly, as shown above. Note too that you cannot just move the file to a different computer an expect it to run - it has to be a computer with a matching operating system (to understand the executable file format), and matching CPU architecture (to understand the machine-language code that the executable file contains). 
Finally, the run-time environment has to match. For example, if we compiled the program on an operating system with one version of the standard C library, and we try to run it on a version with an incompatible standard C library, the program might crash, or complain that it cannot find the relevant C library. This is especially true for systems that evolve quickly (e.g. Linux with libc5 vs. Linux with libc6), so beware.

== Creating Debug-Ready Code ==

Normally, when we write a program, we want to be able to debug it - that is, test it using a debugger that allows running it step by step, setting a break point before a given command is executed, looking at contents of variables during program execution, and so on. In order for the debugger to be able to relate between the executable program and the original source code, we need to tell the compiler to insert information to the resulting executable program that'll help the debugger. This information is called &quot;debug information&quot;. In order to add that to our program, lets compile it differently: 

cc -g single_main.c -o single_main 

The '-g' flag tells the compiler to use debug info, and is recognized by mostly any compiler out there. You will note that the resulting file is much larger than that created without usage of the '-g' flag. The difference in size is due to the debug information. We may still remove this debug information using the strip command, like this: 

strip single_main 

You'll note that the size of the file now is even smaller than if we didn't use the '-g' flag in the first place. This is because even a program compiled without the '-g' flag contains some symbol information (function names, for instance), that the strip command removes. You may want to read strip's manual page (man strip) to understand more about what this command does. 
 

== Creating Optimized Code ==

After we created a program and debugged it properly, we normally want it to compile into an efficient code, and the resulting file to be as small as possible. The compiler can help us by optimizing the code, either for speed (to run faster), or for space (to occupy a smaller space), or some combination of the two. The basic way to create an optimized program would be like this: 

cc -O single_main.c -o single_main 

The '-O' flag tells the compiler to optimize the code. This also means the compilation will take longer, as the compiler tries to apply various optimization algorithms to the code. This optimization is supposed to be conservative, in that it ensures us the code will still perform the same functionality as it did when compiled without optimization (well, unless there are bugs in our compiler). Usually can define an optimization level by adding a number to the '-O' flag. The higher the number - the better optimized the resulting program will be, and the slower the compiler will complete the compilation. One should note that because optimization alters the code in various ways, as we increase the optimization level of the code, the chances are higher that an improper optimization will actually alter our code, as some of them tend to be non-conservative, or are simply rather complex, and contain bugs. For example, for a long time it was known that using a compilation level higher than 2 with gcc results in bugs in the executable program. After being warned, if we still want to use a different optimization level (lets say 4), we can do it this way: 

cc -O4 single_compile.c -o single_compile 

And we're done with it. If you read your compiler's manual page, you'll soon notice that it supports an almost infinite number of command line options dealing with optimization. Using them properly requires thorough understanding of compilation theory and source code optimization theory, or you might damage your resulting code. A good compilation theory course (preferably based on &quot;the Dragon Book&quot; by Aho, Sethi and Ulman) could do you good.

== Getting Extra Compiler Warnings ==

Normally the compiler only generates error messages about erroneous code that does not comply with the C standard, and warnings about things that usually tend to cause errors during runtime. However, we can usually instruct the compiler to give us even more warnings, which is useful to improve the quality of our source code, and to expose bugs that will really bug us later. With gcc, this is done using the '-W' flag. For example, to get the compiler to use all types of warnings it is familiar with, we'll use a command line like this: 

cc -Wall single_source.c -o single_source 

This will first annoy us - we'll get all sorts of warnings that might seem irrelevant. However, it is better to eliminate the warnings than to eliminate the usage of this flag. Usually, this option will save us more time than it will cause us to waste, and if used consistently, we will get used to coding proper code without thinking too much about it. One should also note that some code that works on some architecture with one compiler, might break if we use a different compiler, or a different system, to compile the code on. When developing on the first system, we'll never see these bugs, but when moving the code to a different platform, the bug will suddenly appear. Also, in many cases we eventually will want to move the code to a new system, even if we had no such intentions initially. 
Note that sometimes '-Wall' will give you too many errors, and then you could try to use some less verbose warning level. Read the compiler's manual to learn about the various '-W' options, and use those that would give you the greatest benefit. Initially they might sound too strange to make any sense, but if you are (or when you will become) a more experienced programmer, you will learn which could be of good use to you. 
 

== Compiling A Single-Source &quot;C++&quot; Program ==

Now that we saw how to compile C programs, the transition to C++ programs is rather simple. All we need to do is use a C++ compiler, in place of the C compiler we used so far. So, if our program source is in a file named 'single_main.cc' ('cc' to denote C++ code. Some programmers prefer a suffix of 'C' for C++ code), we will use a command such as the following: 

g++ single_main.cc -o single_main 

Or on some systems you'll use &quot;CC&quot; instead of &quot;g++&quot; (for example, with Sun's compiler for Solaris), or &quot;aCC&quot; (HP's compiler), and so on. You would note that with C++ compilers there is less uniformity regarding command line options, partially because until recently the language was evolving and had no agreed standard. But still, at least with g++, you will use &quot;-g&quot; for debug information in the code, and &quot;-O&quot; for optimization. 
 

== Compiling A Multi-Source &quot;C&quot; Program ==

So you learned how to compile a single-source program properly (hopefully by now you played a little with the compiler and tried out a few examples of your own). Yet, sooner or later you'll see that having all the source in a single file is rather limiting, for several reasons:
* As the file grows, compilation time tends to grow, and for each little change, the whole program has to be re-compiled. 
* It is very hard, if not impossible, that several people will work on the same project together in this manner. 
* Managing your code becomes harder. Backing out erroneous changes becomes nearly impossible. 
The solution to this would be to split the source code into multiple files, each containing a set of closely-related functions (or, in C++, all the source code for a single class). 
There are two possible ways to compile a multi-source C program. The first is to use a single command line to compile all the files. Suppose that we have a program whose source is found in files &quot;main.c&quot;, &quot;a.c&quot; and &quot;b.c&quot; (found in directory &quot;multi-source&quot; of this tutorial). We could compile it this way: 

&lt;code&gt;cc main.c a.c b.c -o hello_world&lt;/code&gt; 

This will cause the compiler to compile each of the given files separately, and then link them all together to one executable file named &quot;hello_world&quot;. Two comments about this program: 
# If we define a function (or a variable) in one file, and try to access them from a second file, we need to declare them as external symbols in that second file. This is done using the C &quot;extern&quot; keyword. 
# The order of presenting the source files on the command line may be altered. The compiler (actually, the linker) will know how to take the relevant code from each file into the final program, even if the first source file tries to use a function defined in the second or third source file. 
The problem with this way of compilation is that even if we only make a change in one of the source files, all of them will be re-compiled when we run the compiler again. &lt;br /&gt;

In order to overcome this limitation, we could divide the compilation process into two phases - compiling, and linking. Lets first see how this is done, and then explain: 

&lt;code&gt;cc -c main.cc&lt;br /&gt;

cc -c a.c&lt;br /&gt;

cc -c b.c&lt;br /&gt;

cc main.o a.o b.o -o hello_world&lt;/code&gt;

The first 3 commands have each taken one source file, and compiled it into something called &quot;object file&quot;, with the same names, but with a &quot;.o&quot; suffix. It is the &quot;-c&quot; flag that tells the compiler only to create an object file, and not to generate a final executable file just yet. The object file contains the code for the source file in machine language, but with some unresolved symbols. For example, the &quot;main.o&quot; file refers to a symbol named &quot;func_a&quot;, which is a function defined in file &quot;a.c&quot;. Surely we cannot run the code like that. Thus, after creating the 3 object files, we use the 4th command to link the 3 object files into one program. The linker (which is invoked by the compiler now) takes all the symbols from the 3 object files, and links them together - it makes sure that when &quot;func_a&quot; is invoked from the code in object file &quot;main.o&quot;, the function code in object file &quot;a.o&quot; gets executed. Further more, the linker also links the standard C library into the program, in this case, to resolve the &quot;printf&quot; symbol properly. &lt;br /&gt;

To see why this complexity actually helps us, we should note that normally the link phase is much faster than the compilation phase. This is especially true when doing optimizations, since that step is done before linking. Now, lets assume we change the source file &quot;a.c&quot;, and we want to re-compile the program. We'll only need now two commands: 

&lt;code&gt;cc -c a.c&lt;br /&gt;

cc main.o a.o b.o -o hello_world&lt;/code&gt;


In our small example, it's hard to notice the speed-up, but in a case of having few tens of files each containing a few hundred lines of source-code, the time saving is significant; not to mention even larger projects.

== Getting a Deeper Understanding - Compilation Steps ==

Now that we've learned that compilation is not just a simple process, lets try to see what is the complete list of steps taken by the compiler in order to compile a C program. 
1.	Driver - what we invoked as &quot;cc&quot;. This is actually the &quot;engine&quot;, that drives the whole set of tools the compiler is made of. We invoke it, and it begins to invoke the other tools one by one, passing the output of each tool as an input to the next tool. 
2.	C Pre-Processor - normally called &quot;cpp&quot;. It takes a C source file, and handles all the pre-processor definitions (#include files, #define macros, conditional source code inclusion with #ifdef, etc.) You can invoke it separately on your program, usually with a command like: 

cc -E single_source.c 

Try this and see what the resulting code looks like. 
3.	The C Compiler - normally called &quot;cc1&quot;. This is the actual compiler, that translates the input file into assembly language. As you saw, we used the &quot;-c&quot; flag to invoke it, along with the C Pre-Processor, (and possibly the optimizer too, read on), and the assembler. 
4.	Optimizer - sometimes comes as a separate module and sometimes as the found inside the compiler module. This one handles the optimization on a representation of the code that is language-neutral. This way, you can use the same optimizer for compilers of different programming languages. 
5.	Assembler - sometimes called &quot;as&quot;. This takes the assembly code generated by the compiler, and translates it into machine language code kept in object files. With gcc, you could tell the driver to generated only the assembly code, by a command like: 

cc -S single_source.c 
6.	Linker-Loader - This is the tool that takes all the object files (and C libraries), and links them together, to form one executable file, in a format the operating system supports. A Common format these days is known as &quot;ELF&quot;. On SunOs systems, and other older systems, a format named &quot;a.out&quot; was used. This format defines the internal structure of the executable file - location of data segment, location of source code segment, location of debug information and so on. 
As you see, the compilation is split in to many different phases. Not all compiler employs exactly the same phases, and sometimes (e.g. for C++ compilers) the situation is even more complex. But the basic idea is quite similar - split the compiler into many different parts, to give the programmer more flexibility, and to allow the compiler developers to re-use as many modules as possible in different compilers for different languages (by replacing the preprocessor and compiler modules), or for different architectures (by replacing the assembly and linker-loader parts).

::Yes, this is the same Kurt Kawohl who started the book. I dont have any problem with any of the work as well, as long as it follows policy but unfortunately, Kurt is on an Internet Spam mission (see [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=8Ep&amp;q=Transcendentalism+kurt&amp;btnG=Search Google] here) and WikiBooks is part of his spam. What he has done is write personal essays on Transcendentalism and related subjects and then spam it on the Internet in an attempt to make it famous and get it accepted by people. His other articles that he has just added to Wikibooks a few days ago may also need to be considered for deletion. They are:
::*[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Theology/Urantian_theology Theology/Urantian theology] - only a collection of external links to his website
::*[[Urantia United Foreword]] - This is a [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22In+formulating+the+succeeding+presentations+having+to+do+with+the+portrayal+of+the+character+of+the+Universal+Father+and+the+nature+of+his+Paradise+associates%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a copyright violation]. Here he writes himself: &quot;''Urantia United (Earth United) is in large part an '''edited, condensed version of the Urantia Book by Kurt Kawohl'''. ''&quot; - He edited the Urantia Book according to his own beliefs and then placed it in an article. 
::After having his material deleted so many times before, he still doesnt care if he's violating policies and continues to spam the Internet including Wikibooks. --[[User:Zddune|Zddune]] 20:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' as clever self-promoting spam. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:49, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - I'm changing my vote to delete.  Going over the edit histories, and in particular the new content that this user seems to be adding to Wikibooks, it seems as though it is a sort of spam after a manner.  While he may be granting Wikibooks a license (I don't think the copyright issues are huge here as the author is granting permission), it still smacks strongly of original research.  I don't see any verifiability to any of this, in terms of outside sources of information that this Wikibooks is already copying verbatium.  We do accept philosohpical books like discussions of the Koran and the Bible, but those have nearly countless sources of information to draw upon if you want to do a serious study of those philosohpies.  And as I pointed out strongly on the Staff Lounge, Wikibooks is not a place to publish as a vanity press.  There are specific goals in mind for Wikibooks, and the publication of these books doesn't fit in even close to those goals.  I would like to see some counter justification, but I don't see it.  In terms of original research, I don't see how legitimately anybody else could possible be able to contribute to this (and the other books this user has added) in a meaningful way to extend the ideas that have been presented.  At best only minor edits, not a major reworking based on scholarly knowledge and external (to Wikibooks) sources of knowledge.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Roast Beef and other things ==

G'day Peter, yes I am an Aussie (by way of being an ex-Kiwi). It gives me a slightly different perspective on some things here, and on Wikipedia. I'm also not a pimply teenager, but I am [[w:White &amp; Nerdy|white and nerdy]] enough to fit in here a bit :-)

You don't really need to learn anything about templates in order to write a Cookbook page. However, there are a couple of handy templates that you can use to make your page more like a Cookbook recipe.

The first is to give it a navigation template, and I reckon it should be mandatory. See [[Cookbook:Policy#Available_Cookbook-Related_Templates|here]] for what to type, and what it gives you. It puts a simple navigation line at the top of your recipe, knocks out the Table of Contents (not needed in recipes), and also includes it into an appropriate category (minimally, [[:Category:Recipes|Category:Recipes]]). I recommend that you put this one at the top of your recipes: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The second is the recipe summary. This is completely optional, but it's nice to have one there so that prospective cooks have some idea of what they'll be getting themselves into. Even nicer if it has a lovely photo of what they'll be getting for their efforts! See [[Template:Recipesummary/Examples|here]] for some examples of how to use it. It also should go at the top of the page (I've seen it both above and below the navigation template).

That's really all you need to know about templates, unless you want to delve further into it. Otherwise, you can do pretty much all you need with plain-old Wiki editing syntax. The [[Help:Editing|Editing help]] link at the bottom of the edit box (next to the &quot;Save page&quot; and &quot;Show preview&quot; buttons) will tell you all you need to know about that.

Regarding your problems on Wikipedia, you might want to take a look at [[w:Wikipedia:Resolving disputes|this page]].

Oh, and I look forward to testing out your roast beef recipe sometime soon. I have a general preference for roast lamb (the Kiwi thing, no doubt), but my better half keeps prodding me to roast some beef, so maybe next time we do a roast. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 23:27, 12 January 2007 (UTC)


: Roast Lamb, eh ?? Take a look here !!

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Roast_Lamb

::G'day Peter. Thanks, but I have Roast Lamb pretty much down pat, what with my Kiwi heritage and living in a country that's busy slaughtering as many lamb as it can due to drought :-( Although, I haven't yet mastered the Greek-style roast lamb - the sort that falls off the bone as you wave your knife at it. I've come close, but not yet succeeded; needs a lot of time at a low temperature. BTW, I cook my roasts at 150°C, with big veges (e.g. taro) going in at the start, smaller hard veges (spuds, sweet potato) going in after first ½ hour, and smallest and softer (carrots, parsnip) after second ½ hour. But everyone has their way.

::Incidentally, have you seen [http://forums.egullet.com/index.php?showtopic=40548 this page on eGullet]? Quite educational. There are some fabulous pages on that forum (I wish I had time to spend a while there).

::Lastly, the link you give above isn't the best way to give links in Wikibooks, on two counts. Firstly, your recipe is actually at &quot;Cookbook:Roast_Lamb&quot;; the page you link to is a redirect. Such an approach will not work for most recipes here. Secondly, you can link to Wikibooks pages using internal link syntax, like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:Roast Lamb|Roast Lamb]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which produces this: [[Cookbook:Roast Lamb|Roast Lamb]]

== Carbonara ==

Hi Peter - just to let you know I've moved it to [[Cookbook:Carbonara pasta sauce]] so that it is part of the cookbook - thanks &amp; regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:16, 8 June 2007 (UTC)
:No problem Peter - just start the page name off with Cookbook: and then the name.  Equally if you forget it is a simple as using the move tab on the page and for the &quot;location&quot; adding Cookbook: to the start of the name.  Happy to help (tho I'll be offline now for a a bit over a week!).  Others will help if you need it ([[user:Webaware|Webaware]] is often around and is more knowledgeable than me about the cookbook).  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:05, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

Thanks Herby. Am a little backward on such matters but will learn! Peter

:G'day Peter, you might be interested in [[Cookbook talk:Spaghetti alla Carbonara|this]], particularly the section &quot;The Point of view of a Roman&quot;. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:11, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

Thanks Webaware !! Thats some discussion. I am at least glad that my recipe did not suggest either garlic OR onions, but I wonder what they make of the Lemon Zest. I shall go and wind them up a little !~~

:Hah! Cute, but don't expect a reply for some time, as I doubt that anybody is actively (passively?) watching that talk page. Except a few addicts like me, who patrol Cookbook talk page changes... [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:48, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

Lol! I suppose we need to get ourselves a life or something!! Peter

== Re:[[Summer pudding]] ==

No problem, i'll move this one into the cookbook for you. For future reference, if you want to create a new page in the cookbook, you have to put the word &quot;Cookbook:&quot; into the title. So instead of creating a page &quot;Summer Pudding&quot;, you should create a page called &quot;Cookbook:Summer Pudding&quot;. Once you get the hang of that, the rest should be very easy. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:46, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, it really is that easy. The problem is that we really don't make it clear that things are so easy. For that reason, it really is our fault, as a community, that our help and introductory pages really just dont answer the questions that the newest of users are frequently asking. 
:On a personal note, I am going to be doing work on our help pages, and as a new user you would make a good resource to help direct me on what questions need to be answered, and where the answers should be so that new users can actually find them. If you have any suggestions about this, please let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:33, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

Yes, I'd be delighted and will put together some ideas in the next couple of days ! --[[User:Peterkirchem|Peterkirchem]] 18:54, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

:On a related note, I moved your new page to [[Cookbook:Pasta alla gorgonzola]]. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:58, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

== Signing talk pages ==

G'day Peter, I just saw your comment on [[Cookbook talk:Potato]]. To sign a comment on a talk page, just add four tildes to the end, i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Alternatively, press the button that looks a bit like a signature, on the tool bar above the edit box. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:58, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

== Pete's pasta ==

G'day Peter, I've just cookbooked your [[Cookbook:Pete's pasta]] recipe. It seems to be missing some vital quantities - e.g. it measures things in boxes and tins, not mentioning how big these are. Remember that we shop in different countries, not just different grocers, so my box of pasta might be bigger or smaller than your box :-) Could you please update with some sizes? thanks, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:12, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

Done that, Webaware. Thanks. It's at times difficult as it rather depends on how many are eating, but I take your point. If you're in the US I am quite SURE your boxes are bigger than ours ! Here (UK) we have to buy pasta every 5 minutes as our boxes are tiny! Also I am afraid I tend always to chuck stuff in til it looks about right, but realise that is a pretty awful way of doing things ! --[[User:Peterkirchem|Peterkirchem]] 08:08, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks, mate. I'm in Australia, and our &quot;boxes&quot; may well be the same size as yours. However, I don't buy pasta in boxes; if I ever do buy pasta (which is rare), it's a plastic bag of gluten-free pasta. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:40, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

== Signing recipes ==

G'day Peter, I see you've been signing all your recipes. That's generally &quot;not done&quot;, as it implies [[WB:OWN|ownership]] - something Wikibooks doesn't go in for! Signing is for talk pages, and a page's edit history tells everyone who wrote it. 

However, you should probably add your name to the list of [[Cookbook:Contributors|Cookbook contributors]], and maybe list the recipes you've added on your [[User:{{PAGENAME}}|user page]]. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:40, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

Oops !! Sorry, didn't know. It's more an act of owning up rather than owning !! Thanks for the photo by the way. One you made ? Btw - can I duplicate that recipe as Mushroom Risotto ?

Another question - this general description of Risotto - http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Risotto - is more a description than a recipe (and the recipe bit is rather tortuous english) - can one start a new RECIPE for Risotto, and then string out from there - or has it got to be left how it is ?

:G'day Peter, no worries! But you can stop signing them now :-)
:The photo is from the [[Commons:|Wiki Commons]]. When I find a recipe without a photograph, and if I have a moment, I search the Commons for a suitable photo to plaster across it. It's surprising how many recipes are well represented in there, and also how many incredibly common recipes aren't! Incidentally, I add porcini mushrooms to my risottos / paellas, often along with a couple of others. Haven't made a simple mushroom risotto though, but will bear it in mind ('cos it's bloody easy, and we like easy here!)
:Don't duplicate recipes. However, if you want to give your recipe an alternative name, you can create a page for &quot;Cookbook:Mushroom Risotto&quot; and only put in it a redirect to &quot;Cookbook:Risotto ai funghi&quot;. Press the &quot;#R&quot; button above the edit box when you are creating the page.
:Regarding Risotto, the page you linked to is not in the Cookbook. Here's the Cookbook's risotto recipe: [[Cookbook:Risotto]]. Note the prefix, &quot;Cookbook:&quot;? Thanks for finding the other page for me, I've tagged it to be merged into the Cookbook page and then deleted.
:When you do a search in Wikibooks, the default settings don't search the Cookbook. You can change this by ticking &quot;Cookbook&quot; on the search tab of your [[Special:Preferences|preferences]], and saving. I suspect that you hadn't worked that one out yet, hence your find of Risotto :-)
:cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:46, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

== Recipes belong in the Cookbook ==

G'day Peter, I see that you are still creating recipes outside the cookbook, forcing others to run around tidying up after you. This is getting pretty boring. Could you please read over the advice left by me, and others, and take some notice of some of it? I have to say that it's starting to get a bit tiresome. The more cleanup work we all have to do, the less time we have for our own contributions.

Additionally, before creating a new recipe, please check to see whether it already exists in the Cookbook. If it does, you should determine whether your recipe is sufficiently different to warrant a separate page; otherwise, incorporate your changes into the recipe either in the &quot;Notes, tips and variations&quot; section (preferred) or by modifying the existing recipe.

cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:38, 14 July 2007 (UTC)

Oh dear. I thought I WAS putting it in the cookbook. Sorry, will try again.--[[User:Peterkirchem|Peterkirchem]] 20:48, 15 July 2007 (UTC)

Also, I looked up Fish and Chips and didnt come across anything, but I just for instance looked up German Meatballs in COokbook, and get a link to Cookbook:german meatballs. Dont understand, as I thought I was searching IN cookbook already (having chosen in in the &quot;navigation&quot; column on the right.--[[User:Peterkirchem|Peterkirchem]] 20:56, 15 July 2007 (UTC)

:G'day Peter, I just entered &quot;fish and chips&quot; into the search field, and clicked on &quot;Search&quot;, and this is what it got me: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=fish+and+chips&amp;fulltext=Search].

Buy a new oven !!  :-) 

Mind you am slightly perplexed that you say an oven goes DOWN to a certain temperature. On the premise all great American Ovens live their lives 'cool' until called to service, I would have thought yours would rise THROUGH 170 degrees on the way to its maximum setting ! I now put a leg of lamb in the oven the night before I eat it and roast it (on say 100) all through the night. The smell of lamb when you wake up is an amazing experience!

== Slow Roasting Lamb ==

Here in the great USA, most of our ovens only go down to 170, but the slow roasting calls for 150 F, was it? Maybe it was 160. I can't remember. Anyways, how would I be able to do it if the lowest my oven can go is 170 F? --[[User:Iwatchaltonbrown|AltonBrownIsAwesome]] ([[User talk:Iwatchaltonbrown|talk]]) 19:20, 28 July 2009 (UTC)

Buy a new oven!!

== Roast pork ==

I think it's safe to serve pork when it's still pink, or at least at 145 degrees '''''F'''''. Trichina die out at around 137 degrees. Also, there are small enough amounts of other nasties to all die around that temperature. [[User:Iwatchaltonbrown|AltonBrownIsAwesome]] ([[User talk:Iwatchaltonbrown|talk]]) 14:02, 9 August 2009 (UTC)


Bit chewy when it's pink, don you find??

Yes, I agree. I personally dont like pork which is pink, but that is just a personal preference ! Yes, a bit chewy...and piggy !

==Thanks==
I just noticed your comment on one of my recipes. Thanks for the compliment. [[User:Moby-Dick4000|Moby-Dick4000]] ([[User talk:Moby-Dick4000|talk]]) 12:53, 14 October 2009 (UTC)

:By the way, I made changes to both the name and the intro to a recipe you wrote: ''[[cookbook:Spaghetti alla Vongole|Spaghetti alla Vongole]]''. It's now titled [[cookbook:Spaghetti with clams in white wine sauce|Spaghetti with clams in white wine sauce]]. The recipe itself, however, remains unchaged. I left an explanation for my changes on that recipe's talk page.

:I hope you're not offended. If you are, please leave a note on my talk page and I'm sure we can reach a compromise. [[User:Moby-Dick4000|Moby-Dick4000]] ([[User talk:Moby-Dick4000|talk]]) 17:39, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

Absolutely no problem! I think it is a better title as the italian is....well.. for italians really !! I now add some mussels to the recipe, but then would have to call it something else !</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section concerns expenditure on sea walls as part of a rental business.

Where a person incurs expenditure in the making of any sea wall or other embankment necessary for the preservation or protection of the premises agaisnt the encroachment or overflowing of the sea or any tidal river, that person will get a tax deduction when computing his rental income equal to one twenty-first of the expenditure in the year in which it has been incurred, and in each of the subsequent 20 years.

Subsection (2) provides for the benefit of this deduction to be transferred to the subsequent owners of the interest in the property that was held by the person originally incurring the expenditure.

Subsection (2A) makes sure subsection (2) works where the tranferor is subject to income, rather than corporation, tax.

Subsection (3) makes it clear who the subsequent owner of the interest in the property is where that interest is a lease that comes to an end.

Subsection (4) provides that, where necessary, the deduction is time apportioned between [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Corporation tax/Accounting periods|accounting periods]] falling in periods of account to which the deduction applies, excluding any last accounting periods if the deduction is no longer relevant for that period.

Subsection (5) provides that the section does not apply to any expenditure for which a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Corporation tax/Capital allowances|capital allowance]] is due.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) is the main provision. It provides that where the payment of any premium is required under a lease, or otherwise under the terms subject to wwhich a lease is granted, and the duration of the lease does not exceed 50 years, the landlord is treated for corporation tax purposes as receiving as rent when the lease is granted an amount equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;P -\frac{(P x Y)}{50}\ &lt;/math&gt;

where P is the size of the premium, and Y is the number of complete periods of 12 months (other than the first) comprised in the duration of the lease.

Subsection (2) modify subsection (1) where the terms of the lease give the tenant an obligation to carry out work on the premises. It effectively provides that the value of that obligation is deemed to be an additional premium received by the landlord.

Subsection (3) disapplies subsection (2) if the landlord would have received a tax deduction in his rental income calculation for the costs incurred in carry out that work had the landlord incurred those costs himself.

Subsection (4) provides that if, under terms under which the lease was granted, a sum becomes payable by the tenant in lieu of the whole or any part of the rent for a period, it is to be deemed to be an additional premium received by the the landlord when the amount becomes payable by the tenant. The spreading period is the period for which the payment is made to cover.

Subsection (5) provides that if, under the terms of a waiver or variaion of the lease, a sum becomes payable by the tenant otherwise than by way of rent, that sum is deemed to be an additional premium received by the landlord when the contract for the waiver or variation is entered into. The period for the spreading is the period for which the waiver or variation applies.

Subsections (6) and (7) provide the if a company connected to the landlord within the meaning of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 839 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|section 839 of ICTA]] receives an amount in relation to a rental business of the landlord, subsections (1), (4) and (5) apply to that company in a similar way to how they would have applied to the landlord had he received the amount.

Subsection (7A) provides that the amount treated under this section as rent is to be taken into account in computing rental income for the accounting period in which it is treated as received (ie it is not time apportioned by reference to periods of account).

Subsection (8) makes a provision where the deemed rental amount is to be paid by the tenant in instalments. It allows the Board of HM Revenue and Customs to give the company an option to pay the tax related to that amount in instalments over a period not exceeding eight years and, in any event, ending not later than th time at which the tax would be due on profits in the accounting period in which the last of the tenant's instalments is payable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, Welcome to wikibooks! I saw your note on the staff lounge, and I wanted to talk to you about your class project. I've been involved with a number of other class projects here in the past, and am interested in helping your project along as well. It certainly sounds interesting! I would ask you to read (or at least skim over) [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]], a resource that we've been compiling to help projects like yours get off to a good start. 

I've done some significant work on several related books, such as [[Reverse Engineering]], [[Embedded Systems]], [[x86 Assembly]], and other similar books. I'm starting my PhD dissertation research in this area, so i have some expertise that I could lend as well. 

If you have any questions, or if you need any help at all, please don't hesitate to ask me [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:You aren't the first fuddy-duddy to experiment with the wiki medium, i assure you! for some examples of other books that resulted from class projects, see [[Human Physiology]], and [[XML]]. There certainly is potential to make it a great experience for your class. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:06, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:I've added your book to [[Wikibooks:Programming languages bookshelf]]. I don't know why you can't edit it, and I will try to figure out the problem. I've added your book at the very bottom, under the UNIX section. Let me know if you would like it moved anywhere else. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:13, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

A religion is a belief system that explains why we exist and why the universe is the way it is.  There are many different religions.  Some are very popular, such as Islam and Christianity; some others you've probably never heard of.  This is a book for 10&amp;ndash;12-year-olds who want to find out about different religions.

I need help I thought it would be a cool book idea but I need some more contributors
&lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:Gogreen|Gogreen]] ([[User talk:Gogreen|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gogreen|contribs]]) 00:01, 10 January 2007  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== Upgrades ==

I hope to make a few infrastructure upgrades here, in the near future.  The three areas that seem to me to need work are:
* The lead paragraph.
:: {{done}} --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 21:57, 4 January 2011 (UTC)
* The standard outline for articles.  (Needs to be more flexible.)
:: {{done|Proposed}} a new set of questions, [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Contributing|here]].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:28, 5 January 2011 (UTC) 
* The book outline.  (In addition to more belief systems, there are historical suggestions for other kinds of sections besides belief-system articles.)
Resources of interest are
* [{{fullurl:Wikijunior:WorldReligions|oldid=1897875}} Wikijunior:Religions], an attempt to start this same book (from the same book proposal, that is) almost two years before this one.  It looks like the author didn't link to it from anywhere, so no-one else knew it was there and it just got lost.  Not much there, but it has an interestingly different lead, and suggests some other belief systems to cover.  [Update: it's now been history-merged with this book, so I've adjusted the above link to point to a revision containing the relevant content.]
* [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions/Archive#Religions]]

==Divisions==
If we're going to list &quot;Catholic Christianity&quot; and &quot;Protestant Christianity&quot; separately, we should probably do the same for [[Wikipedia:Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Wikipedia:Shia Islam|Shia]] Islam, as well as [[Wikipedia:Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Wikipedia:Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], and [[Wikipedia:Reform Judaism|Reform]] Judaism. However, especially considering that this is Wikijunior, it would probably be best not to present it that way, and instead explain the internal divisions after outlining the generally shared tenets of the religion as a whole. [[User:Belteshazzar|Belteshazzar]] ([[User talk:Belteshazzar|talk]]) 18:40, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

:Yeah, we're better off with just one unified section for Christianity.  There seem to have been thoughts, once upon a time, of an extensive hierarchical structure; but that wouldn't make sense until there was already much more to this book than there is now, and there would still be only one top-level taxon for Christianity.

:One wonders whether there should be a standard section heading in the [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Contributing|article outline]] for sects.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 21:32, 23 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

==1. Describe the following in detail concerning lighthouses:==
===a. What is the function of a lighthouse?===
The function of a lighthouse is to serve as a navigational aid to ships by sending a beam of light, which provides signals.

===b. When were the first lighthouses of record built?===
The first lighthouse in recorded history is the Pharos Lighthouse in Alexandria, Egypt.  Built in 280 BC, it is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

===c. What is the name of the most famous ancient lighthouse?===
Perhaps the most famous lighthouse in history is the Lighthouse of Alexandria, built on the island of Pharos in ancient Egypt.

===d. What are people called who study lighthouses? Why?===
People who study lighthouses are called pharologists, after the island of Pharos where the famous lighthouse was constructed.  Indeed, the name of the island is still used as the noun for &quot;lighthouse&quot; in some languages, for example: French (phare), Italian and Spanish (faro), Portuguese (farol), Swedish, Danish and Norwegian (fyr), Romanian (far) and Greek (φάρος).

===e. Do all lighthouses have keepers? If not, how are they run?===
In the United States, only the lighthouse called Boston Light still has a keeper - all the others are automated.

Even automated lighthouses need occasional maintenance, which the Coast Guard and the National Park service do on a regular basis.  However the day-to-day warning that Lighthouses given is totally automatic with electronic machines that shine the (usually) aero-marine beacon lights out to passing ships, just like the Fresnel-lenses and gas-lamp mechanical masterpieces did in ages past.

==2. Research the structure and function of Fresnel lenses. Explain what makes these lenses so effective.==
{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| [[image:Fresnel lens.svg|thumb|220px|1: Cross section of a Fresnel lens&lt;br&gt;2: Cross section of a conventional plano-convex lens of equivalent power]]
| [[Image:Cape_Willoughby_Lighthouse_Fresnel_lens.jpg|thumb|375px|right|Close-up of a lighthouse lens]]
|}
A Fresnel lens (pronounced ''fray-NELL'') is a type of lens invented by Augustin-Jean Fresnel.  Originally developed for lighthouses, the design enables the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the weight and volume of material which would be required in conventional lens design. Compared to earlier lenses, the Fresnel lens is much thinner, thus passing more light and allowing lighthouses to be visible over much longer distances.

The Fresnel lens reduces the amount of material required compared to a conventional spherical lens by breaking the lens into a set of concentric ring-like sections.  These concentric rings are shaped to point the light inward, focusing the light from all the rings to a single point, much like a magnifying glass does (imagine hundreds of magnifying glasses all working together!).  Because there are so many ring-like lenses focusing light on a single point, the light is very bright, and can be seen from miles away, even through a thick fog.

==3. Throughout history, what fuels were used for lighthouse lights?==
The earliest lighthouses used wood and coal fires to make their light.  Other fuels that have been used since include whale oil, lard, kerosene, and (lots of) candles.  Today most lighthouses are lit with electricity.  The first lighthouse in the United States to use electricity was the Statue of Liberty in 1886!  Lady Liberty served her first 15 years as a lighthouse.

==4. Are all lighthouses located along ocean shores? If not, list other locations where you would find a lighthouse.==

Not all lighthouses are located along ocean shores.  Many are also located along major rivers and lake shores.

==5. What is the lighthouse service called in your country? What organization or branch of government is responsible for maintaining lighthouses in your country?==

In the United States and in Canada, the Coast Guard is responsible for the lighthouse service.  Other lighthouse services may be found by visiting The [http://www.iala-aism.org/ International Association of Marine Aids and Lighthouse Authorities].

[[File:Seal of the United States Lighthouse Service.png|thumb|100px|right|US Lighthouse Service]]
:'''Historical Notes (United States):'''
:* 1852 - the United States Lighthouse Board created as an agency of the US Federal Government to be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of all lighthouses in the United States.
:* 1886 to 1902 - the Statue of Liberty functioned as a lighthouse.
:* 1910 - the United States Lighthouse Service (also known as the Bureau of Lighthouses) succeeded the Lighthouse Board.
:* 1939 - the US Lighthouse Service merged with the United States Coast Guard, which now maintains and operates all US Lighthouses and Lightships.

==6. When a lighthouse is a visible landmark seen from the ocean during the day it can be identified by certain markings. What are these called?==
These markings are called ''daymarks''.  Lighthouses have unique daymarks so that they can be distinguished from one another.  If all lighthouses were round brick towers, a sailor would have to have a pretty good idea of where he was to know which lighthouse he was looking at.  Instead, lighthouses are painted with easily distinguishable patterns.  Often these are red and white, or black and white.  Daymarks can be bands, diamonds, squares, rectangles, or any other shapes - so long as they can be seen from afar.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==7. What is a foghorn? Why would one be used at a lighthouse? What are three things that affect how far away a foghorn can be heard?==

Foghorns are a navigation aid for mariners. In foggy conditions, when visual navigation aids such as lighthouses are obscured by the weather, fog horns provide an audible warning of rocks, headlands, or other dangers to shipping. 

Lighthouses are often built near shipping hazards such as rocks.  It often becomes too foggy to see a lighthouse at a safe distance from these hazards, so an audible signal is needed instead.

The sound produced by a foghorn is a very deep '''pitch''', due to the fact that deep sounds are audible to human ears at a greater distance than higher pitched ones. It is also very '''loud''' so ships a considerable distance away can heed its warning.  '''Height above sea level''' is another factor that determines the distance at which a foghorn can be heard.  Some foghorns can be heard up to six miles (9.6 km) away.

==8. Since lighthouses are often called &quot;lights&quot;, explore the concept of &quot;lights&quot; in scripture by doing the following:==
===a. Look in the Bible Concordance to find “lights” and discuss lights as referred to in the Bible===
* In Genesis 1:14-16, Psalm 136:7, and Ezekiel 32:8 refer to God making the lights in the sky
* Luke 8:16 and Luke 11:33 talk about putting a light under a basket verses on a lampstand where everyone can see it.
* In Acts 16:29 the jailer calls for lights to see if Paul and Silas had escaped from jail.

In all of these cases, the lights are there as an aid to seeing.  Sometimes the light is so we can see physically, and sometimes so we can see spiritually.  

The instances here are limited to the plural noun &quot;lights&quot; and do not include the singular form &quot;light&quot; or the use of light (or lights) as a verb.  You may wish to expand the search to include those.

===b. Explain why you think God’s word is like a lighthouse.===
Just as a lighthouse guides ships, God's word shows us the way to happiness and away from destruction.

===c. Memorize John 8:12.===
{{Bible_verse
| book = John
| chapter = 8
| verse = 12
| version = NKJV
| text =
Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.”
}}

==9. Write a poem or a story about a lighthouse light. Include thoughts of God’s “light”. Read your story or poem to your group.==
There are various forms of poetry, including traditional rhyming poems or non-rhyming ones.  Haiku is a form of Japanese poetry containing three lines: the first line has five syllables, the second has seven, and the third has five.  The Bible is full of poetry as well, though it is in a form unfamiliar to most English speakers.  Biblical poetry repeats an idea using different words.  Consider the full text of Psalm 136:7-9 (NKJV):

{{Bible_verse
|book = Psalm
|chapter = 136
| verse = 7-9
| version = NKJV
| text = &lt;br&gt;
:''To Him who made great lights,''
::''For His mercy endures forever—''
:''The sun to rule by day,''
::''For His mercy endures forever;''
:''The moon and stars to rule by night,''
::''For His mercy endures forever. ''
}}

Notice how the first line speaks of the great lights, and is followed by a verse meaning the same thing, but with different detail.  Also notice how &quot;For His mercy endures forever&quot; is repeated between each expression of the idea.

Have fun with this.

==10. Draw or photograph five lighthouse forms/types being used today.==
{{Lighthouse
|type = Octagonal
|description = As the name implies, and octagonal lighthouse has eight sides.
|image = PhareDeLaMartre.jpg
|image_caption=

}}

==11. Do one of the following:&lt;br&gt;a. List the names and locations of 5 lighthouses in your state/province.&lt;br&gt;b. Locate on a map the location of 10 lighthouses in your country/division==

The [http://www.iala-aism.org/ International Association of Marine Aids and Lighthouse Authorities] is a good resource to check out for meeting this requirement.

The U.S. Park Service has an [http://www.cr.nps.gov/maritime/ltsum.htm Inventory of Historic Light Stations] which lists lighthouses from all over the United States, though this inventory is by no means exhaustive.  

The Canadian Coast Guard has a [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/list/index List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals].

Another way to find lighthouses is by using an Internet search engine using the terms &quot;Lighthouse&quot; and the name of your locality.  If you cannot find five lighthouses in your state or province, you may have to expand the search and find ten lighthouses in your division instead.

==12. List the references you used to learn about lighthouses.==

We obviously don't know which references ''you'' will use, but here are the ones that were used to put these answers together:

* [http://www.uscg.mil/history/WEBLIGHTHOUSES/lighthouse_curriculum.html U.S. Coast Guard Lighthouses Curriculum]

* [[W:Lighthouses|Wikipedia article on Lighthouses]]

* [http://www.overfalls.org/page.cfm?pageID=26 Overfalls Maritime Museum Foundation] Overfalls Lighthship online exhibit.

==3. List the development of a Fresnel lens, including: &lt;br&gt;a. Name of the gentleman that invented it. &lt;br&gt;b. Country that he came from &lt;br&gt;c. Year developed==
[[Image:Augustin Fresnel.jpg|thumb|Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]
3a) &lt;u&gt;Name of the gentleman that invented it&lt;/u&gt;: '''[[W:Augustin-Jean_Fresnel|&lt;u&gt;Augustin-Jean Fresnel&lt;/u&gt;]]''' (pronounced fray-NELL) is most often given credit for the development of this lens for use in lighthouses. 

3b) &lt;u&gt;Country that he came from&lt;/u&gt;: Fresnel (May 10, 1788 – July 14, 1827), was a '''[[W:France|&lt;u&gt;French&lt;/u&gt;]]''' physicist who contributed significantly to the establishment of the theory of wave optics. 

3c) &lt;u&gt;Year developed&lt;/u&gt;: According to Smithsonian, the first Fresnel lens was used in '''[[w:1822|&lt;u&gt;1822&lt;/u&gt;]]''' in a lighthouse on the Gironde River in France, Cardovan Tower; its light could be seen from more than 20 miles out.

* A Fresnel lens is a type of lens invented by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. Originally developed for lighthouses, the design enables the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the weight and volume of material which would be required in conventional lens design. Compared to earlier lenses, the Fresnel lens is much thinner, and passes more light which allows lighthouses to be visible over much longer distances.

[[Image:Cordouan lighthouse architectural.png|thumb|Cardouan Tower]]
* The idea of creating a thinner, lighter lens by making it with separate sections mounted in a frame is often attributed to Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. However, it is difficult to find any other sources that link Buffon to work with optics. French physicist and engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel is most often given credit for the development of this lens for use in lighthouses. According to Smithsonian, the first Fresnel lens was used in 1822 in a lighthouse on the Gironde River in France, [[w:Cordouan_lighthouse|Cardovan Tower]]; its light could be seen from more than 20 miles out. Scottish physicist Sir David Brewster is credited with convincing The United Kingdom to use these lenses in their lighthouses.

* The Fresnel lens reduces the amount of material required compared to a conventional spherical lens by breaking the lens into a set of concentric annular sections known as Fresnel zones.

* In the first (and largest) variations of the lens, each of these zones was a different prism. Though a lens might look like a single piece of glass, closer examination reveals that it is many small pieces. It was not until modern computer-controlled milling equipment (CNC) could turn out large complex pieces that these lenses were single pieces of glass.

* For each of these zones, the overall thickness of the lens is decreased, effectively chopping the continuous surface of a standard lens into a set of surfaces of the same curvature, with discontinuities between them. This allows a substantial reduction in thickness (and thus weight and volume of material) of the lens, at the expense of reducing the imaging quality of the lens.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==4. Draw a Fresnel lens:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;a. Show how prisms are used to concentrate light&lt;br&gt;b. Draw a bull’s eye lens and state its purpose==

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==5. Make a chart showing each class of Fresnel lens:==
You can get a nice diagram/chart at the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/displayPhoto.pl?path=/pnp/habshaer/ri/ri0300/ri0392/sheet&amp;topImages=00008a.gif&amp;topLinks=00008r.tif,00008a.tif Library of Congress].

===a. Define order and list by size===

Here's a listing of the classical Fresnel Lenses in the United States: http://uslhs.org/resources_lighthouse_lenses_4.php

==6. Research and describe the history of the mechanism for rotating lights==

In early years and the lenses were rotated by a weight driven clockwork assembly wound by lighthouse keepers (sometimes as often as every two hours). The lens assembly usually floated in mercury to reduce friction. In more modern lighthouses, electric lights and motor drives were used, generally powered by diesel electric generators. These also supplied electricity for the lighthouse keepers.

==7. Make a chart of six lighthouses showing nighttime (light) and daytime (daymark) signature.==

===Daymark===
Lighthouses have distinguishing daymarks. No two lighthouses are exactly alike. This way, ships and sailors can determine their location. For example, if you see a red lantern and black and white spiral stripes, you will know that you are off the coast of [[w:St._Augustine_Light|St. Augustine]].


&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Alcatraz11.JPEG|'''Alcatraz Island Lighthouse''' &lt;br&gt;Natural color with black lantern with Octagonal/Pyramidal tower.
Image:Point Loma Lighthouse.jpg|'''Point Loma Light''' &lt;br&gt;Square Pyramidal (skeletal).
Image:14footbk.jpg|'''Fourteen Foot Bank Light''' &lt;br&gt;Cast Iron (Square)
Image:Alligator-reef-lh.JPG|'''Alligator Reef Light''' &lt;br&gt;White octagonal pyramid on black skeleton tower.
Image:St. Augustine Lighthouse 1.jpg|'''St. Augustine Light''' &lt;br&gt;Conical tower, red lantern and black and white spiral stripes
Image:Thomaspointshoals.PNG|'''Thomas Point Shoal Light''' &lt;br&gt;Square on hexagonal house, White with Red Roof and Black Lantern.
Image:Holland Harbor Lighthouse.jpg|'''Holland Harbor Light''' &lt;br&gt;Wood, Square, Red.
Image:Cape hatteras lighthouse img 0529.jpg|'''Cape Hatteras Light''' &lt;br&gt;Conical, white and black spiral bands with red brick base.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Nightmark===
In similar fashion, the signature or pattern of light at night is the ''nightmark''.  By viewing this distinctive signature, sailors can tell their location even in the dark.
* '''Pigeon Point Light Station''': Flashing white 10s
* '''Point Bonita Lighthouse''': [[w:Occulting|Occulting]] white once every 4s
* '''Ponce de Leon Inlet Light''': fixed light (original)
* '''Cape Hatteras Light''': Short flash every 7.5 seconds
* '''Au Sable Light''': Flashing white every 6 s
* '''Fort Washington Light''': flashing red

==8. What is a lightship? Why and where are lightships needed?==

[[Image:Ambrose Lightship.jpg|thumb|Ambrose Lightship]]

A lightship is a &lt;u&gt;light&lt;/u&gt;house on a &lt;u&gt;ship&lt;/u&gt;. It allows a lighthouse to be put where a lighthouse ''cannot be built''.  For example, a lightship may be moored over treacherous reefs, or marking the narrow approaches to a channel. Also, at harbor entrance(s) where lighthouses can not be built or placed in areas too far offshore for a land-based lighthouse's lens to reach.

Here's a link for more information:
http://www.nps.gov/history/maritime/ltshipmain.htm

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==9. Read about lighthouse keepers and list some of the hazards they faced in completing their duties.==

A lighthouse keeper is the person responsible for tending and caring for a lighthouse, particularly the light and lens in the days when oil lamps and clockwork mechanisms where used. Keepers were needed to trim the wicks, replenish fuel, wind clockworks and perform maintenance tasks such as cleaning lenses and windows.

==10. Study quotes by Ellen White mentioning lighthouses and discuss the meaning. Place a copy of the quotes in your scrapbook.==

Here's a link to a quote: http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/Drama.html. See pages 6, 17, 18.

==11. Obtain a “Lighthouse Passport” and have it stamped at 10 different lighthouse locations.==
* [http://uslhs.org/passports.php Lighthouse Passports]
* [http://uslhs.org/passports_sites.php Participating Lighthouses]

==12. Build a lighthouse modeled after a real lighthouse using a lighthouse kit, wood, or other medium. Know the name, location, and date when the actual lighthouse was originally built.==

''Have Fun! You should have no problems finding a kit to build on the Internet.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">A piece of curved glass can sometimes be used to focus the rays of the sun, igniting the tinder.  The glass must be smooth enough to not overly-distort the point of light.  A magnifying glass is the typical sort of lens used for this, but there are other possibilities in a pinch.  

It is [http://wildwoodsurvival.com/survival/fire/ice/index.html possible], for instance, to use a piece of ice shaped into a sphere to do the same job.  Getting the piece of ice round enough and, clear enough, and smooth enough to ignite a fire, however may prove to be difficult.

[http://wildwoodsurvival.com/survival/fire/cokeandchocolatebar/ Others] have reported success in polishing the bottom of a soda can, and using it as a mirror to reflect the sun's rays onto a point.  Again, it takes a lot of patience to polish the can well enough to be able to light a fire this way, but it has been done.  The polishing material can be any fine rouge-like substance, such as clay.  The surprising thing about this particular technique is that a chocolate bar has been used as the polishing compound!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Reader Message Boxes==

This work makes regular use of message boxes&amp;mdash;called &quot;Reader Message Boxes&quot;&amp;mdash;to draw the reader's attention to some important point of fact. Several different message boxes are used, and each serves a specific purpose. The Message Boxes used throughout this text are as follows:

{{reader-warningbox|This box is used to contain information intended prevent the reader from making some potentially serious error. This could be something as simple as indicating that activation of a feature may lead to security issues and how to mitigate such a risk.}}

{{reader-tipbox|This box is used to drop various small, but helpful tips for the reader to find. Such as: &quot;Remember that in order to produce a hidden share in Samba the share name must end with a '$' dollar sign. Do not think that naming your shares [dot]''share-name'' will have the same result, it won't.&quot;}}

{{reader-windowsworld|This note tends most often to serve as a reminder of the way things work in the 'Windows World', which might be forgotten by those who do not use Windows based machines on a regular basis. For example: &quot;Remember, in the Windows World, and by extension Samba, when the ''file-level'' and ''share-level'' permissions combine the '''Most Restrictive''' set of permissions wins.&quot;}}

{{reader-macworld|This note tends most often to serve as a reminder to peculiarities of deploying or using Samba shares in a homogeneous environment that includes Macintosh Computers. For example: &quot;Even though Microsoft Windows machines cannot see shares that have a dollar-sign '$' after them, MacOS X Samba clients ''can'' see these shares. Remember that obscurity alone is not sufficient to secure your shares (especially in this case) and to make doubly sure none of the Macintosh users have excessive permissions.&quot;}}

{{reader-linuxworld|This note is intended to give users who are new to Linux a helping hand in understanding the differences between Linux and non Unix-like platforms, such as Microsoft Windows. For example: &quot;Remember, Linux uses a different set of file permissions than Windows. Permissions are often expressed in numbers such as '7' (read-write-execute), '5' (read-only), or '0' (no rights).}}

{{reader-technicalnote|This note is used to briefly express hard-core technical information to the reader. This is often followed by hyperlinks to Wikipedia, or RFC's for more information. Such as: &quot;Remember: Samba, as of version 3, lacks direct support for Microsoft's ''Active Directory'' technology. Though Active Directory is a proprietary extension of the LDAP protocol, and Samba can use OpenLDAP to store user account information&amp;mdash;do not confuse the two. For more information on the LDAP protocol see: RFC 4510. For more information on Samba 4 which will have direct Active Directory support (also by OpenLDAP) see: [http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4 Samba4].}}

Hi Ke6gwf,

I assume that with a username like that, you must be into amatuer radio.  Welcome to Wikibooks, and particularly to the Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book.  I greatly appreciate your contribution to the Small Engines honor.  If you are up to it, requirement 9 could really use some attention.  If you don't like what it says, feel free to delete it and start over.  I wrote that part, and ran out of steam before I finished it up.  I was going to suggest that testing for spark could be done by grounding the end of the plug to the engine body and pulling the starter, but that didn't seem quite right.  If you have better ideas, please add them!

If you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  You can leave a note on my [[User_talk:Jomegat|Talk Page]] if you like.  You can also ask questions in the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]].

[[Image:Idli pan.png|right|thumb|Idli pan]]

'''Idli pans''' are pans with smooth, round indentations into which [[Cookbook:Idli|idli batter]] is poured, before steaming to make idli. They typically have holes punched into the pan between the indentations, to allow steam to rise and envelope the cooking idli. They may come as individual pans for use in a saucepan, or with a special pot used to steam several idli pans in a stack, or even as a tree of idli pans that fits into a large pot.

In addition to idli, they are used for steaming other foods including [[Cookbook:Idiyappam|idiyappam]], and also make great [[Cookbook:Poaching|poached]] [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]].</text>
