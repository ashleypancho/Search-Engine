==How are food molecules broken down to make energy?==

The major food molecule in living organisms is a sugar called '''glucose'''. Most ''carbohydrates'' (sugars and starches) are converted into glucose before they are broken down to release energy. The  series of steps where glucose is broken down to release energy begins with a metabolic pathway called ''glycolysis''. '''Glycolysis''' is the &quot;lysing&quot; or cutting of glucose to release energy. The six carbon sugar, glucose, is cut in half and converted into two three carbon sugars called ''pyruvate''. What happens next depends on the presence or absence of oxygen.

If oxygen is present, then glucose can be broken all the way down into carbon dioxide and water. This process is called ''aerobic respiration'' because it requires air (oxygen). In the absence of oxygen, the cell uses a process called ''anaerobic fermentation''. or simply ''fermentation''.
Fermentation doesn't break the sugar down any further, it simply helps reset the system so that more sugar can be broken down.

Because aerobic respiration breaks the sugar all the way down, it releases much more energy than fermentation.


==What is the equation for aerobic respiration?==

''' C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + energy '''


==How is energy stored in the cell?==
In living cells, energy is stored in the form of high energy molecules. The most common is a molecule that we call '''ATP''' (Adenosine triphosphate). ATP is a nucleic acid containing three high energy phosphate groups. It breaks off these groups to release measured amounts of energy. When ATP loses one phosphate group, it becomes Adenosine diphosphate ('''ADP'''). When ATP loses two phosphate groups it becomes adenosine monophosphate ('''AMP''').


Many reactions in the cell are directly run by ATP. ATP drives reactions as varied as moving flagella, pumping salt through pores, and making muscles move. Because ATP has so many uses, it has been called &quot;the currency of the cell&quot;.

There are other energy storing molecules found in cells. For the most part, these molecules must be converted into ATP for the cell to use them. This occurs in the mitochondria by a process called oxidative phosphorylation.


==Why do we need to breathe oxygen to live?==

Very simple organisms (e.g. bacteria) do not need much energy to live. Humans, however, require large amounts of energy to run their bodies. Fermentation produces two ATP molecules for every glucose molecule consumed. Humans need more energy than can be provided simply by fermentation alone. Therefore, humans must use aerobic respiration which produces 36 or 38 ATP's for each glucose molecule consumed. 

( See the [[Biology, Answering the Big Questions of Life/Metabolism/Metabolism3|advanced]] page for more information about why humans need oxygen to live.)

==What is the purpose of anaerobic and aerobic respiration?==
The sugar ''glucose'' is the major food molecule in the cell, but it is too energetic to use directly in most chemical reactions. To be useful, glucose is broken down into an energy storing molecule (ATP) that can be used throughout the cell.


==What are the steps in glycolysis?==

[[Image:GlycolysiscompleteLabelled.png|left|500px|thumb|These are the steps in glycolysis]]

==Why do cells need to ferment if they already get 2 ATP from glycolysis?==

Glycolysis yields 2 net ATPs and 2NADHs. NADH is another high energy molecule. (NAD has low energy, NADH has higher energy). NADH has many fewer uses in the cell than ATP. It is normally converted into ATP in the mitochondrial electron transport chain if oxygen is present.

If no oxygen is present, then NADH builds up and the cell can run completely out of NAD. Without NAD glycolysis stops. NAD becomes a &quot;limiting reagent&quot; The  chemical whose concentration determines whether the reaction will happen or not.

In the absence of Oxygen, the cell runs out of NAD and glycolysis is stopped until it can be regenerated. To regenerate NAD the cell uses a process called ''Fermentation''.

In Fermentation, Pyruvate is transformed into another molecule using the energy provided by NADH. NADH gets converted to NAD so that it can be used again in glycolysis, and pyruvate becomes Lactic Acid in animal cells, or Ethanol + Carbon dioxide in plants, yeast, and bacterial cells.
(Lactic acid builds up in muscle cells and causes cramps. When oxygen is present again, lactic acid is converted back into pyruvate and broken down by aerobic respiration).

The anaerobic pathway is glycolysis + fermentation. This pathway recycles the NADH generated, so the only energy molecules made from the breakdown of sugar by this pathway is 2ATP for every glucose molecule. The molecules made by anaerobic fermentation still contain lots of energy in the form of chemical bonds. Anaerobic fermentation in not a very efficient pathway to yield energy from glucose. 

==What pathways make up aerobic respiration?==
Aerobic respiration starts by breaking Glucose down into Pyruvate by ''glycolysis''. Next in a preparatory step for the Krebs cycle, ''Coenzyme A'' joins to pyruvate causing a loss of one carbon and the generation of NADH. The ''acetyl-CoA'' formed enters the Krebs cycle and the acetyl group is transferred to a molecule of oxaloacetic acid making a molecule of citric acid. The Krebs cycle releases CO2 and the high energy molecules NADH, and FADH2 which are converted into ATP by the mitochondrial electron transport chain.


==Why do we need oxygen to break down glucose completely by aerobic respiration?==

Aerobic respiration requires oxygen because oxygen is the ''final electron acceptor'' of the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. If there is no oxygen to accept electrons, then the electron transport chain stops working and the high energy molecules NADH+H and FADH2 cannot be converted back into NAD and FAD. Without these molecules, the glucose biochemical pathway stops. These molecules become the ''limiting reagents'' needed for glucose break down to continue, and when they run out, the pathway stops.

==How does the electron transport chain convert NADH and FADH2 into ATP?==

In order to get the full amount of energy released by the breakdown of sugar, you must convert the high energy molecules NADH and FADH2 into ATP. This occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria.

Energy in the form of electrons is taken from these molecules and passed from molecule to molecule in a molecular game of &quot;hot potato&quot; until it is ultimately dumped on oxygen. The extra pair of electrons allows oxygen to make another chemical bond, and it makes a water molecule. This frees up the electron transport chain to take another pair of electrons from an FADH2 or a NADH.


====The electron gradient====

The mitochondria contains two compartments, the ''matrix'' which is the area inside of the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and the ''intermembrane space'' which lies between the inner and outer membranes of the mitochondria.

The Kreb's cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria. This is where NADH and FADH2  are produced. They travel to the inner membrane and dump their electrons onto the membrane. This loss of electrons is a '''redox''' reaction and converts NADH back into NAD while FADH2 changes back into FAD.

The membrane proteins in the Electron Transport Chain are protein pumps. The passage of electrons across them makes them change shape and pump protons across the inner membrane from the matrix to the intermembrane space. Each NADH pumps three protons whereas each FADH2 pumps two protons.

NADH = 3ATP
FADH2 = 2ATP

This pumping of electrons across the inner membrane causes a concentration gradient of Hydrogen atoms across the membrane. By diffusion, the hydrogen ions will want to travel back into the matrix to reach equilibrium. They can do so by traveling through a special channel found in the membrane called ATP sythase. This channel uses the energy of the passage of the Hydrogen ions to make ATP. For each proton that passes, one ATP is made. This is why each NADH makes three ATP and each FADH2 makes 2 ATP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to create diagrams ==
Diagrams are invaluable for conveying precise chemical information without encroaching on the word count.  For two-dimensional diagrams such as skeletal formulae or flow charts, a [[w:molecule editor|molecule editor]] is your best bet.

For images of three-dimensional molecules, use [[w:molecular graphics|molecular graphics]] software, such as [http://www.accelrys.com/products/downloads/ds_visualizer/ Accelrys DS Visualizer], a free downloadable application for Windows. A tutorial on how to use DS Visualizer is available [[w:User:Benjah-bmm27/MakingMolecules|here]].

== 2001 ==

=== Article 1: ''From Accident to Design: the progress of poly(ethene)'' ===
* Discovery of poly(ethene)
* Development of industrial production of poly(ethene)
* Discovery of Ziegler-Natta catalysts

=== Article 2: ''Shaping up: the story of poly(propene)'' ===
* [[/Stereochemistry in poly(propene)/]]
* Development of Ziegler-Natta catalysts
* [[/Discovery and development of metallocene catalysts/]]

=== Exemplar response ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Central Processing Unit''' (CPU), also called a '''processor''', is the heart of your computer. It performs nearly all the actual computation that takes place as the computer is used. The choice of a CPU will affect the ultimate speed of the computer more than any other single component (gaming systems excepted; there the GPU is usually the bottleneck).

==Vocabulary==

Before we can explain the differences between CPUs, you must first be familiar with certain CPU terms.

[[Image:Cpu_Pentium100.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An Intel Pentium [[w:Central processing unit|CPU]]]]

; Clock speed : Clock speed, measured in gigahertz (GHz) or megahertz (MHz) (1 GHz = 1000 MHz), is the number of calculation cycles that your CPU can perform per second. Therefore, a higher clock speed generally indicates a faster processor. But not all CPUs perform an equal quantity of work per cycle, meaning two CPUs at the same clock speed can potentially perform at very different levels:  Clock speeds should not be compared for CPUs from two different architectures (AMD Phenom versus Intel i7, etc.) - in such cases, use reviews and benchmarks to judge relative performance.

; IPC : IPC, or instructions per cycle, is the amount of work a CPU can do in a cycle. With modern processors this number is an average.

; Front side bus speed (FSB) : Front side bus speed is the rate at which the CPU communicates with the northbridge chipset component on your motherboard,and, through the northbridge with main memory, measured in MHz. A larger FSB value shows that your CPU is able to communicate with memory and other components on the motherboard at a higher speed. In an AMD processor the front side bus depends on the version of HyperTransport it has: HT 1.x 800MHz, 2.0 1400MHz, 3.0 2600MHz, and 3.1 3200MHz. 

; Interface (Socket/Slot) : CPU’s plug into a socket on the motherboard. It is very important that your CPU is a COMPLETE MATCH to your motherboard CPU socket. Plugging a CPU into the wrong socket will never work and will usually break either the CPU, the socket, or both. 

; Bit width : Modern processors are either 32-bit or 64-bit (this is a simplification; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit for details). For our purposes a processor can be called 64-bit  if it will support running a 64-bit operating system. The newer chips from Intel and AMD all support this for most 64-bit OS’s. If you have any doubts, check the support materials for the 64-bit OS you are interested in running.

; Hyper-threading (HT) : Hyper-threading is an Intel technology which allows a single core processor to simulate having two cores, giving a performance boost when running several programs at once. It requires motherboards and chipsets supporting Hyper-Threading technology. The advantages of the Hyper-Threading technology have never been breathtaking and Intel has gone back and forth on its support in multi-core processors.

; Cache : Cache is memory implemented directly on the CPU. Data which is being used in computations is stored in the cache as much as possible and can be retrieved from there much faster than the same data can be pulled through the northbridge from main memory. Generally, the larger the cache, the faster the system will run. Cache comes in (usually) three varieties, L1, L2, and L3. L1 being the smallest and fastest, and L3 being the largest and slowest. Usually only the L2 cache size will be shown, as L3 is rarely used in processor design, and L1 will often stay the same size throughout an entire processor product line.

; Core : The core is the heart of the CPU. Often several cores will be marketed under the same name, so look at what core you are buying. It’s a mistake to choose a processor based solely on it’s rated speed in hertz . This number, while easy to understand, does not tell the whole story. The number of cores and the way they communicate will have a big effect, as will the fundamental architecture of the core or cores themselves. 

Slower processors are generally preferred for overclocking, as they can often achieve higher overclocking percentages. Retail CPU's come in a package containing a HSF (Heat Sink Fan), instructions, and a warranty, often 3 years. OEM CPUs do not include these.

The current CPU speeds and advantages change frequently, so for up-to-date comparisons, you may want to check a website that specializes in Hardware reviews, such as [http://tomshardware.com Tom's Hardware Guide] or [http://anandtech.com Anandtech]. A current (as of 14 February 2006) beginner's explanation can be found at [http://www.behardware.com/articles/607-1/a-survey-of-40-intel-and-amd-processors.html Behardware].




; Clock speed : the number of calculation cycles that the CPU can perform per second, measured in Gigahertz (GHz) or Megahertz (MHz).  1 GHz = 1000 MHz.  A higher clock speed generally points toward a faster CPU and, therefore, system.  However, not all CPUs perform an equal quantity of work per cycle, meaning two CPUs at the same clock speed can potentially perform at very different levels.  Other factors may also limit the effectiveness of a fast CPU.

; IPC : instructions per cycle, the amount of work a CPU can do in a cycle.  This varies with different properties of the CPU.

; Front side bus speed (FSB) : the rate (usually in MHz and/or MT/s) at which the CPU communicates with the northbridge chipset component on your motherboard.  A larger FSB value shows that your CPU is able to communicate with other components on the motherboard (and thus your system) faster, provided the motherboard supports an equally high FSB speed.  Note that MT/s (megatransfers per second) is a better gauge of FSB speed.  For example, a &quot;quad-pumped&quot; 266 MHz FSB will do 1066 MT/s, whereas a 1000 MHz FSB that does two transfers per cycle will do 2000 MT/s.

; Interface (Socket/Slot) : the type of connector that the CPU uses to connect to the motherboard.  It is VERY important that your CPU interface is a COMPLETE MATCH to your motherboard CPU socket otherwise you would be wasting money on a piece of spare silicon and may risk damage the the CPU and/or motherboard.

; Bit-rate : Most modern desktop CPUs are of the 32-bit x86 system, which works fine with most modern operating systems and hardware.  Higher end models (and all currently manufactured AMD desktop CPUs) are of the x86-64 (a.k.a. AMD64/EM64T) 64-bit system which may allow faster CPU processing capabilities due to the larger bandwidth, but not all operating systems are compatible with the newer 64-bit format -- they will still run, but without a major performance boost. You will require 64-bit if you need to manage more than 4GB of RAM.

; Cache : The cache is memory that is on the processor dedicated for it to use.  Cache is many times faster for the CPU to access than RAM.  Generally, the larger the cache, the faster your system would run.  However, cache uses a lot of transistors, and the larger the cache, the higher number of transistors needed, which consume more electricity, and output more heat.  Cache comes in (usually) three varieties, L1, L2, and L3. L1 being the smallest and fastest, and L3 being the largest and slowest. Usually only the L2 cache size will be shown, as L3 is rarely used in processor design, and L1 will often stay the same size throughout an entire processor product line.  

; Core : The '''core''' of the CPU is the heart of the CPU.  Often several cores will be marketed under the same name, so look at what core you are buying.

==== Multiple cores ====
; Advantages
: Dual-core processors are a fairly new innovation built by both major processor manufacturers (Intel [[w:Core Duo|Core Duo]] / [[w:Core 2 Duo|Core 2 Duo]] and AMD [[w:Athlon 64 X2|Athlon 64 X2]]).
:* Multitasking: Each processor has two processing centers (cores) for a theoretical maximum of twice the operating power and for better multitasking. Major advantages of dual core processors are evident when doing heavy multitasking, such as encoding video and playing video games at the same time.
:* Application Support: Newer applications are being written to take advantage of this technology by using a technique known as [[w:Thread (computer_science)|Multi-threading]].
:* Power Saving: Dual core processors (especially Intel Core Duo) have the ability to turn off one of their cores when application demand is low to save power.

; Disadvantages
:* Support: Older programs (with certain notable exceptions) do not support multi-threading and may run very slightly slower on dual core CPUs. Gamers should also take note of this as many games (typically those released before 2006, when the dual-core Intel and AMD processors were released) do not support processing with multiple cores that well, although some of the more bleeding-edge games will take advantage of using multiple cores.
:* Performance: A quad core isn't twice as fast as a dual core. Especially if you use a single, very demanding application (like games).

; The future of Multi-Core Processing : Quad core technology is finally here, and more and more programs are being built to take advantage of multiple cores. The large chip makers are discussing CPU's with eight, sixteen, even thirty two cores in the coming years. Only time and experience will tell how the advantages we are seeing with duo and quad core configurations will scale.

==== Descriptions ====
Often in advertisements (especially for pre-built systems) a processor will be described  briefly, like this:
: AMD FX-6300 at 3.5GHz

But there’s more to it than that, a more detailed specification would read as follows:
: AMD FX-6300 six core processor at 3.5GHz/4.1GHz, AM3+ socket, 8MB L3 Cache, 6MB L2 Cache 

Which parses out to:
: Model: AMD FX-6300
: Base Clock Speed: 3.5GHz (3500 MHz)
: Turbo Clock Speed: 4.1 GHZ (4100 MHz)
: Socket: AM3+ 
: L3 Cache: 8MB, L2 Cache: 3x2MB
So we can see that while 3.5 GHz is a fast clock speed, this processor might not be as fast as, a higher end AMD FX-8320, which runs at the same 3.5GHz base clock speed, but has 2MB more L2 cache and an additional two processing cores.

==== Intel ====
Intel classifies its CPUs using a series of numbers. 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, 6xx and 7xx of which 7xx denominates the highest end products. Generally, the higher the number, the faster the CPU and the more expensive. Usually, models and ratings correspond.  For instance: an Intel Core 2-Quad processor is at 2.4 while an AMD Phenom Quad-Core is at 2.2.  An Intel Core 2-Duo's speed is not very different from an AMD Phenom Quad-Core's speed. Here is a list of most modern Intel Desktop CPUs:

*'''Intel Celeron''' (Single and Dual core)
The Celeron series is a range of CPUs for budget computers and used to feature just one core. The last single core Celeron was released as part of the Sandy Bridge line-up, and since then all Celeron G-series processors have been dual-core.
*'''Intel Pentium''' (Single and Dual core)
The Pentium series was part of Intel's most popular CPUs. Earlier Intels all featured just one core, although the newer Pentiums feature dual-core support, such as the Pentium D, the Pentium Dual-Core, and the Pentium G-series processors.
*'''Intel Core 2 Duo''' (Dual core)
An extremely popular brand of Intel chips, the Core 2 Duo processors all support dual-core technology while fitting in to Intel's most common socket type, LGA 775 (Land Grid Array 775). Many older desktop computers from 2007-2010 will tend to use this CPU or another processor in the Core 2 series.
*'''Intel Core 2 Quad''' (Quad core)
The Core 2 Quad range of processors feature 4 processing cores and have been made for both gaming (although gamers should be aware of the lack of multi-core support for games released before 2006) and professional 3D graphics design, video editing, etc. Keep in mind that the hardware level the Core 2 Quad processors implement may cause bottlenecking, but usually most Core 2 Quad users would not have to worry about that.
*'''Intel Core 2 Extreme''' (Dual and Quad core)
This range of CPUs tends to be directed at enthusiasts and are basically improved versions of Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad processors. Be aware that these processors are quite expensive, even today, and typically aren't worth the buy (but if you really want it, nobody's going to stop you)

*'''Intel Core i3''' (Dual core)
These are dual core processors that have hyperthreading enabled, allowing them to make use of multi-threaded software more efficiently. This CPU series is made for LGA 1156, 1155, and 1150. This processor lineup is adequate for most applications, including the majority of games.

*'''Intel Core i5''' (Quad core)
These are quad core processors without hyperthreading. Like the rest of the 'i' lineup, they are made for LGA 1156,1155, and 1150. This series can take almost any game without bottlenecking the graphics card.

*'''Intel Core i7''' (Quad/Hexa core)
These are quad/hexa core processors with hyperthreading. Like the rest of the 'i' lineup, they are made for LGA 1156,1155, and 1150. This series can take any game without bottlenecking the graphics card. 



*'''Intel Xeon''' (Single, Dual, Quad, and Hexa core)
The Xeon brand was a brand of Intel x86 processors for workstations, servers, and embedded systems. The Xeon brand features single, dual, quad, and hexa (6) core processors (although don't get excited - remember that these are for servers and similar systems, not your &quot;Ultra-awesome high-tech bleeding-edge owns-everybody-else's computer&quot; with a 790i Ultra SLi motherboard and 4 graphics cards)
*'''Intel Core i7''' (Quad core)
Intel's newest line of consumer microprocessors, these CPUs are all have 4 cores and feature higher amounts of cache and Intel's new &quot;Turbo Boost&quot; technology, which allows all cores to automatically clock themselves to appropriate frequencies in intervals of 133 MHz without stressing the processor and risking overheating. The drawbacks? it's not compatible with Intel's de facto socket standard of LGA 775. Rather, it utilizes a newer socket - LGA 1366. It also is only compatible with DDR3 memory and does not use a FSB (Front Side Bus), but rather uses an Intel QuickPath interface (which, honestly, I have no idea how that makes it better from a FSB, but I do know that it only allows for one of these interfaces, so having multiple CPUs is out of the question). Basically, if you want to get this kind of processor, make sure the rest of your system is up to par. This line also includes the Core i3 and Core i5 processors. Core i3 is mainly used for low-power systems and it is usually single core. Core i5 is dual core and supports newer features like Turbo-Boost and Hyper Threading. 

''Other information about Intel's Classification System:''

: '''XD Technology:''' A CPU's model number followed by suffix J signifies XD (''eXecute Disable'') technology, which is an added security feature on Intel CPUs. Note that AMD processors have a similar technology dubbed EVP, or &quot;''Enhanced Virus Protection''.

: '''Intel's naming scheme:''' &quot;Intel Pentium 4 3.0Ghz L2-1MB with HT&quot; will easily convert to just &quot;Intel Pentium 4 530J&quot;

There is also the Core 2 Duo range out at the moment - it's naming scheme is relatively normal, except for the models ending with 50, they have 1333mhz FSB.

* E6300/E6320: 1.86Ghz, 2MB L2 Cache (E6320 has 4MB), 1066MHz FSB
* E6400/E6420: 2.13Ghz, same as above
* (new) E6540: 2.33Ghz, 4MB L2 Cache, 1333MHZ FSB
* (new) E6550: 2.33Ghz, same as above
* E6600: 2.4Ghz, 4MB L2 Cache, 1066MHZ FSB
* E6700: 2.66Ghz, same as above
* (new) E6750: 2.66Ghz, 4MB L2 Cache, 1333MHZ FSB
* (new) E6850: 3.0Ghz, same as above
* X6800: 2.93Ghz, same as above except multiplier unlocked

The Nehalem/Lynnfield/Sandy Bridge/Ivy Bridge/Haswell series line-up uses a different naming scheme as follows.
Celeron/Pentium indicates a basic dual core. Pentiums usually have more cache and higher clockspeed than celerons.
i3 denotes dual core with hyperthreading. No Turbo functionality.
i5 usually denotes a quad core without hyperthreading, and all feature turbo functionality which allows the processor to raise its clockspeed under load. However, the i5-6xx series was dual core hyperthreaded, and featured turbo unlike the almost identical i3-5xx series.
i7 denotes quad/hexa cores with hyperthreading, and all feature turbo functionality

Examples follow:

To differentiate the families using the 'i' designation, it is necessary to look at the numbering of the processors.
Any cpu that has the i designation and 3 digits is meant for LGA 1156
Any cpu that has the ix-2xxx/ix-3xxx type naming is for LGA 1155
Any cpu that has the ix-4xxx naming is for LGA 1150

Celeron G1101/Pentium G6950 is meant for LGA 1156
Celeron G4xx and G5xx/Pentium G6xx and G8xx series are for LGA 1155
Celeron G16xx/Pentium G2xxx are for LGA1155
Celeron G18xx/Pentium G3xxx are for LGA 1150

==== AMD ====
AMD CPUs have a different classification. The AMD Athlon CPU rating are '''not''' of the actual clock speed but rather the equivalence bench mark performance corresponding to a comparison to the AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1.0Ghz. The conversion Table is as follows:

[[Image:Athlon_xp_2000%2B.jpg|thumb|right|300px|AMD Athlon CPU]]


* AMD Athlon 1500+ = Actually runs at 1.33 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 1600+ = Actually runs at 1.40 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 1700+ = Actually runs at 1.47 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 1800+ = Actually runs at 1.53 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 1900+ = Actually runs at 1.60 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 2000+ = Actually runs at 1.67 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 2100+ = Actually runs at 1.73 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 2200+ = Actually runs at 1.80 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 2400+ = Actually runs at 1.93 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 2500+ = Actually runs at 1.833 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 2600+ = Actually runs at 2.133 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 2700+ = Actually runs at 2.17 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 2800+ = Actually runs at 2.083 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 3000+ = Actually runs at 2.167 GHz 
* AMD Athlon 3200+ = Actually runs at 2.20 GHz 

* AMD Octeron = Low-Power Quad-Core
* AMD Phenom x3 = Tri-Core 
* AMD Phenom x4 = Quad-Core
* AMD Phenom II x4 = Quad-Core

You may wish to purchase a high end AMD64/EM64T (AMD and Intel, respectively) processor, which provides support for 64-bit operating systems (eg. Windows XP Professional 64-bit Edition). Most 64-bit processors are backwards-compatible with 32-bit operating systems and applications.. Given the huge expansion in addressable memory afforded by the transition from 32-bit to 64-bit (a 32-bit address space tops out at  4 Gigabytes while a 64-bit space encompasses 17,179,869,184 Gigabytes)  64 bit operating systems are the wave of the future. For the time being though, given the enormous quantity of 32-bit software out there, and the limited advantages of 64-bit as of yet, the move is likely to be a slow one.

==== CPU cooling ====

[[Image:CPU-Cooler-Intel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A processor heat sink with fan]]

CPU cooling is very important, a less than average CPU temperature prolongs CPU life (up to more than 10 years). On the other hand, high CPU temperatures can cause unreliable operation, such as computer freezes, or slow operation. Extremely high temperatures can cause immediate CPU destruction by melting the materials in the chip and changing the physical shape of the sensitive transistors on the CPU. Because of this, '''never''' switch on the computer if your CPU has no cooling at all, or if the cooling device power cable is not plugged into the motherboard. Turn your computer on &quot;just to test whether my CPU works&quot; and you'll likely find that the CPU fries in less than 2 seconds and you'll be off to buy a new one.

Most CPU installations use forced-air cooling, but convection cooling and water cooling and even oil submersion cooling are options. For traditional forced-air cooling, the heat sink and fan (HSF) included with most retail CPUs is usually sufficient to cool the CPU at stock speed. Overclockers might want to use a more powerful after-market fan, or even try water cooling to combat the increased heat engendered by overclocking. 

Many retail HSF units have a thermal pad installed.  These transfer heat from the CPU to the fan, helping to diffuse the heat created by the CPU. This pad is usable only once. If you wish to remove the fan from another CPU so that you can use it on your new one, or need to take it off for some reason, you will need to remove the pad and apply a thermal paste or another thermal pad. Note that some of the cheaper pads can melt in unexpected heat and may cause problems and potentially even damage if you are overclocking.  In either case, thermal paste is usually more effective, just harder to apply. If you plan to do any high performance computing, or remove and replace the HSF often, thermal paste is suggested. If you are planning  on a long term installation a thermal pad is often best. Using one or the other is essential to ensure consistent heat conduction between the CPU and heatsink.

Electrically insulating thermal pastes made up of silicon are the cheapest and safest, but silver-based thermal pastes sometimes perform better and carbon-based ones perform better still. When applied improperly both can be conductive, causing electrical shorts upon contact with the motherboard. A thin properly-applied layer will usually prevent this problem, although some pastes can become runny when they get hot. Users should also beware that many &quot;silver&quot; thermal pastes do not actually contain any silver metal.

For quiet operation, start with a low-heat (low wattage) CPU.  You can also underclock your CPU, giving up some unneeded performance for some peace and quiet. Another option is to choose a large copper heat sink with an open fin pattern. However, true fanless operation is difficult to achieve in most case designs. You can position a case fan to blow across the heat sink, or mount a fan on the heat sink. With either choice, a large and slow fan will give better airflow and less noise than a small and fast fan.

Some low-noise CPU cooling fans require special mounting hardware on the motherboard. Be sure that the cooling systems you choose are compatible with your motherboard.











== Multi-cores and Hyperthreading (HT) ==
Consumer multi-core processors are a fairly new innovation built by both major consumer processor manufactures, AMD's [[w:Athlon 64 X2|Athlon 64 X2]] and Intel's [[w:Core Duo|Core Duo]] and [[w:Core 2 Duo|Core 2 Duo]].  Intel also has a quad-core model, the [[w:Core 2 Quad|Core 2 Quad]], and AMD supports motherboard architectures that allow for two individual dual-core processors.

=== Multi-Core Advantages ===
* Multitasking: Each processor has two processing centres (cores) for (a theoretical maximum of) twice the operating power and for better multitasking.  Major advantages of dual core processors are evident when doing heavy multitasking, such as encoding video and playing video games at the same time.
* Application Support: Newer applications are being written to take advantage of this technology by using a technique known as [[Wikipedia:Thread_%28computer_science%29 Multithreading|multithreading]].
* Power Saving: A dual core processor (specifically the Intel Core Duo) usually has the ability to turn off one of its cores when application demand is low to save power.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Support: Most older programs do not support multithreading and will likely not run any faster on dual core CPUs than on a single-core of the same clock speed.
* Price: Dual core processors are also significantly more expensive than their single core brethren, due to the fact that they are essentially two combined CPUs.

=== Multi-core Future? ===
The trend of CPU design is turning towards multi-core processors (one notable example is the Cell processor in the [[w:Playstation 3|Sony Playstation 3]], with 7 active cores), instead of higher clock speed, and more and more programs being built to take advantage of multiple cores, so prices are sure to decrease, and the availability and usability of multi-core processors is sure to continue to increase.

=== Hyper-threading (HT) ===
Hyper-threading is a technology which allows a single core processor to simulate having two cores, often giving a performance boost when running several programs at once.  It requires motherboards, chipsets, and operating systems supporting Hyper-Threading technology.  It also suffers similar disadvantages as Dual-Core Processors of support and price.  In addition, under certain conditions, the additional overhead of Hyper-Threading may even decrease performance of some applications.

== CPU Specifications ==
Now, one of the most common mistakes of choosing a CPU is ignoring the fine print of CPU specifications and relying completely on the clock speed.  CPU specifications are written in full like this:
&lt;code&gt; 
: Intel Pentium 4 3.2GHz LGA775 FSB800 HT L2-2MB
: Model: Intel Pentium 4
: Clock Speed: 3.2GHz (=3200MHz)
: Interface: Land Grid Array 775
: L2-Cache: 2MB (=2048 kB)
: Frontside Bus: 800 Mhz
: Other Spec: HT technology
&lt;/code&gt;
The consumer logic for processor speed may be misleading because many consumers think that clock speed, which is measured in gigahertz (GHz) or megahertz (MHz) is equal to system speed.  While a higher clock speed will allow the CPU to do cycles more frequently and it does have a fundamental effect on speed, it is not the sole factor as the number of calculations (and data handled) per cycle is different for each different manufacturer and model.  In addition, other factors, such as FSB speed will affect the CPU's ability to process data efficiently.  If the FSB and RAM aren't able to get data to the CPU as quickly as the CPU can process it, then the CPU will speed some of the cycles doing nothing.  A cycle during which the CPU does nothing is called a '''wasted cycle'''.

Intel classifies its x86 CPUs using a series of numbers. 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, 6xx and 7xx of which 7xx being the highest end products. Generally, the higher the number, the faster the CPU and the more expensive. Usually, models and ratings correspond.

* 3xx Series: Intel Celeron (L2-128KB)
* 4xx Series: Intel Celeron D (L2-512KB)
* 5xx Series: Intel Pentium 4 / Celeron D (L2-1MB)
* 6xx Series: Intel Pentium 4 / Pentium 4 XE (L2-2MB)
* 7xx Series: Intel Pentium 4 XE
* 8xx Series: Intel Pentium D
* 9xx Series: Intel Pentium D

The number followed by suffix J signifies XD technology.
E.g. Intel Pentium 4 3.0GHz L2-1MB with HT --&gt; Intel Pentium 4 530J





You may wish to purchase a high end AMD64/EM64T (AMD and Intel, respectively) processor, which provides support for 64-bit operating system (eg. Windows XP Professional 64-bit Edition).  A 64-bit system is very efficient in handling large amounts of RAM.  In a 32-bit system, efficiency drops beyond about 512 to 864MB of RAM, and becomes significantly less efficient beyond 4GB of RAM.  Most processors for gaming are about 2.8Ghz-3.2Ghz.

A 64-bit processor is not necessary yet as most applications run on the 32-bit system (which the 64-bit systems are backwards-compatible with). However, there is no doubt that the 32-bit system would gradually be replaced by the 64-bit system when the prices fall over a few years time. It is unlikely that the 64-bit system would completely replace the 32-bit system within 5 years but Linux users might find a great improvement in speed when a 64-bit processor is used. Note that there are processors that can run 32-bit code ''and'' 64-bit code; they are becoming very popular and may prove a very wise investment for the future of computing, which will invariably be 64-bit. They are more expensive than processors that only run 32-bit code; however, it should be noted that AMD has invested in this market faithfully, and therefore all of their processors, even their low-end Sempron line, runs both types of code. The same cannot be said for the Intel family, which only includes such technology in their high-end server processors and the new Core 2 series.

Smaller processors are generally preferred for overclocking, as they run cooler, and can achieve higher clock speeds. Retail CPU's come in a package containing a HSF (Heat Sink Fan), instructions, and a warranty, often 3 years. OEM CPUs do not include these.

The current CPU speeds and advantages change frequently, so for up-to-date comparisons, you may want to check a website that specializes in Hardware reviews, such as [http://tomshardware.com Tom's Hardware Guide] or [http://anandtech.com Anandtech].

== CPU cooling ==
CPU cooling is very important and should not be overlooked. A less than average CPU temperature prolongs CPU life (up to more than 10 years). On the other hand, high CPU temperatures can cause unreliable operation, such as computer freezes, or slow operation. Extremely high temperatures can cause immediate CPU destruction by melting the materials in the chip and changing the physical shape of the sensitive transistors on the CPU. Because of this, '''never''' switch on the computer if your CPU has no cooling at all. It is an extremely stupid thing to do. Turn your computer on &quot;just to test whether my CPU works&quot; and you may find that the CPU fries in less than 5 seconds and you will be off to buy a new one.

Most CPU installations use forced-air cooling, but convection cooling and water cooling are also options. For traditional forced-air cooling, the heatsink and fan (HSF) included in most retail CPUs is usually sufficient to cool the CPU at stock speed. Overclockers might want to use a more powerful aftermarket fan, or even try water cooling because they need additional cooling ability given the increased heat of overclocking. 

HSFs with decent performance are usually copper-based. The cooling effect is enhanced if the HSF has heatpipes. Silent (i.e. fanless) HSFs are there to provide users with nearly silent cooling. 

Many retail HSF units have a thermal pad installed.  These transfer heat from the CPU to the fan, helping to diffuse the heat created by the CPU. This pad is usable only once. If you wish to remove the fan from another CPU so that you can use it on your new one, or need to take it off for some reason, you will need to remove it, and apply a thermal paste or another thermal pad. Note that some of the cheaper pads can melt in unexpected heat and may cause problems and potentially even damage if you are overclocking.  In either case, thermal paste is usually more effective, just harder to apply. If you plan to do any high performance computing, or removing and replacing the HSF, often thermal paste is suggested. If you are planning a long term installation a thermal pad is suggested. Non-conductive thermal pastes made up of silicon are the cheapest and safest.

Silver-based thermal pastes sometimes perform better than normal thermal pastes, and carbon-based ones perform better still. When applied improperly both can be conductive, causing electrical shorts upon contact with the motherboard. A thin properly-applied layer will usually prevent this problem, although some pastes can become runny when they get hot. Users should also beware that many &quot;silver&quot; thermal pastes do not actually contain any silver metal.

For quiet operation, start with a low-heat (low number of watts) CPU. Processors made by VIA, such as the VIA C3, tend to produce low amounts of heat. The Pentium M gives performance that is on par with many of the desktop processors, but gives off more heat than the Via processors. You can also underclock your CPU, giving up some unneeded performance for some peace and quiet. Another option is to choose a large copper heat sink with an open fin pattern. However, true fanless operation is difficult to achieve in most case designs. You can position a case fan to blow across the heat sink, or mount a fan on the heat sink. With either choice of fan placement, choose a large and slow fan over a small and fast fan to decrease noise and increase air flow.

Some low-noise CPU cooling fans require special mounting hardware on the motherboard. Be sure that the cooling fan you choose is compatible with your motherboard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm '''Ben Mills'''.  My home is in [[w:Odell, Bedfordshire|Odell]], a village in North [[w:Bedfordshire]], England.  Between 2004 and 2006 I was studying [[w:Natural Sciences at Cambridge|Natural Sciences]] at [[w:King's College, Cambridge]].  I've struggled with [[w:clinical depression|depression]] in the past few years, exacerbated by the stresses and strains of [[w:University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], so I transferred to [[w:University of Bristol|Bristol]], where I've been since October 2007, continuing my studies in [[w:chemistry|chemistry]].

In between Cambridge and Bristol, I worked as an administrator, teaching assistant and tutor at [[w:Sharnbrook Upper School and Community College|Sharnbrook Upper School]], my former school.

I am currently in between the second and third years of a [[w:User:Benjah-bmm27/degree|chemistry MSci]] at the [[w:University of Bristol|University of Bristol]].

Most of my editing is to chemistry articles.  I've been adding images of the molecular structures of some chemical compounds, especially to articles which previously lacked an appropriate image.  Before I had access to the scientific literature, I used to use Wikipedia all the time to find the structures of molecules, so I feel I am returning the favour by adding structures where none existed before!

I also have my own website, [http://www.benjamin-mills.com Benjamin-Mills.com].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Converting Information into Mass Flows - Introduction ==

In any system there will be certain parameters that are easier (often considerably) to measure and/or control than others. When you are solving any problem and trying to use a mass balance or any other equation, ''it is important to recognize what pieces of information can be interconverted''. The purpose of this section is to show some of the more common alternative ways that mass flow rates are expressed, mostly because it is easier to, for example, [[w:orifice plate|measure a velocity]] than it is to measure a mass flow rate directly.

== Volumetric Flow rates ==

A '''volumetric flow rate''' is a relation of how much volume of a gas or liquid solution passes through a fixed point in a system (typically the entrance or exit point of a process) in a given amount of time. It is denoted as:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}_n \dot= \frac{Volume}{time} &lt;/math&gt; in stream n}}

Volume in the metric system is typically expressed either in L (dm^3), mL (cm^3), or m^3. Note that a cubic meter is very large; a cubic meter of water weighs about 1000kg (2200 pounds) at room temperature!

=== Why they're useful ===

Volumetric flow rates can be measured directly using '''flow meters'''. They are especially useful for gases since the volume of a gas is one of the four properties that are needed in order to use an ''equation of state'' (discussed later in the book) to calculate the molar flow rate. Of the other three, two (pressure, and temperature) can be specified by the reactor design and control systems, while one (compressibility) is strictly a function of temperature and pressure for any gas or gaseous mixture.

=== Limitations ===

'''Volumetric Flowrates are Not Conserved'''. We can write a balance on volume like anything else, but the &quot;volume generation&quot; term would be a complex function of system properties. Therefore if we are given a volumetric flow rate we should change it into a mass (or mole) flow rate before applying the balance equations.

Volumetric flowrates also do not lend themselves to splitting into components, since when we speak of volumes in practical terms we generally think of the total solution volume, not the partial volume of each component (the latter is a useful tool for thermodynamics, but that's another course entirely). There '''are''' some things that are measured in volume fractions, but this is relatively uncommon.

=== How to convert volumetric flow rates to mass flow rates ===

Volumetric flowrates  are  related to mass flow rates by a relatively easy-to-measure physical property. Since  &lt;math&gt; \dot{m} \dot= mass/time &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} \dot= volume/time &lt;/math&gt;,  we need a property with units of &lt;math&gt; mass/volume &lt;/math&gt; in order to convert them. The '''density''' serves this purpose nicely!

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}_n*{\rho}_n = \dot{m}_n &lt;/math&gt; in stream n}}

The &quot;i&quot; indicates that we're talking about one particular flow stream here, since each flow may have a different density, mass flow rate, or volumetric flow rate.

== Velocities ==

The velocity of a bulk fluid is ''how much lateral distance along the system (usually a pipe) it passes per unit time''. The velocity of a bulk fluid, like any other, has units of:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; v_n = \frac{distance}{time} &lt;/math&gt; in stream n}} 

By definition, the bulk velocity of a fluid is related to the volumetric flow rate by:

{{box|&lt;math&gt;{v}_n = \frac{\dot{V}_n}{A_n} &lt;/math&gt; in stream n}}

This distinguishes it from the velocity of the fluid at a certain point (since fluids flow faster in the center of a pipe). The bulk velocity is about the same as the instantaneous velocity for relatively fast flow, or especially for flow of gasses. 

For purposes of this class, all velocities given will be bulk velocities, not instantaneous velocities.

===Why they're useful ===

(Bulk) Velocities are useful because, like volumetric flow rates, they are relatively easy to measure. They are especially useful for liquids since they have constant density (and therefore a constant pressure drop at steady state) as they pass through the orifice or other similar instruments. This is a necessary prerequisite to use the design equations for these instruments. 

=== Limitations ===

Like volumetric flowrates, '''velocity is not conserved'''. Like volumetric flowrate, velocity changes with temperature and pressure of a gas, though for a liquid velocity is generally constant along the length of a pipe.

Also, velocities can't be split into the flows of individual components, since all of the components will generally flow at the same speed. They need to be converted into something that can be split (mass flow rate, molar flow rate, or pressure for a gas) before concentrations can be applied.

=== How to convert velocity into mass flow rate ===

In order to convert the velocity of a fluid stream into a mass flow rate, you need two pieces of information:

# The '''cross sectional area''' of the pipe.
# The '''density''' of the fluid.

In order to convert, first use the definition of bulk velocity to convert it into a volumetric flow rate:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}_n = v_n*A_n &lt;/math&gt;

Then use the density to convert the volumetric flow rate into a mass flow rate.

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_n = \dot{V}_n*{\rho}_n &lt;/math&gt;

The combination of these two equations is useful:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_n = v_n*{\rho}_n*A_n &lt;/math&gt; in stream n}}

== Molar Flow Rates ==

The concept of a molar flow rate is similar to that of a mass flow rate, it is the number of moles of a solution (or mixture) that pass a fixed point per unit time:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_n \dot= \frac{moles}{time} &lt;/math&gt; in stream n}}

=== Why they're useful ===

Molar flow rates are mostly useful because ''using moles instead of mass allows you to write material balances in terms of reaction conversion and stoichiometry''. In other words, there are a lot fewer unknowns when you use a mole balance, since the stoichiometry allows you to consolidate all of the changes in the reactant and product concentrations in terms of one variable.

=== Limitations ===

Unlike mass, '''total moles are not conserved'''. Total mass flow rate is conserved whether there is a reaction or not, but the same is not true for the number of moles. For example, consider the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen gasses to form water:

&lt;math&gt; H_2 + \frac{1}{2}O_2 \rightarrow H_2O &lt;/math&gt;

This reaction consumes 1.5 moles of reactants for every mole of products produced, and therefore the total number of moles entering the reactor will be more than the number leaving it.

However, since neither mass nor moles of individual components is conserved in a reacting system, it's better to use moles so that the stoichiometry can be exploited, as described later.

The molar flows are also somewhat less practical than mass flow rates, since you can't measure moles directly but you can measure the mass of something, and then convert it to moles using the molar flow rate.

=== How to Change from Molar Flow Rate to Mass Flow Rate ===

Molar flow rates and mass flow rates are related by the '''molecular weight''' (also known as the '''molar mass''') of the solution. In order to convert the mass and molar flow rates of the ''entire solution'', we need to know the '''average molecular weight''' of the solution. This can be calculated from the molecular weights and mole fractions of the components using the formula:

&lt;math&gt; \bar{MW}_n = [\Sigma({MW}_i*y_i)]_n &lt;/math&gt;

where i is an index of ''components'' and n is the ''stream'' number. &lt;math&gt; y_i &lt;/math&gt; signifies ''mole fraction'' of each component (this will all be defined and derived later).

Once this is known it can be used as you would use a molar mass for a single component to find the total molar flow rate.

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_n = \dot{n}_n * \bar{MW}_n &lt;/math&gt; in stream n}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Usage and Relevance of trigonometry ===
[[Image:Trigonometry intro circ triangle.svg|right|300px]]

In trigonometry, there are some concepts which must be grasped by the reader in order to understand the usage and beauty of trigonometry. It has often been asked why trigonometry exists, and why it is not simply under the umbrella of geometry -- while it is true that trigonometry is a tenet of geometry, its importance gives it the title of trigonometry because it is simply more than just, &quot;what is a triangle's length?&quot; and &quot;what kinds of triangles are there?&quot;, and should thus be acknowledged.

Similarly, such thought takes away from the principles of mathematics; asking why a dog is not called &quot;a-furry-thing-sometimes-but-sometimes-not-furry-and-sometimes-barks-when-angry&quot; is the same as asking &quot;Why isn't trigonometry called geometry of triangles?&quot;; if for nothing else, the name is used for referring to something with accuracy and meaning and not for determining what it is a part of. If it were for people to go to the base of every definition every tenet of science, it would end up to some kind of ambiguous mess seen before in explaining our doggy friend. 

If you are concerned about the history of trigonometry, which, by all means has importance, then understanding the principles and finer points of its beauty will help you come to the conclusions its contributors came to, hundreds and even thousands of years ago.

=== Further concepts and understanding===
In order for you to understand trigonometry, this book will provide the necessary foundation in mathematics to help you continue toward a complete understanding of the topic, rather than urge you to read another book, and switch back and forth between the two. However, it is beneficial to have an understanding of algebra and basic mathematics to be able to learn the topic of trigonometry with a &quot;running start&quot;.  Because trigonometry describes entities and their relation to each other, trigonometry is naturally expressed through geometry because of entities which produce ratios, constants and equivalents to each other. These entities are not difficult to understand, but require some thought when being applied to situations of trigonometry. 
 
The prerequisites of trigonometry are learned similarly to those of the principles and prerequisites for any other form of mathematics and are used throughout this book. When learning any topic, the fundamentals are re-used repeatedly as a means of achieving higher platforms of learning once other concepts have been understood and analyzed properly. Although this may sound difficult to someone who has not practice mathematical analysis and understanding, the use of the terms is merely a means of describing the tasks which you have to do, or guide you in which way it is best to go about them, and is by no means out of the reach of anyone. 

So, for the foundations of trigonometry, the fundamentals are that the student be ready and willing to understand the relation of objects to each-other and other shapes. Of course, because these entities are in relation, they resemble a whole unit which, when broken down, must be related with the use of algebra. However, such algebra only involves very basic equations, ratios and fractions and these will be broken down initially to show their logic, but also to reveal paths to the reader which they may not have known, or thought of before.

Of course, with everything that has requirements within other fields, reading other disciplines also helps enhance the ease and accuracy of the skills when they are applied to trigonometry. However, a good axiom for all learning that should be applied here is that you must allow yourself to move to the topics and the discipline itself; do not feel that you are implicitly required to, or that you must learn the concepts, but get to a stage where you, yourself are interested in the topic and feel that reading the topic directly gives you extra depth on the topic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a great wikibook.

I have one question about the printing.  I implemented this, but somehow I messed something up, so the print menu is grayed out, even though the printDocument code is there and print menu item does point to it.  From what I understand the code searches up the responder chain until it finds the printDocument.  When it finds it, it activates the print menu, and in my case has not found it.

Some information in the book about how to check in the case of problems would be great.

cheers-

      <comment>/* Copying the plugin to the GIMP plugin directory */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Plugins can be very helpful in The GIMP. GIMP Plugins can be quite useful. Take, for example, the DDS plugin. The DDS plugin is a now stable and reliable plugin to load DDS files, supporting the OpenGL S3TC extension. Of course, GIMP plugins are not limited to file loading. There exists a GIMP plugin for using the CMYK color model!

If you want to run Photoshop plugins in The GIMP, Microsoft Windows and Linux users may use the PSPI plugin.
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/pspi.html

==Finding and downloading plugins==
The largest known source of GIMP plugins is the GIMP Plug-In Registry. The GIMP Plug-In Registry contains many useful plugins for The GIMP and all of its versions. In addition to regular plugins, you can also find Perl, Script-Fu and Python plugins at the GIMP Plug-In Registry. 

You can find the GIMP Plug-In registry at the URL below.

http://registry.gimp.org/

Once you have downloaded the plugin, you need to load it into GIMP. In order to load it into GIMP, it needs to be extracted from the package in which it came.

==Extracting plugin packages==
Almost every plugin you download will come in a package. You need to extract this package. 

ZIP files can be extracted easily in Windows and GNU/Linux with the utilities included with your OS. Windows includes ZIP support by default. Most (if not all) GNU/Linux distributions include [http://www.info-zip.org/ Info-ZIP], which can be used to decompress ZIP files, along with a GUI frontend, such as File Roller for GNOME and Ark for KDE. 

RAR files are compressed using a proprietary format. [http://www.rarlab.com/ WinRAR] is the original tool for RAR, available for many platforms, but it is proprietary shareware. There are alternatives. The free software (as in freedom) [http://home.gna.org/unrar/ unrar] can unpack RAR files that do not use RAR 3.0 or later. If RAR 3.0 is needed, taking a newer CVS snapshot may work, which has been done for the unrar-free Debian and Ubuntu packages. The [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip] program includes support for RAR 3.0, but the RAR component is proprietary.

TAR.GZ and TAR.BZ2 files are compressed archives originating from GNU/Linux. It is a double extension. The &quot;GZ&quot; or &quot;BZ2&quot; section refers to the fact the compression method is gzip or bzip2. gzip and bzip2 can only compress single files, however, so a program like tar is used to merge the files/folders into one file, hence the &quot;TAR&quot; section of the name. On GNU/Linux, the original tools can be used, usually &quot;tar -xvzf file.tar.gz&quot; (TAR.GZ) or &quot;tar -xvjf file.tar.bz2&quot; (TAR.BZ2). On Windows, the free 7-Zip can be used.

7z files can be done in Windows with 7-Zip, and in GNU/Linux, if the p7zip utility is installed, Ark and File Roller will work, along with the p7zip command directly.

If you find any other file types, a quick search on the internet will help. On the Windows platform, [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip] is a piece of software that will extract most file formats, while on GNU/Linux, most free are bundled with the OS and others usually can be found in your package manager.

==Copying the plugin to the GIMP plugin directory==
Open up the folder containing the plugin. Now, copy the files to the clipboard (Select the files, right click one and press copy)

===Windows===
On Windows, go to folder GIMP is installed in (usually somewhere in Program Files). Once in the GIMP's main folder navigate to lib\gimp\*version*\ where as *version* represents the version of The Gimp. Then double click the &quot;plug-ins&quot; folder. Not all plugins will run in Windows if the OS is 64bit, &quot;normalmap&quot; is one.

To install a script (ends in &quot;.scm&quot;) navigate to share\gimp\*version*\. Then double click the &quot;scripts&quot; folder.

===GNU/Linux===

On GNU/Linux, you might need to read the manual at the official site first under the section:

&quot;1.3. Installing New Plugins&quot;
http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-scripting.html#gimp-plugins-install

Plugins may be stored in different locations depending upon your distribution. 

Locally installing plugins are easiest because they will usually be stored in a hidden folder under $HOME/.gimp-*.* (where you should replace ''$HOME'' with path to your home catalogue and gimp-*.* with the version you use (for example 2.6). In this case, however, the plugins you install will only be available to the user who installed them, which may not be what you want.

If you want to install plugins globally, you might have to look around a bit more. Some boxes will have plugins stored at /opt/gnome/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/ (change lib to lib64 if you've got a 64bit OS), others /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/ (change lib to lib64 if you've got a 64bit OS. Running &quot;''$whereis gimp''&quot; (or &quot;''which gimp''&quot;) in a terminal might help. For example, if the output was /some/place/bin/gimp, then you could check the /some/place/lib (or lib64 if you've got a 64bit OS). In Ubuntu, plugins are located at /usr/share/gimp/2.0/ for both 32 and 64bit. Note that you have to be root to access these files.



===Ubuntu GNU/Linux===
Steps to install GIMP scripts / plugins
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Download the relevant GIMP script from the GIMP plug-in registry.
* Each GIMP script is available in two formats namely – Script-Fu (.scm) and Python script (.py). You can choose to download either one of them but not both. If you are downloading the Script Fu file, then it should be saved in GIMP scripts folder. If you are downloading the Python file, it should be saved in the GIMP plug-ins folder. Let’s assume we have downloaded the python script for the sake of this example.
&lt;li&gt; Save the downloaded python script into the GIMP plug-ins folder. In Ubuntu, it is in the directory /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/

How did I find the correct directory, you ask? I opened a terminal and ran the following command :
&lt;pre&gt;
$ dpkg -L gimp | grep plug-ins
&lt;/pre&gt;
Of course, there is another way of finding the GIMP plug-ins folder which is, start GIMP and open “GIMP Preferences” dialog. In this dialog, click on “Folders &gt; Plug-ins” and you will find the directory where GIMP installs all its plug-ins.
&lt;p&gt;
Now you copy the downloaded script (gimp-script.py) into this folder as follows :
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo cp gimp-script.py /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Next open the terminal and set the execute bit for the python script file as follows :
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/gimp-script.py
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Lastly, if you have GIMP already running, restart it so that it is aware of all the new scripts you have installed.

&lt;/ol&gt;

===Mac===
System-wide script-fu scripts are stored in /Applications/Gimp.app/Contents/Resources/share/gimp/2.0/scripts/. Executable and python plugins are located in /Applications/Gimp.app/Contents/Resources/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/

User-private plugins are stored under $HOME/Library/Application Support/Gimp-2.8/plug-ins/.

''NOTE'': Check &quot;Preferences &gt; Folders&quot; to confirm your plug-ins directory. On some system, it may be set to &quot;Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.8/plug-ins/&quot; which is wrong. Fix this by adding a new path and restarting.

==Testing the plugin==
To test the plugin, simply open the GIMP and try the plugin. If this plugin makes a certain image type supported, try opening a file of that type. If the plugin is a filter, test it.

==Troubleshooting==
If the plugin appears to not be working, be sure that its for your OS and it is for your version of GIMP.

Also, [[Scheme Programming|Scheme]] ( Script-Fu ) plugins (*.scm) and python plugins go in their own respective folder, up one level from the regular plugins directory. Python plugins also require gimp-python.

The  Script-Fu directory is something like ''/usr/share/gimp/2.0/scripts/''.

==Statements==
:''Please briefly answer these set of questions in your own section.''
===SBJohnny===
; ''Where is the issue taking place?''
:Historically in the [[C++ Programming]] book, but lately it's spread throughout the project.

; ''Who's involved?''
:[[User:Panic2k4]], and just about everyone who has tried to contribute to that book.
:More recently he's become unpopular with more than a few others, because he used sockpuppets to evade a block.

; ''What's going on?''
:&quot;Total mayhem&quot; sums it up rather nicely :). I was going to answer here (busy yesterday, sorry!), but Panic appears to be baiting me on his talk page (disparaging metaphors and legal threats), so I will keep my self out of this for the time being. I can be contacted on IRC or email if there are any questions. 

; ''What would you like to change about that?''
:

===Panic2k4===
; ''Where is the issue taking place?''
: Wikibooks, but directly related to issues already stated on the arbitration logs.
: See: [[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny]]
: That is the source, everything after was derived from the way it ended. 
 
; ''Who's involved?''
: [[User:Panic2k4]] and [[User:SBJohnny]] at least on my side and for now.

; ''What's going on?''
: Wrongly blocked 3 times by [[User:SBJohnny]] (in reality I lost count at 5 but some weren't made by [[User:SBJohnny]] but he strongly supported them)

; ''What would you like to change about that?''
: I wish for someone to specify and evaluates the accusations in a proper way and point to me situations that validated the use of a block (even if wrongly performed), so I can clear my name (as I'm still open to agree to be in error at some point), address the abuse of the block policy (as it was not fallowed and resulted in continued damage to my rights as user and person) and removal of blocks (can't see that last one happening, but if a strict use of site policy is made and issues are addressed in order later actions can be disregarded at least that is my opinion)
: Since I don't know in what order you will want to pick this mess apart, it is my suggestion that you would start by (for the sake of the community and to ease your job), analise the way the arbitration was terminated not only for my benefit but because of the minority of people that stood up against what clearly is not the way things should be done on wikibooks, I also call your attention that during the time the arbitration was proceeding I was not under block nor restricted to edit, if you agree with the way the arbitration was terminated (not to the fact that it was terminated), then there is no point on your attempt to analise the other events, as we would as I have with [[User:SBJohnny]] and others a very different view on how to come to decisions, respect others and in general fallow policies.
==Proposed agreements==
:''Below are intended to be proposed agreements, anyone can propose any constructive suggestion, however only involved parties can &quot;vote&quot; to agree/disagree''
===Sockpuppets===
Regardless of the intention sockpuppets should not be used to evade any kind of block (Justified or not)
:'''Proposed by:''' [[User:Cool Cat|Cool Cat]]
:'''Vote:''' &lt;!-- Vote Support/Oppose --&gt;
*'''Support''' -- I came pretty close to getting blocked on wikipedia a couple times (edit conflict over italics,,, long and painfully boring story), but even though I was right, I wouldn't have used a sockpuppet to go around a block. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:41, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
*
===Staying Focused===
Regardless of any wrongs or injustice that Panic has, agreeing to stay focused on the problems that the community has with Panic that has continued to cause him to be blocked, putting aside any disputes or objections he has regarding policies, the GFDL, laws, etc.

==Discussion==
===Involved parties only===
&lt;!-- 
     Comments here should only be made by Cool Cat, SBJohnny or Panic2k4
--&gt;
I really want to focus on what is at hand today, not what has happened in the past. I can't change the past. Panic2k4 what exactly would you like to see changed? --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Cool Cat|Cat]] [[User talk:Cool Cat|out]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

:My block.
:If we reduce the scope so much then I really haven't got a problem with anyone since all actions will be outside of the discussion. You then should address the one that blocked me and ask why I'm blocked and what purpose does the block address that will only reverse the order of analysis as he probably can't justify the block without using the past as reference.
:Anyway I seem to have read someone opposing this debate, I think we should address first the community concerns, even about the lifting of the last block to allow me to participate and at least come to an agreement on who agrees to participate and in what way and what is going to be addressed and how it will be applied, if the agreement is only between me, you and SB Jhonny then the community will have to respect our wishes even if in the end the last block can't be removed at least we would be working to resolve SB Jhonny problems with me. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:12, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
::I think the better approach is for us to come up with a ''resolution to the dispute'' that the community would agree with. You can't just work outside of the community, you are supposed to be a part of the community --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Cool Cat|Cat]] [[User talk:Cool Cat|out]]&lt;/small&gt; 05:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
:::If a dispute is between 2 users the community doesn't have to be involved, unless the solution would in any way have impact in the community itself, for instance a simple edit conflict would only need the 2 users or a third (or more) as arbiter(s) if so requested and agreed, a unblock request is a bit more trickier and we at the moment don't have a policy that would cover that, but the same solution is applicable (as was being used on our case), the user and the blocking administrator can get to an agreement or a  arbitration can be used without no intervention of the community as it would not involve them, (in my case the problem was bigger because it was the first time and people did fear the arbitration of administrative actions, that I think was the main problem and the objection a significant part of the community had and why they imposed the end of the process and as I see it against consensus).
:::In any case I agree to discuss anything with anyone, see if you can define the problem in any way, but you should be careful on what actions you think we should address, it is my understanding that SB Jhonny is ok with your let's call it moderation, now he must define what are the subject he agrees to discuss or see addressed, it seems he declared a very big range and since you are restricting the time frame we would consider, I can't help you more, I gave you an idea from where to start, you can even agree to discuss and analise the problem outside of any &quot;moderation&quot; or arbitration with me, and show me were my action were incorrect, even that would at least help me, if in any case you came to share my view of the problem you may consider helping me addressing the problem next to the community. Any solution would be advantageous to all, inaction will only aggravate the problem. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 06:15, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
::::OK, lets try a little different approach to the issue then. Why do you feel you were blocked for? --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Cool Cat|Cat]] [[User talk:Cool Cat|out]]&lt;/small&gt; 06:23, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
* reset

Bad assessment of the situation by the administrator, probably (I don't know and can't understand some of the actions) due to disagreeing with me in other points regarding interpretation of the author vs contributor and GFDL as his opinion was closer to that of the user. I had a valid (as justifiable based on policy) dispute with Darklama, that was being addressed, he could have been misinformed outside of wikibooks but I can't comment on that. Resulting in abuse of (as not implemented in accord to) the use of the block policy. (If we are addressing the first 3 blocks) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 06:42, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
:Look, I cannot solve the 'past' disputes as they are a thing of the past. Please, lets focus on the present. My inquiry was for the very last block and what you think of it. --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Cool Cat|Cat]] [[User talk:Cool Cat|out]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
::It was illegal, it didn't obtain community consensus nor it emanated from an administrative action, in accord to the block policy in relation to any new event caused by myself. If I got it right the last block was performed at request of SB Jhonny but no specific reason was given, it was a direct result from other events that you are putting out of the discussion. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:58, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
:::I am merely trying to focus on current events. What is this deal with GFDL? Is that the root of the problem? I do not understand the disagreement at all. --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Cool Cat|Cat]] [[User talk:Cool Cat|out]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:25, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
::::Do you have my user page monitored, I'm discussing there with Whiteknight on the GFDL, as for the author vs editor, most users  seem to understand the any type of edit grants authorship of a work (this discussion would be futile on wikipedia but it seems to be a real problem to users o wikibooks to come to the understanding of the legal definition of author).
::::It is not the root but I think it is probably part of the problem the biggest one seems to be the revaluation of an administrative decision, I have writen a short story that resumes all the events (no users names were used), and it is not a exact account nor it intends to be, the &quot;judge&quot; character is used to simplify things also. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:11, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

     Comments here can be made by anyone

Cool Cat please remove this message if you feel that it doesn't belong here (not sure if this discussion is open to all).  In my own opinion this problem has got out of hand and as Panic and SBJohnny have made clear above there are several different issues which makes it all the more complex.  The original blocking of Panic took place on 9th December and was a short block issue by SBJohhny for trolling which (I think) concerned the infamous C++ book.  It is believed by most users connected to this book that Panic had a negative influence over the book and wanted control over it and this feeling had scared off many would-be users.  The following day a 2 week block was imposed by SBJohnny for continued problems associated with Panic and the aforementioned book.  Later, on 3rd January, Panic was blocked for a further 2 weeks for similar problems and again by SBJohnny.  He was later unblocked pending a long arbitration which was to be arbitrated by Robert Horning.  Unfortunately it seems that not everyone approved of the arbitration but as no alternative suggestions were made it went ahead anyway.  After a few weeks Robert Horning was absent for some time and so Withinfocus took the decision (after waiting a long time I should add) to end the arbitration and make a decision on his own.  He chose to block Panic for 6 months and promptly did so.  Robert Horning, Panic, myself and some other regular Wikibooks users were not happy at this decision as we either felt it was unfair or without community support.  However I think that there were more Wikibooks users who supported the block than didn't.  After much thought and some complaints from different parties I took the decision to unblock Panic and reimpose the original 2 week block (that SBJohnny had originally given him and what the arbitration was brought about for) as I thought this was a 'fairer' compromise.  Since this time Panic has been reblocked indefinitely and this has not pleased some users (myself included) as I feel that indefinite blocks whould only be used against the worst kind of vandals of which Panic is not.  During ongoing discussions with SBJohnny, Panic created some sockpuppet accounts to prove to the community that blocking users doesn't ever make them go away.  His decision was not a wise one and this prompted further opposition to Panic although the majority of his action with these sockpuppets was of a good nature.  Then you arrived Cool Cat and will hopefully sort all of this mess out.

My personal opinion is that SBJohnny was correct with his original 3 blocks but it may not look good if it's the same administrator performing the blocks each time.  Panic certainly should never have been reblocked indefinitely nor for 6 months but he must commit himself to working with the community and addressing any issues he might have with SBJohnny and C++ authors.  I believe that the issues about GFDL and sockpuppets are just distracting us from the real issues.  Thanks for your time y'all.

:I don't agree with the above opinion nor the reported assessment of events (in particular to have a problem with several users on that book), I do comprehend that it is how [[User:Xania]] sees it and value his position on how he interprets the events and  I take this chance to personally recognize him as one of the few that chose to object to the more objectionable actions that took place, and by doing so getting involved on the subject and taking a personal risk to defend his opinions. Kudos to him for  the action and exposing his views even if I don't agree with him.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

::I believe that I am not the only contributor to the C++ book to find that Panic's actions made it not worthwhile to continue to contribute.  I certainly had the impression that Panic characterized one set of corrections I made as &quot;vandalism&quot; because they did not correct all instances of the particular mistake I was addressing or some such.  That struck me as very odd, given that the reason for my edits was documented on the associated talk page, and that in any number of cooperative projects, the normal reaction to noting that somebody had contributed an incomplete correction would be to help them by applying that correction to other applicable instances of the error it addressed.  Talk of vandalism is immensely adversarial, and would seem not to be in the spirit of the &quot;assume good faith&quot; guideline.
::Further evidence, to my mind, of the non-cooperative nature of Panic online is in his tendency to turn discussions of reasonable conduct into attempts to define rules.  It's part of what makes a Wiki community work that it does not need a lot of formal rules, because people work together to reach consensus.  If a community within Wikibooks can't get along without a lot of rules, I think they're unlikely to get along with a lot of rules either.  I have experience in a fair range of online communities, and I've never seen anything quite like the current debacle.
::I'd be willing to put it all behind us, but Panic's conduct during this whole sorry affair has continued to be one of arguing rather than appearing to cooperatively seek a good solution based on an accurate understanding of the situation.  At this point I really do not know whether Panic argues for the sake of arguing, or whether he really does not see the problems that others do.  Panic is good at transforming a discussion to avoid the aspects he wishes to sidestep, but I think it would be better for him and the community not to do so; let's agree on what has happened first, and then make judgments on what to do going forward.  -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 06:16, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

::Two more notes: firstly, that most of what I see written here has been written before during this process.  I'd like to see some notion of at least a partial plan for how to ensure that we don't just go around in circles.  Secondly, maybe I should have written this elsewhere (or not at all).  It's not clear which dispute this &quot;Dispute resolution&quot; is intended to resolve (which was also a problem with the previous attempted arbitration).  It would be a good step to make sure we have a clear statement of what we're trying to achieve and why. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 06:20, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

I agree with James Dennett. Panic's behavior is very odd and has an adversed effect on people. I also agree with SB_Johnny in that Panic's very odd behavior has spilled over into the general community and as a result increased the intention given to it. I agree as a result, as Xania put it, Panic has had a negative effect on the community. I agree with James Dennett that Panic's conduct throughout this whole sorry affair has been one of arguing and avoidance rather than cooperatively seeking a good solution based on an accurate understand of the situation. I agree with James Dennett and as others have also said, that it would be better for Panic and the community to stay focused and have a plan to ensure that we aren't just going around in circles. Finally I also agree with James Dennett that the previous &quot;dispute resolution&quot; did not make it clear what was intended to be resolved, what we are trying to achieve and why.

I believe this &quot;dispute resolution&quot; or &quot;mediation&quot; should in the spirit of staying focus on what is an ongoing problem, &quot;here and now&quot;, as I understand Cool Cat wants, should be about resolving what problems the community has with Panic's behavior that has been the driving force of all the previous and current blocks, so that the community can, with or without him, move on to writing books rather than focusing on this. Unfortunately I don't believe Panic can or will agree to focus on this and will continue to try to focus on what he considers unjust blocks, wrongful use of Wikibooks/Wikimedia policies or wrong with them, and abuse/violation of the GFDL and laws, until he is no longer able to do so. As a result, causing this to draw out longer than anyone has time or patience for or ending very badly for him --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 09:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

I want to point out that for myself, I am not entirely happy with the statements that have been made against me, particularly by those who were critical of my being &quot;absent&quot; from discussion about the arbitration.  I deliberately tried to stay away from IRC discussions and the usual watering holes in part because I wanted to detach myself partially from the community and seek some objectivity.  I also deliberately tried to set up an arbitration system that would protect Panic from abuse, and give him the best opportunity to defend himself and and get a conclusion to the whole matter.  Instead (nothing against you personally Cool Cat) it appears as though those with an axe to grind against Panic were shopping for a venue that would confirm the ban that had been placed on Panic... even after I took over the arbitration.

From my perspective, what happened instead was that those who didn't get along with Panic (and there apparently were several) were quite upset that I hadn't blocked Panic already and wanted some action immediately.  I also engaged briefly in both an edit war and a wheel war over the situation with Panic, and I was faced with the dillema of either trying to continue and broaden the wheel war or aquiesce and let the current &quot;cabal&quot; (as I mentioned on my talk page) take over.  I do feel like I was bullied into letting Panic get blocked, and I'm still not entirely happy that it happened at all.  The &quot;lengthy&quot; period that I was &quot;absent&quot; was not even two weeks, and by Wikibooks standards that is generally a short time to resolve things.

I will also mention that on my own, while I have tried to go through page logs, deleted pages, and user contribution logs, that I simply don't see where Panic has done all of the damage that he is being accused of doing.  It seems more like a content edit war, with an additional twist that pushed Panic into the mess because he was writing a C++ Programming Wikibook, another group was writing another Wikibook on essentialy the same topic, and some admins came along and forced the merger of the two efforts even though there really was no community policy that really required this to happen.  In some ways, the fight is artificial and occured precisely because of this merger.  Experence on Wikipedia doesn't apply here as books are much more involved and you can find multiple book about the same topic... even by the same publisher.  The idea that one and only one book on a given topic can ever be written on Wikibooks has never been codified as policy and I would fight that policy if it were ever tried.  I do believe that this is ultimately the source of all of the contention, even though it has moved on.

In almost every case when people have even touched dealing with Panic, it seems as though logic goes straight out the window and either you want to crucify the guy or are dazzeled and confused by the whole mess.  Panic does have an abrasive personality and has created some hard core enemies.  Of that I'm sorry that people have to be so offended but it happens.  But that happens even elsewhere and you simply have to get along with people like this.  Even so, I never felt that any of the user blocks were justified, and I feel that I am being threatened with a block on my account if I try to do anything more right now, including trying to defend Panic.  I also find it odd that one of the ways that people were trying to deal with Panic was to establish policies that would empower them to be able to go after this one user.  I could speak volumes more, but I will say that for myself, I consider Panic to be a good friend and a very productive and useful contributor to the Wikibooks community.  He is not a vandal or the usual rogue user who seeks do deliberately damage this project, but rather somebody with a very different world view that apparently some people here can't appreciate or cope with.  It is far too bad that he is being singled out for so much attention in such a negative light and being told that he is not welcome on Wikibooks by what appears to me as a small but very vocal and active minority on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:47, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

=== Discussion between Panic and James Dennett ===

(At Panic's request, I've moved this here from his talk page. -- James)

About [[User:James Dennett]]:
I don't have nor ever had any problems with James, my original post and comments about the situation and links to actions done on that regard are on part 1 of my response to the accusations on the arbitration log, I will repeat here again in a resumé, 

James (and this is only my view on things, it can be wrong but facts support it), James is a old contributor to the C++ book he has been working on it since 2004, I have had nor reason or intention on addressing him directly before that post, he had not been involved on any discussions on the book evolution or to my knowledge on wikibooks in general (I know Paddu talked to him in 2004, the time of the fork and he also was contacted by the both [[User:Darklama]] and SB Jhonny near the arbitration days), in any case the so called &quot;conflict&quot; or what James is calling &quot;my accusation of vandalizing&quot; is clearly a confusion of his part and probably based on how he understand the situation and I already have (even before the block) requested apologies for it. The alleged &quot;conflict&quot; is about a 3 or 4 scattered word contribution, a post he made on the talk page requesting no alteration, his lack of signature of that and other posts, my conversation with other users at that time (I was busy addressing other 5-6 users including the ones I already named) and hadn't the time to check the text, his edit did transform humm incorrect information in nonsense, the request was made in the spirit I already stated I recognize and have James in high regard (relating to the book topic and even his edits on the book) and I consider that even if not shared by some wikibookians, he is a fellow author of the book as he has already added a significant quantity of his own content to it. I also note that he did not formalize a complain about my post on my talk or on the lounge as it is requested and that as soon as the user stated distress on the same book talk page I acted on it to clarify the action, I also remember that it  is my view that even if productive on the book the user was unaware and unexperienced with the social relations or even etiquette (like signing his posts), I don't say this in any way as a disregard to James, but to point out that he may have seen thing a bit differently that one more experienced user (only he can say if that true or false). (I'll edit later and add links to the text).

I agree with James in several points things should be addressed, censorships and objections to debate will only provide cover for incorrect actions, there should be no fear on showing the truth, and debate even if it is not wikibooks objective is at the last degree beneficial to shared understanding, even if I don't agree with James and other users (but not on the same problem James points out, it seems that James object to the initial part of the text and the other users objected only to the time limitation), we can address that, and see if it really is a violation of policy and if the intention was of abuse from my part.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:38, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

I don't care to debate the meanings of words: whether something is &quot;conflict&quot; to you, doesn't change the fact that there was a communication problem and that I personally found your approach to be grating and a violation of expected codes of etiquette.  There was a problem, whether you agree that the term &quot;conflict&quot; applies or not doesn't matter; pick a different term if you prefer.

Claiming that things are &quot;clearly a confusion on [James Dennett's] part&quot; assumes your own conclusion.  But maybe you can tell me what you were referring to when you wrote of some edits that they were vandalism?

I am not talking &quot;about a 3 or 4 scattered word contribution&quot;, and I did not make &quot;a post... on the talk page requesting no alteration&quot; (though I would and did ask that the page not be reverted to remove the error corrections).

Regarding &quot;a lack of signature of that and other posts&quot;: when people assume good faith, there's not always a need to sign every point on a talk page.  Whilst it's often useful, it's also useful to keep egos out of it by just posting impersonal information.  The spirit of the rules is more important than a dogmatic application of it.  (I'd say that's something of a meta-rule; if the rules act against the best interest and the stated goals of the community, the rules are in error.  This may be a clash of personality types; apparently some view adherence to the rules as being vital even when the rules need to be changed.  We'll never be able to formalize enough rules, or accurate enough rules, that the rules alone determine what conduct is good and bad on Wikipedia.)

Your claim, repeated just now on this page that &quot;his edit did transform humm incorrect information in nonsense&quot; is offensive to me.  (You probably did not mean offense; this is a simple example of how something said without malice may still be offensive.) What was there previously was nonsense (because it was diametrically opposed to reality); after my edit, it was less so (most of it was accurate and with the associated note on the talk page, it was trivial for any other editor to help out and complete the transformation to accurate information).  A cooperative community acts that way.

You write &quot;I also note that he did not formalize a complain about my post on my talk or on the lounge as it is requested&quot;.  Indeed I did not; rather that recourse to authority and rules, I hoped that quiet diplomacy would be more effective.  Clearly it was not effective.  On the other hand, attempts by &quot;authority&quot; to ask you to work on how you deal with other people have so far not even achieved any recognition on your part that your conduct does alienate others and dissuade them from working on the C++ book.

Of &quot;as soon as the user stated distress on the same book talk page I acted on it to clarify the action&quot;, I would say that instead of clarifying the action you acted to assert strongly (as you do again here) that you are in the right, by stating numerous things that are not consistent with what I have seen.  You've not shown a willingness to address the points that have been raised numerous times that threaten your interpretation (for example, you've not responded to my repeated notes on why a partial correction is better than no correction).

Regarding &quot;I also remember that it is my view that even if productive on the book the user was unaware and unexperienced with the social relations or even etiquette&quot;, while it is true that I am no expert on Wikipedia rulesmithing, I am very experienced with online etiquette in general (for example, I've moderated comp.std.c++ for the last 8 years, I've contributed to various FAQs, and I fear I've made thousands of posts to other programming-related newsgroups).  One Wikipedian asked me politely to sign my talk notes, and since then I've done so (any exceptions being accidental).

I don't think the intention was abusive on your part; the actions, though, were inappropriate for a cooperative community.  It's vital for a work such as this that you must not classify an incomplete correction as leaving &quot;nonsense&quot; -- it's a work in progress, and that's a very valid thing for a wikibook that doesn't claim to be near completion.  Instead of welcoming the correction, you threatened to revert it to incorrect material.  I don't know how many potential contributors have decided not to work on this book because of all the factual errors in it, but it was a big factor for me when I walked away in 2004, and to see it happening again was most disappointing.  We need more openness to corrections, not less.

In the end it comes down to this: I'd like to work with others on a good online resource for people learning C++.  There are many inaccurate resources online; there are almost no accurate tutorials/books addressing modern C++ from the perspective of someone learning the language.  My time to contribute is limited, and there are other places I can contribute to the programming community as a whole.  If helping on Wikibooks doesn't get results to justify the time it takes, I'll be elsewhere.  This isn't a personal thing; I've not been out to see you reprimanded, which is why I've not made complaints until after others did.  I preferred to talk away rather than making waves, but then I've seen that the waves were already there. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 19:44, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

I understand your view point and probably it was a limitation of my vocabulary, but I don't take that a change I make if nonsensical does in any way, state a fact about the author (only on the result &lt;s&gt;I will check the dictionary&lt;/s&gt;, ''Lacking intelligible meaning''). I'm don't have English as my natural language but I don't think I'm that off the mark. (the edit you took offense was probably read out of contest, I remember you that Darklama raised exception to the use of the WE word (as in WE, wikibookians) and then I explained it to him on that same talk page and moved to his talk page just to remove any confusion you could possibly take from what I was saying to him), I was talking that the general way we deal with similar edits on the day to day are to revert them (and said if I'm not in error that I only made the request, in place of a direct revert because it did came from you), I haven't read you comment (just glanced I will provide a full reply to your point but consider this lines and check again (as it is on the arbitration log the only post I directed to you on that talk page). Please move the above comment to CC Discussion Page as soon as you can, :) in 3 days max I'll delete it from here, it will still be on the history. &lt;- is this offensive to you or abusive even if we now are talking about my talk page, I would have preferred someone did place some info like that on some reverts done to me in the past, this was the alleged reason for the blocks.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:31, 28 February 2007 (UTC)  

(...James was asked to move his comment to the discussion page, I [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] will try not to alter the text of the first post I made regarding his involvement, but still want to add links there to see if James can agree with me that I it was not my intention to call him a vandal nor in any way put his work in question)

== Comments from darklama ==

This is intended to address a broad range of comments by different people and concerns they may have.

I want to mention that I believe Panic may think he is and was blocked for simply having a different view than that of other users and administrators. I wish to try to make it clear for him and anyone else who might have similar thoughts, that this is not the case. I would be the first to defend Panic if I thought that was the case. I also want to say that new policy proposals that have popped up were not directed as an attack on Panic, but as a mutual. yet unspoken agreement, that some policies could use clarification and some things on Wikibooks taken for granted, but were never formalized as proposed policies may need to be, even if there were disagreements on what should or should not be a policy. None of this should be a part of any discussion that decides whether or not to block or unblock Panic.

I believe Panic to be blocked for being uncivil and destructive in the mist of trying to work together to work out differences. I believe for Panic to be unblocked that he needs to understand why he has been considered uncivil and destructive in order to prevent this sort of thing from happening again. I rather see him having a long block now that involves people trying to help him understand how he has been uncivil and destructive in the eyes of those who believe the blocks were warranted rather than have uncivil and destructive behavior repeat again later out of any perceived ignorance of what he's done. I think this needs to be defused now rather then allowing the block/unblock dance to continue which seems to only increase the divide and frustration for Panic and everyone else involved.

I don't want this process rushed as attempts to do so in the past have. I would prefer this mediation to end with everyone understanding what was  being addressed even if not everyone agrees that it needs to be addressed. I would prefer this mediation to end with everyone satisfied with what was addressed even if not everyone is satisfied with the final decision and books have to be copied offsite in order for people to be able to continue to contribute to the books in peace. I would prefer this mediation to simply be the end to any future need to block Panic or to address the issues that resulted in his blocks. I would prefer this mediation to work, than have the next step be a steward making a decision for Wikibooks.

As a first step, can everyone agree to what is to be addressed, even without agreeing that it needs to be addressed? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:48, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>moved [[Programming:WebObjects/Web Applications/Development/How Forms Work]] to [[WebObjects/Web Applications/Development/How Forms Work]]: The book has moved, moving the module</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This document was written by Andrew Lindesay (http://www.lindesay.co.nz) and relates to WebObjects 5.3.

=== Overview ===

Component actions work by utilising the latter end of the action URL which will look something like &lt;TT&gt;2.12.6.2&lt;/TT&gt; to allow the element which &quot;owns&quot; the action to invoke its bound action method.  We call the inbound numerical string the &quot;sender id&quot; and the identifier of the element, the &quot;element id&quot;.  If the two match up then the element knows it should invoke its action.

If you have a form with many submit buttons this cannot be how the right action gets invoked because the action method contains a URL with a &quot;sender id&quot; of the form.  This won't match with the &quot;element id&quot; of the submit button.  For example, the following ficticious code illustrates this.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Foo.woa/1/wo/qtU2rRz2QrxNsJpxLRVqS0/0.32.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;input size=&quot;40&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;32.0.1&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Search&quot; name=&quot;32.0.2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The submit button here might have element ID of &lt;TT&gt;32.0.2&lt;/TT&gt;, but the form has element &lt;TT&gt;0.32.0&lt;/TT&gt;.  So it will not be possible to match up the sender id with the element id.  So the question is; how does this mechanism work?

=== Invoke Action ===

The submit button could look for a value of &lt;TT&gt;32.0.2&lt;/TT&gt; in the inbound request.  In this way it would be able to see the value &lt;TT&gt;Search&lt;/TT&gt; and then invoke the bound action.  However this mechanism is slightly more complex.  The form element makes modifications to the context in order to get the submit buttons to exhibit this behaviour.  Those modifications include setting the &lt;code&gt;setInForm(...)&lt;/code&gt; method as well as some internal methods to state if the form was submitted and if a submit button has invoked its action method yet.

If the submit button does invoke its method then it in turn modifies the context to state that an action had been &quot;fired&quot;.  If no submit button does set this value in the context then the form can invoke its own action method if appropriate.

=== Append To Response === 

The WOForm simply sets into the context that it is in a form and then renders its children.

=== Take Values From Request ===

The WOForm sets into the context that the children are in a form and if the form was submitted and then allows its children elements to take their values from the request.

The following sentences I have moved here

Note that &lt;math&gt;f(z_0)&lt;/math&gt; is defined iff &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is an accumulation point of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{G}&lt;/math&gt; belonging to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{G}&lt;/math&gt;.

A point in a set is always an accumulation point of that set.


Since this definition assumes that ''f''(z) is finite, we introduce the concept of chordal continuity: a function ''f'' is '''chordally continuous''' at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; if for any real for any real number &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we can find a real number &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\chi(f(z)-f(z_0))&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all ''z'' that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\chi(z,z_0)&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. Note that a function that is continuous at a point is also chordally continuous there, although the converse may not be true ([[Complex Analysis/Appendix/Proofs/Chordal Continuity|proof]]).

it is not said what finite is nor what $\chi$ means here.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==
Prescription forgery is a means by which illicit drug users obtain medication illegally. By definition, its comprises the submission of a copied and/or handwritten prescription (Medical Doctor's order for medication) to a legitimate pharmacy in order to obtain controlled substances. Forged prescriptions are most often used to obtain narcotic painkillers, benzodiazepine anti-anxiety medications, erectile disfunction treatments, and other drugs which are popular on the black market.

== Methods ==
Forgers are creative and enterprising people who are using their creativity and motivation for unethical reasons.
=== Copying ===
In this method, the forger would copy a legitimate prescription using electronic copying devices. The two prescriptions would then be submitted to different pharmacies, so that double the intended amount of medication may be purchased. In some areas, prescription forms are watermarked or otherwise marked with anti-copy markings. The absence or alteration of these markings would alert the pharmacist to a forgery.

A slight variation of the copying method occurs when the forger &quot;whites out&quot; the handwritten prescription on a form and uses an electronic copier to obtain blank prescription forms which the forger can then write on as he/she wishes.

=== Pad Theft ===
In this method, the forger steals blank prescription forms from a medical doctor's office. The forger can then write prescriptions for himself. This method is the forger's only choice when using prescription forms with anti-piracy mechanisms embedded.

== Jargon or Lingo ==
Although plain-language writing of prescriptions is becoming more popular, there exists a &quot;code&quot; of abbreviations used by Medical Doctors for the writing of prescriptions. The forger will learn these abbreviations and become a master of them in order to make the forged prescription look more legitimate. Most of these abbreviations are derived from Latin language words. They are used to speed the writing of the script, to make the script harder for a layperson to decipher, and to avoid ambiguity and confusion on the part of the pharmacist. According to about.com, the Latin language was used for the earliest prescriptions, around 1400 AD; and is used to this day because Latin is a &quot;dead&quot; language, and is thus unlikely to be misinterpreted.

=== Examples ===
1 - 2 tab po q 4 - 6 hrs prn pain&lt;BR&gt;
Unless you have a medical background, this phrase probably makes little sense. It means: &quot;Take 1 or 2 tablets by mouth every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain.&quot; The following table is only a short sampling of abbreviations and is not exhaustive.

=== Abbreviation Table ===
Abbreviation | meaning&lt;BR&gt;
Sig | Signa - &quot;to write&quot; - used to indicate patient's dosing instructions&lt;BR&gt;
tab | tablet - A normal &quot;pill&quot; - not a capsule&lt;BR&gt;
cap | capsule or caplet&lt;BR&gt;
prn | &quot;as needed&quot; or &quot;as needed for&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
po | &quot;by mouth&quot;&lt;BR&gt;

== DEA License Numbers ==
In the USA, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issues licenses to medical professionals that enable them to prescribe controlled substances. This number is sometimes preprinted on prescription forms, or is filled in on prescriptions for narcotics only.

=== Checksum Formula ===
There is a formula which can be used to verify DEA numbers. It is in use to prevent forgers from simply making up a random number for use as a DEA license number on a forged prescription. An example of a valid DEA number for a doctor named Dr Adams would be &quot;#BA1424326&quot;. The following information was copied from www.uspharmd.com:&lt;P&gt;
DEA numbers are two letters followed by a seven digit number. The first letter is always either an 'A' or a 'B'.  This letter is used to designate the nature of the prescriber's practice and/or indicate any special privileges or restrictions attached to the license. For example, physician's with a special license permitting the prescription of opoid replacement therapy medications (ie., Suboxone [buprenorphine/naloxone], and Subutex [buprenorphine]) will be designated with an introductory &quot;X&quot;.  Other examples of introductory letter designations include &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; for regular care providers (medical doctors, dentists, and non-physician care providers [CRNP's and PA's], and an introductory &quot;C&quot; for clinicians practicing in and /or operating healthcare practices such as a {C}linic or ambulatory/urgent care center.  This introductory letter can be any one of many and no longer has any relationship relative to the date of license issuance. Most pharmacies pay a fee to subscribe to an electronic database of all current DEA numbers, giving them the ability to acces and confirm the validity of any given number.  The second letter is always the first letter of the doctor's last name. The seven digits have a mathematical relationship that is always followed.&lt;BR&gt;
Do this exercise with your DEA number to verify it:&lt;BR&gt;
Let's use the first six digits (142432) as an example to determine what the final digit must be in order for it to be a valid DEA number:&lt;BR&gt;
Add the first, third and fifth numbers.&lt;BR&gt;
In this case we have 1+2+3 = 6&lt;BR&gt;
Now add the second, fourth and sixth numbers. 4+4+2 = 10.&lt;BR&gt;
Double the sum you just calculated 10x2 = 20.&lt;BR&gt;
Add this to the first sum. 20+6 = 26.&lt;BR&gt;
Take the last digit in that sum (the sum is 26, the first digit is 2, the last digit is 6).&lt;BR&gt;
The final digit in the above DEA number must be 6.&lt;BR&gt;
1424326 is a valid DEA number. Any other digit (other than 6 in this example due to the mathematical relationship that must exist) as the last digit, is a fraud.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose:==
To transfer text or files between two standard dial-up modems, '''''with no connection to a telephone company.''''' This method not only doesn't require a telephone company, it might not even work correctly while connected to one.

==Advantages:==
#Use any common phone cord
#Avoid using ports needed for mice and other peripherals
#Avoid the expense of a null-modem cable ($10 or more?)
#Some computers don't have the required jacks for null-modem cables
#Avoid the need for an ISP in a VPN (Virtual Private Network)
#Modems automatically determine and connect at appropriate speeds
#Null-modem cables are limited to a few feet, while phone cords can be much longer
#Transferring files using floppy disks is tedious and slow
#Some computers don't have the required hardware for removable drives (such as: USB drives, ZIP drives, external SCSI drives), or the ports could be in use for other devices.

==A simple example to get started:==
'''Note:''' When typing into a typical terminal program, such as ''HyperTerminal'', what you type will sometimes not appear in the window, but '''will''' be sent to, and appear at any other computer it's connected to. This can be fixed by changing the &quot;Echo typed characters locally&quot; setting. In ''HyperTerminal'' go to &quot;File/Properties&quot;, go to the &quot;Settings&quot; tab, click &quot;ASCII Setup&quot; and it will show the dialog with the &quot;Echo...&quot; setting.
Sometimes this setting will cause two copies of each character you type. If so, you can fix it by unchecking it.

#Make sure both computers are disconnected from the wall jacks, to make sure you don't bother the phone company.
#Connect the modems together with regular phone cord, such as the one which usually connects them to a wall jack or one which connects a telephone handset to the base, for example.
#Run &quot;HyperTerminal&quot; on both computers
#Set them both up to use your modems
#If you want to hear a modem, make sure its volume is turned up in Windows volume control (try the one labeled &quot;TAD&quot;). It most likely has a volume control slider for it, but you might have to go to &quot;Options/Properties/Show the following volume controls:&quot; to enable it. If it's not there, your modem should have a built-in speaker anyway. Type &quot;ATM1L3&quot; then Enter (that controls the modem's internal volume controls).
#Type '''''&quot;ATD&quot;''''' and press '''Enter''' on either of them
#...and within a few seconds afterward... type '''''&quot;ATA&quot;''''' on the other one and press '''Enter'''
#You should soon hear it &quot;training&quot; like it does when connecting to a dial-up ISP. This step could take up to around 20 seconds, but probably much less.
#You should soon see response messages like '''''&quot;CONNECT&quot;''''' or '''''&quot;CONNECT 36000&quot;''''' in the HyperTerminal windows. You can then send data between them just like a normal connection. The easiest way to test it is to type into one window and watch it appear at the other computer.

==Optimizing your connection==
If you get serious about using such a connection, you should change Windows settings for your modems. Some of these settings can improve your transfer speeds dramatically. None of these suggested settings should interfere with your usual ISP connection, so you can leave them this way.

*'''In Windows &quot;Start&quot; menu'''
**Go to &quot;Settings/Control Panel/Modems&quot;
**...or in HyperTerminal go to &quot;File/Properties&quot; and click &quot;Configure&quot;
*'''On the &quot;General&quot; Tab of &quot;Modems Properties&quot;:'''
**Select the modem you plan to use.
**Click &quot;Properties&quot;
*'''On the &quot;General&quot; Tab (for the modem):'''
**Set &quot;Maximum speed&quot; to 115200 (or more if possible)
*'''On the &quot;Connection&quot; Tab:'''
**Set &quot;Data bits&quot; to 8
**Set &quot;Parity&quot; to &quot;None&quot;
**Set &quot;Stop bits&quot; to 1
**Click &quot;Port Settings&quot;
**Check &quot;Use FIFO buffers...&quot;
**Set &quot;Receive Buffer&quot; to &quot;Maximum&quot;
**Set &quot;Transmit Buffer&quot; to &quot;Maximum&quot;
**Click &quot;Okay&quot;
**Click &quot;Advanced&quot;, then
**Check &quot;Use error control&quot;
**Check &quot;Compress data&quot;
**Check &quot;Use flow control&quot;
**Select &quot;Hardware (RTS/CTS)&quot;
**Click &quot;Okay&quot;
*Click &quot;Okay&quot; or &quot;Close&quot;

===Data throughput===
The modems won't actually transfer data between them at speeds as high as some of the &quot;Maximum speed&quot; settings you can select, but it can ensure that data gets transferred promptly to the modem from a COMM port, so that there's no interruption in the flow.
Due to how few people are aware of this capability of modems, there is no software which supports this use in a convenient way. It would not be very difficult to add such support though.
Although a modem might report a connection speed of only 36000, the effective data through-put can be much higher because most modems have built-in compression.
The effective data throughput can be increased even more by using a utility such as (the free, and open source) [http://www.7-zip.org 7-Zip].

===Actual example of effective data throughput using two 56k modems:===
The file was a Windows help file (&quot;.hlp&quot; extension) and was transferred using
the &quot;ZMODEM&quot; protocol.

The time to transfer a megabyte of the original file was 127 seconds which is 02:07, in minutes and seconds.
The time to transfer a megabyte of the zipped file was 59.45 seconds which is just less than a minute.
The effective transfer rate of the zipped version was '''2.1376 times''' that of the original, unzipped version!

===Notes:===
*A command typed to a modem must be all UPPER CASE or all lower case, but not a mixture of the two. Both '''''&quot;ATD&quot;''''' and '''''&quot;atd&quot;''''' are fine, but '''NOT''' '''''&quot;Atd&quot;''''', for example. After they've connected, you can type or send anything at all.
*So-called &quot;WinModems&quot; or &quot;software modems&quot; might not be usable this way, because their capabilities are determined by software rather than the hardware. These modems have minimum hardware internally to help reduce their prices. &quot;Hardware modems&quot; were used during the testing of these connections.
*Some files don't benefit from zipping, either because they've already been zipped, or because of the nature of their data. The type of file which won't likely benefit is an installer or setup program for software, or one with any of the extensions: 7Z, ARJ, BZ, CAB, GIF, GZ, JPEG, JPG, PNG, TGZ or ZIP, for example. If you're transferring many files, then zipping can make it more convenient if done at the lowest setting (called &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;store&quot;, for example).
*You should be able to hook up computers all over your house this way. The lines used can be many feet long. It's been tested with about 25 feet with no problems. This author hasn't tried this with more than two computers at once.
*There are people who are said, or implied to be experts who claim that this can't be done at all. This author prefers to read such claims after sending them to another computer through a connection between two dialup modems :D
*There are reportedly people who physically modify modems to achieve this, but modifications aren't necessary, at least not for all modems.
*Modems made for use in some countries might have some features unavailable due to government restrictions, but hopefully not any required for this purpose.

==Ideas for software to support modem-to-modem connections==
#Use [http://www.7-zip.org 7-Zip] to zip sections of files to be transferred, so there's less delay before it starts sending data. The sections should probably be from 64KB to 1MB or so. The receiving computer would unzip and combine the sections as it got them.
#If it's known that one of the modems is always to be the initiator, then there's no need for a special protocol to make a connection without human intervention. If it isn't known, then each one should briefly go into answer mode to see if the other computer is trying to connect. If not, then it would go into initiate mode. Both would alternate between these two modes until a connection was made. The goal is to get the modems in the opposite modes at the same time.

==How to distinguish between &quot;hardware modems&quot; and &quot;software modems&quot;==
Hardware Modems handle telephony communications more on-the-adapter-card, rather than using CPU cycles and system bus for its processing; as such, hardware modems generally have much more electronic components visible on them including DIP switches (for configuring a specific COM port to be utilized), resistors, capacitors, IC chips, etc.  This type of board tends to be more expensive than Soft Modems inasmuch as more components are utilized.  Performance also tends to be better with this modem type as well since more of the processing is dedicated to a local level rather than having to shell out through system bus, CPU, and other motherboard components.

Software Modems, aka WinModems, are designed with a reliance on system board components (CPU cycles, RAM, system bus) for their processing capability.  However this type of adapter card is more easily configured by the operating system inasmuch as normally there are no components which could be configured by a computer user.  As such, the software modem settings are configurable using the operating system interface, with such settings as COM Port, IRQ, modem volume, buffers, and other configurable settings. Usually, these settings are configured automatically by a plug-and-play operating system such as Windows with little or no configuration required by the computer user. Adversely, a hardware modem might require one to specify a specific COM Port to use, figure out an available IRQ for the modem, and other such settings, making installation and initial use more cumbersome.

Opioids are a class of drugs derived from opium, or synthetically engineered to be similar in molecular structure and effect on the body. They are usually prescribed by a doctor for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Due to their addictive nature and impairment of cognitive function, they have fallen from favor in the medical community. These drugs are currently popular on the black market and are often obtained by illegal means such as [[/Prescription Forgery|prescription forgery]].

== Formulations ==
A short sampling of popular opioid drugs include the following:&lt;BR&gt;
Codeine - Sold under many names and included in many formulations used for the treatment of minor to moderate pain, cough and cold, etc.&lt;BR&gt;
Vicodin or Lortab - &quot;Hydrocodone&quot; used to treat moderate to severe pain. Vicodin and Lortab formulations combine hydrocodone with acetaminophen or ibuprofen&lt;BR&gt;
Percocet or Oxycontin - &quot;Oxycodone&quot; used to treat moderate to severe pain. The percocet formulation combines oxycodone with acetaminophen. The Oxycontin formulation is a time-release oxycodone tablet.&lt;BR&gt;
Dilaudid - &quot;Hydromorphone&quot; used for moderate to severe pain&lt;BR&gt;
Morphine - Usually injected for treatment of severe pain&lt;BR&gt;

== History ==
In the 1800s and before, opioids were unregulated by law. Opioid extracts were often a major component of &quot;snake oil&quot; remedies sold by peddlers. These peddlers touted their formula as a cure-all which would alleviate anything from a headache to arthritis to depression. In reality these formulas served only to  get the user &quot;high&quot; and create a false feeling of well-being without actually curing the illness. Many users became addicted to these formulations.

Some options depend on the version of iGuide used. You can determine the version by following the instructions at [[../../Firmware and Software#How To Check Your Firmware and Software Versions (i-Guide)/|How To Check Your Firmware and Software Versions (i-Guide)]].

The iGuide version can be found in the middle of the software version string. Newer versions are A25 and A28. Previous versions may not have listed the version using the Axx format.

==User Setup Options==
There are many options in the user setup menu that will let you customize features of your i-Guide.

To access the user setup:
#Press the '''Menu''' key twice
#Scroll to ''Setup'' and press '''OK/Select''' (older versions of i-Guide will require scrolling down to a second screen.)

To change most settings, you use the up-down arrows to select the option, then left-right to select the available settings of that option.

To exit the setup, you can either press the '''Exit''' key to return to your video, or '''OK/Select''' to back up a menu level.

Not all versions of i-Guide will have all of these options.

As you select an option, the upper-left corner of the display will give a brief description.


==Audio Setup==
These options configure the audio outputs of the DVR.

==Default Audio Track==
Selects the language you prefer. The settings are ''Channel default'', ''English'', ''Español'', ''Français'', and ''Portuguēs''. For analog or broadcast channels, ''Channel default'' and ''English'' will play the main audio, and the others will play the SAP channel. For HD and digital channels, they may or may not select an actual language.
==Descriptive Video Service==
Replaces the normal audio with a narrative audio (version A25 and newer)
==Audio Output==
This setting only affects the analog audio output. It has no effect on digital audio (optical or coaxial.) The settings are ''TV Speakers'', ''Stereo'', and ''Advanced''. ''TV Speakers'' sets the audio to a high level. ''Stereo'' sets the output to line level. ''Advanced'' enables the two options below.

==Compression==
This option is only available if '''Audio Output''' is set to ''Advanced''.
This option configures the amount of audio compression (increasing volume of quiet audio, and reducing volume of loud audio). The settings are ''None'', ''Light'', or ''Heavy''.
==Stereo Output==
This option is only available if '''Audio Output''' is set to ''Advanced''.
This affects how audio is output. The settings are ''Mono'', ''Stereo'', and ''Matrix'' (fake stereo created from a mono signal.)
==Optimal Stereo==
Setting this to ''Yes'' will reset the analog audio volume to a standard line-level output.


==Cable Box Setup==
These options configure the LED display, AC outlet, and RF bypass options. You can also list firmware/software versions.

==Front LED Display==
Selects whether you want displayed on the DVR's LED display on the front panel. The selections are ''Current Channel'' or ''Current Time.'' When displaying time, PM is designated by a dot at the top between the last two digits.
==AC Outlet==
Selects whether the AC outlet on the back of the DVR will turn on and off when you turn the DVR on and off. The selections are ''Unswitched'' and ''Switched''. Depending on your model, this option may have no effect, and the outlet will always be on.
==RF Bypass==
This option is supposed to allow the cable RF signal to pass through when the DVR is turned off. This feature no longer works and should always be set to ''Off''. If you turn it ''On'', the Record light will always be on (see [[How_to_use_a_Motorola_DVR/Bugs#When_I_turn_the_DVR_off.2C_the_Record_light_turns_on.2C_but_there_is_no_recording_going_on|Record Light Bug]].)

==Configuration==
Displays software and firmware versions, ID information, and whether it is receiving data. The ''Message'' number will increment once a second and ''Status'' will rotate between 18 alphanumeric values.

==iGuide Diagnostics==
Pressing the '''FAV''' button on the Configuration page will display the iGuide diagnostics pages. Each press of '''FAV''' will move to the next page. Pressing '''OK/Select''' will update the currently displayed page.

:''GUIDE STATISTICS''
::Run time since last reboot is displayed at the top in the format number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

==DVR Setup==
Allows you to set several DVR related features. This menu entry was added in software version A28.

==DVR Folders==
When set to ''On'', any program that you have multiple episodes of will be listed in folders.

==Live Program Notice==
When set to ''On'', you will get a notice asking to add additional time when you set up a recording for a live program. The default is to add 30 minutes. (version A25 or newer) In version A25, this was in the Guide Setup settings.

==DVR Clipping==
When set to ''On'', if two scheduled programs overlap by 5 minutes or less, and there is no available tuner, the start of the second program will not be recorded. This is noted by a &quot;(Clipped)&quot; note in the scheduled program list. (version A25 or newer) In version A25, this was in the Guide Setup settings.


==Favorite Lists Setup==
Allows you to create, edit, or delete several Favorite lists. The display will list any current Favorite lists. You can edit a list by using the up and down arrow keys to highlight it, then pressing '''OK/Select'''.

To create a new list, use the arrow keys to cursor down to the ''New'' button on the bottom, and press '''OK/Select'''.

==Editing a Favorite List==
Editing a list may require entering a PIN if you have a Locks PIN configured.

To edit a list, use the icons on the bottom of the screen after choosing a previous list or create a ''New'' list.

The left-arrow icon will return you to the Favorite list menu.

The heart icon will open up a channel list.
:
:You can use the '''right arrow''' key to have the list sorted by name or sorted by channel number. Use the '''up arrow''' and '''down arrow''' keys to move one row at a time, or the '''PageUp''' and '''PageDn''' buttons to move a screen at a time, to highlight a channel. Press '''OK/Select''' to select or deselect a channel. Selected channels will have a heart icon.
:
:The down-arrow icon will move to the next screen (or just keep pressing the '''down arrow''' key, or use the '''PgDown''' key.)
:
:The checkmark icon will save the changes.
:
:The '''X''' icon will clear the list.

The keyboard icon will allow you to rename the list (the default is ''List01'', ''List02'', etc..)
:
:Use the '''arrow keys''' to select a letter, then press '''OK/Select''' to type it.
:Use the tiny left-arrow triangle above the letters to erase the last letter.
:Use ''Sp'' to type a space character.
:When done, use ''Save''.
:To cancel a name change, press the '''Last''' key on the remote.

The '''X''' icon will delete the list.

The padlock icon will allow you to enable or disable locking the Favorite list. When enabled, you will need to enter your Locks PIN code to make any changes.


==Guide Colors Setup==
This option offers several color palettes for the display. Use the arrow keys to select a color and press '''OK/Select''' to change the color. There are at least 2 pages of color (scroll down for the second page.) The default color is ''Topaz Blue''.


==Guide Setup==
These options configures how the Guide display (the program listing) is displayed.

==Flip bar position==
This is the position of the small bar that appears when changing channels or first hitting the Info button. The settings are ''Top'' or ''Bottom''.
==Flip bar timeout==
This sets how many seconds until the flip bar (the small channel and program info pop-up) disappears on its own. You can always use the '''Exit''' button to clear it immediately. The settings are ''2 seconds'' to ''15 seconds''.
==Channel entry behavior==
This specifies what happens if you do not hit '''OK/Select''' for a 1 or 2 digit channel entry. ''Auto-Tune'' will change the channel after a few seconds. ''No Auto-Tune'' will cancel the entry. If you choose ''No Auto-Tune'', you MUST type all 3 digits (005, 013) or press '''OK/Select''' after entering fewer than 3 digits to change the channel.
==Default reminder start-time==
Specifies when a pop-up alerting you to a reminder you have set on a program will appear. The settings are ''1 minutes early'' to ''15 minutes early.'' You can also display the reminder by pressing '''OK/Select''' while a reminder is due or in effect, and you are NOT on the reminder channel.
==Grid Cell Height==
This sets the height of the program grid cells on the main Guide display (usually access by pressing the '''Guide''' key.) The settings are  ''Double Height'' or ''Single Height.'' ''Double Height'' will display up to two lines of text for a program name, and lists 5 channels (no ads) or 4 channels (with ads) on-screen. ''Single Height'' will only display one line of text for a program name, and lists 6 channels (no ads) or 5 channels (with ads) on-screen.

==Mini-Grid Cell Height==
The Mini-Grid is accessed by pressing '''OK/Select''' while viewing video, and no reminder is active or you are on a reminder-active channel. It displays a shorter program grid on the bottom of the display. The settings are ''Double Height'' or ''Single Height''. ''Double Height'' will display up to two lines of text for a program name, and lists 2 channels. ''Single Height'' will only display one line of text for a program name, and lists 3 channels.
==Message Indicator==
Selects whether or not the red light will turn on when your cable company sends messages. The selections are ''On'' and ''Off''. 
Note:  The cable provider can override this setting on a message by message basis with a special override flag.

==About Us==
Displays patent information.


==Locks Setup==
This is the basic Parental Control setup menu. Information about it is on the [[../Parental Control/|Parental Control]] page.

As of version A25, this has been expanded and moved into ''Parental Control Setup''.


==Parental Control Setup==
See the separate [[../Parental Control/|Parental Control]] page.


==PINs Setup==
These options allow you to clear or create Personal Identification Numbers ([[w:Personal Identification Number|PIN]]s).

As of version A25, this has been moved into the ''Parental Control Setup'' menu.


==Remote Access Setup==
Note: Select Cable providers only.

This option returns a code and information for configuring the myDVR feature. This allows you to manage your future recording via your cable providers website.

==Screen Position Setup==
This option adjusts the position of the DVR's graphics on your TV. Use the arrow keys to adjust the position, then press the '''Last''' button to save. Be aware that if you move the display too far to the right, the video will not resize into the corner on some of the menus. (See [[How_to_use_a_Motorola_DVR/Bugs#On_some_display_screens.2C_you_only_see_a_corner_of_the_video_instead_of_it_being_scaled_to_fit|Video Scaling Bug]].)


==Screen Saver Setup==
This options enables/disables a screen saver for use with some TV's that can be sensitive to image burn-in (mostly CRT and Plasma.) It's triggered only when the DVR is in Pause or similar situation involving a fixed screen. It will display a moving image while active (on some systems, it may be your cable company's logo and the time). To restore the screen, just press any key on the remote.&lt;br&gt;
'''NOTE:''' In version A25, on an HD channel or if 4:3 Override is set to &quot;Stretch&quot;, '''only the middle portion of the screen will be blanked!''' As of version A28, the full screen is blanked.

==Screen Saver==
The settings are ''On'' or ''Off''.
==Activation Time==
Sets how long there must be no remote control/front panel commands received before activating the screen saver. The settings are ''1 minute'' to ''15 minutes''.


==Service Locks Setup==
This option allows you to enable or disable locks for services such as On Demand. You must have a Locks PIN defined.

As of the A25 version, this has been moved into the ''Parental Control Setup'' menu.

After entering your Locks PIN, there will be a list of supported services.&lt;br&gt;
Use the arrow keys to select the service.&lt;br&gt;
Press '''OK/Select''' to lock or unlock a service.&lt;br&gt;
Locked services will display a padlock icon.


==Text Language Setup==
These options select the language used for the i-Guide display. Use the arrow keys to select a language, then press '''OK/Select''' to change it. The menu will then exit. It will take a few minutes while the DVR downloads and recreates the main menu in the selected language.</text>

'''Hake''' is a [[Cookbook:whitefish|whitefish]] with a moist, flaky texture and a subtle flavour, like a milder version of [[Cookbook:Cod|cod]]. It is also sometimes known as '''ling''' or '''whiting''', although in the UK, &quot;whiting&quot; is used to mean a different, less tasty fish.

This fish responds best to simple cooking, and can be [[Cookbook:frying|fried]] or [[Cookbook:poaching|poached]], or used in fish soup.

Add-on features for LaTeX are known as packages. Dozens of these are pre-installed with LaTeX and can be used in your documents immediately. They should all be stored in subdirectories of &lt;tt&gt;texmf/tex/latex&lt;/tt&gt; named after each package. The directory name &quot;texmf&quot; stands for “TEX and METAFONT”. To find out what other packages are available and what they do, you should use the [http://www.ctan.org/search.html CTAN search page] which includes a link to Graham Williams' comprehensive package catalogue.

A package is a file or collection of files containing extra LaTeX commands and programming which add new styling features or modify those already existing. There are two main file types: class files with &lt;tt&gt;.cls&lt;/tt&gt; extension, and style files with &lt;tt&gt;.sty&lt;/tt&gt; extension. There may be ancillary files as well. When you try to typeset a document which requires a package which is not installed on your system, LaTeX will warn you with an error message that it is missing. You can download updates to packages you already have (both the ones that were installed along with your version of LaTeX as well as ones you added). There is no limit to the number of packages you can have installed on your computer (apart from disk space!), but there is a configurable limit to the number that can be used inside any one LaTeX document at the same time, although it depends on how big each package is. In practice there is no problem in having even a couple of dozen packages active.

Most LaTeX installations come with a large set of pre-installed style packages, so you can use the package manager of the TeX distribution or the one on your system to manage them. See the automatic installation. But many more are available on the net. The main place to look for style packages on the Internet is [http://www.ctan.org/ CTAN]. Once you have identified a package you need that is not in your distribution, use the indexes on any CTAN server to find the package you need and the directory where it can be downloaded from. See the manual installation.

== Automatic installation ==

If on a system with a package manager or a portage tree, you can often find packages in the repositories. With TeX Live, it is common to have the distribution packed into a few big packages. For example, to install something related to internationalization, you might have to install a package like &lt;tt&gt;texlive-lang&lt;/tt&gt;.

With MikTeX there is a package manager that allows you to pick the package you want individually. As a convenient feature, upon the compilation of a file requiring non-installed packages, MikTeX will automatically prompt to install the missing ones.

With TeX Live manually installed, use &lt;tt&gt;tlmgr&lt;/tt&gt; to manage packages individually.

 tlmgr install &lt;package1&gt; &lt;package2&gt; ...
 tlmgr remove &lt;package1&gt; &lt;package2&gt; ...

The use of &lt;tt&gt;tlmgr&lt;/tt&gt; is covered in the [[LaTeX/Installation|Installation]] chapter.

If you cannot find the wanted package with any of the previous methods, see the manual installation.

== Manual installation ==

===Downloading packages===

What you need to look for is usually two files, one ending in &lt;tt&gt;.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; and the other in &lt;tt&gt;.ins&lt;/tt&gt;. The first is a DOCTeX file, which combines the package program and its documentation in a single file. The second is the installation routine (much smaller). You must always download both files. If the two files are not there, it means one of two things:
* ''Either'' the package is part of a much larger bundle which you shouldn't normally update unless you change {{FULLBOOKNAME}}version of LaTeX;
* ''or'' it's an older or relatively simple package written by an author who did not use a &lt;tt&gt;.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; file. 

Download the package files to a temporary directory. There will often be a &lt;tt&gt;readme.txt&lt;/tt&gt; with a brief description of the package. You should of course read this file first.

===Installing a package===
There are five steps to installing a LaTeX package. (These steps can also be used on the pieces of a complicated package you wrote yourself; in this case, skip straight to Step 3.)

1. '''Extract the files''' Run LaTeX on the &lt;tt&gt;.ins&lt;/tt&gt; file. That is, open the file in your editor and process it as if it were a LaTeX document (which it is), or if you prefer, type latex followed by the &lt;tt&gt;.ins&lt;/tt&gt; filename in a command window in your temporary directory. This will extract all the files needed from the &lt;tt&gt;.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; file (which is why you must have both of them present in the temporary directory). Note down or print the names of the files created if there are a lot of them (read the log file if you want to see their names again).

2. '''Create the documentation''' Run LaTeX on the &lt;tt&gt;.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; file. You might need to run it twice or more, to get the cross-references right (just like any other LaTeX document). This will create a &lt;tt&gt;.dvi&lt;/tt&gt; file of documentation explaining what the package is for and how to use it. If you prefer to create PDF then run pdfLaTeX instead. If you created a &lt;tt&gt;.idx&lt;/tt&gt; as well, it means that the document contains an index, too. If you want the index to be created properly, follow the steps in the [[LaTeX/Indexing|indexing]] section. Sometimes you will see that a &lt;tt&gt;.glo&lt;/tt&gt; (glossary) file has been produced. Run the following command instead:

 makeindex -s gglo.ist -o name.gls name.glo

3. '''Install the files''' While the documentation is printing, move or copy the package files from your temporary directory to the right place[s] in your TeX local installation directory tree. Packages installed by hand should always be placed in your &quot;local&quot; directory tree, ''not'' in the directory tree containing all the pre-installed packages. This is done to ''a)'' prevent your new package accidentally overwriting files in the main TeX directories; and ''b)'' avoid your newly-installed files being overwritten when you next update your version of TeX. 

For a TDS(TeX Directory Structure)-conformant system, your &quot;local installation directory tree&quot; is a folder and its subfolders. The outermost folder should probably be called &lt;tt&gt;texmf-local/&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;texmf/&lt;/tt&gt;. Its location depends on your system:

:* MacTeX: &lt;tt&gt;Users/''username''/Library/texmf/&lt;/tt&gt;.
:* Unix-type systems: Usually &lt;tt&gt;~/texmf/&lt;/tt&gt;.
:* MikTeX: Your local directory tree can be any folder you like, as long as you then register it as a user-managed texmf directory (see http://docs.miktex.org/manual/localadditions.html#id573803)

The &quot;right place&quot; sometimes causes confusion, especially if your TeX installation is old or does not conform to the TeX Directory Structure(TDS). For a TDS-conformant system, the &quot;right place&quot; for a LaTeX &lt;tt&gt;.sty&lt;/tt&gt; file is a suitably-named subdirectory of &lt;tt&gt;texmf/tex/latex/&lt;/tt&gt;. &quot;Suitably-named&quot; means sensible and meaningful (and probably short). For a package like paralist, for example, I'd call the directory &lt;tt&gt;texmf/tex/latex/paralist&lt;/tt&gt;. 

Often there is just a &lt;tt&gt;.sty&lt;/tt&gt; file to move, but in the case of complex packages there may be more, and they may belong in different locations. For example, new BibTeX packages or font packages will typically have several files to install. This is why it is a good idea to create a sub-directory for the package rather than dump the files into misc along with other unrelated stuff. If there are configuration or other files, read the documentation to find out if there is a special or preferred location to move them to.

For most fonts on CTAN, the ''foundry'' is &lt;tt&gt;public&lt;/tt&gt;.

4. '''Update your index''' Finally, run your TeX indexer program to update the package database. This program comes with every modern version of TeX and has various names depending on the LaTeX distribution you use. (Read the documentation that came with your installation to find out which it is, or consult http://www.tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html#fndb):
:* teTeX, TeX Live, fpTeX: &lt;tt&gt;texhash&lt;/tt&gt;
:* web2c: &lt;tt&gt;mktexlsr&lt;/tt&gt;
:* MacTeX: MacTeX appears to do this for you.
:* MikTeX: &lt;tt&gt;initexmf --update-fndb&lt;/tt&gt; (or use the GUI)
:* MiKTeX 2.7 or later versions, installed on Windows XP through Windows 7: Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; MikTex -&gt; Settings.  In Windows 8 use the keyword ''Settings'' and choose the option of ''Settings'' with the MiKTex logo.  In ''Settings'' menu choose the first tab and click on ''Refresh FNDB''-button (MikTex will then check the Program Files directory and update the list of File Name DataBase). After that just verify by clicking 'OK'.

{{Warning|This step is utterly essential, otherwise nothing will work.}}

5. '''Update font maps''' If your package installed any TrueType or Type 1 fonts, you need to update the font mapping files ''in addition'' to updating the index. Your package author should have included a &lt;tt&gt;.map&lt;/tt&gt; file for the fonts. The map updating program is usually some variant on &lt;tt&gt;updmap&lt;/tt&gt;, depending on your distribution:
:* TeX Live and MacTeX: &lt;tt&gt;updmap --enable Map=''mapfile''.map&lt;/tt&gt; (if you installed the files in a personal tree) or &lt;tt&gt;updmap-sys --enable Map=''mapfile''.map&lt;/tt&gt; (if you installed the files in a system directory).
:* MikTeX: Run &lt;tt&gt;initexmf --edit-config-file updmap&lt;/tt&gt;, add the line &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Map ''mapfile''.map&lt;/tt&gt; to the file that opens, then run &lt;tt&gt;initexmf --mkmaps&lt;/tt&gt;.

See http://www.tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html.

The reason this process has not been automated widely is that there are still thousands of installations which do not conform to the TDS, such as old shared Unix systems and some Microsoft Windows systems, so there is no way for an installation program to guess where to put the files: you have to know this. There are
also systems where the owner, user, or installer has chosen not to follow the recommended TDS directory structure, or is unable
to do so for political or security reasons (such as a shared system where she cannot write to a protected directory). The reason for having the &lt;tt&gt;texmf-local&lt;/tt&gt; directory (called &lt;tt&gt;texmf.local&lt;/tt&gt; on some systems) is to provide a place for local modifications or personal updates, especially if you are a user on a shared or managed system (Unix, Linux, VMS, Windows NT/2000/XP, etc.) where you may not have write-access to the main TeX installation directory tree. You can also have a personal &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; subdirectory in your own login directory. Your installation must be configured to look in these directories first, however, so that any updates to standard packages will be found there before the superseded copies in the main &lt;tt&gt;texmf&lt;/tt&gt; tree. All modern TeX installations should do this anyway, but if not, you can edit &lt;tt&gt;texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf&lt;/tt&gt; yourself.

==Checking package status==

The universal way to check if a file is available to TeX compilers is the command-line tool &lt;tt&gt;kpsewhich&lt;/tt&gt;.
 $ kpsewhich tikz
 /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/plain/pgf/frontendlayer/tikz.tex

&lt;tt&gt;kpsewhich&lt;/tt&gt; will actually search for files only, not for packages. It returns the path to the file.
For more details on a specific  package use the command-line tool &lt;tt&gt;tlmgr&lt;/tt&gt; (TeX Live only):

 tlmgr info &lt;package&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;tlmgr&lt;/tt&gt; tool has lot more options. To consult the documentation:
 tlmgr help

==Package documentation==

To find out what commands a package provides (and thus how to use it), you need to read the documentation. In the &lt;tt&gt;texmf/doc&lt;/tt&gt; subdirectory of your installation there should be directories full of .dvi files, one for every package installed. This location is distribution-specific, but is ''typically'' found in:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Distribution
!Path
|-
| MiKTeX || &lt;tt&gt;%MIKTEX_DIR%\doc\&lt;font color=&quot;#744&quot;&gt;latex&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| TeX Live || &lt;tt&gt;$TEXMFDIST/doc/&lt;font color=&quot;#744&quot;&gt;latex&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|}
Generally, ''most'' of the packages are in the &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; subdirectory, although other packages (such as BibTeX and font packages) are found in other subdirectories in &lt;tt&gt;doc&lt;/tt&gt;. The documentation directories have the same name of the package (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;amsmath&lt;/tt&gt;), which generally have one or more relevant documents in a variety of formats (&lt;tt&gt;dvi&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;txt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;pdf&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.). The documents generally have the same name as the package, but there are exceptions (for example, the documentation for &lt;tt&gt;amsmath&lt;/tt&gt; is found at &lt;tt&gt;latex/amsmath/amsdoc.dvi&lt;/tt&gt;). If your installation procedure has not installed the documentation, the DVI files can all be downloaded from CTAN. Before using a package, you should read the documentation carefully, especially the subsection usually called &quot;User Interface&quot;, which describes the commands the package makes available. You cannot just guess and hope it will work: you have to read it and find out.

You can usually automatically open any installed package documentation with the ''texdoc'' command:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
texdoc &lt;package-name&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Someone ought to know how to clean glassware at least. Come on chemists. Talk about Alconox. Lets all pitch in.
[[User:Rozzychan|Rozzychan]] 23:19, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

I agree that this needs updated. I disagree that clean glassware is a critical section of a text on biotechniques. Perhaps a Chemistry Techniques book. And I'm not saying that I don't clean glassware in the lab (I do), but those kinds of things were covered in chemistry courses, not biology courses. 

But to the rallying point. Can more people get involved in this! A free book of this nature is long over-due!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Thoughts and ideas about the current version of the policy ==

I'd like to note that from a historical perspective, the most potent and (in term of VfD reference) useful policy that seems to have been consistantly referenced was the &quot;[[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not]]&quot; page.  It is also very true that every &quot;generation&quot; of admins has come along and added their $0.02 into the mix as well, which is very reasonable.

This move to a more positive view than saying &quot;thou shalt not do....&quot; and condemning actions of new users from a pedistile.  For this, I like the new version in many ways.

I will say, however, I still disagree with the sentiment that Wikibooks is only for textbooks.  If you have to put a scope on it, saying that Wikibooks is more for general &quot;instructional materials&quot; that can be generated using a Wiki is perhaps a little more correct, at least with the vision that Jimbo seems to have and as a matter of practice here on Wikibooks as well.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't want to discourage people who want to come up with a very original idea that just doesn't quite fit the standard model of what somebody would think of as a collegete textbook.  That clearly abuses have occured in the past, I will openly admit, and this is a slippery slope in the other direction as well to be far too permissive for Wikibooks content.  Again, this is likely going to be a part of Wikibooks for the rest of the life of the project, to debate exactly where the line should be drawn to demark Wikibooks content from non-Wikibooks content.  

Slamming down and saying something is &quot;not a textbook&quot; I think will lead, unfortunately, to a deletionist camp thinking that removes content from Wikibooks that can and should stay.  I do believe that far too much has been deleted from Wikibooks over the past year and I'm trying to &quot;dig in&quot; my heels and say that the line is here and no more, at least in terms of what content is largely left on Wikibooks at the moment.  Proposals to cull and move the How-to guides like the Video Game guides were removed I hope are dead in the water at the moment.

Some additional thoughts on the textbook criteria:

:One of the biggest problems that we have is one of semantics. Clearly the &quot;textbooks&quot; that we host here will not be textbooks in the traditional sense. As much as we would like to call each individual book a &quot;wikibook&quot;, it is far less clear to say &quot;Wikibooks is for wikibooks&quot; then it is to say &quot;Wikibooks is for textbooks&quot;, and then broadly define the term &quot;textbook&quot; for our own uses. I think that in a broad sense (at least as it has been interpreted by the community in general) is that general instructional resources can be considered textbooks so long as they aren't better suited as wikipedia articles or wikiversity courses. A trend among current movers and shakers is to leave policy more open to interpretation, which will allow us to &quot;know it when we see it&quot;, and avoid becoming mindless decision machines. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:04, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

==== &quot;Not already exist on Wikibooks with a similar scope and target audience.&quot; ====

I'm not completely comforatble with this idea.  I understand that duplication of effort seems to be an issue here, but I do see the potential for &quot;forking&quot; and two different approaches to the study of a topic happening.  In other words, having two different books covering the very same material would IMHO be acceptable on Wikibooks, particularly due to the fact that these are book-length approaches.  If you do create a new book on the same topic, there should be some sort of &quot;manifesto&quot; that spells out exactly how the second book is going to be substantially different and how the approach is going to be done.

Forking for the sake of a different POV is clearly not acceptable.

: This is about two books covering the same material with a similar scope and target audience. It doesn't disallow forking and if you read the bit above where this is written about textbooks must have a definition, then you can see a &quot;manifesto&quot; of sorts must be spelled out for all textbooks. Scope and target are defined in terms of how they are used in the textbook definition to define each textbook. Hope that makes sense --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:59, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:I'm of the opinion that multiple books with similar scope and target audiences can be merged together into a single book, and perhaps delineated internally based on other factors. As a classic example, consider the teaching of college-level probability courses where some students learn probability as a set of algebraic equations, and some students learn probability in terms of calculus. Both aspects can be covered in a single book, with an &quot;algebra&quot; section and a &quot;calculus&quot; section. No need to have multiple books on a given subject, just a single book with many facets. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:54, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

::In principle I agree books ''can'' be merged - however all too often they tend to merely stay with a tag on them? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:09, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Isn't there already a policy on forking and merging ? If a policy is to cover several topics it's best to vote them on the specific points and work them one by one, this is a better way to archive consensus. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:26, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

==== &quot;Not be a promotion or advertisements for products, services or companies.&quot; ====

I understand the rationale for adding this, and certainly the WMF doesn't want to be seen as endorsing for-profit activities.  Still, this is a fine line to look at and I see some potential for some content that might be pushing the line a bit here.  Merely having a book about a product, such as the [[Blender 3D]] book, certainly is in a way a sort of advertising here.  Or a book that describes the history of a prominent company like Union Pacific.  Clearly there is a difference between a scholarly discussion of a person, product, service, or company and blatant advertising, but the difference I think is perhaps a little more subtle than might be apparent on the surface.

Link spamming is clearly unacceptable, but if you are talking about a product I don't see the harm to have as a bibliographic reference an external link to the company that produces that product.

: The Blender 3D book teaches how to use Blender 3D, I don't see how its promoting or advertising it. Sense the line isn't defined, its up to community concensus to decide where the line is and that line can change without any need to update this if made policy. You may not of noticed this proposal says that bibliographic references are fine as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with you entirely. I think this line of the policy refers more to &quot;unnecessary promotion&quot;. Linking to the software developer when writing about a peice of software is a necessary addition. Linking to a retailer who sells that particular peice of software is not. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:56, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

==== &quot;Be acceptable to the Wikibooks community&quot; ====

This is something that is definitely a slippery slope to worry about.  I guess this is openly saying that mob rule can dominate VfD discussions, but clearly current practice is that admins sometimes overrule VfD votes from time to time as well.  I know this is something more akin to what Justice John P. Stevens of the U.S. Supreme Court said about pornography:  &quot;I know it when I see it.&quot;

Sometimes there is something etherial that you can't just point to and say why you think a book just isn't acceptable on Wikibooks, but you do know in your heart that it just shouldn't be here.  Books like [[How to build a bomb]] shouldn't be written, or at least have been deleted in the past using the community standards as a sort of guideline.  I will say that any admin who uses this as justification for deleting content should certainly get a rebuke unless it has gone before a VfD first.  This is something, however, that the Wikibooks community has been criticized in the past over as being far too permissive over this kind of content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:26, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

: I think the deletion policy does a good job of covering the issues involved in deleting contents. Sometimes VfD discussions are used as a bases for what current practise is in regard to what the community is willing to allow or not allow. This proposal even says that I think. Its not a mob so much as community concensus that decides what stays and what goes. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:20, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

: I disagree with this sentence as well in some aspects, and not in others. For instance, the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] guideline really lays out how the community makes decisions on these kinds of mattes, and tries (succesfully I would hope) to curtail &quot;mob rule&quot;. Keep in mind though that if there is a single large majority here at any time, that majority will likely find the power to rewrite policy as needed to suit themselves, if we don't leave in a provision allowing for changing tastes. Perhaps a dire prediction, but possible nonetheless. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:59, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Oh... thats what you meant :-) Lol, I should read the talk page before editing stuff. Hmm... lets see... I much prefer the original wording by Rob, so I'll place that back in.

We will not accept &quot;How to Build a Bomb&quot;) &quot;--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 21:54, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

:There have been a number of issues in the past (and I'm certain there will be plenty of them in the future) where materials like this have been brought to VfD, and people have argued against deletion on the grounds of anti-censorship. Wikibooks may not be explicitly censored, but this clause should allow us to draw a line in the sand between the things that do not belong, and the things that do. It may be a slippery slope, but I would rather censor some material by concensus (and be accused of all the negative things that come with censorship) then to maintain a whole listing of such books. Perhaps a note should be added to this policy (or a related policy or guideline) that wikibooks is neither for nor against censorship explicitly, but that the community can choose what kinds of material to host and what not. Conversely, this message might be implicit in the statement that a book must &quot;Be acceptable to the Wikibooks community&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:51, 22 January 2007 (UTC)


== Textbooks, some changes. ==

I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks/Unstable&amp;diff=694782&amp;oldid=692765 edited] the &quot;textbook&quot; section and here is why:

* Scientifically doesn't match the goals of say, a history book. Wikibooks includes books on history, and religion, so I took out &quot;scientifically&quot;. Either way; it should be verifiable someway, somehow. So &quot;scientifically&quot; doesn't really fit.
* Wikibooks includes forks from other published books. So I removed &quot;Not copy previously published works or source texts.&quot;. Maybe there should be a note that it is allowed as long as the text is GFDL or donated to Wikibooks.
* I don't recall any books passing a concensus before they are started. While that was done (maybe still is done?) on wikijunior, I don't think it should be done on Wikibooks.

The rest of the edits were minor. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 21:49, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

: I clarified &quot;Textbooks may be based on previously published works&quot;, since you removed that criteria. I also clarified the passing concensus bit since I disagreed with your changed to that part, by instead saying &quot;If disputed be able to pass community concensus&quot;. I don't believe we should be excluding books based on moral grounds, since what is moral is dependent on who your asking. There is already a brief disclaimer in the policy about contents that me be harmful or objectional with a link to the full content disclaimer. I support your other changes though. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:53, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

I disagree with the statement &quot;Not already exist on Wikibooks with a similar narrative and definition&quot;. If I write a book on mathematics, say, for people sitting an exam for 16 year olds in England, it's perfectly reasonable for someone else to write a separate book, borrowing heavily from my text, for people sitting an exam for 16 year olds in Scotland. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:36, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Well, that is kinda indirect reading. You have to know what a &quot;definition&quot; is to understand that.

::: Well, I don't think I like your quick fix. The definition has to do with text &quot;All textbooks should have both a central narrative and a definition. A textbook definition should specify all the following aspects of the book:&quot; and defines, scope, audience and goal. So it says what a definition consists of in the text.

I added another [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_is_Wikibooks%2FUnstable&amp;diff=695102&amp;oldid=695096 change]. I'm sorry that the first paragraph got moved down in the change-log. I changed ''free open-content textbooks and annotated texts'' to ''free open-content textbooks, annotated texts, and reference texts''. I think it is appropriate to detail under what conditions reference texts are permitted on Wikibooks; namely, when they correspond to and supplement one or more an existing ''legitimate'' Wikibook textbook and/or annotated text.

Two existing example of one such a text are the ''[[Engineering Tables]]'' and ''[[False Friends of the Slavist]]'' modules. The former is of significant use to the engineering, math, and physics Wikibooks textbooks, while the latter is of great use in linguistics and the Slavic languages. Neither, however, are necessarily textbooks or annotated texts by themselves. References, such as a [[w:Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] of Shakespeare's works or a task- and language-organised programming reference text could also be included as reference texts under this addition. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 10:16, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

=== What is Wikibooks ===

I disagree with the need to identify reference texts and study guides differntly from textbooks. I'm also thinking we may need to add something about licenses compatible with GFDL if we are allowing more then just the GFDL license to be used. Should we even mention any licenses? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:49, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:I certainly agree vis-a-vis reference texts, and I have removed the reference to them (see the thread below). [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:30, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
:On reflection, I've removed the reference to study guides. These are just a form of textbook, so we don't need a section of them all by themselves. I suppose we could (briefly) refer to them explicitly in the definition of a textbook. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:33, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

::Without explicit mention of study guides and other reference works, we run into a little ambiguity. such guides and references would seemingly already be cut by the need of a textbook to have a narrative (as per the definition we've included). Reference works certainly don't have narratives, and study guides might not either. Also, encyclopedias and dictionaries count as reference works, and they are expressly not allowed. In general, I dont think that study guides are a problem, and I would be inclined to explicitly allow for them in this policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:55, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

== Reference texts ==

I have removed the section on reference texts. The reason for this is that it says no more than that we allow appendices to textbooks that might appear in standard, written textbooks, which is obvious from saying that we allow textbooks. Having an additional section is just confusing: it might suggest that we allow content more suited to Wikisource. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:I would tend to disagree with this, it serves as a point of clarity. We do say that wikibooks aren't a  collection of tables, charts or definitions, but we also want to specifically allow a wikibook to contain such things. Don't forget that there are people in this world who will follow the letter of the policy. Can you imagine a crusade to delete tables and glossaries from all the books here? It may be improbable, but certainly not impossible. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:21, 3 January 2007 (UTC)


== Verifiability ==

:&quot;Like other projects of Wikimedia Foundation, to be on the English-language Wikibooks, textbooks content must:

:....
:Be verifiable and peer reviewable; that is anyone can verify the material will work every time through repeating it.&quot;

Admirable though this is, we don't currently adhere to this. I therefore think we should delete it. We can always discuss the benefits of introducing such a rule later. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 22:09, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

: I agree its good to reflects what is currently adhered to. I think though we do try to adhere to it and I don't believe its introducing a new rule. Original research is in essents anything thats not been peer-reviewed and generally accepted as true. As I tried to explain to Rob above, there seems to be a move to losen the current definition in [[WB:WIW]]. Just look at [[WB:OR]] to see what I mean. I don't really agree we need that proposal though. I would call myself skeptical that its needed. I think a few well picked words in this policy is enough to say what current practise is.
: I slightly clarified that criteria with &quot;Be verifiable and peer reviewable; that is anyone can verify the material is correct and will work every time through repeating it&quot;, although I did that before reading your comment on it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:03, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

::I've made a number of further tweaks - mostly, but not wholly, just tidying up things. Regarding &quot;verifiability&quot;, I have replaced this with a requirement to be &quot;accurate&quot;. It may be that we develop a verifiability policy to expand on what we mean by accurate, but I don't think we need to do this when describing what Wikibooks is. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:12, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I would disagree on some points here, I think that it is current practice on wikibooks to delete material that isn't verifiable. However, we also don't have any guidelines as to what constitutes &quot;verifiability&quot;, and that's perhaps where our biggest shortcoming comes from. Unfortunately, just saying that things must be &quot;verifiable&quot;, without qualifying that term doesnt help, and only serves to create arguments on VfD. Perhaps we should remove this statement then. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Two more additions ==

I have added sections related to study guides and to how-to guides [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_is_Wikibooks%2FUnstable&amp;diff=696588&amp;oldid=696038 here] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks/Unstable&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=696588 here.] I apologise for not adding these earlier. I never really noticed the advertisement in the staff lounge or on the bulletin board, and I just now decided to add my own $0.02.

I realise that how-to guides are a touchy subject. I tried to remove ambiguity that I know has been dragged to death in the past. Unfortunately, I am afraid I may have added some myself. Specifically, I tried to note that how-to guides should be somehow relevant to education provided by universities, home-schools, etc. I provided the example of an ''appropriate'' how-to-create-a-video-game guide, as it would certainly be relevant to computer programming programs across the country. I know that is a '''''very''''' loaded topic, and please feel free to change my wording or my example if necessary.

Regarding my slew of edits, I think that the motion to enforce should probably be closed and re-opened or delayed because of these new additions, which I realise significantly changes the meaning of this version. I do not intend to do last-minute back-room additions akin to United States Congress. On the contrary, I hope that these changes do not change the intended scope of Wikibooks, but instead more correctly define it. Right now there are several study and how-to guides, and I think that they are something we should definitely keep. That is why I added these.

Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:23, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

: I completely disagree with both additions and believe they make the text longer then necessary. I think study guides are being mostly moved to Wikiversity because that is one of the focuses of that project rather then this one. Even if this is not the case I believe the wording of the text before the addition may of been enough to permit it somewhat. The point of defining textbooks was to make having so many sections completely unnecessary. I believe textbooks as defined in this text covers howtos as you tried to define it. I think both additions should be deleted as they are just adding instruction creep that is not needed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 09:31, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

: I believe [if] you feel strongly about having it be explicit that something along the lines of &quot;study guides, howtos and a book on video game programming are examples of textbooks.&quot; This of course is dependent on how others feel about using that as an example. This is an alternative to having these two sections. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 09:43, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I will agree with you that by the current definitions given, a ''how-to guide'' is redundant to a ''textbook''. As I defined it, the former introduces a subject, whereas the latter covers a subject; well, the latter could very well just introduce/cover the subject!
:: ''Study guides'', however, have what I consider a distinct scope. That is, study guides are meant to ''review'' material, which I consider distinct from ''covering'' it. They may or may not have ''a central narrative'', as they may contain relevant points in a list or partial-prose format. Thus I consider them necessary.
:: I don't know why you would consider me strongly believing in a video game programming textbook. For one thing, I have not played a video game in two years, could care less (I spend all my time elsewhere &amp;ndash; a.k.a. wikiwiki), and thought of that off the top of my head.
:: [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 10:02, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

::: I made some changes [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_is_Wikibooks%2FUnstable&amp;diff=696721&amp;oldid=696590 here] another point is the addition of the study guide section is in contradiction of the Wikibooks complements Wikimedia section that says that exams are not permitted here. I wasn't saying you felt strongly about it, just giving an alternative to the additions of two sections which you added, if you feel strongly that it needs to be covered. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:10, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: I partially restored my edit [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks/Unstable&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=696721 here]. I think that study guides are specifically distinct from textbooks for my reasons previously stated. I don't think that it contradicts the Wikibooks complement Wikimedia section because it is does permit doing testing on Wikibooks, it is permits providing study guides for testing that is totally external to Wikibooks. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 10:16, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: It is in contradiction and here's how and why:
::::* Your addition state in the study guide section that &quot;Study guides are a kind of review text that help students and professionals prepare themselves for subject, standard or professional examination.&quot;
::::* And the Wikibooks complements Wikimedia section states that &quot;Quizzes and Exams: Wikibooks is not the place to host quizzes, exams or other tests of comprehension. However, Wikibooks textbooks can contain example problems, study questions related to the narrative of the text, etc.&quot;

:::: The later section permits tests and quizes within books, but disallows books that consist of only being a quize of exam book. Which contradicts what you added. Such books aren't really approperiate here and belong on Wikiversity. Wikibooks provides books for learning about a subject and Wikiversity provides materials for study for a subject in preperation for exams and tests. Wikiversity use to be a project on Wikibooks before it was seperated and that is probably why you can find some books of that sort here, but which probably need to be moved there or changed to be more then just a book on preparing for an exam. At least that is how I understand things. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:30, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: Most study guides that I have read are not quiz and test material. But they generally neither have a central narrative nor are something more than a collection of articles or list of terms, quotations, facts, images or other information.. Thus by our definition of textbook, they fail on two counts. Note that these are study guides for standard examinations that I have taken. I cannot judge by others experiences without data collecting.
::::: But specifically because study guides contain review material, whether it be prosaic in lists or in questions with answers in the back, I think are appropriate for Wikibooks. They are ''review texts'' (though I could imagine them using images depending on the subject, such as multimedia or something), not ''review media''. They do contain ''text'' that can be used for quizzes, exams or tests of comprehension, but as texts hopefully to be printed off, published, or used as ebooks they are not meant to have dynamic javascript quizzes such that Wikiversity has nor should they.
::::: Study guides are not generally quiz or exam books, but are instead combinations of prose, lists, (maybe graphics like I said above), and raw data which a student or professional can use to study for a subject, standard, or professional examination. I think that there is a distinct difference.
::::: [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 10:40, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

:::::: Simple lists and tables generally do not count as individual textbooks. However, if these &quot;resources&quot; are accompanied or paralleled by a narrative, then they do qualify. For instance, a textbook could contain appendices that contain lists and tables. However, these appedix pages do not stand alone as books. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:16, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

== Videogame guides ==

The time has come for us to finally make a decision on the topic of videogame strategy guides. This issue has been in the air for some time now, and although we haven't made an explicit policy about it, the numbers of videogame guides has been constantly decreasing. We are at the point where the wholesale expulsion of these books would not be a significant detriment to the wikibooks project, or the wikibooks community. To this end, I have added the following text to this policy, and I would ask that it not be removed from this policy barring discussion and agreement on the matter:
:http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_is_Wikibooks%2FUnstable&amp;diff=735417&amp;oldid=732375
Some points of justification for this:
#Jimbo has specifically mentioned videogame guides as something that does not belong on this project. He personally attempted to add such text to the previous version of [[WB:WIW]], although he was reverted after some discussion.
#Strategywiki is a much better, focused place to host such guides. Many guides have been moved to that location already.
#Videogame guides have been being deleted on VfD for some time now, especially those that have been transwikied. At the very least, policy should be made to match practice.
#Many decisions that have been made about videogame guides (especially on VfD) have not been grounded in any kind of policy, and are therefore open to too much ambiguity.
#While it may be a slippery slope, videogame strategy guides are not textbooks, and ''no educational institution teaches a class about how to play videogames, with an associated textbook''. 
While last, the final point above is the one that should carry the most weight. I think it's time that we finally laid this matter to rest, once and for all. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:34, 29 January 2007 (UTC)


== Application of Proposal - An example ==

How would this proposal be applied to the new wikibook on The Lord of the Rings: [[Guide_to_The_Lord_of_the_Rings]]?   Is this a textbook?   If not, what would have to be changed to make it a textbook?  Clearly, the works of JRR Tolkein are legitimate subjects of classes at a university.  [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 17:20, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, that's well within the scope of wikibooks, as an annotation. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:30, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

::An annotation in the event that the text of the original book was reproduced here on our servers (a large task, and likely illegal, I think that book is still under copyright). However, it would definately qualify as a &quot;reading aide&quot;, or a &quot;study guide&quot;, both of which are perfectly fine here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:13, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Ah, yep... that's what I meant. :) --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:23, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

Fair enough.  What about [[Roulette]]?  Now I don't know of many colleges that teach a class on how to play gambling games.  How would this be significantly different from Computer Game guides?  [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 22:11, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:Interesting example. A book on Roulette (like a book on any casino game) might be used in a school that trains people to be employees of casinos. &quot;University&quot; is probably too broad a term in any case, since we write a lot of stuff for primary and secondary education, vocational/technical training, etc. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:01, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

::Quoting from the section just above this one:  &quot;While it may be a slippery slope, videogame strategy guides are not textbooks, and ''no educational institution teaches a class about how to play videogames, with an associated textbook''.&quot;  I think it would be difficult to assert that this is absolutely true, and still maintain that the roulette example is legitimate.  Frankly, I think one could easily replace the words &quot;videogame strategy guides&quot; with &quot;roulette guides&quot; and the sentence would still be true.

::If we are not going to allow videogame or computer game strategy guides, we should do so by specifically excluding them, not through torturous interpretations of words like &quot;textbook.&quot;  Of course, if we are going to exclude them, there should be a good reason to exclude them, something other than, &quot;Jimbo says,&quot; or &quot;they aren't part of the mission.&quot;  I can think of several good reasons; let's make it explicit, let's spell out exactly why, and then we can stop worrying about the dichotomy between Roulette and Everquest.  [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 02:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I am very much trying to avoid invoking &quot;Jimbo says&quot; as rationale for making decisions here. The undeniable fact is, however, that Jimbo did say these things, and he sounded pretty serious about it at the time. The videogame guides in particular have been a target of numerous deletion attempts, and a large number of those guides have been deleted in the past year or so. There are plenty of &quot;slippery slope&quot; continuations that we could take: if videogames are not appropriate, then what about other &quot;non-video&quot; games, such as [[chess]], and [[Roulette]]? Or, to really blur the lines a bit, what about a book detailing strategy on a collectable card game, like Magic the Gathering? Alot of the grey area I think we can hammer out using our own judgement, but we need to draw a line in the sand somewhere to use as our starting point. I would make the argument (spurious though it is), that people in this world can make a living playing Roulette (or other casino games), that Roulette strategy has been a topic of serious academic study, and that a book about roulette would implicitly be a book about probability and economics. Of course, the counter-argument could be made that plenty of people recently have earned prize money for competing in videogame competitions, but we can just ignore that for now. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

::::You see how this gets difficult?  Trying to differentiate [[Roulette]] from a guide on how to play Magic: The Gathering is very tough.  If we try to rely upon some generalized description of what a Wikibook should be, we will never be able to make that distinction.  This leaves us with making a specific exclusionary rule.

::::Which brings us to the main issue: what is the rationale for NOT allowing gaming guides as wikibooks?  They teach you how to do something, as much as a book on roulette or craps does.  They are as likely to be part of a &quot;university&quot; course catelogue (that is, extremely unlikely for either).  They service much the same sort of audience (someone with an interest in a recreational pasttime).  And other than attempts to assert they don't meet the main &quot;mission&quot; of Wikibooks, or an appeal to &quot;Jimbo says,&quot; no one seems able to articulate a good reason why they shouldn't be allowed.  I, personally, have always suspected that a good reason not to allow them is because of trademark and copyright issues that would inevitably crop up, but I also suspect that the main reason that they are frowned upon by TPTB is that they appeal to kids and computer geeks, which are somehow not quite &quot;acceptable&quot; as an audience.

::::So, I guess my suggestion is this: articulate a working rule that would exclude gaming guides, '''and''' articulate a valid reason why they should be excluded.  Otherwise, let's stop trying to split infinitismally thin hairs. [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 02:25, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::My counter-suggestion would be to delete [[Roulette]], and all other such books that are inappropriate here. The primary rationale for not allowing gaming guides is that they are not textbooks, and they are not used in any school ever to teach a class. No teacher uses a gaming strategy guide to teach a class, and there are similarly no classes at any school titled &quot;how to play doom&quot;, or &quot;how to win at everquest&quot;. The rationale is that this simply isn't the correct place for these books, in the same way that this is not the correct place for encyclopedia or dictionary content. This is not to say that the subject of videogames is ''never'' discussed academically, and plenty of colleges and universities teach classes about how to program videogames, or how to appreciate videogames, or even a critical understanding of videogame themes. Notice however that none of those topics involve videogame &quot;strategy&quot;, or &quot;walkthroughs&quot;. 
:::::With this in mind, we do not necessarily need an explicit rule to ban videogames, because they are already banned by our other rules (must be a textbook, must help teach a class, etc). We are making it an explicit rule, however, because of confusion that has been caused in the past by leaving it implicit. There are schools in this world that teach games like [[Chess]], and I suspect that there are even some schools that might teach [[Roulette]], although I find that pretty unlikely. We can sort through these games on a case-by-case basis, and remove the ones that do not meet our mission. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:15, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
::::::I have long been an advocate of keeping the Video Game books on Wikibooks, and I still fail to see why this is such a huge point of interest that they be eliminated only because of their content.  That perhaps some standards ought to be established to raise the bar on what would be considered acceptable, and make some video game book policies that are exclusive to the &quot;genera&quot; of Wikibooks, but I still don't see why having a book about [[Roulette]] or even [[Doom]] is necessarily something that can or ought to be removed strictly because of the title and subject matter.  OK, I admit that a book which is strictly a walk-through perhaps shouldn't be on Wikibooks (such as &quot;how to play Doom&quot;) that goes through each level and talks about the monsters.  But a legitimate textbook can be created about the topic that would include some strategies, biographical information about the designers of the game, history of the game including influences on subsequent games, and chapters about game modding and how Doom influenced the video game industry.  This is a very valid and legitimate Wikibook that would indeed be used in a university curriculum as a textbook.  Particularly as something to be reviewed as a part of a study of video game design, which is a university major at several colleges, where both bachelors and even graduate degrees are offered.  There is a place for these books here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Persian Questions/Corrections==
Dear Sir (or Ma'am):
Your Persian lessons are excellent. However, there were some questions I had, and also I think there are few formatting issues that may need to be corrected. These are all relating to Lesson One.

(1) Is &quot;furniture&quot; pronounced ASAS or ASAR--it looks like the final consonant is &quot;se&quot; but you have it written as &quot;ASAR&quot;, with a &quot;re.&quot; (2) Is CHERA (&quot;why&quot;) written correctly? It looks like &quot;che&quot;-&quot;wa&quot; but it should be &quot;che&quot;-&quot;re&quot;? (3) There may be some spots where &quot;jim&quot; and &quot;khe&quot; are confused. (4) There are definitely several places where the whole letter is not fully visible, thus the reader cannot tell if it is &quot;pe&quot; or &quot;be&quot; (among others).

Again, your lessons are excellent. Keep up the good work. I plan to keep using them. Thanks --[[User:Dpr|Dpr]] 14:38, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. I appreciate your help. I'll try to contribute to the project where possible but I'm a complete beginner in Persian. 

:Regarding your question, I say introduce/use the Persian alphabet as soon as possible (i.e. right off the bat), under the theory that real-world use of Persian will require using the alphabet and it's better to master it as soon as possible. Anyone who wants to learn to speak it but not read it will have to be satisfied with a phrase book which can contain Romanized and original text versions of words/phrases. (You can move my comments to the talk page if you'd like).

:Finally, if you have time for another question...I was trying to find out was whether there is a difference in pronunciation between the following groups of letters in Persian/Farsi:
:*se, sin, sad 
:*ze, za, zad 
:*te, ta 
:Does each group have the same pronunciation (i.e. /s/, /z/, /t/, respectively)? Thanks in advance! --[[User:Dpr|Dpr]] 18:53, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

==Further edits==

I've made some amendments, which I hope will be seen as improvements. I do think this unstable version is much better than the original - I hope it can go live in the not too distant future. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:50, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

I think some changes were improvements and some things weren't. I think your changes removed some clarity and facts:
* Even though dictionaries, thesaurus, books of quotations, etc. are books that may be useful for learning, they don't belong here.
* Wikibooks isn't the place to upload books and works of literature, they can only be used as part of annotated texts.

I'll try to make some improvements of my own. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:02, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

== Critical section missing, at least as a theme ==

One thing that is critically missing in this revised policy is something indicating the relationship of Wikibooks to the other Wikimedia projects, and in particular Wikipedia.  I will note explicitly [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not an encyclopaedia]], that has caused innumerable problems in the past when it has not been followed.

Since almost the beginning of Wikibooks, there was a tendancy of people on Wikipedia using Wikibooks as a place to fork articles because of some editing dispute or some sort or another on Wikpedia, especially as Wikibooks tended to have fewer admins and a generally much more permissive policy on what was acceptable.

The issue of avoiding macropedias on Wikibooks is of particular concern to me, as it seems like they are starting to creep back into Wikibooks again, particularly with [[Star Trek Starships]] and a few other semi-recent Wikibooks.  Indeed one of the legitimate reasons for killing some of the gaming guides on Wikibooks (generally not stated in the VfD discussions) was that they tended to be merely collections of references or articles to monsters or weapons in each of the games.  They really weren't scholarly treatments about the games.

I know there is a section in this version about reference texts, but I don't think that covers the issue well enough nor clear enough to new Wikibooks users.  Explicitly stating that macropedias aren't considered acceptable should perhaps be something better defined, particularly given problems that Wikibooks experienced in the past.

Other parts of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#What Wikibooks is not]] do have some legitimate concerns.  I can point to a specific VfD, problematic user, or Wikibooks gone awry that resulted in almost every sentance being written in this section.  While much of that has been worked into this new policy, I think we need to be careful that we aren't throwing too much out in the process.

A variation of [[v:Wikiversity:Approved Wikiversity project proposal#What_Wikiversity_is_not]] might be reasonable to add in here as well.  The general philosophy that we as a project don't go stepping on the toes of the other Wikimedia sister projects is a reasonable thing to explain, and as a general policy we should try to avoid having overlaping areas of responsibility.  This also gets back to why we need to be very explicit that Wikibooks should not duplicate Wikipedia:  Wikipedia does a much better job of being an encyclopedia.  So much so (with tough quality standards, reference requirements, and a much much larger group of people participating) that it seems patently absurd that we here on Wikibooks should even try to duplicate efforts on Wikipedia.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:37, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

:I hate it when people say I agree but &quot;I agree&quot;.  I think this difference needs to be made explicit.  There are some very good books on here &amp; some that may become ones.  However there are both some works that do not seem to me booklike and some stubs that ''could'' be developed the wrong way.  Peace to the anti deletionists but it is a reason I query a number of short pages that seem to have little direction.  They are not useful to readers and in not clearly specifying where they are going may mislead in the future --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:53, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

: I believe the bit about using previously published works could be expanded a little bit to state that in order for duplicate to exist here, it needs to be expanded on, not just copied. I don't believe the issue of using Wikibooks as a dumping ground is strictly done by Wikipedians nor taken just from Wikimedia projects. It was my intent to exclude works duplicate here with no intent of ever being developed further or with the intent of just mirroring another source,

: A major part of my philosphy in revisions to this policy has been on making it more postive and focusing on ways to explain what Wikibooks is for with the effect of excluding through postive definitions (eg so people can say &quot;This is what Wikibooks is for, this is why this isn't allowed here&quot;). I also believe it would be a lot easier for people to agree on what Wikibooks is for then what it is not for. and what may not be allowed might change with time, while the general aims of Wikibooks is not as likely to do so.

: I cut down on referring to other projects a lot because I believe that would be better served as a help page for instance or even a textbook, which should be allowed to be expanded on and changed without being part of some policy. I can agree that &quot;A duplication of other Wikimedia projects.&quot; from Wikiversity may have a place within this policy and the &quot;Other projects&quot; section revised to reflect this. In fact as soon as I finish this reply, I will work on it.

: Are there any other concerns? What other things do you believe is missing from this proposal that is currently in [[WB:WIW]]? I believe this proposal does a good job of covering what is in WB:WIW in a more positive and helpful way, and explains a lot more. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:49, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

::Keep in mind that [[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not]] was primarily defining the relationship between Wikibooks and Wikipedia, at least in the beginning with the policy.  I understand the need to cut down on some of the words here, and that certainly Wikibooks has become an established project, but something here needs to explicitly cover the use of encyclopedias within Wikibooks.  This shouldn't be a seperate policy, because '''''this is precisely''''' the policy where this relationship is already defined.  I would dare say this is the very purpose of this policy.  That perhaps this section from the older policy could be rewritten to a more positive tone, I would have to agree.  That it should be culled completely from this policy, I strongly disagree.  This is far too important to ignore and as I've said, has been the source of considerable frustration in the past that this is supposed to clear up.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:33, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:::My issue is in how WIW currenly defines that relationship by describing what each project is for. I think that sort of information is better off in a help page or textbook because its going off the subject of what Wikibooks is for and into what other projects are for which has nothing to do with Wikibooks policy, but their own policies. There is already links to the other projects policies on what each is within this policy for them to learn that. On the other hand I already adopted some of &quot;What Wikiversity is not&quot; into the policy because I do think it is short and to the point and does a better job of saying &quot;don't duplicate work from other projects&quot; in a hopefully more positive and helpful light which does deal with our policy and I believe covers more then just Wikipedia. Keep in mind this proposal says &quot;Be more then a collection of articles or list of terms, quotations, facts, images or other information&quot; which also excludes most other Wikimedia project stuff. Have you read the current version? I made some changes a few days ago to try to address your concerns. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:44, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

: I remember this problem a while ago, and I agree that there should be some sort of &quot;Wikibooks is '''not''' Wikipedia&quot; thing written in the policy. It is so obvious, but it is forgotten much. We have similar policies, but with distinct nuances. I don't worry so much about Wikibooks anymore however; as we have developed a sense of what is allowed here and what is not.

: As for making it explicit... I'm neutral on the subject. On the one hand, there have been instances in the past where Wikipedia users would come here and dump whatever didn't fit Wikipedia's policy. And there are always going to be macropedias attempted here on Wikibooks. On the other hand, maybe they'd read the policy if we focused on making it shorter and easier to read, instead of adding in so much redundancy. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 17:50, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I agree with your comment that maybe more people would read the policy if it focused on being easier to read. My main issue with the current WIW is it seems to focus on what Wikibooks isn't too much, which doesn't help new users understand what Wikibooks is for. Thats why I think this one is better. I did as I said I was going to do and made [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_is_Wikibooks%2FUnstable&amp;diff=695843&amp;oldid=695267 some changes]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:22, 24 December 2006 (UTC)


== Duplicating some items from the older version ==

I added some sections regarding the relationship between Wikibooks, Wikipedia, and Wiktionary.  These are very common new user mistakes in terms of having somebody create a list of words or write up what is essentially just an encyclopedia article.  With some strong examples of what a Wikibook is on the Main Page, this has been cut down considerably from what the typical experience was like in the past, but it still happens.

I tried to keep the generally positive tone of this new version of the policy, but to retain the key ideas.

I also added a new section about essentially original research.  There has been some concern that there is no official policy about original research, but in fact what was on the previous &quot;What Wikibooks Is Not&quot; was largely felt to be all of what was necessary for original research policy here, and the policy most often cited in terms of removing original research in the past.  This is in fact something we need to be a little more diligent about in terms of trying to cull this sort of content from Wikibooks before it gets out of hand.  The wording is mostly copied from the original policy, so I hope it isn't too controvercial to be added here.

Omitting either of these additions really puts a huge hole in this policy, and was something really missing from this current revision.  I understand that the purpose was to try and simply a rather unwieldy policy, but experience has shown that many of these issues need to be spelled out very explicitly, particularly for brand-new users to Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:16, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

: I do understand that creating lists of words or writing encyclopediac articles can be a very common mistake for new users to make, but I still don't understand why you think this policy is the approperiate place to address these concerns. We have [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for example which is meant to address confusion for people who are use to Wikipedia and how things are different here, and we also have various [[Help:FAQ]] files that could include this information for example &quot;Q: I can write encyclopedia articles here too right?&quot;. I have to admit though what you added is more positive than before. I guess you could say my concern is this providing informative information thats policy rather then proving helpful information for new users and where do we start to draw the line?

: Your use of &quot;they must be secondary and auxiliary to a main text&quot; has given me the beginings of an idea for more improvements to this policy, which I think can help improve the &quot;Wikibooks complements Wikimedia&quot; section.

: The omittion of an original research section was intentional there is some attempts to have [[WB:OR|another policy]] to address this specifically that are in contradiction with the current WIW's concept of original research and your Academic Research description. The people working on that policy seem to be interested in allowing people to coin new words and definitions so long as they make are clear and people can understand them, and in allowing new ways of doing things. Last I checked though it was not very clear because of disagreements on what should or shouldn't be allowed. For myself, I believe taking the perspective of defining what it takes to not be original research has a far better chance of working while satifing these wishes. &quot;Be verifiable and peer reviewable; that is anyone can verify the material will work every time through repeating it&quot; was the result of some of that perspective and discussing it on the IRC channel. Fiction and novel literatures aren't something your going to be using to learn from but for enjoyment, so why do you think this is needed? I think the two points I think you were trying to make for orginal research can be perhaps be addressed as &quot;Be based on facts that are well established&quot;, what do you think? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:54, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

::I will have to say that we absolutely must get the original research policy passed before this version is accepted if you absolutely insist that the original research portion of the current policy is to be removed.  For now, this is the one and only policy that we have that even addresses this issue.

::In terms of removing the portion discussing Macropedias, I am going to be a major PITA about this if it is not put into this policy in some substantial form.  This is a very, very, very common new user mistake, and not something merely to be relegated to the &quot;FAQ&quot; pages.  The same goes for individuals who want to create encyclopedia articles on Wikibooks, including forking from Wikipedia.  That the wording may be more friendly, yes, I can agree on that point.  But it does need to be in here in some fashion.  This is very much a critical section that absolutely must be addressed by this policy, or perhaps recreating [[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks Is Not]] if you insist.  The whole point of merging that policy into this policy was to keep to one page everything that generally talked about the same general idea:  What exactly is this crazy thing we are doing?

::As far as addressing fiction and novel literature, this is again something that has been repeatedly added to Wikibooks and we point explicitly to this policy as justification for removing that sort of content.  I thought this was a resolved issue here, but apparently it isn't.  ''''''This is the policy that governs fiction on Wikibooks!'''''  If you want to spin this policy off as a seperate policy, OK, I might go along with that, however it flys in the face of trying to simplify the plethora of policies on Wikibooks as well.  While you may not think currently of fiction as something found on Wikibooks, that hasn't always been the case.  It is very diligent efforts on the part of many administrators to keep that stuff off, and point to this policy as a short hand not to reopen the whole debate over fiction on Wikibooks all over again.  Or if the issue is reopened, then it should be a major policy change instead.

::One of the key parts of this policy is that it is the accumulated experience and history of Wikibooks, particularly in dealing with marginal issues and codifying concensus that has happened on the VfD pages and the Staff Lounge.  My huge concern about the massive culling of content on this page is that you have suddenly lost all of that accumulated experience, and lost the context as to why we do things the way they are done here.  Try to at least understand why I'm adding these sections in here, and make a special effort that any policies that are removed are then subsequently covered elsewhere.  I don't see that happening here at the moment.  As the oldest policy on Wikibooks, dating almost to the very creation of this project, it has accumulated some cruft over time.  But at the same time, don't simply change things just for the sake of changing them.  There are reasons why this policy has been worded the way that it is currently.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:21, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I agree with Rob. The NOR rule is one of the fundamental rules of all WMF projects, and it's something that we do need to specify, either here or someplace else. As a bit of compromise, we could include a small statement against original research in this policy, and then create a separate proposal (guideline or policy, i don't care) that will flesh out the details. Regardless of where we write about it though, i think that ''we must have something on the topic''. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:55, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

::::I'd be interested to know specifically how Rob would amend the current version of the proposed text so as to address his concerns. For example, is it sufficient to add under the &quot;To be on the English-language Wikibooks, textbooks content must:&quot; section the words &quot;not be original research&quot; to address this point, or, if not, what would he see as addressing it. Similarly, do we just need to add &quot;be non-fiction&quot; to address the non-fiction point? Are we just talking about an additional one or two sentence bit under the &quot;Wikibooks complements Wikimedia&quot; section to address the macropaedia point? Similarly, I'd be interested in how else Rob would amend the text to address any other concerns that he has. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 22:02, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

::::: As far as how I would ammend this.... I already tried and was reverted.  I don't need to add it in again and turn this into an edit war.  If you want to see what I would do, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks/Unstable&amp;oldid=711188 this was my edit in that direction].  I think this was one of the more positive policies on the previous version of this policy, and points to some clear places where you can add both fiction and do original research, if that is what you really want to do.  I still fail to see why this whole section needs to be eliminated.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

::: I understand that this policy represents the accumulated experience and history of Wikibooks. However, I can't say I understand your concern, because I disagree that changes present in this proposed revision for the policy is resulting in lost of all that accumlated experience. I believe its clarifying that accumulated experience through more positive reinforcements and addressing both the need for clarity and an updated reflection of current practise. I am trying to understand why your adding them, even if I do disagree with them, so I can better understand your position and reach a compromose we both can accept. So far though you haven't made it easy for me to understand your position and why you think its needed.

::: I agree that works of fiction and other literature aren't generally allowed unless its in the form of annotated texts. I don't dispute that, so I don't consider it unresolved. I'm not suggesting that this be a seperate policy either. I believe that through the definition of textbook and the bit on annotated texts, this proposed policy does explain why works of fiction and other literature don't belong here. What I'm trying to understand is how Robert or anyone else feels that this proposal inadequately addresses why they are not approperate for Wikibooks. For example, how would anyone not be able to point to this policy and clearly show, in its current form, that fiction and other literature aren't allowed?

::: My problem with focusing on macromedia and encyclopedia articles for policy is I don't believe its enough any more. I think we need to address the broader problem of content dumping in all its forms, not just from Wikipedia and not just in the form of encyclopedia articles. I could be wrong, but I believe its current practise to disallow it without much regard for the reason for it, unless there are people who are willing to develop it into textbook material independently of its original source. I would be agreeable to having &quot;Be more than a collection of articles or list of terms, quotations, facts, images or other information (though books may include them)&quot; taken and made into its own section somehow thats explained in more detail. That was actually part of the idea that was starting to form with the concept of secondary information. I think that &quot;Wikibooks complements Wikimedia&quot; could be that section. Explaining how each Wikimedia project has its own focus and the focus of Wikibooks is on textbooks and so most of these things don't belong here as a book within itself, but can be used as seconardy information within a book as an aid to readers, but nothing more than that. I do have some concern though that this issue may need to be addressed seperately from this policy because it seems like it could get rather big and may have a different focus and aim from this policy. I'm still working it out in my mind, but hopefully you see my point.

::: The original research concept, I believe needs to be made more positive and reflect current practise as with everything else that has been done to this policy. I think there needs to be a decision of some form as to whether or not that should be covered in this policy or in a seperate one. I favor rejecting [[WB:OR]] and focusing on better ways to describe the concept in this policy. For example if it there is a insistence on giving it a name, rather then describing it through content requirements, than use something like &quot;established research is theories that have been peer reviewed and is generally accepted as fact.&quot; I would like to understand what problems, if any, that Robert or anyone else has with this approach. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 09:30, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: I will have to say that in term of forking Wikipedia articles, I just dealt with an issue done by a new contributor '''''today'''''.  See [[Physical Chemistry/Valence Bond Theory]] for what I marked as an issue.  And clearly this is yet another attempt to create a macropedia about in this case physical chemistry.  There is a very strong tendancy among Wikibooks authors to simply make a Wikibook to be a collection of articles about a given topic, where there is no distinction at all between Wikibooks and Wikipedia.  I'm not being paranoid here, but simply stating a simple observation I've made over a great deal of time.  This is something that absolutely must be explicitly mentioned.  Forking content from Wikipedia is fine, and is not in violation of the GFDL.  I should note that the rest of this user's contributions were out right copyright violations, so he is obviously just copying stuff because he doesn't know better.  But that doesn't stop abuses here of Wikibooks.

:::: And while I may agree that the issue of Macropedias might need to be expanded, I feel that the wording I used in my previous edit to be quite reasonable and concise.  It was also very positive in tone and even suggested alternatives for those who really want to make a macropedia.  It can be done on Wikipedia without even creating a Wikibook in the first place.  If so, there is no reason to make one here in the first place.  It is also current policy, and by removing it also removes and declares void this policy.  That is a huge change.  Or it turn this policy from something official to something much less concrete and open to objection.

:::: As far as the original research policy wording, I'm really curious about what is so negative about it.  It simply says that it is better to used the Academic Wikicity if you want to do original research, and notes that as a basic principle original resesearch is not done on Wikibooks.  Ammending the wording to make it more positive is much different than culling the whole policy altogether.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

::::: The primary problem (at least concerning macropedias) is that not all people are capable of writing a '''textbook''', and many people don't quite understand the difference between a textbook and a multi-page macropedia. This is a subject that people need to learn on their own, because nobody teaches how to write textbooks. That a textbook needs to have a centralized narrative implies that it requires a large amount of planning, dedication, and vision. These are all things that our contributors are not required to have before during or after they start authoring their books. Having more policy on these issues won't change the fact that most of our contributors (as well-meaning as they may be) are simply unable to properly author a textbook. Frankly, a macropedia makes a good start to a book, and only requires a certain &quot;author's touch&quot; to become something better, and I'm willing to wait around forever for somebody to deliver. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:30, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::: Well at the end is easier to turn a macropedias into a book with some flow and a sense direction that it is to start it from scratch, I'm personally against teaching anyone how to write a book (that is giving a set of rules and guidelines), the best book one can write is the book one would like to read, this is not very complex and a basic use of common sense would do, this is part of the attraction I have on how books evolve on Wikibooks, it is with some pleasure that I can detect cultural influences on several books or as you state the &quot;author's touch&quot;, but most users still prefer to be kept away from the work and personal involvement authoring entails (things do get dangerous out there), and this will not change even if numbers get increased the disparity of contributors vs authors will probably remain steady or even aggravate since the only reward an author has on Wikibooks is to accomplishing something he sees and hopes will be useful for others.
:::::: Another point to have in consideration is that it is easier for contributors to participate collectivity in a macropedia that to have several authors colaborating at the same time on a book especially under the Wikibooks infrastructure, were most personal relations are casual and based on assumptions and decisions don't require/can't support a long term compromise nor an end date for the job. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 06:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

==== Macropedias ====

I would like to point out that the issue of Macropedias is currently a part of the existing policy, and has been &quot;official policy&quot; since [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=129062 this version] of this policy was created by [[User:KelvSYC]], a long-time admin who practically ran Wikibooks single handedly back elsewhen.  I see that Whiteknight is challenging this philosophy, which is fine, but my argument here is that this is currently policy and what is being proposed now is to remove this policy from Wikibooks.  And that the policy was removed under the guise of a simplification where I think this is a signficant policy change and should not be omitted unless this is precisely where the Wikibooks community wants to go.

OK, I will admit that in actual practice the Wikibooks users do have a hard time trying to make a distinction between a Wikibooks module and a Wikipedia article.  And often the two read so similarly that they can be transwikied between the two projects with most people not really understanding that there might be a difference.

One of the key points of this policy is that it very clearly defines a huge difference between Wikipedia and Wikibooks.  Even if in practice we tend to fall short of the goal, it is still important to let people know what the idea &quot;textbook&quot; really could be here.  Set the standard high enough and eventually much of what we produce will reach that standard.

In addition, I have tried (sometimes unsuccessfully) to stop efforts that are really nothing more than a Wikiproject that was kicked off of Wikipedia for some reason or another.  Wikibooks that clearly have no intention of being anything other than a collection of encyclopedia-like articles, such as frankly most of the video game guides were before they were deleted, fit this description.  It really would be better if these articles were instead on Wikipedia (where they would get much more attention anyway) and you create a Wikipedia portal page to that content.

Keep in mind that Wikibooks was started specifically because [[User:Karl Wick]] decided to write [[Organic Chemistry]] on Wikipedia, but this content was kicked off due to the length it was getting on Wikipedia.  This is the standard that Jimbo uses when trying to compare the rest of Wikibook's content, and frankly much of what we have does fall short of that sort of approach and quality.  So the question I offer here is how to distinguish random Wikipedia articles that really should be on our sister project from those that really should be here on Wikibooks?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:49, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

:For clarification, I'm not challening the &quot;no macropedias&quot; rule, that's an established rule, and I dont see a reason to remove it. What I am advocating, however, is that while the aim of a book project here on wikibooks should not be to create a macropedia, the use of macropedia-like formatting as an intermediate state of book creation should be acceptable. My point being here that many people who are not familiar with authoring textbooks (which includes, essentially, everybody here) may not be immediately able to construct books in the proper format. Having a book that is essentially a macropedia shouldn't be cause for deletion (i dont feel that we should ever really delete content that is acceptable based on poor formatting), but should be cause for people to come in and improve it. I posit that all macropedias can become textbooks with far less effort required then it would take to author a new book on the subject from scratch. 
:Something that I would like to point out is that many books here begin life as a meer outline. And while outlines themselves are not acceptable material to host here on wikibooks, they are an acceptable intermediate state of material while a book is being created. Macropedias, while not recommendable, are likewise an acceptable intermediate step in book creation, but they are not (and should not ever be) an acceptable end point for a book project here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:01, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

::Why not add a timelimit or a limited life time as a macropedia and tag it as VfD after that has passed, maybe taking in consideration the last time the book was contributed (not edited) content, in the VfD we can add [[User:Whiteknight]] view that I agree completely, this will solve any future problems and bring content, even if the content in the final stage is discarded from Wikibooks it can be usefully elsewhere under the GFDL. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

:::A timeline, i think, is just not an acceptable tool. Textbooks take a long time to write, and all our authors here are volunteers. We must be patient with people as they author their textbooks, and we should not be in any kind of a hurry to mandate what kinds of progress must be made, and in what timeframe. The only punishment that we should use in such situations, is that books that are meerly macropedias should not be designated as &quot;good&quot;, and should not appear on the main page or in [[Wikibooks:Featured books]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Narrative&quot; as optional ==

I disagree with the change in the text to make a narrative an optional component of a book. A narrative is all that stands between a macropedia and a textbooks, and saying that a narrative is optional is tantamount to saying macropedias are acceptable. There is a strong historical precident for not allowing macropedias here, and i think we should follow that precident. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:15, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

: That was in response to the fact that references don't generally have a narrative which is an acceptable textbook. I could of sworn I read you urging above that macropedias can become acceptable textbooks with time and should be given a chance to become so. Have you changed your mind on that? Surely there is some other criteria that excludes macropedias from being developed here without relying on all books requiring a narrative and without making a special exception for it? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:34, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

::A macropedia can become acceptable with the addition of a narrative. Once the information is written down, the addition of narrative and other &quot;book features&quot; is a relatively simple matter. I can understand your point about reference books, however. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:45, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Wikibooks doesn't complement Wikimedia ==

Wikibooks is a part of Wikimedia it does not complement it, Wikimedia is a project under constant evolution without a specific goal or concrete objective so no one single part of it may complete it.

part - A portion, division, piece, or segment of a whole.

complement - Something that completes, makes up a whole, or brings to perfection.

--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:41, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

: Because Wikibooks is a part of Wikimedia, it helps to complete and bring Wikimedia to perfection. Thus it is both a part and a complement of Wikimedia. Rather confusing, but hope this helps! :) --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 05:10, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

::I would tend to agree that wikibooks is a component part of wikimedia, and not a complement to it. Wikibooks does, however, complement the other wikimedia projects. For instance wikibooks complements wikipedia and wikiversity. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:18, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

A part belongs to the hole, a complement may not be part of the hole, but help the &quot;fulfillment&quot; of the goal. &quot;The METRO/SUBWAY complements the BUS routes.&quot; --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:29, 26 December 2006 (UTC)


== From &quot;not paper&quot; ==

What does &quot;The authors of a textbook do not worry about an event occurring tomorrow that makes all the large, expensive paper copies outdated, as the textbook will change as well.&quot; mean? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:03, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

:My own interpretation of the text is that printed textbooks sometimes refer to things that may change shortly, such as some new theory that may effect how a subject is understood and effect the accuracy of the text. Because Wikibooks is not limited to paper where such speculation may be needed, textbooks here can be updated to reflect changes as the changes happen rather then trying to guess what will happen and trying to prepare for it prematurely. Attempting to do so is difficult anyways to do beforehand because what may happen can radically change from day to day. Its about making clear to write about what people know to be true today rather then what may be true tomorrow. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

: Hmm... the &quot;not paper&quot; does seem important to remind people that Wikibooks can do stuff that normal books can't do. However; it feels like a &quot;wikibook plug&quot; to me, and probabably should be in a different section. Maybe in a how to write a wikibook section or something similar. It contributes little to this policy page IMO. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 19:55, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

:I think it's important: we don't want people to be writing traditional-style textbooks at the expense of losing some great features that wiki has to offer. The sentence that Johnny brings up, while poorly worded, goes to mean that wiki is a continuous process, not a linear process like tradtional textbook authoring (write, edit, revise, format, publish, etc). If the world changes tomorrow, wiki can update immediately, if needed. If a traditional textbook is being edited or revised, and the world changes, the whole project needs to get scraped. In short, wiki isn't constrained by timelines, as paper books are. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:20, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">At first glance, type may seem an easily overlooked feature in Flash.  However, the text features in Flash are very comprehensive and allow the user to explore their typographic creativity. Flash uses vectors to create type.  Vectors are mathematical algorithms used in programs such as Adobe Flash and Adobe Illustrator to create shapes that are both scalable and small in file size.  In contrast, bitmap or raster images are created pixel by pixel yielding subtle color detail such as in photographs.  Vector type is a great choice for Flash because it allows for precise lines and scalability without inflating file size.  

==Using the Text Tool==
Adobe has introduced new font rendering capabilities that allow for anti-aliased text in animation increasing the readability of the text.  However, because of this feature, anti-aliased text created with Flash cannot be rendered when opened by versions older than Flash 7.

Flas incorporates three main types of text:  '''[[/Static|static]]''', '''[[/Dynamic|dynamic]]''', and '''[[/Input|input]]''' text.  Static text is display text which is not changed at run time.  Dynamic text fields are updated or changed at runtime via an outside source such as a text file.  Input text are text fields for user input at runtime such as a message post or username.  These three categories of type will be further explained in the following sections.


The text tool bar in Flash is similar to those found in other creative application software.  Many of the options will look familiar such as the ‘font menu’, ‘kerning’, ‘color’, ‘size’, ‘alignment’, ‘bold’, and ‘italic.’  The best way to get acquainted with the text tool bar is to observe the layout and features:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using Static Text in Flash Professional 8==


'''Static text''' is display text that is not changed at run time.  However, static text allows the designer many options at author time.  Similar to text boxes in layout programs, Flash’s static text boxes can be scaled, rotated, skewed, flipped, and moved.  In addition, static text can have filters applied to it as well as anti-aliasing.  Static text boxes come in two varieties: expanding and fixed width.  Simply clicking the text tool on the stage and typing will create an expanding text box.  This box will expand width-wise as long as the user types.  Using the text tool to define a box by clicking and dragging will create a fixed width box.  This will constrain the text to the width of the box.  In the upper right corner of each text box, the user will find either a square for fixed width boxes or a circle for expanding text boxes.  Flash 8 also allows text to be positioned vertically in a static text box.  The user simply changes an option on the menu to control the text orientation.  This can be useful when dealing with languages that are not based on Latin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using Dynamic Text in Flash Professional 8==

'''Dynamic text fields''' are updated or changed at runtime via an outside source such as a text file.  Instead of ‘text boxes’, the dynamic text area is called a ‘field.’  The area of the field is defined by the author of the movie.  Using ActionScript, text is called from an outside source and is inserted into the field during run time.  These outside sources can include databases, server-side applications, other flash movies, or text files.  Creating a dynamic text field works the same way as a static text box except that the expanding or fixed width indicator is in the lower right corner instead of the upper right.  Dynamic text fields can be set to scroll.  When the text field is full and set to scroll, the width handle indicator changes from white to black.


There are certain limitations on the appearance of dynamic text.  Text in a dynamic text box cannot be skewed, kerned, tracked, rotated, or use vertical type at author time.  However, because dynamic text fields are allowed to have instance names, ActionScript can be applied to help control its appearance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using Input Text in Flash Professional 8==

'''Input text''' fields are very similar to dynamic text fields.  Instead of using outside sources, the input text field gets its content from the user at runtime.  This could take form of bulletin posts, usernames, user comments, forms, and other means where user input is necessary.  Just as dynamic text, input text area is called a “field” instead of a “text box.”  The area of the field is defined by the author of the movie. Creating an input text field works exactly as a dynamic text field in that the expanding or fixed width indicator is in the lower right corner.  Input text fields can be set to scroll.  When the text field is full and set to scroll, the width handle indicator changes from white to black.


There are a few options which are unique to input and dynamic text.  The HTML option in the properties inspector will allow the text field to interpret HTML tags.  The text border option creates an outline around the field and is an easy way to create a dynamic or input “text box.”  Also, both dynamic and input text fields can be assigned instance names in order to have ActionScript applied.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Qt Programming ==
'''[[w:Qt (toolkit)|Qt]]''' is a cross-platform '''application development''' framework which supports the X Window System (Unix/X11), Apple Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows NT/9x/2000/XP). The latest versions have experimental support for mobile operating systems.

Qt is object-oriented, widely used for the development of GUI programs: it is the basis for the KDE desktop environment and used in numerous commercial applications such as Google Earth, Skype for Linux and Adobe Photoshop Elements. It is also useful for developing non-GUI programs such as console tools and servers.

Qt is Released under the LGPL or a commercial license.

To use the framework a previous [[Subject:C++ programming language|C++]] experience is recommended. If you'd like an easier language for use with Qt, check out [[w:PyQt|PyQt]]. See [[X Window Programming/Qt]] for more information.

The Qt documentation (provided freely as the framework) is probably the best information source you can find. See: http://qt-project.org/. It provides extensive documentation and tutorials on Qt.

For more help, try #qt on irc.freenode.net.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] all-purpose bleached [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|Vegetable oil]] for brushing [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]]

==Procedure==

# Heat a large non-stick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or griddle over low heat while preparing ingredients.
# Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in medium bowl.
# [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|Microwave]] buttermilk and milk in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup to room temperature, 20 to 30 seconds.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] in egg, butter, and vanilla.
# Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until just mixed.
# Return batter to measuring cup, stirring in a teaspoon or two of [[Cookbook:Water|water]], if necessary, to make a thick, but pourable batter.
# Increase heat to medium and generously brush skillet or griddle with oil.
# When oil starts to spider, but before it starts to smoke, pour batter, about ¼ cup at a time.
# Work in batches, if necessary, to avoid overcrowding.
# When pancake bottoms are golden brown and tops start to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes, flip pancakes.
# Cook until pancakes are golden brown on remaining side.
# Repeat, brushing skillet or griddle with oil.
# Serve hot.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Use all-purpose flour (which is softer than unbleached), not unbleached flour to make a tender pancake.
* If using salted butter, reduce salt to ¼ teaspoon.
* I usually substitute a tablespoon of lemon juice (or vinegar) in milk for the buttermilk.
* Pancake batter should pour, not glug! On the other hand, runny batter makes thin, oddly shaped pancakes that frequently collide on the griddle. Stir in a touch more flour into thin batter. For batter that's too thick, whisk in water, a teaspoon at a time.
* The temperature of the pan or griddle is important: too hot and the pancakes are dark and raw; too cool and they're blond and hard. For tender, golden brown pancakes, heat the pan or griddle on low while you make the batter. Then increase the heat to medium and generously brush the pan or griddle with oil. It's ready when the oil starts to shimmer and, in any skillet or griddle other than non-stick, sends out tendrils that resemble an octopus or spider. But if the pan starts to smoke, set it down off the burner until the smoking subsides and the oil cools a bit.
* This recipe easily doubles for a crowd.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Biological psychology is the scientific study of the biological bases of behavior and mental states. Because all behavior is controlled by the central nervous system, it is sensible to study how the brain functions in order to understand behavior. This is the approach taken in behavioral neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology. Neuropsychology is the branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relate to specific behavioral and psychological processes. Often neuropsychologists are employed as scientists to advance scientific or medical knowledge. Neuropsychology is particularly concerned with the understanding of brain injury in an attempt to work out normal psychological function.

The approach of cognitive neuroscience to studying the link between brain and behavior is to use neuroimaging tools, such as fMRI, to observe which areas of the brain are active during a particular task.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''''''The nature of thought is another core interest in psychology. Cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes underlying behavior. It uses information processing as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as cognitivism, whose adherents argue for an information processing model of mental function, informed by positivism and experimental psychology.

Cognitive science is very closely related to cognitive psychology, but differs in some of the research methods used, and has a slightly greater emphasis on explaining mental phenomena in terms of both behavior and neural processing.

Both areas can use computational models to simulate phenomena of interest. Because mental events cannot directly be observed, computational models provide a tool for studying the functional organization of the mind. Such models give cognitive psychologists a way to study the &quot;software&quot; of mental processes independent of the &quot;hardware&quot; it runs on, be it the brain or a computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Psychology is an extremely broad field, encompassing many different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior. Below are the major areas of inquiry that comprise psychology, divided into fields of research psychology and fields of applied psychology. A comprehensive list of the sub-fields and areas within psychology can be found at the list of psychological topics and list of psychology disciplines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mainly focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or moral development. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of small infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). Urie Bronfenbrenner's theory of development in context (The Ecology of Human Development - ISBN 0-674-22456-6) is influential in this field, as are those mentioned in &quot;Educational psychology&quot; immediately below, as well as many others. Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of theorists in scientific psychology to inform their research.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Personality psychology studies enduring psychological patterns of behavior, thought and emotion, commonly called an individual's personality. Theories of personality vary between different psychological schools. Trait theories attempts to break personality down into a number of traits, by use of factor analysis. The number of traits have varied between theories. One of the first, and smallest, models was that of Hans Eysenck, which had three dimensions: extraversion—introversion, neuroticism—emotional stability, and psychoticism. Raymond Cattell proposed a theory of 16 personality factors. The theory that has most empirical evidence behind it today may be the &quot;Big Five&quot; theory, proposed by Lewis Goldberg and others.

A different, but well known, approach to personality is that of Sigmund Freud, whose structural theory of personality divided personality into the ego, superego, and id. Freud's theory of personality has been criticized by many, including many mainstream psychologists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Clinical psychology is the application of abnormal psychology research to the understanding, treatment, and assessment of psychopathology. This primarily includes behavioral and mental health concerns. It has traditionally been associated with psychological treatment and psychotherapy, although modern clinical psychology may take an eclectic approach, including a number of therapeutic approaches. Typically, although working with many of the same clients as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists do not, in general, prescribe psychiatric drugs. Several branches of the armed forces have in the past, and a few graduate schools are presently offering a psychopharmacology specialty for psychologists for them to be able to prescribe mental health medication.  Some clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury. This area is known as clinical neuropsychology.

In recent years and particularly in the United States, a major split has been developing between academic research psychologists in universities and some branches of clinical psychology. Many research psychologists believe that many contemporary clinicians use therapies based on discredited theories and unsupported by empirical evidence of their effectiveness. From the other side, these clinicians believe that the research psychologists are ignoring their experience in dealing with actual patients. The disagreement resulted in the formation of the Association for Psychological Science by the research psychologists as a new body distinct from the American Psychological Association.

The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be done inside various therapy models. A popular model is the Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT) framework. CBT is an umbrella term that refers to a number of therapies which focus on changing cognitions and/or behaviors, rather than changing behavior exclusively, or discovering the unconscious causes of psychopathology (as in the psychodynamic school). The two most famous CBT therapies are Aaron T. Beck's cognitive therapy and Albert Ellis's rational emotive behavior therapy, i.e., RET (with cognitive therapy being, by far, the most extensively studied therapy in contemporary clinical psychology).

== Counseling ==
Counseling psychology is a psychology specialty that facilitates personal and interpersonal functioning across the lifespan with a focus on emotional, social, vocational, educational, health-related, developmental, and organizational concerns. Counseling psychology differs from clinical psychology in that it is focused more on normal developmental issues and everyday stress rather than serious mental disorders. Counselling psychologists are employed in a variety of settings, including universities, schools, businesses, private practice, and community mental health centers.

The emerging field of relationship counseling, which characterizes ordinary human relationship successes and failures in concrete terms, has the specific appeal of avoiding psychology's practice of ascribing pathology to individuals who seek assistance. Current health insurance reimbursement for psychological services commonly involves the assignment of mental disease nomenclature(a feature that potential clients may find offensive, and that could potentially be iatrogenic, i.e., when a treatment creates other problems).

Relationship counseling, also referred to as &quot;relationship education&quot;, includes psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers. It is based on decades of university-based research, drawing on knowledge gained through close observation and analysis of both successful and unsuccessful marriages and family units.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. The work of child psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget and Jerome Bruner have been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices.

The work and theories of the above mentioned psychologists will be linked from this site soon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=====Psychology and Law=====
Together, Forensic psychology and Legal Psychology compose the area known as Psychology and Law.

Most typically, forensic psychology is practiced by clinical psychologists, and involves a clinical analysis of a particular individual and an assessment of some specific psycho-legal question. Typically, referrals to forensic practices constitute assessments for individuals that have ostensibly suffered neurologic insult(s). These patients have sought legal recourse, and the job of the forensic psychologist is to demonstrate that there is or is not (depending on their employment by either the prosecution or defense) a cause-and-effect relation between the accident and the subsequent (again, ostensible) neurologic change.

Legal psychology is a research-oriented field populated with researchers from several different areas within psychology (although Social Psychologists are typical).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Health psychology is the application of psychological theory and research to health, illness and health care. Whereas clinical psychology focuses on mental health and neurological illness, health psychology is concerned with the psychology of a much wider range of health-related behavior including healthy eating, the doctor-patient relationship, a patient's understanding of health information, and beliefs about illness. Health psychologists may be involved in public health campaigns, examining the impact of illness or health policy on quality of life or in research into the psychological impact of health and social care.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Industrial and organizational psychology (I/O) is among the newest fields in psychology. Industrial Psychology focuses on improving, evaluating, and predicting job performance while Organizational Psychology focuses on how organizations impact and interact with individuals. In 1910, through the works and experiments of Hugo Munsterberg and Walter Dill Scott, Industrial Psychology became recognized as a legitimate part of the social science [3]. Organizational Psychology was not officially added until the 1970s and since then, the field has flourished. The Society for Industrial Organizational Psychology has approximately 3400 professional members and 1900 student members. These two numbers combine to make up only about four percent of the members in the American Psychology Association but the number has been rising since 1939 when there were only one hundred professional I/O psychologists [3].

I/O psychologists are employed by academic institutions, consulting firms, internal human resources in industries, and governmental institutions. Various universities across the United States are beginning to strengthen their I/O Psychology programs due to the increase of interest and job demand in the field [3].

Industrial organizational psychologists look at questions regarding things such as who to hire, how to define and measure successful job performance, how to prepare people to be more successful in their jobs, how to create and change jobs so that they are safer and make people happier, and how to structure the organization to allow people to achieve their potential.[3]

Human factors psychology is the study of how cognitive and psychological processes affect our interaction with tools and objects in the environment. The goal of research in human factors psychology is to better design objects by taking into account the limitations and biases of human mental processes and behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Experimental psychological research is conducted in the laboratory under controlled conditions. This method of research attempts to rely solely on an application of the scientific method to understand behavior and mental processes. Examples of such measurements of behavior include reaction time and various psychometric measurements. Experiments are conducted to test a particular hypothesis.

As an example of a psychological experiment, one may want to test people's perception of different tones. Specifically, one could ask the following question: is it easier for people to discriminate one pair of tones from another depending upon their frequency? To answer this, one would want to disprove the hypothesis that all tones are equally discriminable, regardless of their frequency. (See hypothesis testing for an explanation of why one would disprove a hypothesis rather than attempt to prove one.) A task to test this hypothesis would have a participant seated in a room listening to a series of tones. If the participant would make one indication (by pressing a button, for example) if they thought the tones were two different sounds, and another indication if they thought they were the same sound. The proportion of correct responses would be the measurement used to describe whether or not all the tones were equally discriminable. The result of this particular experiment would probably indicate better discrimination of certain tones based on the human threshold of hearing.

Experimental psychological research is not restricted to the laboratory.  In a natural setting, a manipulation of the situation can be made to see what is its effect on behavior.  For example, one piece of research in environmental psychology measured the littering behavior of picnicers in a park as the result of litter already at the site.  On random hours and random days, when the picnic area was vacant, the researchers made the area clean or left trash, and then observed how the site was left after the next picnicers visited.

The key phrase to describe an experiment is similar people in different situations.  The similarity of the people is achieved by random assignment (This resembles the phrase 'random selection', but they are very different in meaning and in practice).  The different situations are created by manipulation of some situational variable.  In the previous paragraph, that variable was the absence or presence of litter when the picnicers arrived.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A longitudinal study is a research method which observes a particular population over time. For example, one might wish to study specific language impairment (SLI) by observing a group of individuals with the condition over a period of time. This method has the advantage of seeing how a condition can affect individuals over long time scales. However, such studies can suffer from attrition due to drop-out or death of subjects. In addition, since individual differences between members of the group are not controlled, it may be difficult to draw conclusions about the populations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Neuropsychology involves the study of both healthy individuals and patients, typically who have suffered either brain injury or mental illness.

Cognitive neuropsychology and cognitive neuropsychiatry study neurological or mental impairment in an attempt to infer theories of normal mind and brain function. This typically involves looking for differences in patterns of remaining ability (known as 'functional disassociation's') which can give clues as to whether abilities are comprised of smaller functions, or are controlled by a single cognitive mechanism.

In addition, experimental techniques are often used which also apply to studying the neuropsychology of healthy individuals. These include behavioral experiments, brain-scanning or functional neuroimaging - used to examine the activity of the brain during task performance, and techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, which can safely alter the function of small brain areas to investigate their importance in mental operations.

Computational modeling is a tool often used in cognitive psychology to simulate a particular behavior using a computer. This method has several advantages. Since modern computers are extremely fast, many simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for a great deal of statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualise hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human.

Several different types of modeling are used to study behavior. Connectionism uses neural nets to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many different mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling.

==Ingredients== 

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] all-purpose bleached [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]] extract
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]] for brushing [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]]

==Procedure==

# Heat a large non-stick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or griddle over low heat while preparing ingredients.
# Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in medium bowl.
# [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|Microwave]] buttermilk and milk in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup to room temperature, 20 to 30 seconds.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] in egg, butter, and almond extract.
# Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until just mixed.
# Return batter to measuring cup, stirring in a teaspoon or two of [[Cookbook:Water|water]], if necessary, to make a thick, but pourable batter.
# Increase heat to medium and generously brush skillet or griddle with oil.
# When oil starts to spider, but before it starts to smoke, pour batter, about ¼ cup at a time.
# Work in batches, if necessary, to avoid overcrowding.
# When pancake bottoms are golden brown and tops start to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes, flip pancakes.
# Cook until pancakes are golden brown on remaining side.
# Repeat, brushing skillet or griddle with oil.
# Serve hot.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Use all-purpose flour (which is softer than unbleached), not unbleached flour to make a tender pancake.
* If using salted butter, reduce salt to ¼ teaspoon.
* I usually substitute a tablespoon of lemon juice (or vinegar) in milk for the buttermilk.
* Pancake batter should pour, not glug! On the other hand, runny batter makes thin, oddly shaped pancakes that frequently collide on the griddle. Stir in a touch more flour into thin batter. For batter that's too thick, whisk in water, a teaspoon at a time.
* The temperature of the pan or griddle is important: too hot and the pancakes are dark and raw; too cool and they're blond and hard. For tender, golden brown pancakes, heat the pan or griddle on low while you make the batter. Then increase the heat to medium and generously brush the pan or griddle with oil. It's ready when the oil starts to shimmer and, in any skillet or griddle other than non-stick, sends out tendrils that resemble and octopus or spider. But if the pan starts to smoke, set it down off the burner until the smoking subsides and the oil cools a bit.
* This recipe easily doubles for a crowd.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] all-purpose bleached [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]] for brushing [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]]
* 2 small [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]], thinly sliced

==Directions==

# Heat a large non-stick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or griddle over low heat while preparing ingredients.
# Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in medium bowl.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] nutmeg into dry ingredients.
# [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|Microwave]] buttermilk and milk in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup to room temperature, 20 to 30 seconds.
# Whisk in egg, butter, and vanilla.
# Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until just mixed.
# Return batter to measuring cup, stirring in a teaspoon or two of [[Cookbook:Water|water]], if necessary, to make a thick, but pourable batter.
# Increase heat to medium and generously brush skillet or griddle with oil.
# When oil starts to spider, but before it starts to smoke, pour batter, about ¼ cup at a time.
# Drop 5 or 6 slices of banana over the uncooked side of each pancake as it cooks.
# Work in batches, if necessary, to avoid overcrowding.
# When pancake bottoms are golden brown and tops start to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes, flip pancakes.
# Cook until pancakes are golden brown on remaining side.
# Repeat, brushing skillet or griddle with oil.
# Serve hot.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Use all-purpose flour (which is softer than unbleached), not unbleached flour to make a tender pancake.
* If using salted butter, reduce salt to ¼ teaspoon.
* I usually substitute a tablespoon of lemon juice (or vinegar) in milk for the buttermilk.
* Pancake batter should pour, not glug! On the other hand, runny batter makes thin, oddly shaped pancakes that frequently collide on the griddle. Stir in a touch more flour into thin batter. For batter that's too thick, whisk in water, a teaspoon at a time.
* The temperature of the pan or griddle is important: too hot and the pancakes are dark and raw; too cool and they're blond and hard. For tender, golden brown pancakes, heat the pan or griddle on low while you make the batter. Then increase the heat to medium and generously brush the pan or griddle with oil. It's ready when the oil starts to shimmer and, in any skillet or griddle other than non-stick, sends out tendrils that resemble and octopus or spider. But if the pan starts to smoke, set it down off the burner until the smoking subsides and the oil cools a bit.
* This recipe easily doubles for a crowd.

This page is for people who might help improve this Persian course on English Wikibooks.

'''To take the Persian language course, [[Persian/Lesson 1|click here]].'''

== Book definition ==
* '''Scope''': This Wikibook aims to teach the Persian language from scratch, including grammar, core vocabulary, common phrases, formal/literary language, and conversational language.  By the end, the student should be able to read and write Persian, but may need a human teacher to help with listening and speaking.
* '''Audience''': Anyone who can read English and wishes to learn Persian. Students may not know much about grammar or [[w:linguistics|linguistics]], so the text should describe grammar ideas in simple English.
* '''Organization''': This Wikibook requires no prior knowledge of Persian, and all relevant terms are explained as they are encountered. The book is meant to be read from lesson 1 forward to the end.
* '''Narrative''': The course will move slowly.  The conversations are meant to be engaging and thorough.  Each lesson should include many examples and exercises. Key grammar and vocabulary items are repeated several times to reinforce the foundation being built. After describing each grammar topic, provide several examples and exercises, then a summary.
* '''Style''': The formatting is consistent throughout, with UniPers transcription in angle brackets (e.g., ‹alef›) the same formatting throughout. Each lesson begins with a conversation, including the key grammar and vocabulary in the lesson. At the end, a summary reviews what was learned.

== To-Do List ==
* Add any missing language topics to the list below.
* Move the language topics into the appropriate lesson, building from common or easier topics to uncommon or more difficult ones.
* Create audio files of entire spoken sentences or short conversations (rather than several individual files) for convenient downloading.
* Add more examples to the handwriting section. More explanation of Persian handwriting.
* Possibly: An introductory section for Arabic speakers.  (Shouldn't such a section be in an Arabic Wikibook?)
* A section on Arabic grammar. (Only in the limited sense that such grammar is used in Persian, right?)
* A definitive policy on what level of language should be used.

== Transliteration ==
The transliteration system UniPers, consistent with [[w:Persian phonology]] and [[wikt:Wiktionary:Persian transliteration]], is used in these lessons.  That system gives a single transcription letter for each Persian phoneme, so when it is written within angle brackets (‹alef be pe te se›), it is consistent with the orthographic use of [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet]].

== Pronunciation ==
Both formal and colloquial pronunciation should be included, with a consistent register throughout any given dialogue.  Differences between colloquial and formal (e.g. formal [ɒːn] becomes colloquial [uːn]) should be mentioned to the student.  This course has a print version, wherever pronunciation of a single word is to be presented, show it visually using IPA and include a link to the audio file for convenient online access.  [[template:listen]] is helpful here.  (Supply IPA pronunciation as the last parameter, which replaces &quot;listen&quot;.)

== Practice ==

After explaining each grammar topic or lesson, show example phrases, then invite the student to participate actively with reading, listening, and speaking exercises. Exercises should be simple, show answers if relevant, and even repetitive to help instill an intuition for Persian. 

== Lesson Planning ==
This is a space for the development of an overall framework for the book, so that grammar and vocabulary can be introduced in a logical order and at a good pace. Previously covered grammar and vocabulary should be revisited regularly.

As you write, remember that people reading this book may be totally new to the language. Do not write as if you are writing for another Persian speaker, but explain things so learners can use this book easily.

Add any missing topics below. Keep the lesson contents manageable and their size regular.

Note: The first bullet point in each lesson below shows the main focus for the lesson.

===Fundamentals===
The first four lessons focus on the writing system with minimal grammar and vocabulary.

[[Persian/Lesson 1]]
* Orthography: Introduce alphabet from ‹alef› to ‹xe›.   Show stroke order with animate gif files.
* Dialogue: ‹salâm!›  Friends آرش  ‹âraš› and شيرين ‹širin› greet each other informally.
* Culture: Brief Arab-Persian history and the influence of the Arab language on Persian.
* Orthography: separate and joined letter forms (‹alef› lacks a joined form)
* Orthography: short vowels and how they are usually omitted in writing.

[[Persian/Lesson 2]]
* Orthography: Continue alphabet: د ‹dâl›, ذ ‹zâl›, ر ‹re›, ز ‹ze›, ژ ‹že›, س ‹sin›, ش ‹šin›, ص ‹sâd›, ض ‹zâd›, ط ‹tâ›, ظ ‹zâ›.   Show stroke order with animated images.
* Dialogue: ‹hâl-e šomâ cetor ast?› آرش  ‹âraš› and آقاى پیمان ‹âqâ-ye peymân› greet each other formally.
* Phonology: syllable stress
* Culture: titles like آقا and its feminine homophone آغا are used before or after the first name, last name, or both. پيمان is a first name. Family names are relatively new (1912?) in Iran. 
* Orthography: د ‹dâl›, ذ ‹zâl›, ر ‹re›, ز ‹ze›, ژ ‹že› lack a joined form

[[Persian/Lesson 3]]
* Orthography: Continue alphabet:  ع ‹'eyn›, غ ‹qeyn›, ف ‹fe›, ق ‹qaf›, ک ‹kaf›, گ ‹gaf›, ﻝ ‹lâm›, م ‹mim›, ن ‹nun›.  Show stroke order with animated gif files.
* Dialogue: صبح بخیر ‹sobh bexeyr› (&quot;good morning&quot;)  حسن (&quot;Hassan&quot;, a.k.a. حسن ی /hasani/) talks with Mohamad (a.k.a. ممد /Mamad/).
* Vocabulary : Introduce one form of the negative present tense copula, e.g. {{Persian/text|نیستم|nistam}} and a few adjectives.

[[Persian/Lesson 4]]
* Orthography: Finish alphabet: و ‹vâv›, ه ‹he›, ی ‹ye› (‹vâv› lacks a joined form).  Show stroke order with animated gif files.
* Dialogue: آقا رضا ‹âqâ rezâ› talks with خانم شيرين ‹xânom širin›.
* Orthography: long vowels (with alef at beginning vs. without alef in the middle/end)
* Orthography: Alphabet summary.  Copyedit and move most of [[Persian/Alphabet]] into here.
* Vocabulary: include pronouns that have not yet been introduced in preparation for the grammar lessons: ما, آنها, او
* Grammar: تشديد tašdid

===Basic grammar===
The next several lessons establish a foundation of Persian grammar.

[[Persian/Lesson 5]]
* Grammar: introduction to verb conjugation via the present tense forms of copula بودن (the most common verb in Persian) in short/clitic form (ام، است، ...) and emphatic/full-form (هستم، ...)
* Dialogue: ___ talks with احمد جان /Ahmad jân/ (&quot;dear Ahmad&quot;, term of endearment), include all standard personal pronouns in copular sentences
* Grammar: simple copular sentence structure, verb last, optional subjects. (no definite object marker yet, no prepositions)
* است (with singular and plural subjects) and هستند (animate plural subjects only) for &quot;there is&quot; and &quot;there are&quot;.  Some sources disagree with this and say است is only a copula, not used for existence.

[[Persian/Lesson 6]]
* Grammar: Ezâfe
* Dialogue: 
* Grammar: adjectives following nouns, unstressed ی (like ezafe and considered such by modern/western grammars, but functionally different and not considered ezafe by traditional Persian grammars because it does not join two substantives) as enclitic (not suffix), pronunciation and written/unwritten form after consonant (/e/) or vowel (/je/); colloquially, short forms are used even after vowels.
* demonstrative adjectives: این /in/ (&quot;this&quot;), آن /un/ (&quot;that&quot;), before noun.
** Demonstrative contractions: /injâ/ (&quot;here&quot;), آنجا /unjâ/ (&quot;there&quot;), /conin/ (&quot;like this&quot;), /conân/ (&quot;like that&quot;), /hamin/ (&quot;this [very] same&quot;), /hamân/ (&quot;that [very] same&quot;)
** Demonstrative pronouns آنها ‹unhâ› (&quot;those there&quot; or just &quot;those&quot;, special case where ها is always joined) and اینها ‹inhâ› (&quot;these here&quot;, second special case where ها ‹hâ› is always joined).

[[Persian/Lesson 7]]
* Grammar: simple past tense conjugation (infinitive /-an/; past stem + /-am/ /-i/ /-/, /-im/, /-id/, /-and/)
* Dialogue: 
* Culture: plurality and formality/deference
* Grammar: plurality of verb with animate vs. inanimate subject
* Plurality of subject reference, optional subject pronoun, and verb as it relates to formality and deference:
** Semantically plural human subject requires plural verb.
** 2nd person semantically singular addressee:
*** Friendly, informal reference: (optional pronoun) تو /tow/, singular verb (ی ending)
*** Semi-formal, respectful: (optional plural pronoun) شما /šomâ/, singular verb (ی ending)
*** Formal, more respectful: plural verb, optional plural pronoun (شما), plural verb written with ید ending, pronounced colloquially as ین.
*** Very formal conditions treating the addressee with deference: جناب عالی /jenâb âli/ (&quot;your excellency&quot;)
** 3rd person semantically singular human reference: او /u/ or ایشان /išân/.  May use plural verb to show greater respect.

[[Persian/Lesson 8]]
* Grammar: negation
** negative particle ن ‹na-› takes the stress and prefixes conjugated verb, not the invariant part
* Grammar: negative copula (بیستم، بیست، ...)

[[Persian/Lesson 9]]
* Grammar: plural nouns, (joined or ZWNJ plus) ها suffix, works for all nouns in spoken Persian.
** Bonus: Alternatively, plurals of certain Arabic nouns representing animates or paired body parts can take ان ‹-un›.  Regular (un-&quot;broken&quot;) Arabic plurals can take ات ‹-ât›.  Arabic final ه becomes جان. Some Arabic nouns can take ین ‹-in›.
**  No suffix when numeral is used (before the noun). Written Persian: use ان suffix for human nouns, irregular plurals from Arabic (ات، ین، or vowel alternation, e.g. [[wikt:کتاب|کتاب]])
** non-pronoun subject may be unspecified for number
** plural non-human subject with plural suffix ها may take singular verb if it is thought of as a collective unit.  Plural verb is always used with plural autonomous subjects, e.g. vehicles carrying people, governments of people, buildings with people, etc.

[[Persian/Lesson 10]]
* Grammar: indefinite marker as unstressed clitic ی, translates as “a”, “an”, or “some” (after ها)
** written as ئی after ا or و
** singular noun with ی may express uncertainty about the quantity
** colloquial use of یک as a singular indefinite determiner vs. indefinite clitic ی.  Avoid confusion between ezâfe (کتابهای &quot;books of&quot;) and indefinite (کتابهائی &quot;some books&quot;)
* homographs with different short vowels: کرم for ‹kerm› &quot;worm&quot;, ‹karam› &quot;generosity&quot;, ‹kerem› &quot;cream&quot;, ‹krom› &quot;chrome&quot;, ‹karm› &quot;vine&quot;; also, مردی as noun ‹mard› + indefinite suffix or + linking enclitic or + 2nd person singular copula enclitic or + abstract morpheme, or verb ‹mord› + 2nd person singular conjugation suffix

[[Persian/Lesson 11]]
* Grammar: direct objects and prepositions
** definite or human object enclitic را , colloquially pronounced or /o/ after consonant, /ro/ after vowel
* Dialogue:
* Grammar: no actual direct article, but in some situations را  carries similar meaning, less used than &quot;the&quot;.
* Grammar: prepositions, semantic objects marked by prepositions (/az/, /be/)
* Grammar: single-clause sentence structure: (subject) (definite object را) (prep phrases) (adverbs) (predicate nominative/adjective) verb

[[Persian/Lesson 12]]
* Present tense conjugation (می + ZWNJ + imperative stem): imperative/present stem + /-am/, /-i/, /-ad/, /-im/, /-id/, /-and/
** Old form of simple present was without می, which carries imperfective sense, but the می form has replaced the simple present in modern use for most verbs.
** Verbs that don't take می in the present tense: بودن (ههستم، ...)، داشتن (درم، ...)
** Negative present (نمی)

[[Persian/Lesson 13]]
* Grammar: (bound) personal enclitics after (singular or plural) noun phrase:
** After consonant: /am/, /at/, /aš/, /emân/, /etân/, /ešân/
** After و or ا, /yam/, /yat/...
** After ه or ی, singular suffixes are spelled with leading zwnj+ا.
** after noun phrase, expresses possession /pedaram/ (&quot;my father&quot;), /dust-e xubam/ (&quot;my good friend&quot;)
** alternative pronomial direct objects as enclitics
* Differences between spoken and written forms (e.g., written را is spoken و, ‹e› as the spoken form of است, colloquial verb endings: ه ‹eh›, written ان ‹ân› vs spoken ‹un›, but not in خانم ‹xânom›)

[[Persian/Lesson 14]]
* Grammar: verbs with invariant separable prefixes (sometimes known as &quot;light&quot; verb constructions, similar to English &quot;make an announcement&quot;, &quot;catch a cold&quot;)
* causative sense of کردن vs. شدن (e.g. تلفن کردن, تمیر کردن, گریه کردن, فراموش کردن, فکر کردن)

[[Persian/Lesson 15]]
* formal questions with sentence-initial آیا
* informal questions with voice tone only

===Intermediate grammar===

[[Persian/Lesson 16]]
* Perfective aspect:
** Present perfect (&quot;... has/have [done]&quot;): past participle + auxiliary present بودن in simple clitic or bound form: دیدهم /dideam/, دیدهی /didei/, دیدهست /dideast/, ...; رفتهم /rafteam/, رفتهی /raftei/, رفتهست /rafteast/, ...
** negative perfect: negative ن /na-/ prefixes main verb, not the auxiliary (in case full/emphatic form is used).
** Use of از ... ن with negative present perfect verb for &quot;have not done ... for [some period of time]&quot;
** Use of است که ... ت with negative present perfect verb for &quot;it's been ... since [someone did something]&quot;
** Past perfect (&quot;... had [done]&quot;): with ...ه past participle + auxiliary simple past بودن , e.g.: دیده بودم /dide budam/, دیده بودی /dide budi/, دیده بود /dide bud/, ...; رفته بودم /rafte budam/, رفته بودی /rafte budi/, ...
** Negative past perfect: ن /na-/ prefixes main verb, not auxiliary: نرفنه بودم /narafte budam/
* Invariant prefix before auxiliary verb.
* Negative auxiliary with positive main verb.

[[Persian/Lesson 17]]
* Comparative adjectives (ZWNJ + stressed تر suffix) follow noun with ezâfe like other adjectives.
* Superlative adjectives (ZWNJ + stressed ترین suffix). Superlative comes before noun.
* Comparing two nouns using {{term-fa|از|az|than}}, prepositional phrase typically goes before predicate nominative
*: Proverb: /došman-e dânâ behtar az dust-e nâdân ast/ (&quot;a wise foe is better than a foolish friend&quot;)

[[Persian/Lessons 18]]-?
* Imperative: stem changes, with and without ب prefix, informal imperative as ب + present stem with no personal ending, negative imperative as ن replacing ب
*: Subjunctive: subordinate statement of desire, doubt, possibility, or indirect quote.
*: Imperative/conditional/subjunctive: ب /be-/ + present stem + present personal clitic: بنویسم /benevisam/, بنویسی /benevisi/, بنویسد /benevisad/, ...; دیدن : present stem بین /bin/ (to see): ببینم /bebinam/, ببینی /bebini/, ...; رفتن raftan, ‘to go’, stem رو (rav), بروم /beravam/, بروی /beravi/, /biravad, biravim, biravid, biravand/; bibakhshid, 'pardon!', bibinid, 'see!'
*: Negative imperative/subjunctive/conditional: ن /na/ + present stem + personal endings e.g. naravid 'don't go'; nakunid 'don't do!’
*: Informal imperative: 'bi' + present stem + Ø, e.g. bibin 'see!', bikhuwr 'eat!’, bigu, ‘say!'.
** Subjunctive (&quot;[that] I write&quot;) and conditional: &quot;I want to go&quot; translates as می‌خواهم بروم /mixâham beravam/ (&quot;I want [that] I go&quot;).  Similarly, /mitavânam bebinam/ (&quot;I can [that] I see&quot;).  Past: xâstam biram, 'I wanted to go'; nazasht biram (naguzasht biravam)', ‘He didn't let me go.'
**: verbs frequently followed by subjuctive: tavanistan, 'to be able to', xâstan, 'to want', fikr kardan, 'to think', umidvar budan, 'to hope', guzaŝtan, ‘to let’.
** /be/ pronounced as /bu/ before syllable with /u/, pronounced as /bi/ before syllable with /â/ 
* Explicit possession with the noun مال, e.g. مال من ‹mâl-e man› (“mine”): این کتاب مال من است، ن مال تو ‹in ketâb mâl-e man ast, na mâl-e to› (“&quot;this book is mine, not yours&quot;)
* Future:
** Spoken Persian, future expressed with present imperfective and time adverb (/fardâ/ (&quot;tomorrow&quot;), /baødan/ (&quot;later&quot;)), e.g. /fardâ sobh be muze miravim/ (&quot;We'll go to the museum tomorrow morning&quot;).
** With auxiliary خواستن, e.g. خواهم، خواهی، ... followed by simple past stem (otherwise unconjugated main verb)
** Literary Persian future simple tense
* Abstraction with stressed suffix ی.  Works with nouns and adjectives.  آب، مرد، خوب، بزرک، گل، صورت، نارنج، قهوه، خاکستر...
* progressive/continuous tense:
** No progressive tense in written Persian
** Informal progressive/continuous with simple present auxiliary داشتن /dâštan/ conjugated for person + imperfective (present or past, depending on sense) tense main verb (both verbs conjugated for person).  Sometimes also used as informal future tense. /dâram minevisam/ (&quot;I am writing&quot;), /dârad minevisad/ (&quot;he/she is writing&quot;).
** No negative progressive ( */dâram neminevisam/ ). Instead, the negative imperfective main verb is used with no auxiliary. /neminevisam/ (&quot;I'm not writing&quot;)
** Tendency not to negate present continuous, but to use negative simple present instead
* Relative pronouns آنجه، هرجه، کدام
* Reflexive pronoun {{term-fa|خود|xod|oneself, myself, ...}} always replaces a standard personal pronoun if it has the same referent as the subject
* Past imperfect:
** Expresses continuous or habitual past action, e.g. ‹‹vaqtî bachchih bûdam tû yik furûshgâh kâr mîkardam›› 'I used to work in a department store when I was a child.'
** می /mi/ + ZWNJ + simple past stem + personal suffix.
** When negated نمی is pronounced /nemi-/ in standard dialect, but /nami-/ in Afghanistan and Tajik
* Past continuous
* past continuous + که (for &quot;while&quot; or &quot;when&quot;) + simple past
* اگر (&quot;if&quot;), مگر (&quot;unless&quot;) with subjunctive verb prefix ب
* باید می + simple past tense for &quot;should have [done]&quot;: auxiliary verb is invariant
* شاید +‌ present perfect for &quot;may/might have [done]&quot;: auxiliary verb is invariant
* توانستن conjugated for &quot;can [do]&quot;
* خواستن conjugated + (dropped که +) subjunctive for &quot;want to [do]&quot;
* Coordinating conjunctions:
** [subject] هم [complement 1] هستم/است/.../هستند (&quot;am/is/are both&quot;) هم (&quot;and&quot;) [complement 2]
** [subject] یا [complement 1] است/هستم/.../هستند (&quot;am/is/are either&quot;) یا (&quot;or&quot;) [complement 2] 
** [subject] نه [complement 1] هیت/هستم/.../هستند (&quot;am/is/are neither&quot;) نه (&quot;nor&quot;) [complement 2] 
** [subject] نه تنها [complement 1] هستم/است/.../هستند (&quot;am/is/are not only&quot;) بلکه (&quot;but&quot;) [complement 2] هم  هستم/است/.../هستند (&quot;also am/is/are&quot;) 
* Nouns used like prepositions but read with ezafe: کنار, رو ,پهلو ,پشت ,جلو, عفب, زیر
* Impersonal verbs (آدم)
* Addressing people:
** Friend: آقا /âqâ/ (Mr.) or جان /jân/ (dear) before or after the names as آقا احمد /âqâ Ahmad/, احمد آقا /Ahmad âghâ/ (Mr. Ahmad) or رضا جان /Reza jân/ (dear Reza).

The first day of the calendar year is {{term-fa|نوروز|nowruz|New Day}}, the most important festival of the year in Persian regions.

Seasons: {{term-fa|بهار|bahâr|spring}}, {{term-fa|تابستان|tâbestân|summer}}, {{term-fa|پاییز|pâyiz|autumn}}, {{term-fa|زمستان|zemestân|winter}}

In Iran, the weekend is on Thursday and Friday and the standard business office workweek is from Saturday through Wednesday.  The weekend schedule accommodates the Muslim day of prayer—Friday.  Other than {{term-fa|جمعه|jom’e|Friday}}, the days of the week are named based on {{term-fa|شنبه|šambe|Saturday}}:
# {{term-fa|یک‌شنبه|yek-šambe|Sunday}} (one day after Saturday)
# {{term-fa|دوشنبه|do-šambe|Monday}} (two days after Saturday)
# {{term-fa|سه‌شنبه|se-šambe|Tuesday}} (three days after Saturday)
# {{term-fa|چهارشنبه|cahâr-šambe|Wednesday}} (four days after Saturday)
# {{term-fa|پنج‌شنبه|panj-šambe|Thursday}} (five days after Saturday)

Note that {{Persian/text|&amp;zwj;نب&amp;zwj;|-nb-}} is pronounced as ‹-mb-›, not just in {{term-fa|شنبه|šambe}}, but in all Persian words where the consonant {{Persian/text|ن|n}} is immediately followed by {{Persian/text|ب|b}}.

===Vocabulary===
Limit the core vocabulary to about 15 new words per lesson, but feel free to add any additional words that fit the lesson topic as bonus vocabulary.  Doing so gives students the choice of how much to learn. If the topic for which you have new words hasn't been introduced yet, add them to [[Persian/Glossary]].

{{:Persian/Glossary}}

As each word below finds its way into a lesson, move it from below to [[Persian/Glossary]] (above) and indicate the lesson where it is introduced.

OK, I thought here there could be a framework for the lessons so people can come in and write a chapter at any level. This has worked well in the Chinese wikibook. [[User:Poppy|Poppy]] 10:52, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

== Learning Farsi-English fast ! Words that both languages have in common or are very similar or easy to remember - and little useful easy phrases and [[mnemotechnic]] means on how to remember them ==
It's alway very encouraging when you get to know some words in a foreign language.  And why not start with an easy to remember list of words that are similar or very similar or for some reason easy to remember using a mnemotechnic means.
Then why not start with some easy and very useful phrases and then spin out and learning how to conjugate verbs used in these very useful phrases?

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]] 
| [[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast Cuisine]] 
| [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian Cuisine]] 

==Ingredients==

* ¾ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] all-purpose bleached [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|fine yellow corn meal]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|Vegetable oil]] for brushing [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Corn|frozen corn]]

==Procedure==

# Heat a large non-stick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or griddle over low heat while preparing ingredients.
# Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in medium bowl.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] corn meal into dry ingredients.
# [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|Microwave]] buttermilk and milk in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup to room temperature, 20 to 30 seconds.
# Whisk in egg, butter, and vanilla.
# Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until just mixed.
# Return batter to measuring cup, stirring in a teaspoon or two of [[Cookbook:Water|water]], if necessary, to make a thick, but pourable batter.
# Increase heat to medium and generously brush skillet or griddle with oil.
# When oil starts to spider, but before it starts to smoke, pour batter, about ¼ cup at a time.
# Sprinkle 2 tablespoons corn over the uncooked side of each pancake as it cooks.
# Work in batches, if necessary, to avoid overcrowding.
# When pancake bottoms are golden brown and tops start to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes, flip pancakes.
# Cook until pancakes are golden brown on remaining side.
# Repeat, brushing skillet or griddle with oil.
# Serve hot.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Use all-purpose flour (which is softer than unbleached), not unbleached flour to make a tender pancake.
* If using salted butter, reduce salt to ¼ teaspoon.
* I usually substitute a tablespoon of lemon juice (or vinegar) in milk for the buttermilk.
* Pancake batter should pour, not glug! On the other hand, runny batter makes thin, oddly shaped pancakes that frequently collide on the griddle. Stir in a touch more flour into thin batter. For batter that's too thick, whisk in water, a teaspoon at a time.
* The temperature of the pan or griddle is important: too hot and the pancakes are dark and raw; too cool and they're blond and hard. For tender, golden brown pancakes, heat the pan or griddle on low while you make the batter. Then increase the heat to medium and generously brush the pan or griddle with oil. It's ready when the oil starts to shimmer and, in any skillet or griddle other than non-stick, sends out tendrils that resemble and octopus or spider. But if the pan starts to smoke, set it down off the burner until the smoking subsides and the oil cools a bit.
* This recipe easily doubles for a crowd.

Serves 6, for 2-3 days

==Ingredients==
* 1 pound red beans
* 6 large ham hocks (3½ -4 pounds (1.5 kg to 2 kg))
* 2 cups finely chopped celery (1/2 stalk)
* 2 cups finely chopped onions (one medium)
* 2 cups finely chopped [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]] (one medium)
* 5 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|Bay leaves]] (go real easy here, or you will taste it in your nose)
* 3 Tbls ''Paul Prudholme's Seafood Magic'', or a similar spice
* 1 Tbls [[Cookbook:Tabasco Sauce|Tabasco Sauce]] or similar chili sauce
* 4 Cups cooked Rice (preferably converted)

==Procedure== 

This takes 4+ hours, from the start of cooking

# Cover beans with water, let stand over night. Drain.
# Place ham hocks, celery, onions, bell peppers, Bay leaves, and seasoning into large sauce pan with 10 cups water.  
# Cover and bring to boil. Simmer until meat is fork tender, about an hour after boiling starts, stir occasionally.  
# Remove ham hocks from pan, set aside, skim fat from pan, discard.  
# Remove a significant fraction of liquid from pan, add drained beans, add back just enough liquid to cover beans. Simmer beans until they just begin to break up and liquid starts to become creamy, about 45 minutes.  Stir frequently.  Add back liquid as needed to keep beans covered.
# If beans begin to scorch, do not stir, transfer mixture to another pan without scraping scorched beans into new pot.
# Add ham hocks, cook 45 minutes more, SERVE IMMEDIATELY

==To Serve==

On to heated serving platter, mound 3/4 cup rice per serving at one end of platter, place ham hocks at other end, put 1 cup beans per serving in middle.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] all-purpose bleached [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 1 teaspoon finely grated [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Poppy Seed|poppy seeds]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|Vegetable oil]] for brushing [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]]

==Procedure==

# Heat a large non-stick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or griddle over low heat while preparing ingredients.
# Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in medium bowl.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] lemon zest and poppy seeds into dry ingredients.
# [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|Microwave]] buttermilk and milk in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup to room temperature, 20 to 30 seconds.
# Whisk in egg, butter, and vanilla.
# Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until just mixed.
# Return batter to measuring cup, stirring in a teaspoon or two of [[Cookbook:Water|water]], if necessary, to make a thick, but pourable batter.
# Increase heat to medium and generously brush skillet or griddle with oil.
# When oil starts to spider, but before it starts to smoke, pour batter, about ¼ cup at a time.
# Work in batches, if necessary, to avoid overcrowding.
# When pancake bottoms are golden brown and tops start to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes, flip pancakes.
# Cook until pancakes are golden brown on remaining side.
# Repeat, brushing skillet or griddle with oil.
# Serve hot.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Use all-purpose flour (which is softer than unbleached), not unbleached flour to make a tender pancake.
* If using salted butter, reduce salt to ¼ teaspoon.
* I usually substitute a tablespoon of lemon juice (or vinegar) in milk for the buttermilk.
* Pancake batter should pour, not glug! On the other hand, runny batter makes thin, oddly shaped pancakes that frequently collide on the griddle. Stir in a touch more flour into thin batter. For batter that's too thick, whisk in water, a teaspoon at a time.
* The temperature of the pan or griddle is important: too hot and the pancakes are dark and raw; too cool and they're blond and hard. For tender, golden brown pancakes, heat the pan or griddle on low while you make the batter. Then increase the heat to medium and generously brush the pan or griddle with oil. It's ready when the oil starts to shimmer and, in any skillet or griddle other than non-stick, sends out tendrils that resemble and octopus or spider. But if the pan starts to smoke, set it down off the burner until the smoking subsides and the oil cools a bit.
* This recipe easily doubles for a crowd.

'''''Lactuca''''', commonly known as lettuce,  is a genus of flowering plants in the Sunflower family Asteraceae. The genus includes about 100 species, distributed worldwide, but mainly in temperate Eurasia.

==Description==
Its best-known representative is the garden lettuce (''Lactuca sativa''), with its many varieties. But many are just common weeds. They are annuals or perennials. Their height can vary between 10-180 cm. They form heads or capitula in panicles of yellow, brown or purple flowers in ray florets.

The non-edible species may contain bitter elements. Others contain a milky juice.

==Growing conditions==


==Species==
*''[[../Lactuca biennis/]]'' : Tall Blue Lettuce, Wild Blue Lettuce
*''[[../Lactuca canadensis/]]'' : Canada Lettuce, Florida Blue Lettuce, Wild Lettuce (North America)

'''''Prunus''''' is a genus of trees and shrubs traditionally placed within the rose family, (Family Rosaceae), but now sometimes placed in its own family, the Prunaceae (or Amygdalaceae), or in a subfamily of Rosaceae, the Prunoideae (or Amygdaloideae). There are several hundred species of ''Prunus'', spread throughout the northern temperate regions of the globe. 

==Description==
The flowers are usually white to pink, with five petals and five sepals. They are borne singly, or in umbels of two to six or more on racemes. The fruit of all ''Prunus'' species is a drupe with a relatively large stone. Leaves are simple and usually lanceolate, unlobed and toothed along the margin.

==Subgenera==
Some treatments break the genus up into several different genera, but this segregation is not widely recognised other than at the subgeneric rank. 

*'''''Prunus'' subgenera:'''
**Subgenus ''Amygdalus'': almonds and peaches. Axillary buds in threes (vegetative bud central, two flower buds to sides). Flowers in early spring, sessile or nearly so, not on leafed shoots. Fruit with a grove along one side; stone deeply grooved. Type species ''Prunus dulcis'' (Almond).
**Subgenus ''Prunus'': plums and apricots. Axillary buds solitary. Flowers in early spring stalked, not on leafed shoots. Fruit with a grove along one side; stone rough. Type species ''Prunus domestica'' (Plum).
**Subgenus ''Cerasus'': cherries. Axillary buds single. Flowers in early spring in corymbs, long-stalked, not on leafed shoots. Fruit not groved; stone smooth. Type species ''Prunus cerasus'' (Sour cherry).
**Subgenus ''Lithocerasus'': dwarf cherries. Axillary buds in threes. Flowers in early spring in corymbs, long-stalked, not on leafed shoots. Fruit not groved; stone smooth. Type species ''Prunus pumila'' (Sand cherry).
**Subgenus ''Padus'': bird cherries. Axillary buds single. Flowers in late spring in racemes on leafy shoots, short-stalked. Fruit not groved; stone smooth. Type species ''Prunus padus'' (European bird cherry).
**Subgenus ''Laurocerasus'': cherry-laurels. Axillary buds single. Flowers in early spring in racemes, not on leafed shoots, short-stalked. Fruit not groved; stone smooth. Mostly evergreen (all the other subgenera are deciduous). Type species ''Prunus laurocerasus'' (European cherry-laurel).

==Uses==
The genus ''Prunus'' includes the almond, apricot, cherry, peach, and plum, all of which have cultivars developed for commercial fruit production. The edible part of the almond is the seed; the almond fruit is a drupe and not a &quot;nut&quot;. There are also a number of species, hybrids, and cultivars grown strictly as ornamentals, usually for their profusion of flowers, occasionally for leaves and bark. These ornamentals include the group that may be collectively called ''flowering cherries''.  

Because of their considerable value as both food and ornamental plants, many ''Prunus'' species have been introduced to parts of the world to which they are not native. Many of the Old World species are grown for ornament or fruit, and have been planted throughout the world; and some have become naturalised beyond their native range.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shouldn't the &quot;magic numbers&quot; (127, -32767, etc.) in this document be replaced with their constants from limits.h (SCHAR_MAX, SHRT_MIN, etc.)? --[[User:12.9.179.117|12.9.179.117]] 18:30, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

:Magic number should be avoided but we don't have a list of default values, the standard (2003) only mentions of reserved identifiers from the C library, personally I don't know if the values one expects them to represent are fixed (consider for instance http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/296az74e(VS.71).aspx it states that that list is Microsoft Specific).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:50, 17 September 2008 (UTC)    

== Less or More? ==

I have made a change to the Data Types table. The original text was: &quot;Any encoding of 8 bits or less (e.g. ASCII) can be used to store characters&quot;. I have changed it to read: &quot; Any encoding of 8 bits or more ...&quot;, since that is what the previous column in the table would suggest. Was the wording simply incorrect, or did I miss the point of that line? – '''[[User:E_James|&lt;font color=&quot;#D02000&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9000&quot;&gt;James&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &lt;small&gt;([[User_Talk:E_James|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; – &lt;small&gt;22:34, 16 September 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

:I've restored to the prev. edit, the intention expressed is that char is only guaranteed to have 8 bits (it may indeed hold more in specific setups, compiler and OS).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:32, 17 September 2008 (UTC)

====
There seems to be confusion over the two words char and character.
C++11 (Draft):
&quot;The fundamental storage unit in the C++ memory model is the byte. A byte is at least large enough to contain any member of the basic execution character set (2.3) and the eight-bit code units of the Unicode UTF-8 encoding form and is composed of a contiguous sequence of bits, the number of which is implementation defined. ...
The memory available to a C++ program consists of one or more sequences of contiguous bytes. Every byte has a unique address.&quot;  So a byte is 8 bits OR MORE and a char is one byte OR MORE. I am changing the table.  I am also removing &quot;sizeof&quot; it is a great idea to have it on this page, but not in the table. 
* {{C++ Programming/kw|sizeof}} gives the size in units of &lt;tt&gt;'''char'''&lt;/tt&gt;s. These &quot;[[w:Byte|bytes]]&quot; need not be 8-bit bytes (though commonly they are); the number of bits is given by the &lt;tt&gt;CHAR_BIT&lt;/tt&gt; macro in the &lt;tt&gt;climits&lt;/tt&gt; header.

[[File:Graphocephala_coccinea_6.jpg|thumb|Red-banded leafhopper ''Graphocephala coccinea'']]
'''Leafhopper''' is a common name applied to any species from the family '''Cicadellidae'''. Leafhoppers, also known as '''hoppers''', are minute plant-feeding insects in the superfamily '''Cicadelloidea''' in the homopterous division of the order Hemiptera. Recent classification within the Hemiptera has changed the old term 'Homoptera' into two new suborders: Sternorryncha (aphids, whiteflies, scales, psyllids...) and Auchenorryncha (cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers...) with the suborder: Heteroptera containing a large group of insects known as the 'true-bugs', (gnat bugs, pond skaters, shore bugs, toad bugs, water boatmen, backswimmers, etc...)

Leafhoppers are found all over the world, and it is the second largest family in the Hemiptera; there are at least 20,000 described species. Leafhoppers have piercing sucking mouthparts, they feed on plant sap and can transmit plant-infecting viruses and bacteria. Species that are significant agricultural pests include the potato leafhopper, beet leafhopper, white apple leafhopper, two-spotted leafhopper, and glassy-winged sharpshooter. A Leafhoppers' diet commonly consists of plant sap from a wide and diverse range of plants. Leafhoppers mainly consume vegetation but have been known to indulge in small insects.

==Description==
The Cicadellidae combine the following features:
*thickened part of the antennae very short and ending with a bristle (arista)
*two simple eyes (ocelli) present on the top or front of the head
*3 segments on the tarsi
*front femora with at most weak spines
*hind tibia with one or more distinct keels, with a row of movable spines on each, sometimes on enlarged bases
*base of middle legs close together where they originate under the thorax
*front wings not particularly thickened.  An additional, unique character of leafhoppers is the production of brochosomes which are thought to protect egg masses from predation and pathogens.  Leafhoppers are susceptible to various pathogens; viruses as in the(''Dicistroviridae''), bacteria, fungi, as well as having a host of parasitoids which attack the eggs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objective C files ==

In objective C, files normally use either the extension &lt;code&gt;.h&lt;/code&gt; for interface files, or the extension &lt;code&gt;.m&lt;/code&gt; for implementation files.

These objective C files are text files that contain instructions on how to write a program.  For example, this is a minimal hello world program
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
#import &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main (void)
{
	printf (&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The #import &lt;stdio.h&gt; is a preprocessor directive that will cause the compiler to import the contents of the file stdio.h, just as if it was in the file.
A C programmer may immediately see a slight difference in this directive, which is that C  uses the #include directive instead.  Objective-C programmers usually use the #import directive, which includes the specified header file but, unlike #include, #import is only done once.

== Apple's XCode IDE ==

Objective-C is most commonly used to develop software for the Apple products Mac OS X and iOS (iPodTouch, iPhone, iPad-Mini, and iPad).   It's also used in the GNUStep environment on Linux.  If you're developing on a Mac, you can use Apple's nice graphical user interface (GUI) called XCode, which is free.

There is documentation , but don't expect a python tutorial. There is a tutorial on ios programming for instance, that half is for learning how to use the IDE, and half to make a simple phone app that reads from a input field, and outputs a message in a label when a button is pressed. 

The basic steps for the IOS tutorial are:
# create a project from the main menu bar, select the project type single view and controller.
# Make sure the project summary in the left top of the project page says compiling to a phone simulator, if the UI being designed is on a phone.
# Open the main storyboard file the device (phone) you are working on, and use drag-and-drop to design a form.
# using the buttons on the top left, switch to assistant editor, and put the storyboard in one pane and a source view of the interface file for generated view controller.
# graphically make connections between the storyboard objects ( fields, buttons ) and interface file, by pressing control and dragging from the user interface design page to source code of the interface file. 
# On control dragging graphical elements to the interface file of the view controller, there will be prompts showing choices. The easy common case is to make them &quot;outlets&quot; which give reference to the readable or writeable graphical elements on the user interface designer; for button elements,  create an action connection and fill in the method name. The actions for button is usually where code needs to start. 
# There is also a concept called delegate, and in this example, the delegate is for giving up focus when the return key is pressed on the keyboard during entry for the text field entry widget (UITextField).  A delegate is just a handler that can implement one or more methods from  a set of method signatures defined as a protocol , in this case , UITextFieldDelegate protocol.  The delegate method called when the return button is pressed  is not &quot;returnButtonPressed&quot;, but &quot;textFieldShouldReturn&quot;, and this will be found in the protocol documentation.. Inside the textFieldShouldReturn, the textField's &quot;resignFirstResponder&quot; method should be called to allow the keyboard to hide, as a response to the return button being pressed.
# the tutorial implements the action button's action of copying the entry text to the label with a few unnecessary but illustrative steps . e.g. copying the textfield's text NSString property to your view controller's NSString property , which was created as an exercise; then creating a local scope NSString variable using alloc and &quot;initWithFormat&quot;  so that the name typed in the textfield is concatenated with a hello message. Then assigning the local NSString variable to the label's text property, which has an elided alloc-initCopy semantic.  Shorter, but equal , is  &quot; self.label.text = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@&quot;Hello %s!&quot;, self.textField.text] ;&quot;

After this, more complicated learning examples could be attempted e.g. 
====== example 1 ======
* make a calculator, where the formula is entered in the textField and the formula is parsed and the result returned in the label.
&lt;small&gt; - this can be done by creating a parser-lexer class that has the responsibility of top-down parsing with a 1 character lookahead into a given string. The parser has a recursive grammar, and methods can represent non-terminal symbols in the grammar, with a lexer method used for converting a terminal string of characters to a number.  If the initial symbol of a valid calculation is 'L',
then L -&gt; E , is the initial line of the grammar, represented by a call to the a method E  (  e.g. [ self  E ];  ).  An expression is made of one or more terms separated by + or - , and can be expressed recursively as
 E -&gt; T |   T + E | T - E
So E  can be one of 3 cases, '''T ''' , or '''T + E'''  if the symbol after '''T''' is '''+''',  or  '''T - E''' , if the symbol after '''T''' is '''-'''.  A start for the E method , could be:-
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
-(void) E {
  [self T];
  char ch = [self lookahead];
  if (  ch == '+' ) {
     [self nextchar];
     [self E];
     [self plus];
  } else if ( ch == '-') {
     [self next char];
     [self E];
     [self minus];
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The reason 'plus' and 'minus' are called at the end is that normal arithmetic grammar can be converted to reverse polish notation , where operands can be loaded onto
a stack , and operations operate on the 2 last operands pushed onto the stack, and an alternative implementation could be to translate a given input string from normal notation to a string
in reverse polish notation , which is then traversed to push/pop/operate in order. Otherwise, in this implementation , 'plus' might look like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// stack is a NSMutableArray* initialised in -(id)init
-(void) plus {
  NSDecimalNumber* n2 = [stack  lastObject];
  [stack deleteLastObject];
  NSDecimalNumber* n1 = [stack  lastObject];
  [stack deleteLastObject];
  NSDecimalNumber *res = [[NSDecimalNumber alloc] initWithDouble: ( [n1 doubleValue] + [n2 doubleValue] ) ];
  [stack addObject:res];
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Another implementation of plus, is there is a second instance of a mutableArray that stores NSString tokens , and 'plus' simple pushes a '+' NSString token onto this second array.
When parsing is complete, this array is traversed , and a third mutable array is used to process each token in order, pushing number tokens, and popping numbers for operations and pushing results.

A third implementation could eliminate the use of a stack by having operations return numbers which are the result of applying operations or converting a number lexeme. This relies on the program stack to use recursion not only to provide the ordering for the grammar rules , but to do depth first processing so that intermediate results are  stored on the stack in the callers' program stack frames.
e.g. if the function expr is returning  [self term] + [self term] ,  the first term call's return value is being held in a register and pushed on the cpu stack before the second call to term .

The rest of the grammar is something like 
#a term is a factor  , a factor multiplied by a term, or a factor divided by a term, and 
#a factor is a parenthesised expression or a entity , and 
#the only current entity is a constant. 
The constant is a parse of a lexeme which consists of (whitespace ignored) initial + or - , a string of numbers and/or decimal point occurring once.  An exercise is to write out the grammar, and then devise the other methods of the grammar, as well as the constant tokenizer.
*division doesn't work as expected if '''T -&gt; F | F * T |  F / T''', since the T after * or / will recurse until T -&gt; F, and then the operation evaluates from the last F back, so 3/3/3 = .333  would be 3/(3/3) = 3 which is not correct. The solution is to reimplement the grammar to eliminate the right sided evaluation. T is always F followed by * T , / T, or nothing, and this can be called T' or Tdash , so ''' T -&gt; F T' ''', and ''' T'    -&gt; * F T' ''' | '''/ F T' ''' | '''e '''.  The ideas is to move the terminating parse F to the left by wrapping the optional recursive part after the first F with a third symbol T' which always is optionally  'e' or an empty parse.  This technique also helps for solving some ambiguity in grammars, such as if-then-statement-(optional)-else-statement -or- if-then-statement-(optional)-else...
*a parsing bug exists if the expression grammar rule isn't likewise made left-wise resolving.
Once the parser implementation is tested to work on test cases, the action button implementation for the &quot;hello world&quot; app can create a parser to parse the textField's text and output the resulting final number as the label's text, giving a calculator.  Other widgets , like a UISegmentedControl can later be used to implement calculator buttons.
&lt;/small&gt;

====== example 2 ======
* have 2 more textFields , and make the button action sending email to an address with a subject and body ;

== GCC Command-Line Tools==

If you're developing for platforms other than the Mac, you can use GCC from the command-line.  GCC is a collection of various GNU compilers. GCC has an Objective-C package which works from the command-line.  If GCC is installed properly, you should be able to link against the objective-C runtime library; otherwise, you will have to consult your package system.

To build programs under GCC, you need to specify at least one input file and link your program against the Objective-C library:

&lt;pre&gt;
gcc hello.m -lobjc
&lt;/pre&gt;

You might want to use additional flags to let the compiler point out common mistakes and suppress warnings about the &lt;code&gt;#import&lt;/code&gt; keyword:

&lt;pre&gt;
gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -Wno-import -lobjc -o hello hello.m
&lt;/pre&gt;

Any additional files or libraries required for the program will need to be added to the command line.  In addition, gcc allows compiling Objective-C files into intermediate files, which can then be linked into an output binary: 

&lt;pre&gt;
gcc -c hello.m -o hello.o
gcc hello.o -o hello
&lt;/pre&gt;

To use the object-oriented features of objective-C, you need to place the following code at the top of the file:
&lt;pre&gt;
#import &lt;objc/Object.h&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Other compilers ==

In general, the compiler name used is &lt;code&gt;objc&lt;/code&gt; unless specified otherwise by your compiler.  

In a general case, you need to have the following at the top to support objects:
&lt;pre&gt;
#import &lt;Object.h&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''''Tetranychus urticae''''' (an animal with over 60 common names, including ''red spider mite'' and ''two-spotted spider mite'') is one of many species of plant-feeding mites found in dry environments, and generally considered a pest. It is the most widely known member of the family Tetranychidae or Spider mites.

==Description==
During the summer, ''T. urticae'' has a greenish brown appearance with two darker spots, but as winter approaches it gains a strong red color. Some populations are pemanently greenish or reddish, and these are considered different species of ''Tetranychus'' by some authorities. 

==Symptoms and Signs==
'''''Tetranychus urticae''''' is extremely small, barely visible with the naked eye as reddish or greenish spots on leaves and stems; the adults measure about 0.5 mm. The red spider mite, which can be seen in greenhouses and tropical and temperate zones spinning a fine web on and under leaves. The red spider mite is extremely polyphagous; it can feed on hundreds of plants, including most vegetables and food crops (peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, beans, corn, strawberries) and ornamentals: roses, etc. It lays its eggs on the leaves, and it poses a threat to host plants by sucking cell contents from the leaves cell by cell, leaving very tiny, pale spots or scars where the green epidermal cells have been destroyed. Although the individual lesions are very small, commensurate with the small size of the mites, the frequently-observed attack of hundreds or thousands of spider mites can cause thousands of lesions and thus can significantly reduce the photosynthetic capability of plants, greatly reducing their production of nutrients, sometimes even killing the plants. Although this way of feeding could spread plant viruses, this is considered of secondary importance.

[[Image:Phingredients in Ho Chi Min City.jpg|thumb|260px|Typical garnishes for ''phở'', ''Saigon-Style'': [[culantro]], basil, lime, bean sprouts]]

Along with [[Cookbook:Phở gà|phở gà]], '''phở bò''' could easily be called Vietnam's national dish. Most often served in the early morning, it is available on any street corner, everywhere in Vietnam, all day, and is a staple of most Vietnamese restaurants outside of the country. The broth is the star of this meal and can vary from North to South and is in some cases a closely guarded family secret. Experimenting with the ingredients is a must as long as they are traditionally South-East Asian in origin.

==Ingredients==
;For broth:
* 2 large white [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] - chopped into quarters
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable]] or [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]]
* 5 lbs of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] bones (choose ones with a bit of meat on them)
* 1 small knob of [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] - chopped
* 2 medium [[Cookbook:Daikon|daikon]] (white radish) - chopped into quarters
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon stick]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] pods - whole
* 4 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]] - whole
* 1 [[Cookbook:Star Anise|Star Anise]]
* 1 tablespoon whole black [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorn]]


;For serving:
* Phở noodles (broad rice noodle) - soaked in hot water until soft and drained
* Finely sliced white onion
* Finely sliced [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallions]]
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaf]]
* Finely sliced beef sirloin (ask your butcher)

'''Note:''' Traditionally, the Vietnamese prefer fatty meat in their soup. Some other serving ingredients include beef tendon, beef shank, [[Cookbook:Tripe|beef tripe]] and meatballs.

;Condiments:
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Chili peppers]] - whole
* [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|Bean sprouts]]
* [[Cookbook:Lime|Limes]] - cut into wedges
* [[Cookbook:Basil|Thai Basil]]
* [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|Nước mắm]]
* [[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|Hot sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Hoisin Sauce|Hoisin sauce]]
* Black pepper

==Procedure==

# Fry onions in oil until lightly browned. Remove and drain. Rinse the beef bones, place in a stockpot, cover with cold water, and bring slowly to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes. For a clear broth skim off foam.
# After this initial cooking, add cooked onions, ginger, carrots, cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, cloves, garlic and peppercorns. Bring to a boil again and gently simmer the stock, partially covered, for a minimum of 6 hours but up to 12 hours if you can, skimming regularly. If necessary, add more water to keep the bones covered.
# Strain stock to remove the vegetable and spices and discard them. Return the broth to the stove to keep it boiling hot.

==Preparing==
In a large soup bowl, place a handful of cooled Phở noodles, top with thinly sliced raw beef, and ladle on generous amounts of steaming hot broth, which will cook the raw beef. Garnish with sliced onions, scallions and coriander, and serve immediately.

==Serving==
Place condiments on a large serving plate. It's not necessary to add any of the condiments to the soup, but adding a few basil leaves, a squeeze of lime, and some bean sprouts, is customary.

Many Vietnamese will also take small bites of very hot chili peppers while eating the soup to spice up the meal. Proceed with caution!

The fish sauce, hot sauce, and hoisin sauce, can either be added directly into the soup or placed in a small bowl for dipping the meat and noodles.

Enjoy!

'''''Solanum''''' is a large, variable genus of annual plants and perennial plants, forbs, vines, sub-shrubs, shrubs, and small trees. They often have attractive fruit and flowers. Most are poisonous, but many bear edible fruits, leaves, or tubers, and the genus includes several cultivated species, including three major food crops: Tomatoes, Potatoes, and Eggplants.

==Description==
Annual, perennial, or tropical herbs or vines with alternate leaves and a watery sap. The flowers are in cymes or solitary, perfect, showy, 4-5 parted, with thick yellow anthers. Fruits are fleshy berries. Most species have a distinctive scent common to the genus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Public Affairs Writing:
== Definition ==

Public affairs writing is the term used for publications written with the purpose of expressing comments, ideas or concerns to a target audience.  It is also used simply as a source of informing. Some common forms of public affairs writing include letters to the editor, letters to your congressman, or the more recent genre of e-mails and blogs.  The content is usually opinion driven with the purpose of informing or persuading the audience.



== Importance of Public Affairs Writing ==

What kind of government would we have if our citizens didn't get involved? If you are reading this, there's a good chance you have the intention of improving your writing, and therefore yourself.  You are probably also aware of your political, educational and economic circumstances.  Chances are you've also got your own opinions of them.  Public affairs writing can be used constructively on a personal or public level to share your thoughts and experiences to a broad range of audiences.  It's important to become involved on a civil level with your community and peers.  What would you write a letter to your congressman about?  What would you say to the editor of that last newspaper article you read?  Learning the correct forms of public affairs writing can give you the tools you need to make a difference in the public arena.

== Examples of Public Affairs Writing ==

Editorial or Op-Ed:  An editorial or op-ed is an opinion piece that is typically found in newspapers, magazines, journals, newsletters, or other types of periodical publications.  A writer will select a controversial, generally topical or relevant issue and then compose a persuasive piece in which they express their beliefs about the issue. Usually editorials are written by professional writers, but sometimes a magazine or newspaper will publish editorials by “regular people”—even college students, for that matter.

Letter to the Editor: Nearly all periodical publications—newspapers, magazines, online publications—offer the opportunity for the public to interact with the ideas expressed in the publication, allowing their own voices to be heard.  The forum for this exchange of information is generally called the “Letters to the Editor” section.  The format for these writing samples is similar to ordinary letters that you would perhaps send to a friend or a relative, except the style is usually more formal, the writing more polished, the tone is generally persuasive, and the content involves a reaction to something printed in the publication.  Sometimes a letter to the editor is simply a congratulations on a job well done for a particular article or feature.  Other times (more frequently) the letter writer takes issue with something printed.

Letter to a Policy Maker (i.e. Congressman, Governor, etc...): A significant part of being an active member of your community is taking an interest in public policy.  After all, public policy affects ''everyone''.  Thus, it is important to make your voice be heard (an opportunity we all have in our democratic society), and writing to the public officials who directly contribute to the intricacies of daily life is one significant method in achieving this goal.  

Proposal: A proposal is a stated plan of action or suggested solution to a problem. Proposals are common in the business world and politics.  Examples would include a proposal for a to counter negative employment trends or to improve student performance in education. 

Flyer/Brochure/Pamphlet/Advertisement: These are all examples of materials distributed to the public in the hopes of influencing public opinion.  These materials often try to appeal to emotion and they tend to include an emphasis on visual literacy. 

Internet Journal/Weblog: Welcome to the Information Age! These days the Internet and electronic media are far more prevalent in our society than print material.  If you really have an interest in social issues that affect the public, and you want a large audience to read and respond to your ideas, then a weblog or &quot;blog&quot; is the way to go.

==Writing an Editorial: A Journey Through the Writing Process==

The following is a sample writing process that details a student's writing process for writing an editorial.  The assignment states to write a 2-3 page editorial about a controversial issue that interests her.  

1.  Inventing:  

A. The first step is to come up with ideas for the editorial.  The student (let's call her Mary) begins by brainstorming a   list of topics that she considers interesting.  She lists such various topics as educational issues, birth control rights, and environmental problems.  After briefly considering each issue separately, she decides on education, a topic that interests her a great deal.

B.  Next, Mary realizes that she will have to narrow her topic down.  After all education is a huge topic that includes any number of controversial issues.  Once again she brainstorms a list of topics: teacher salaries, standardized testing, student uniforms. Mary considers the scope of her assignment-the page length is 2-3 pages, and she understands that some issues are probably to complex to sufficiently tackle in such a short amount. She decides to write about school uniforms.

C.  Finally, before drafting Mary realizes that she will need to have a preliminary thesis in order to begin.  After all, the thesis is the main point of a paper, so she needs to have a goal for her paper.  Mary decides that she will argue that school uniforms will be beneficial to student performance.

2.  Drafting:

A.  Next Mary begins the process of drafting, or actually writing, her paper.  She begins with an introduction that incorporates her personal experience of attending a high school that did not require uniforms.  She briefly details her high school experience as being problematic: poor student behavior, low grades, a surprising high dropout rate.

B.  Mary then focuses on her body in which she discusses the possible benefits of school uniforms: more discipline, less focus on materialism and superficial appearances, a more responsible student outlook.

C.  Finally, Mary drafts a conclusion in which she reiterates her main thesis and ends by calling her audience to action.

3.  Revising:

A.  After writing a complete first draft, Mary goes back and considers her paper.  She decides that while some personal experience is okay, she has used too much personal narrative and she eliminates some of it. Then she decides to tighten her argument and add more examples of evidence.

B.  Then, Mary decides to improve her thesis statement by qualifying it slightly.  She writes that school uniforms may improve student performance if integrated into problem schools.

4. Editing:

A.  Finally, Mary turns her attention to editing.  She reads through everything, catches a few grammatical errors and changes some words in order to clarify her meaning.

B.  At last, the assignment is complete.

== Writing a Letter to the Editor ==

If a local issue is weighing heavily on your mind, a letter to the editor can serve as a means to make your voice heard. The following are examples of issues that may prompt a letter to the editor:

*Local school issues (bond issues, board of education decisions, etc.)

*Local electoral races

*Environmental issues

*A public &quot;thank you&quot;

When writing your letter, think about your audience and reasons one may have to disagree with your opinion. In considering those opinions, address the anticipated disagreements in your letter. Consider what points would make a convincing case, and build your letter to support these points.

===Letter to the Editor Exercise===

Choose an issue which affects you at the local level. Determine what stance you will take on the issue. Organize your thoughts clearly and concisely. Do not make personal attacks; they make you seem small and petty, and may, in fact, negate your position.

== Writing to a Policy Maker ==




Be brief. Limit your letter to one page if possible, but no more than two pages. Get to the point. Address one issue if possible but never more than two different issues. You can add an attachment to your letter that contains more detail if you wish. 

Make no demands. But give the member of congress and staff a recommended course of action to support. Never condemn, threaten or inject partisan politics into your letter. Doing so can only undermine your credibility. Keep your eye on the ball and stick to the points you want to make.
 
All politics is local. Remember to make the link to your member’s district or state. Stress the contributions that your institution can make and the benefits the community and country receives from supporting biomedical research. 

Timing matters. A letter arriving by mail or fax after the House or Senate has taken action is meaningless. Get your facts right and make certain your letter is considered in time. 

Use caution with e-mail. While many offices are increasingly relying on e-mail for constituent contact, surveys show it is not as effective as a typewritten letter. Members receive a great deal of e-mail from non-constituents, which are dismissed. E-mail correspondence also tends to be written in a faster and more informal style than letters, increasing errors in grammar and syntax and making your message unclear.

=== Composing Your Letter ===

*Know what your purpose is and make it clear early in the letter.

*Collect all the information you will need for your letter and jot down the basic order in which you plan to cover this information. Organize your material in the most persuasive order.

*Keep your reader in mind as you write. Select a tone for your letter which is appropriate for the reader. Always be courteous and use positive rather than negative words.

*Avoid the use of words and phrases which are stiff, technical, or overused. Use a writing style which is natural and easy to read.

*Read your first draft out loud to test it for overall &quot;sound&quot; and effectiveness. Be sure your letter states clearly what it is you want your reader to know after he or she reads your letter. 

*Follow the correct form for the kind of letter you are writing and use that form throughout your letter.

*Make sure your final copy is typed or written neatly and is attractive in appearance. 

*Revise and proofread your letter the same way you would any other piece of writing. Look for errors in sentence structure, usage, punctuation, spelling, and capitalization.



== Resources ==


If you are ready to become politically involved but are unsure of who to contact or where here are some resources you can use.

--To find your local congressman or state senators you could go to a major search engine (such as yahoo) and type in the city, county or state which you are targeting and the word &quot;government&quot; or try www.congress.org

--To write a letter to the editor or an opinion piece in your local newspaper, check the publication you are writing to. They will each usually have their own specific instructions.

--To submit a piece to a magazine, it is important to be familiar with the publication. You need to be sure you are addressing your target audience.  Instructions for submission are usually found within the magazine itself.  Be sure to include a brief description of yourself on a separate paper. 

--One resource of influence that is not often thought of in our high-tech society is that of local bulletin boards.  We've all seen these at local businesses and government offices, usually those old-fashioned cork boards.  Why not use them? You can get your point or idea across to many people quite cheaply if you utilize these free advertising spaces.  Once you have your flyer or pamphlet ready don't be shy!  Use those public notification spaces. This is especially applicable to government related issues.



== Practice Assignment ==

Let's get a good feel for becoming involved with this assignment-to complete a letter to your local congressman.  Follow the suggested steps below to create a letter of your own.


1.  First, identify an issue in the current news that has some impact or influence on your life.  Also, your teacher may assign a current topic to you. 
 
2. Second, make an outline of your personal ideas on the subject.  You may ask questions like:
Do I agree with the current actions or issues?  How does this affect me or my family?  What can be done to improve the situation?  Or, you could consider how to thank your representative for a job well done. 

3. Follow the outline in the Public Affairs Writing section entitled Formats for your letter.

4. Write your letter!

5. Proofread or revise as necessary.  You may workshop these letters in class and focus on issues such as; Is the point clearly stated?  Is the wording polite and courteous?  Is it an effective argument or could it use some clarification?

6. Send your letters in the mail!   This assignment is pointless unless you truly feel that your voice will be heard.  Take that final step of dropping it in the mail and know that your hard work will be recognized not only by your instructor, but also by your political representation.  Good job!


Example: There are different format ideals for different types of public affairs writing. A letter to your state congressman would be a good format to learn for the public affairs arena . It should look something like this:



The Honorable (Full Name here)

US House of Representatives

Washington, DC 20515

Dear Representative (Last name here),




This is where you put the content of your letter. It's a good idea to begin with your name and city of residence. Be sure the purpose of your letter is addressed in this first paragraph. Be polite and to the point.  Remember to use an appropriate tone for a political representative (you're not talking to your classmate).


Keep the letter one page or less and only address one issue per letter. You only have one chance here to be heard so be sure not to ramble.  Use specific real-life examples related to your issue, if possible. 

In conclusion be sure to thank your congressman for their time.


Sincerely, Your constituent (your name here)

==Another Practice Assignment==

The Internet Assignment: The Discussion Board

Due to the rapidly expanding use of technology in our society, many instructors are beginning to incorporate technology into the writing class.  One common practice is the use of the Internet discussion board in order to stimulate class discussion in an environment that is outside the classroom.  Some students actually feel more comfortable with virtual discussion than regular discussion because they have the chance to express their ideas using an assumed name--thus, they have the freedom of anonymity. Other students who have problems with speaking up in class due to shyness or insecurities have the ability to gather their thoughts before they release them into the public.

The Discussion Board assignment is designed to get students to think about important issues and to express their ideas in an environment where they will get responses to their writing.  

Assignment: Let's practice using this medium.  Pretend that your instructor has created a discussion board. (Or perhaps he or she actually has.) The discussion board instructs the class to debate whether or not technology has had a positive effect on society as a whole.  
How would you respond? 
What aspects of the question should you explore?
How would you support your argument?

What makes for effective online discussion?
Effective online discussion involves a thoughtful and mature discussion of the question in which each party contributes something worthwhile and bounces ideas off each other.  You should be prepared to have other people disagree with you.  You should also be prepared to support your own opinions and to not take anything personally.

Rules of Online Discussion:

-Do not take disagreements personally and do not respond to arguments that you disagree with by attacking the person who made them. Do not respond to personal attacks.  Keep the discussion on topic.

-Stay focused on the question.  Avoid getting off track by asking personal questions or bringing up irrelevant topics.

-Keep your language friendly and appropriate.  Avoid profanity, derogatory language, and sexist, racist, or homophobic remarks.

-Do not type your responses in all capital letters.  This gives the impression that you are shouting and it is considered rude.

-Keep emoticons such as the smiley face :) to a minimum.  One or two is okay, but if you use them constantly then you will appear very unprofessional, and people may not take you seriously.

-Try to use proper spelling and grammar.  A few abbreviations are okay, but if you use too many, then other people may become confused and not understand what you are saying.  The discussion board should be more formal than an Internet chat with friends.

      <text xml:space="preserve">During the early ages of the universe, the universe was very homogeneous and the only structure present was small fluctuations in the density of the primordial gas cloud. This gas cloud, primarily made up of hydrogen and helium, was formed in the first billion years after the big bang during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recombination recombination]. Small fluctuations in the primordial gas cloud are observed in the cosmic microwave background, homogeneous to one part in one hundred thousand, which is an indication of the density distribution of the universe after recombination. Areas with slightly higher density had enough gravitational attraction to overcome expansion of the universe and collapsed into the first protogalaxies.

Over time, areas of higher density began to collapse due to gravitational attraction and formed the first [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protogalaxies protogalaxies]. The first protogalaxies were formed when the universe was approximately 1 billion years old. Though these initial protogalaxies are too young to have formed stars, they emit infrared [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radiation radiation] as gas falls inward and heats due to collisions. Protogalaxies are theoretically observable due to this emission, but they are very dim and far away (approximately 12 billion light years) since they are the earliest structure to be formed after the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang big bang]. Due to these difficulties, protogalaxies have never been observed. 

As protogalaxies collapse on themselves, they begin to form a distinct [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/core core] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halo halo] much like mature galaxies. Particles near the edge of the protogalaxy can lose energy through collisions with the surrounding gas and fall into the core. It has been speculated that the infalling matter forms unstable stars of around 100 solar masses that rapidly collapse into black holes that have been observed at the center of mature galaxies [1]. As matter falls into the black hole throughout the life of the galaxy, it releases large amounts of energy which have been observed as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quasars quasars] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_galaxies radio galaxies]. 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter Dark matter] present in the protogalaxy has a weaker interaction with surrounding particles. The dark matter present in the protogalaxy remains in the halo while ordinary matter falls into the core, since the primary mechanism for bringing matter into the core is collisions with surrounding gas. Dark matter, due to its weak interaction, has very few collisions and remains gravitationally bound in the halo. 

== Star Formation and Death ==


As gas continues to fall inward towards the core of a protogalaxy, its density continues to increase and dense clouds begin to form. These clouds begin to orbit the center of mass of the protogalaxy due to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservation_of_angular_momentum conservation of angular momentum]. When two gas clouds collide, they form an area of higher density at the collision front. These high density regions become gravitationally unstable and collapse into balls of plasma, forming [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protostars protostars]. As material continues to rain in on the protostar, deuterium fusion begins and a star is born. As these stars begin to burn and emit light, they dissipate the surrounding cloud of gas due to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_wind solar wind] and leave a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/star_cluster star cluster]. These initial areas of star formation may be the source of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/globular_clusters globular clusters], some of which have stars which are nearly as old as the age of the universe.

These newly formed stars form the first heavy elements of the new galaxy in their cores as they burn their hydrogen supply. Hydrogen is converted to heavier elements through [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_fusion nuclear fusion] until the star has formed a critical mass of iron. Iron is very stable and heavier elements do not release heat from fusion, and the star begins to exhaust its fuel supply. Without a heat source, the star undergoes a catastrophic collapse under its own weight, which ends in a supernova. 

As they reach the end of their life, the most massive of these stars explode in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supernovae supernovae], the explosion from which may outshine the rest of its parent galaxy. As the star explodes, it forms heavy elements (heavier than oxygen) by the process of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_fusion nuclear fusion]. These heavy elements are ejected from the exploding star into the galactic gas cloud. Supernovae are responsible for heavy element formation and distribution through the newly formed galaxy, which previously only contained hydrogen and helium formed during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recombination recombination].

== Elliptical vs. Spiral Galaxies ==

A new galaxy will most likely form into either an elliptical or spiral [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galaxy galaxy], though other types of galaxies are present (such as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ring ring] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenticular lenticular] galaxy.) The type of galaxy formed depends on the initial rate of star production. If the new galaxy forms stars slowly, then the gas cloud has enough time to exchange energy through collisions and the cloud elongates into a flat disk-shaped spiral as matter falls in to the plane of rotation. If the galaxy forms stars quickly, it can use up its supply of gas before sufficient energy has been exchanged to form a disk. These galaxies resemble their initial elliptical shape before star formation. Other theories speculate that elliptical galaxies are formed from collisions of other spiral galaxies, which distort into the elliptical shape after collision. [3]

Due to their high rate of star production, elliptical galaxies quickly exhaust their gas supply and no longer have active star formation. As such, elliptical galaxies mainly consist of old [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_II Population II] stars with large numbers of globular clusters. Elliptical galaxies also do not show the characteristic ordered rotation of spiral galaxies since they did not have time to exchange sufficient energy during their formation. 

Spiral galaxies, which form stars more slowly, still have ongoing star formation today and as such their star population is much younger. Since spiral galaxies take a long time to form, they exchange considerable energy over their lifetime which collapses matter into a disk with high angular momentum, resulting in the characteristic rotating disk.

== Large Scale Interactions ==



Much like gas clouds in protogalaxies that can interact to form new star clusters, entire galaxies can collide to form new galaxies. As galaxies pass near each other, they can begin to orbit. If the galaxies pass close enough to each other, tidal interactions will cause their orbits to decay and the galaxies consume each other. The shape of the galaxies may be highly distorted during the collision and star formation increases, powering [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/starburst_galaxies starburst galaxies] which are among the most luminous galaxies. This period of increased star formation can last for ten million years or more and the rate of star formation can be ten to one hundred times that of a typical galaxy [3]. The black hole at the center of the galaxy will also show increased emission as material from the collision falls into the galaxy's core. 

If galaxies pass near each other but do not fully collide, they can eject large quantities of matter from gravitational interaction, sending gas clouds and lone stars into intergalactic space. These near-collisions also distort the galaxies involved and is one possible mechanism for the formation of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenticular_galaxies lenticular galaxies]. 

Though large scale interactions were previously thought to be uncommon, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way Milky Way] was found to have several smaller galaxies orbiting it which suggests that the process is more common. The Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy (or SagDEG) is a small dwarf galaxy orbiting the core of the Milky Way at a radius of about 50,000 light years. The SagDEG is currently passing through the disc of the Milky Way and has been greatly distorted due to gravitational interaction. The small and large Magellanic clouds are also dwarf galaxies which will eventually merge with the Milky Way.

'''''Magnolia''''' is a large genus of about 210&lt;ref&gt;The number of species in the genus ''Magnolia'' depends on the taxonomic view that one takes up. Recent molecular and morphological research shows that former genera ''Talauma'', ''Dugandiodendron'', ''Manglietia'', ''Michelia'', ''Elmerrillia'', ''Kmeria'', ''Parakmeria'', ''Pachylarnax'' (and a small number of monospecific genera) all belong within the same genus, ''Magnolia'' s.l. (s.l. = ''sensu lato'': 'in a broad sense', as opposed to s.s. = ''sensu stricto'': 'in a narrow sense'). The genus ''Magnolia'' s.s. contains about 120 species.&lt;/ref&gt; flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae.

The natural range of ''Magnolia'' species is rather scattered. It includes eastern North America, Central America and the West Indies and east and southeast Asia. Some species are found in South America. Today many species of ''Magnolia'' and an ever increasing number of hybrids can also be found as ornamental trees in large parts of North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The genus is named after Pierre Magnol, a botanist from Montpellier in France.

''Magnolia'' is an ancient genus. Having evolved before bees appeared, the flowers developed to encourage pollination by beetles. As a result, the carpels of ''Magnolia'' flowers are tough, to avoid damage by eating and crawling beetles. Fossilised specimens of ''M. acuminata'' have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae dating back to 95 million years ago. Another primitive aspect of Magnolias is their lack of distinct sepals or petals. The term tepal has been coined to refer to the intermediate element that ''Magnolia'' has instead.  

==Description==
Magnolias are trees or shrubs, generally with smooth gray bark and suckering freely. The flowers are large, showy, ranging from yellow to white through red and purple. Leaves are simple, often quite large.

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Species==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
In general, ''Magnolia'' is a genus which has attracted a lot of horticultural interest. Hybridisation has been immensely successful in combining the best aspects of different species to give plants which flower at an earlier age than the species themselves, as well as having more impressive flowers. One of the most popular garden magnolias is a hybrid, ''[[../Magnolia x soulangeana/]]'' (Saucer magnolia; a hybrid of ''M. liliiflora'' x ''M. denudata'').

The bark from ''M. officinalis'' has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as ''houpu''. In Japan, ''M. obovata'' has been used in a similar manner. The aromatic bark contains magnolol and honokiol, two polyphenolic compounds that have demonstrated anti-anxiety and anti-angiogenic properties. Magnolia bark also has been shown to reduce allergic and asthmatic reactions.

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

| [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]] 

==Ingredients==

* 5 [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg whites]], at room temperature
* [[Cookbook:Pinch|Pinch]] of [[cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] plus 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], divided
* ⅛ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] fresh [[Cookbook:Raspberry|raspberries]]
* 1 tablespoon toasted hazelnut oil
* 1⅓ cups [[Cookbook:Creme Anglaise|hazelnut creme anglaise]], chilled

==Procedure==

# Heat the [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|200°F (90ºC)]].
# In the bowl of a [[Cookbook:Mixer|standing mixer]] or with a hand-held mixer, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on high speed until soft peaks form, about 1 minute.
# Reduce mixer speed to low and add 1 cup sugar in a steady stream; continue whipping until stiff and glossy, about 4 minutes.
# Whip in cinnamon.
# Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip with the meringue.
# Onto a [[Cookbook:Silpat|Silpat]] or oiled piece of parchment paper, pipe the mixture into rounds, starting in the center and moving outward in a spiral to form a 3-inch disk.
# Bake for 2 hours, until crisp but not browned.
# Cool on the Silpat or parchment, then carefully remove the meringues.
# Set aside, uncovered, on a wire rack in a cool, dry place.
# Increase oven temperature to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|350°F]].
# Toss raspberries with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and hazelnut oil.
# Mound the berries on a baking sheet lined with Silpat or parchment paper and roast them for about 5 minutes, until glistening and very fragrant, but not mushy.
# Remove from the oven.
# Pour ⅓ cup of chilled hazelnut creme anglaise into the middle of a soup plate.
# Place a cooled meringue in the center, then spoon one-fourth of the roasted raspberries on top of each meringue.
# Serve immediately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you don't want to use a computer for your composing, skip to the next chapter.

For this tutorial, you will need notation software, aka a Note Editor. A good point to start is free and open source [http://musescore.org/ MuseScore], which works on GNU/Linux, Mac and Windows, and has a built-in synthesizer, eliminating the need for setting up MIDI. There are also several alternatives for Linux.  For Windows, Coda Technology offers [http://www.finalemusic.com/notepad/ Finale Notepad] as a downloadable, ten dollar version of their commercial Finale notation software. Alternatives include [http://lilypond.org/web/ Lilypond], [http://icking-music-archive.org/software/indexmt6.html MusiXTeX] and various [http://www.walshaw.plus.com/abc/software.html abc notation programs]

There's a free music workstation called Frinika that features piano roll, score, and tracker interface as well. It's opensource and written in Java. You can run it without installation through Java Webstart.

(If you are using windows but don't want to pay money, try downloading Ubuntu at http://www.ubuntu.com.  If you don't want to put it as a permanent operating system, then you can use VMWare to make a Virtual PC.)

For this tutorial, we will be using NoteEdit.  To download it on Ubuntu, go to Application -&gt; Add/Remove.  From there make sure 3rd party programs are enabled, then do a search for NoteEdit.  Check it, and press OK.

If you aren't hearing any sound, download EasyUbuntu, http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/, MAKE SURE YOU CHECK MIDI!!!, then type this into the terminal.

&lt;code&gt;timidity -iA -B2,8 -Os -EFreverb=0 &gt; /dev/null &amp;&lt;/code&gt;

This command only needs to be typed in once, but will have to be redone every time you restart Ubuntu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Components are complex Movie Clips with restrictions that you are able
to define during the authoring process.  Basically, they are a
container that can hold many assets that work together to include
enhanced interactivity, productivity, or effects to your movies.  You
can use components to control your movie, such as moving from one
frame to another, or to perform more complex tasks, such as sending
data to and from a server.  Components cover the following areas:
*[[/Data/]]
*[[/Playback/]]
*[[/User Interface/]]

==Why Use Components?==
Components make it easy for you to rapidly create proof-of concepts or
prototypes for larger Rich Internet Application (RIA) frameworks, to
share your work with other Flash developers in the Flash community.

Components are a very effective way of making certain that your
end-user understands how to use certain elements of your Flash movie.
A predictable interface does not have to be boring or common.  In
addition, because components can be skinned, they can have a unique
look from one site to the next.  The components shipped with Flash 8
are also reliable.  Because components are a quick solution to common
interface requirements, you will have more time to spend on more
complicated and interesting creative tasks instead of recurring
authoring.

==Drawbacks Of Using Components==
One of the arguments against using components is the increasing of
file size added to your productions.  Even though this may be the
case, there are several reasons to use components apart from the ease
of dragging them to your Stage and modifying the parameters.

==How To Add Components==

You can add a component to your Stage in the following ways:

1. Open the Components panel by going to Window &gt;&gt;&gt; Components
or by pressing Ctrl+F7.

2. Add a component to the Stage by:

*Double-clicking:  You can double-click a component and it will
be added to the center of your Document window's workspace.

*Dragging: You can add an instance by clicking the component icon and
dragging it onto the Stage.

After your component is on the Stage, you can modify its parameters
and properties manually in various panels by using ActionScript code
on objects or keyframes in a timeline.

==Removing Components from your Movie==

To remove (V2) components, you simply select the compiled clip in the
Library panel, and delete it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Interesting; I set out with a very specific goal with my original C and C++ examples, and it's been long since lost.  The goal was to take a simple case, to show somewhat natural C and C++ code to do string input, string concatenation, and string output.  The contrasts were between the straightforward ways of coding in the two languages (where C++ is still simpler and more general).  I'm not sure what the point of the current examples is! -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 07:16, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Astronomical spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools used by astronomers to gain a fundamental understanding of our universe. Astronomical spectroscopy is a technique in which the absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation from stars and other celestial objects are studied. In order to be able to interpret and predict absorption and emission spectra from celestial bodies, one must have a fundamental understanding of molecular emission and absorption. Molecular emission and absorption is the process in which photons are emitted and absorbed when a molecule changes quantum energy states. By studying molecular emission and absorption, the chemical composition, physical properties, and velocities of astronomical objects may be measured.

== Quantum Mechanics ==

One of the key concepts from quantum mechanics essential to the understanding of molecular absorption and emission is the fact that molecular energy is quantized. In other words, molecules can exist only in specific quantum states with each quantum state having a set amount of energy. The quantized energy stored in a molecule can be thought of as the sum of energy stored in three distinct modes: (1) rotation, (2) vibration, and (3) electronic:

                                         &lt;math&gt;E_{tot} = E_{rot} + E_{vib} + E_{elec} &lt;/math&gt;

Since the internal energy levels of the molecules are quantized, discrete differences in energy are observed when molecules change quantum states. These transitions correspond directly with the energy of emitted or absorbed photons in discrete spectra. As stated earlier, emission is the process by which a molecule changes quantum states from a higher to a lower quantum state by the release of a photon. Absorption, on the other hand, is the process in which a molecule changes quantum states from a lower energy level to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon.[[Image:Bohr model Balmer 32.png|thumb|right|300px|Figrue 1. Example of electric transition in the quantum energy states of an atom resulting in the emission of a photon.]]The total change in energy associated with a molecular transition (emission or absorption), can be described by the following:

                                    &lt;math&gt; \Delta\ E = E_{upper} - E_{lower} = h \nu\ &lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, &lt;math&gt; \Delta\ E &lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the photon which is equal to the difference in energy associated with the molecular transition between two quantum states, &lt;math&gt; \nu\ &lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the corresponding electromagnetic wave, and h is Planck's constant. This relation, known as Planck's Law, is important because it links the concepts of thinking of radiation as both a particle and a wave. Figure 1. illustrates the concept of emission due to the electronic transition of electrons orbiting the nucleus of an atom. It should be noted that even though this picture shows electronic transitions for an atom, the same processes govern electronic transitions in molecules. Using Planck's Law, the total change of internal energy in a molecule can be described as:

                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta\ E  = \Delta\ E_{rot} + \Delta\ E_{vib} + \Delta\ E_{elec} &lt;/math&gt;

This equation states that the total internal energy of a molecule is the sum of the changes in rotational, vibrational, and electronic energy. From quantum mechanics, it can be shown that the quantum energy levels for the different modes of internal molecular energy have different spacing. Electronic states are more widely spaced than vibrational states, which are more widely spaced than rotational states. Because of this different spacing, changes in the different modes of internal energy lead to absorption and emission of electromagnetic energy at different wavelengths. Changes in rotational energy lead to microwave transitions, changes in rotational and vibrational energy (vibrotational) lead to infrared transitions, and changes in rotational, vibrational, and electronic energy (rovibronic) result in ultraviolet transitions. It should be noted that changes in vibrational energy are often accompanied with changes in rotational energy and changes in electronic energy are often accompanied by changes in vibrational and rotational energy.

== Emission and Absorption Spectra ==

The absorption and or emission spectra of a molecule generally consist of a number of &quot;lines&quot;. These lines correspond to the discrete differences in the internal energy modes of a molecule. In other words, a line is the part of a spectrum that corresponds to a transition from one quantum state to another. Groups of lines can in turn comprise a vibrational band. The positions, strengths, and shapes of lines can give accurate physical characteristics about the molecules undergoing internal energy transitions. The position of spectral lines reveals various molecular parameters such as internuclear spacing and molecular bond angles. Line strengths and shapes, on the other hand, can reveal the composition, temperature, pressure, and velocity of molecules in a radiating gas. This concept is illustrated in figure 2 which shows the emission spectra of hydrogen plasma. [[Image:H plasma spectrum.gif|thumb|left|400px|Figure 2. Emission spectra of Hydrogen Plasma. Positions of lines reveal molecular properties while line strengths and shapes reveal composition, temperature, and pressure.]] The governing law for absorption spectroscopy that links various molecular properties with the amount of light absorbed in a gas medium is known as Beer's Law.
                                 &lt;math&gt;T_{\nu} = \left ( \frac{I}{I^o} \right ) = exp(-k_{\nu}L) &lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, &lt;math&gt; T_{\nu} &lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of light transmitted through a gas medium, &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the EM radiation being transmitted, &lt;math&gt; k_{\nu} &lt;/math&gt; is the spectral absorption coefficient, and L is the absprotion path length. A diagram of Beer-Lambert absorption is presented in Figure 3. The spectral absorption coefficient is given by:

                                 &lt;math&gt;k_{\nu} = S_{i} \times \phi \times P_{i} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; S_{i} &lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;strength&quot; of the transition, &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;lineshape function&quot;, and &lt;math&gt; P_{i} &lt;/math&gt; is the partial pressure of the absorbing gas species.



== Diatomic Molecular Spectra ==

The interaction electromagnetic radiation has with matter can be explained through three main types of interactions: electronic dipole moment, induced polarization, and elastic scattering.  Interactions with the electric dipole moment result in changes in the absorption and emission of radiation while induced polarization and elastic scattering are a direct result of how a molecule scatters photons. Many diatomic heteronuclear molecules have a permanent dipole. A dipole has a positive charge on one end and a negative charge on the other end of the molecule. The motion of this dipole, through the rotation and vibration of the molecule, allows the molecule to emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation.

== Molecular Rotations ==

As stated earlier, rotations of molecules correspond to transitions in the microwave region of the EM spectrum. When a diatomic molecule rotates, the molecule's dipole moment also rotates, which allows for the absorption or emission at characteristic resonance frequencies. The simplest rotational model for a diatomic molecule describing this process is the rigid rotor approximation.  In this model, the atoms of the molecules are point masses with an equilibrium separation distance that is either constant or rigid. Using classical mechanics, the moment of inertia and angular momentum of a molecule can be determined. This information used in conjunction with the molecule's rotational energy allows one to determine the allowed values of rotational energy as a function of quantum number. 

== Molecular Vibrations ==

Much as rotations of a molecule can lead to changes in the electric dipole of a molecule, vibrations can also change the electric dipole of a molecule due to stretching of the molecule's internal bonds. This stretching leads to the possibility of emission or absorption of infrared EM radiation. The simplest model for diatomic vibration is the simple harmonic oscillator. In this model, two masses are separated by an equilibrium separation distance. The bond length between the two masses oscillates about this equilibrium distance much like a spring. By using classical mechanics, the fundamental resonant frequency, which is characterized by the bond stiffness and magnitude of the masses, can be used to determine the potential energy stored in the oscillator.

== Electronic Transitions ==

In addition to rotations and vibrations, a molecule's electronic structure can also interact with EM radiation. If the distribution of electrons in a molecule's shell is changed, energy transitions occur which result in emission and absorption of EM radiation in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electronic spectra involve the transitions that occur between the potential energy wells which correspond to different electronic configurations. The potential wells represent the variation of electronic forces with internuclear spacing.

Olive Ascolane is an Italian starter from Ascoli Piceno made of fried green olives, stuffed with minced meat (beef, pork and chicken liver) and spices.

==Ingredients==

* 1 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of pork
* 1 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of chicken breast
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cup of chopped green olives
* &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cup of Parmesan cheese
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 lemon rind, grated
* 1 teaspoon of freshly-grated nutmeg
* 1 teaspoon of cinnamon
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; teaspoon allspice
* Salt to taste, be careful, the cheese and olives are salty 

==Procedure==

#Cook the pork and chicken breast in your favorite tomato gravy recipe. Do not substitute any other meats such as beef or lamb. If you do, you run the risk of altering the flavor. Remove cooked, cooled meats from the sauce and grind them using a food grinder or meat processor. Add the remaining ingredients to the ground meat mix (do not over-process). Mix the ingredients into the meat and put into the refrigerator to cool for at least one hour. Remove the mixture from refrigerator and roll meat into balls about the size of a small walnut. Put half of an olive on each side of the rolled ball. Flour each ball, dip in beaten egg, then dip in unflavored bread crumbs.
#Arrange olive balls on a tray, they can be frozen unfried at this time. When it is time to cook them, fry them quickly in about 1/2 inch of canola oil until golden brown. Drain and serve. It is not important to cook them through because the meat has been cooked already. Traditionally, they would have been cooked in olive oil.
#Allow frozen olive balls to completely defrost before frying. Have an extra jar of olives on hand in case you are left with extra filling.

This recipe makes about 50 stuffed olives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rinsing the pasta==

&lt;i&gt;
Questions for the Italian cooks: When I cook pasta, I always rinse the pasta with cold water after straining it.  The purpose is to stop the heat so that I can ensure the pasta would not continue to cook itself after removing from the fire.  The outcome is a more predictable consistency each time.  The cold pasta is heated up again just before serving.  Is such practice common in Italian cooking?  It is for Chinese.  Since Chinese and Italian cuisine are both famous for their endless choices of pasta, they both should have their tips and tricks passed down through generations.
&lt;/i&gt;

I rinse pasta after it's done cooking too, but I always thought it was to rinse off the extra oil and salt.  My family is Italian in a way (my step-great-grandfather was Italian). I think it's probably a custom that was originated by both cultures. [[user:Dreamyshade|Dreamyshade]]

:Yes, cold water stops cooking, so pasta would not loose any more consistency. But this has to be a very quick operation, or you will eat a cold pasta, and cold pasta is not able to capture sauce (so you practically would eat pasta and sauce separately). Because of this, this operation might be useful if you have to put hot sauces on it; otherwise it is better to have pasta served within 3-4 minutes, or if you need more time to serve it, boiling one minute less than suggested (see box).

I don't rinse my pasta (slightly undercooking it to compensate for the continued cooking).  Not rinsing it leaves any residual starch on the pasta which will both thicken the sauce a little and help it stick.  But then, I am not Italian.

==When to add the salt==

I've always added the salt when the water boils, because salt raises the boiling point of water so it takes longer to boil otherwise.  But that's just me being impatient.
:Actually, it makes no significant difference whether you add the salt at the beginning or at the end.  The heat energy input needed to go from (cold water) + (cold salt) to (boiling salty water) is the same either way.  
:In truth, salt at the end may be slower, just so slightly. Heat flow from stove to pan is greater when the pan is cold. So putting all the mass (water+salt) on the stove from the beginning increases the heat flow and thus gets faster to the final state, even though the temperature is lower for most of the time.&lt;br&gt;[[User:Jorge Stolfi|Jorge Stolfi]] 04:31, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)
::There's not enough salt to significantly affect the boiling point or make any difference in &quot;time to boiling&quot;, no matter when you add it. It's for flavor. -- [[User:Nunh-huh|Nunh-huh]] 05:51, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)
::To be precise the boiling point of salted water is higher than plain water. This because &lt;&lt;a solute [the salt] dissolved into a solvente [the water] increases the boiling point of the latter&gt;&gt;.In any case, as said before, the different is so insignificant if we consider the ordinary ammount of salt used to cook pasta that it's just a matter of habit. Well, with regards to habits I must say that the 99.99% of people I know in Italy (including me) are used to add salt just after the water has started boiling. In my opinion the sentence &lt;&lt;The salt should be added when the water is still cold&gt;&gt; is not true as explained and could be changed in something like &lt;&lt;The salt could be added when the water is still cold or just after it starts boiling&gt;&gt; --gico

==Missing VFD notice?==

After editing this page I found out that it was listed in [[Talk:List of recipes/Delete]] as a candidate for deletion. Shouldn't the article have been flagged with a VfD notice, or with a note on this talk page?&lt;br&gt;[[User:Jorge Stolfi|Jorge Stolfi]] 05:22, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)

==Deleted material==

Trying to rewrite the page i encyclopedic style, I had to delete this sentence:

: =Serving suggestions= For well-cooked pasta, simple sauces such butter and ''[[Parmigiano Reggiano]]'', or some oil, [[parsley]] or [[basil (herb)|basil]] and fresh [[garlic]], may well be as tasty as more sophisticated preparations.

[[User:Jorge Stolfi|Jorge Stolfi]] 05:45, 4 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== Putting oil in the water ==

[[Image:Spaghetti-cooking.jpg|thumb]]
It seems to be common practice to put a little olive oil in the pan of water when cooking (as you can see in this picture wich is used in the [[Spaghetti]] article), to me this seems like a big waste of time, it just flots on the top it doesn't touch the pasta! The article does not mention this, I wonder were this silly idea came from, I assume the Italians don't do it?--[[User:JK the unwise|JK the unwise]] 11:53, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

I don’t think it’s an ''entirely'' silly idea: the useful thing that happens is that the oil disperses in the boiling water and adheres to the pasta, lubricating it and making the penne (or whatever) less likely to stick to each other. But you are probably right in assuming that Italians don’t do it. At any rate it was an Italian who stopped me doing it and taught me instead to stir now and again. I guess I should add that advice to the article. --[[User:Ian Spackman|Ian Spackman]] 01:52, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

== A couple of extra secrets added ==

*The most important lesson I ever learnt on cooking the pasta was to &lt;em&gt;begin&lt;/em&gt; by clearing the sink and putting a colander in it: it’s all to easy to leave it till last and end up with the stuff overcooked and soggy.

*Stir now and again.

Plus one or two other minor modifications.

==Notation for mate==

Mightn't it be wiser to use # for mate (and not ++)?

: Use &quot;#&quot;.  It's what PGN uses. -- [[User:Dwheeler|Dwheeler]] 18:08, August 31, 2005 (UTC)

==Two notations: which is better?==

(Should we use &quot;x&quot; or &quot;times&quot; when taking a piece?)
: Rxh5++
: R&amp;times;h5++

[[User:Michael Hardy|Michael Hardy]] 03:32, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:I'd just use &quot;x&quot;.  I don't think many people can tell the difference. -- [[User:Dwheeler|Dwheeler]] 18:10, August 31, 2005 (UTC)


==Coordinates==

Excellent page! What's missing are coordinates on the images, so the lay reader knows where e7 is. Or could that be done by colour-coding, as in &quot;the queen could now move to the red square&quot;? [[User:Thore|Thore]] 12:16, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:I'm glad you like the page.  Please feel free to take it in whatever direction seems appropriate.  I agree that the images should have coordinates, but I added the images way back when it was still a novelty to have images at all.  Doesn't Wikipedia now have a script for encoding chess positions in a way that folks can modify them?  I've quite fallen out of touch of late, not editing anything but [[Arimaa]], so I'd be happy if someone else brought this old article up to date.

:Done. I've changed this over to the new &quot;Chess diagram&quot; template. [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Standard_chess_diagram Chess diagram appears to be the new standard for chess diagrams on Wikipedia].  And it so happens that &quot;chess diagram&quot; shows the coordinates.

== Congrats! ==

This is really an excellent page on chess! Aimed at begginers, it really seems to get it as right as possible!

Shouldn't we name it for «featured article»? Do you know how to do it? [[User:Velho|Velho]] 23:14, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

::While I don't think this is right for a featured article, I would argue that this page merits its place in Wikipedia. I thought I would copy my argument to that effect here, so it doesn't disappear along with the featured article nomination... [[User:DanielCristofani|DanielCristofani]] 09:40, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

:::Some paper encyclopedias have full pages which are not mostly text: maps, or diagrams of the legislative process, or little picture galleries with examples of eight different kinds of lace, or whatever. In the more vertical (and more nonlinear) format of a web browser it makes sense to put things like this on their own pages, rather than break up the main text column with them (and they won't necessarily fit to the side of it). So not every Wikipedia page has to be exactly an &quot;article&quot;. The page [[Sample chess game]] does not belong on Wikibooks because it is not a textbook or part of a textbook. Rather, it is a supplementary document for the encyclopedia articles [[Chess]] and [[Rules of chess]]. Such supplementary documents should probably never be given featured article status, since they are not encyclopedia articles per se (thus I '''oppose''' this nomination), but there is no good reason to delete them, or to transwiki them to other Wiki projects whose stated criteria they are equally unsuitable for, either. (If anyone wants to get gung-ho about every Wikipedia page being an article per se, rather than some pages serving subsidiary functions, they will have to delete or transwiki all &quot;[[List of]]&quot; and &quot;Timeline of&quot; pages, to begin with.)

== 10% ==

&quot;White wins 10% more often than Black&quot; would mean &quot;White wins 110% as often as black&quot;, whereas it's more like 137%. (Compare with &quot;New Zombinex has 30% more saturated fat than the competition.&quot;) Similarly, &quot;white's advantage over black is 10%&quot; gives the same wrong impression plus additional confusion over how ties are figured in. I think my new phrasing makes it clear, but if you can think of another phrasing that also makes it clear, feel free. Also, this is one figure that would be good to cite...[[User:DanielCristofani|DanielCristofani]] 08:18, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

:I think your edit makes it more accurate without making it unreadable.  Sadly, for true accuracy we would have to define ''expected score'' and say &quot;White's expected score is 0.55&quot;. --[[User:Fritzlein|Fritzlein]] 21:48, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== 6.... d5 ==
&quot;This move is necessary, since 6...Kg6? 7.Qf5+ Kh6 8.d4+ g5 9.h4! would leave White with a crushing attack.&quot;  Let's say I'm confused by d4+. [[User:70.129.156.206|70.129.156.206]] 04:42, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

:It's a &quot;discovered check&quot;; after that move, Black is in check from the bishop on c1, which the d-pawn was blocking before. Does that clear it up? [[User:DanielCristofani|DanielCristofani]] 07:01, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

== 7. Bxd5x mistype? ==

Excerpt from article:
7. Bxd5+
White gives check yet again, keeping Black on the run. Let's review the three ways to get out of check:
Capture the piece giving check. Black could play 7...Qxd5. But White would simply take the queen with 8.Qxd5+, giving White a huge material '''disadvantage''', as well as a continuing attack on Black's exposed king.

I may be mistaken, but I believe the author means that the bold type '''disadvantage''' remarked above would actually be a material '''advantage''' for White, which is why the third listed move is the best move available.

-David Williams

== Nice game ==

Something to point out is that as of white's 7th move, he's taken three pawns (and thus achieved material equality). Of coruse, black didn't *have* to play 6... d5, but white could've forced full material equality (or checkmate!) anyway. On a side note, this reminds me of a win I had as black in summer camp...

== This is a just plain awful game to show beginners ==

:The games fine for beginners. It's quite exciting, especially so for kids.
:I reduced some of the emphasis on giving up the Knight(Nxe5) and added some comments in like with comments.
:Morphy's Opera House game would be a nice as a second example. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 00:57, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

:: ''So will the reader believe that moves 2 and 3 are moves of the same caliber as Crafty?  Since seemingly the same person chose them?'' -- That's a specious argument. Top-level grandmasters have been known to make blunders such as failing to notice that their queen was under attack, or overlooking that their opponent could mate in one. Also, most of Black's moves are not hard to see, as Black is often in check (giving him very few possibilities anyway) and most of the moves are the only one to avoid instant disaster. So the Black side of this game could easily be played by a good player who has not seen 2...f6 analysed before and does not realise it leads to a lost game.

I am however going to change the annotation for 3.Nxe5 because at the moment it reads like White is gambling because he can't calculate the result of this sacrifice, whereas in fact it's easy to calculate (as this game itself proves!!!) [[Special:Contributions/91.107.156.17|91.107.156.17]] ([[User talk:91.107.156.17|talk]]) 20:42, 9 July 2008 (UTC)
:: I'm not sure how to access what crafty might choose. Moves 2 and 3 are not good in my view, yet it the type of thing that occurs between weaker chess players. So to that end I do think the article is interesting to a wide ranging audience. Is the game a quality game of chess? No, certainly not. But does it matter? [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 16:04, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

== Moves 13 and 14 ==

Something really strange is going on with the black queen down there. [[User:Admiral Norton|Admiral Norton]] &lt;sup&gt;([[UserTalk:Admiral Norton|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 15:21, 13 April 2009 (UTC)


== Moves 9 and 12 ==

Why would black bishop take white bishop in the ninth turn? Wouldn't it be more beneficial to threaten the queen with the oter bishop? f8 to d6?

And why woudn't black pawn take white pawn (g5 to h4) instead of queen to e7 in the twelfth turn?

For me, I thought of those moves... Am I stupid?
[[User:Thymo|Thymo]] ([[User talk:Thymo|talk]]) 14:48, 17 October 2009 (UTC)
:9...Bd6 is a good attempt and most likely better then the given move. 12...gxh4 would be illegal because Bc1 checks King. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 19:46, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

== Second game ==

This game is one in which Black blunders.  Shouldn't we replace it with a balanced game with a tough fight to the finish, or at least add such a game to the page? (I have quite a few stored up in my computer that I could add to fill that gap.) --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:06, 27 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello!

Thanks for your work on the Haskell wikibook.  One minor quibble though... could you please avoid the use of HTML markup in your text?  There are some things we can't avoid, like &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but otherwise the markup just makes things a bit more difficult to read/hack on.  The wiki markup should do the job just fine otherwise.  Note also that
 putting a space in the beginning of a line
Like above, inserts some &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, which does not seem to be desired effect in your case -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:36, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">By far the easiest music notation to work with is Klavar (full name Klavarskribo). Klavar is easy to learn and easy to play particularly with keyboard instruments such as piano, organ or synthesizer. The system was invented by a Dutchman called Cornelis Pot.

Some time in the early 1930s Pot had a brilliant idea: he imagined black lines extending upwards from the black keys of a piano keyboard. He realized that if he could transfer that image onto paper and write dots on the lines or spaces formed by the pattern he could write music in a simple, practical way: it would show the performer ''exactly'' which notes to play. Pot published his ideas in 1931 and called his system of writing music Klavarskribo which is Esperanto for &quot;Keyboard Writing&quot;. Here I will simply refer to it as 'Klavar'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Quick Question==
Do these need to be refrigerated after cooking if to be stored for a few days?

:Good question. I never have, and I've left them out for as long as 6 days before consuming. Their 'spoilability' should be about the same as any other brownie or bar cookie if fully cooked. I do keep them covered once they're cool to keep them from drying out and to reduce the amount of mold spores and such getting on them. I usually don't have them for more than a day or two (chocoholics and beer geeks abound in my universe). Of course, standard disclaimer applies ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMMV YMMV]). If you make 'em, let me know how they turn out.  Slainte! [[User:JRStutler|JRStutler]] 23:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

==Eggs?==

The recipes says &quot;4 Large Eggs&quot;, then at the end it says &quot;1 Large Egg&quot;. Which is it? --[[User:147.124.152.117|147.124.152.117]] 05:05, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

:5 eggs: 4 for the brownies, 1 for the topping. I've consolidated the two numbers, so hopefully it is a little clearer now. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:32, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

== Sugar amount? Also, idea. ==

The recipe calls for 1 cup granulated sugar and 1/3 cup granulated sugar. I assume you should use a total of 1 and 1/3 cups, but why are they listed twice? Or is it a mistake?

Also, I had an idea: Do you think it'd turn out well if you reduced the beer, so you could increase the beer-flavor? Eh?

what is a cup size? [[User:Sweetie candykim|Sweetie candykim]] ([[User talk:Sweetie candykim|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sweetie candykim|contribs]]) 13:01, 26 November 2011 (UTC)
:Cups are used in the USA for measurements of liquids and solids.  This article [[w:Cup_(unit)]] on Wikipedia has more information.  I am trying to make sure that every recipe uses metric units because obviously cup sizes are only useful for Americans and the concept seems very strange to me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe|Bun bo Hue}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Cuisine of Vietnam]]

'''Bún bò Huế''' is a popular Vietnamese soup noodle dish which originated in the old imperial capital of Huế.

'''Ingredients for broth:'''
* 1 kg beef shank with cartilage – sliced into 2mm thick pieces. Ask your butcher. Chop the shank slices into various shapes of about 4cm x 4cm.
* 2 medium sized pigs feet – fresh, cut into 1 cm pieces. Discard the feet themselves
* 4 tablespoons Huế [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp paste]]
* 1 small onion – finely chopped
* 2 stalks of [[Cookbook:Lemongrass|lemongrass]] – chopped into 5-inch pieces
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Noodle|rice noodles]] – a noodle resembling spaghetti No 5. is preferred
* [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|Nước mắm]]
* Sugar
* Red pigment powder – non-spicy for colouring
* [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|Chilli powder]]
* Vegetable oil

'''Serving ingredients:'''
* 1 bunch of [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] – stems discarded and leaves chopped
* 1 bunch of Italian (flat leaf) [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] – stems discarded and leaves chopped
* 1 medium onion – finely chopped

'''Condiments:'''
* [[Cookbook:Lime|Limes]] - cut into wedges
* Fresh [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Chilli peppers]]
* [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|Bean sprouts]]
* Banana blossom - thinly sliced
* Shrimp paste

'''Materials:'''
* A large stockpot - 8-10 litres
* A large mixing bowl - 2.5 litres
* A small frying pan

==Procedure==
Start by preparing the shrimp paste. In a large bowl, 2.5 litres, add shrimp paste and slowly pour in cold water while vigorously stirring the paste. Keep adding water and stirring until you’ve almost reached the rim of the bowl. Don’t let it spill over. Let the paste mixture rest in the bowl for 1.5 hours, to allow the mixture to settle.

'''Note:''' ''Shrimp paste is essential to this dish and cannot be considered Bún bò Huế without it. Different types of shrimp paste can be found all over Vietnam. Some are of better quality than others. Some purists believe that only Huế shrimp paste is acceptable for this dish as it is smoother and of superior quality than other pastes, which can have trace amounts of sand in them. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find outside of Vietnam, so an &quot;inferior&quot; paste may be substituted.''

Sauté the small onion in 3 tbsp of oil until golden brown. In your stockpot, combine the cooked onion and pigs feet with 2 litres of water. Slowly bring it to the boil over medium heat. Add lemongrass and '''SLOWLY''' and '''CAREFULLY''' pour in the shrimp paste mixture making sure to only add the clear liquid not the silt that has settled at the bottom of the bowl. To the residual shrimp paste, add another litre of water and stir. Again, wait until the mixture has settled before adding it into the stockpot. Simmer the stock for 20 minutes.

Add the beef and occasionally skim the broth to ensure you get a nice clear liquid. Cook for another 20 minutes, checking the beef to be sure it’s not overcooked. Add fish sauce and sugar to taste to achieve a nice balance between salty and sweet.

While the broth is cooking, heat some oil in a pan and add the red pigment. Cook until the pigment is blended with the oil. Add to the stock. Repeat the process with the chilli powder.

==Preparing==
Combine chopped parsley and coriander leaves with the uncooked medium onion.

If you are using fresh noodles, simply add boiling water to heat them up. If you’re using dried noodles, soak them in boiling water until they are soft then dip in cold water to stop the cooking process. Do not over cook them or you’ll have mush. Dried noodles have already been cooked.

In a large soup bowl, place a handful of noodles, top with a handful of the parsley/coriander/onion mixture, and ladle on generous amounts of steaming hot broth, ensuring there are several pieces of beef and pork.

==Serving==
You can add a squeeze of lime and chopped fresh chillies if you like your food extra spicy. It is also common to add a small dollop of shrimp paste to the soup, but those unfamiliar with the taste may not like it.

==Author's note==
This recipe originated when I tried to adapt my [[Cookbook:Mike's Saffron Rice and Beans|saffron rice and beans]] for a barbecue.  I planned on heating saffron rice and beans over a wood fire at the barbecue as a vegetarian main course, but didn't make enough rice, and added some raw ingredients at the last minute before slow-cooking over the fire.  Later I liked it so much that I made it in the oven.

==Ingredients==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]] cut into chunks
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], cut into large chunks
* several [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], cut into large chunks
* One can [[Cookbook:Garbanzo|Canned chickpeas]] or [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black beans]]
* Other vegetables, [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchini]], [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], etc, cut into chunks
* 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]]
* 5-10 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* Misc spices, good ones include [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]], [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]], ground [[Cookbook:Chili|chili]] or [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]], [[Cookbook:Oregano|ground oregano]] , etc
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|basmati rice]]
* 750 ml [[Cookbook:Wine|red wine]] -- the cheapest you can stand to drink -- I use Charles Shaw merlot, although any of the equivalently priced box-wines will work, so long as you get the red.

==Procedure==
# Put one tablespoon of olive oil in saucepan, heat.
# Stir in curry powder
# Stir in rice, fry rice briefly (5 minutes or so -- although the dish works if the rice is raw too) while stirring
# Pre-heat oven to 250
# Turn off heat, put vegetables, spices, and garlic, followed by rice with curry oil, followed with the can of beans and half the bottle of wine in a casserole dish
With a cover.  Stir briefly to mix, and make sure some at least some rice is on top.
# add rest of olive oil to casserole dish, fill with either water or remainder of wine until all vegetables, beans and rice are submerged in fluid
# Place casserole dish (covered) in oven, drink any remaining wine
# Wait for a couple hours, periodically checking to see if rice is soft.
# Once rice is soft its ready to eat.

==Variations==

# If you turn the oven hotter it'll cook faster.  The whole point of the low heat is you can start this Saturday afternoon, forget about it for most of the day, and then have dinner ready.

# Also works over a campfire.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Vegan_cuisine|Vegan Cuisine]] 

==Description==

Every vegan should know about aioli and related sauces.  They add a creaminess which can be otherwise rare in vegan cooking.

The key to the not-vegan-tasting deliciousness of an aioli is the garlic / olive oil emulsion.  The same principle is at work in hummus (or marinara).  Other common emulsifiers are glycerin, soy lecithin (present in soya-milk, tofu etc.) and egg yolk.

==Note on carrots==

Carrots can damage some blending equipment.  It is recommended to cut them into really small pieces so they're easier to blend.

==Ingredients==
* One [[Cookbook:Carrot|Carrot]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive Oil]]
* 1 pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 5 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Serrano Chile]]
* 100-200 ml [[Cookbook:Orange|Orange]] or [[Cookbook:Orange|Orange Juice]] (any other citrus works)
Optional
**French-style or [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]] (i.e. one that does not contain &quot;turmeric&quot; in the list of ingredients)

==Procedure==
# Cut carrot extremely fine (1 mm slivers) so that blender can handle it.
# Place all ingredients (start with 2 tablespoon olive oil) (Squeeze juice of 1 or more oranges, but don't add any orange peel) into blender-safe dish
# blend
# continue adding olive oil blending and tasting until it reaches desired creaminess.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

When designing a new microprocessor or microcontroller unit, there are a few general steps that can be followed to make the process flow more logically. These few steps can be further sub-divided into smaller tasks that can be tackled more easily. The general steps to designing a new microprocessor are:

#Determine the capabilities the new processor should have.
#Lay out the datapath to handle the necessary capabilities.
#Define the machine code instruction format (ISA).
#Construct the necessary logic to control the datapath.

We will discuss each of these steps below:

== Determine Machine Capabilities ==

Before you start to design a new processor element, it is important to first ask why you are designing it at all. What new thing will your processor do that existing processors cannot? Keep in mind that it is always less expensive to utilize an existing chip than to design and manufacture a new one.

Some questions to start:
#Is this chip an embedded chip, a general-purpose chip, or a different type entirely?
#What, if any, are the limitations in terms of resources, price, power, or speed?

With that in mind, we need to ask what our chip will do: 
#Does it have integer, floating-point, or fixed point arithmetic, or a combination of all three?
#Does it have scalar or vector operation abilities?
#Is it self-contained, or must it interface with a number of external peripherals?
# Will it support interrupts? If so, How much interrupt latency is tolerable? How much interrupt-response jitter is tolerable?

We also need to ask ourselves whether the machine will support a wide array of instructions, or if it will have a limited set of instructions. More instructions make the design more difficult, but make programming and using the chip easier. On the other hand, having fewer instructions is easier to design, but can be harder and more costly to program.

Lay out the basic arithmetic operations you want your chip to have:

*Addition/Subtraction
*Multiplication
*Division
*Shifting and Rotating
*Logical Operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOR, NOT, etc.

List other capabilities that your machine has:

*Unconditional jumps
*Conditional Jumps (and what conditions?)
*Stack operations (Push, pop)

Once we know what our chip is supposed to do, it is easer to lay out the framework for our datapath

== Design the Datapath ==

Right off the bat we need to determine what ALU architecture that our processor will use:

*Accumulator
*Stack
*Register
*A combination of the above 3

This decision, more than any other, is going to have the largest effect on your final design. Do not proceed in the design process until you have made this decision. Once you have your ALU architecture, you create your memory element (stack or register file), and you can lay out your ALU.

== Create ISA ==

Once we have our basic datapath, we can start to design our ISA. There are a few things that we need to consider:
#Is this processor RISC, CISC, or VLIW?
#How long is a machine word?
#How do you deal with immediate values? What kinds of instructions can accept immediate values?

Once we have our machine code basics, we frequently need to determine whether our processor will be compatible with higher-level languages. Specifically, are there any instructions that can be used for function call and return?

Determining the length of the instruction word in a RISC is a very important matter, and one that is worth a considerable amount of thought. For additional flexibility you can utilize a variable-length instruction set instead &amp;mdash; like most CISC machines &amp;mdash; at the expense of additional&amp;mdash;and more complicated&amp;mdash;instruction decode logic. If the instruction word is too long, programmers will be able to fit fewer instructions into memory. If the instruction word is too small, there will not be enough room for all the necessary information. On a desktop PC with several megabytes or even gigabytes of RAM, large instruction words are not a big problem. On an embedded system however, with limited program ROM, the length of the instruction word will have a direct effect on the size of potential programs, and the usefulness of the chips.

Each instruction should have an associated opcode, and typically the length of the opcode field should be constant for all instructions, to reduce complexity of the decoder. The length of the opcode field will directly impact the number of distinct instructions that can be implemented. if the opcode field is too small, you won't have enough room to designate all your instructions. If your opcode is too large, you will be wasting precious bits in your instruction word. 

Some instructions will need to be larger than others. For instance, instructions that deal with an immediate value, a memory location, or a jump address are typically larger than instructions that only deal with registers. Instructions that deal only with registers, therefore, will have additional space left over that can be used as an extension to the opcode field. 

{{TextBox|'''Example: MIPS R-Type'''

In the MIPS architecture, instructions that only deal with registers are called '''R type''' instructions. With 32 registers, a register address is only 5 bits wide. The MIPS opcode is 6 bits wide. With the opcode and the three register addresses (two source and 1 destination register), an R-type instruction only uses 21 out of the 32 bits available. 

The additional 11 bits are broken into two additional fields: '''Shamt''', a 5 bit immediate value that controls the amount of places shifted by a shift or rotate instruction, and '''Func'''. Func is a 6 bit field that contains additional information about R-Type instructions. Because of the availability of the Func field, all R-Type instructions share an opcode of 0.}}

== Instruction Set Design ==

Picking a particular set of instructions is often more an art than a science.

Historically there have been different perspectives on what makes a &quot;good&quot; instruction set.
* The early CISC years focused on making instruction sets that expert assembly language programmers enjoyed programming -- &quot;[[../Code Density | code density]]&quot; was a common metric.
* the early RISC years focused on making instruction sets that ran a few benchmark programs in C, when compiled with relatively primitive compilers, really, really fast -- &quot;cycles per instruction&quot;, and later &quot;instructions per cycle&quot; was recognized as an important part of achieving low &quot;time to run the benchmark&quot;.
* The rise of multitasking operating systems (and shared-memory parallel processors) lead to the discovery of non-blocking synchronization and the instructions necessary to support it.
* CPUs dedicated to a single application (ASICs or FPGAs) led to the idea of customizing the CPU for one particular application&lt;ref&gt;
[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=191326.191501 &quot;Generating instruction sets and microarchitectures from applications&quot;]
by   	
Ing-Jer Huang, and Alvin M. Despain
&lt;/ref&gt;
* The rise of viruses and other malware led to the recognition of the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements.

== Build Control Logic ==

Once we have our datapath and our ISA, we can start to construct the logic of our primary control unit. These units are typically implemented as a finite state machine, and we can try to map the ISA to the control unit in a logical way.

== Design the Address Path ==

If a simple virtual==physical address path is adequate for your CPU, you can skip this section.

Most processors have a very simple address path -- address bits come from the PC or some other programmer-visible register, or directly from some instruction, and they are directly applied to the address bus.

Many general-purpose processors have a more complex address path: user-level programs run as if they have a simple address path, but the physical address applied to the address bus is significantly different than the programmer-visible address.
This enables virtual memory, memory protection, and other desirable features.

We talk more about the benefits and drawbacks of a MMU, and how to implement it, in
[[Microprocessor Design/Virtual Memory]].

== Verify the design ==

People who design a CPU often spend more time on functional verification than all other steps combined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; used to prove the existence of
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow 2} x^2=4&lt;/math&gt;
is not consistent with the definition of limit.
&lt;math&gt; \forall \epsilon &gt; 0\ \exists\delta &gt; 0 \quad \mbox{so} \quad \left | \ x - x_0 \right \vert &lt; \delta\ \Rightarrow \left | \ f(x) - L \right \vert &lt; \epsilon\ &lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; used here is
&lt;math&gt; \delta = \sqrt{4-\epsilon} - 2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;So \quad \sqrt{4-\epsilon} - 2 &gt; 0 \quad \forall \epsilon&gt;0
\begin{align}
 \sqrt{4-\epsilon} &amp;&gt; 2 \\
      4-\epsilon &amp;&gt; 4 \\
      -\epsilon&amp;&gt;0 \\
       \epsilon &amp;&lt; 0 \\
       \epsilon &amp;&lt; 0 \\
         &amp;!
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt; 

The problem derives from the step where you have:
&lt;math&gt; (\delta)\cdot(\delta + 4) = \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; 
And skipped to: &lt;math&gt;\delta=\frac{-4\pm\sqrt{16-4\cdot1\cdot\epsilon}}{2\cdot1}= -2 + \sqrt{4-\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; Asuming that c=ε.

However &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; (\delta)\cdot(\delta + 4) - \epsilon = 0 \therefore\ \delta=\frac{-4\pm\sqrt{16-4\cdot1\cdot-\epsilon}}{2\cdot1}=-2 + \sqrt{4+\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
A comment with regard to the derivation of the delta function in example 2: &lt;br&gt;
When solving for delta, the epsilon goes to the others side, so it gets a minus sign. &lt;br&gt;
(delta)^2 + 4(delta) &lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt; epsilon = 0 &lt;br&gt;
The delta function becomes -2 + sqrt (4 &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt; epsilon).

:You are Right why you didn't fix that in the main article! , you waste my time
:i am going to change it to help the others , thanks for your good observation :) 
:i also changed a small error in
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left| f(x) - L \right| &amp; = &amp; \left| x^2 - 4 \right| \\
\ &amp; = &amp; \left| x - 2 \right| \cdot \left| x + 2 \right| \\
\ &amp; \le &amp; (\delta) \cdot (\delta + 4) \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon} - 2) \cdot (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon} + 2) \\
\ &amp; = &amp; (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon})^2 - (2)^2 \\
\ &amp; = &amp; \epsilon \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.
:as it would be
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left| f(x) - L \right| &amp; = &amp; \left| x^2 - 4 \right| \\
\ &amp; = &amp; \left| x - 2 \right| \cdot \left| x + 2 \right| \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\delta) \cdot (\delta + 4) \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon} - 2) \cdot (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon} + 2) \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon})^2 - (2)^2 \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; \epsilon \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:I change the sign &quot;=&quot; in the last two lines with &quot;&lt;&quot; because 
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{16 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (- \epsilon) }}{2 \cdot 1} = -2 + \sqrt{4 + \epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;
:so &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; will stay with the sign &quot;&lt;&quot; not &quot;=&quot;
:and also in third line i changed the sign from &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; to &quot;&lt;&quot; because from the definition &lt;math&gt;|x-2| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; and |x^2 - 4| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; not &lt;math&gt;|x-2| \le \delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|x^2 - 4| \le \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; as we want a range between 0 and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; , 0 and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; not a specific value [[User:3D Vector|3D Vector]] ([[User talk:3D Vector|talk]]) 00:47, 28 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''What is the problem?'''

Economics is the study of how to allocate or use resources such as money, land, etc. most efficiently. The world is such that everything is scarce. Money is limited, food is limited, labor is limited, steel and plastic are limited. Everything is limited and thus to do something we need to make sure that resources are allocated in the best and the most efficient way.

'''Opportunity cost?'''

One problem here is that of opportunity cost. It is the &quot;next best alternative that has been forgone&quot; while undertaking something. An example is that a person eats ice cream, the next best alternative was eating a burger, which was not undertaken, thus the cost of eating an ice cream is eating burger. This cost exists because the person has a limited amount of money and only one thing can be bought. Companies and governments have to look at opportunity costs as well as time and money when making decisions.

'''Scare resources??'''
What are the scarce resources then?? In economics they are:

*Entrepreneur (defined in economics as anyone who takes a risk)
*Land (your land on which you built a plant, office or mine etc.)
*Labour (employees, skilled and unskilled labour)
*Capital (this includes money, machinery etc.)

Increasingly another factor is added i.e.
*Technology or knowledge (this helps a firm to improve productivity, efficiency, quality, etc. and includes machinery, processes, training etc.)

Canh Chua is the Vietnamese &quot;Hot &amp; Sour&quot; soup. It is closest to the Thai and the Cambodian Tom Yum Soup although it is more sweet and sour than its spicier counterparts. Somehow each family has its own Canh Chua recipe and sometimes, members from the same family has their own; mine is different from my parents, which is different from their parents. 


==Ingredients==
===For soup===
* 1 whole Cat fish or firm white fish
* 1 quart (950ml) Water
* Freshly ground black pepper 
* 2 teaspoons salt 
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|Nước mắm]]
* ½ cup (120g) sour bamboo
* ¼ fresh pineapple – core removed, cut lengthwise and sliced

===For marinade===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallions]], remove green part and reserve for garnish – crush white part
* 4 teaspoons Nước mắm
* 1 teaspoons salt 

===Garnish===
* 2 tablespoons fresh [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] – chopped
* Green part of scallions - chopped

==Procedure==
Traditionally, the fish head is not removed, but if you prefer, it’s not necessary for this dish. Marinate the fish for 15 minutes with the crushed scallions, black pepper, 1 tsp salt, and 4 tsp Nước mắm.

Bring water to the boil. Add the sour bamboo and pineapple slices. Boil for 5 minutes. Add marinated fish and continue to boil for a total of 10 minutes. While the fish is boiling, add 2 tablespoons Nước mắm, and 1 teaspoon salt.

For serving, the soup can be garnished with coriander and the green part of scallions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fundamentals/Techniques of Casting

Stand directly facing the target or slightly sidewise, with the right side (if right handed) towards the target and the right foot slightly advanced.
The arms should be held in a relaxed &quot;natural&quot; position with the elbow at or near the side. The target should be aligned by looking at it through the top of the tip.
When the rod and target are properly &quot;ligned up&quot;, the tip of the rod brought in and up sharply to a vertical position and stopped suddenly the instant the backward motion of the tip stops.
In order to control the line, it is necessary to thumb the spool when using the conventional reel. The tip of the thumb may be placed entirely on the line and partially on the flange of the spool.
The thumb should apply firm pressure as the rod is brught back for the cast and held until the rod cmpltes its forward movement. The pressure is eased on the forward cast at about ten 'clck position, allwing the line to run, and then increase again just before the bait hits the target.
As the rod reaches the vertical position, the grip of the three fingers is relaxed thst the rod breaks away from the palm. Beginning downward movement, they should be closed again.
To bring the rod down, one must be careful to pass again through the &quot;aiming zone&quot; sighted at the beginning of the cast.
The eyes should be &quot;pick up&quot; the plug soon after it is released, keeping the rod, line and target in alignment.
The rod must be shifted to the left hand. The right hand grasps the handle of the reel and begins to reel in the line.

'''Leaf Spots''' are circular lesions found on the leaves of plants, caused by either bacteria of fungi.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Initial infections are small, circular spots, usually with a differently colored zone on the outer edge. Severe cases cause distorted leaves or blight.

==Life Cycle==
Spores or bacteria overwinter on fallen leaves or buds. Growth is favored by moist conditions on the leaf surface.

==Host Range==
Most of the pathogens are quite selective.

==Controls==
{{Phytopathcontrol|
| Exclusion = 
| Cultivation = 
| Cultural Controls = Prune or thin to allow good air circulation.
| Physical Removal = Clean up thoroughly in the autumn to reduce the amount of spores.

'''''Lycopersicon''''' is a genus which included tomatoes and some species of nightshades. First removed from the genus ''[[../Solanum/]]'' by Philip Miller in 1754, its removal leaves the latter genus paraphyletic, so modern botanists usually accept the names in ''Solanum''. The name ''Lycopersicon'' is still used by gardeners, farmers, and seed companies.

*''Lycopersicon cerasiforme'' (Cherry tomato) is now ''[[../Solanum lycopersicum/]]'' var. ''cerasiforme''
*''Lycopersicon esculentum'' and ''Lycopersicon lycopersicum'' (Tomato) are now ''[[../Solanum lycopersicum/]]''
*''Lycopersicon peruvianum'' is now ''[[../Solanum peruvianum/]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== نسخ  Naskh ==

Naskh script (sometimes written as &quot;Nasx&quot;) is a commonly-used script of the Arabic alphabet used in printed Persian. Due to its simple and clear style, most modern fonts used in Persian word processing are based on the Naskh script; therefore it is the style you will see used in this book. It is also the style of writing taught to children.

== نستعلیق  Nastaliq ==

Nastaliq (sometimes written as nastalique, nastaleeq or nastaligh) is a flowing and stylized form of the Arabic alphabet which originated in then Persia (modern Iran) during the 14th and 15th centuries. Its origins lay in a combination of the Naskh and Ta'liq styles, hence the name &quot;nastaliq&quot;. Since the Mughals ruled over Northern India at that time, a simplified version of nastaliq is still used for writing Urdu. 

[[Image:Naskh-nasta'liq-comparison.png|center|thumb|600px|A comparison of Naskh and Nasta'liq writing]]

== شکسته  Shekasteh ==


Shekasteh is a form of handwritten Persian, parts of which are based upon the Nastiliq form. Literally meaning &quot;broken&quot;, it is difficult to read for the beginner so some time must be spent in learning to read this script.

'''Caramel sauce/caramel syrup''' is a common ingredient in clay pot recipes.

==Procedure==
# Combine 1/2 cup sugar with 1/4 cup water or [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|nước mắm]] in a small sauce pan over low heat. 
# Swirl the pan frequently to avoid burning. When the sugar turns lightly brown, remove from the heat, add 1 cup of water or nước mắm. Guard against splattering. 
# Let cool a little and return the sauce to the stove, and cook on low heat until all the sugar has dissolved.
# Let the sauce cool and store in a jar in the refrigerator for future use.

=== The Persian Alphabet: {{Persian/text|الفبا|alefbâ}} ===
The six vowels and 23 consonants of Persian are written using a modified version of the Arabic alphabet with four extra Persian letters to represent sounds which do not exist in Arabic.  Its Persian name is {{Persian/text|الفبا|alefbâ}}, which is the equivalent of the English “ABCs”.

== Transcription ==

[[w:Romanization of Persian#UniPers|UniPers]] is used as a guide to pronunciation in this book:
{{Persian/Transcription key}}

=== Pronunciation ===

Most letters in this system of transcription can be pronounced like their English equivalents, but some deserve special attention:

{|style=&quot;font-family:tahoma,sans-serif;&quot;
! Persian letter !! Pronunciation
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;آ ا&lt;/font&gt;
| {{Listen
 |filename = fa-آ ا.ogg
 |type = speech
 |title    = â
 |plain = yes
 |description = ‹â› sounds like the ''o'' in the Queen's English pronunciation of ''h'''o'''t'', the ''augh'' in American English ''c'''augh'''t'', or the ''a'' in South African English ''p'''a'''rk''.  It is a longer and deeper sound than the short ‹a› (as in ''cat'').
}}
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;ژ&lt;/font&gt;
| {{Listen
 |filename = Fa-ژ.ogg
 |type = speech
 |title    = ‹ž›
 |plain    = yes
 |description = ‹ž› sounds like the ''g'' in ''mira'''g'''e'' or the ''s'' in ''mea'''s'''ure'' and in ''A'''s'''ia''.
}}
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;خ&lt;/font&gt;
| {{Listen
 |filename = Voiceless velar fricative.ogg
 |type = speech
 |title    = ‹x›
 |plain    = yes
 |description = ‹x› is similar to the ''ch'' in ''Ba'''ch''''' or the ''j'' in Spanish ''o'''j'''o'' but pronounced low in the throat.
}}
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;ر&lt;/font&gt;
| {{Listen
 |filename = Fa-ر.ogg
 |type = speech
 |title    = ‹r›
 |plain    = yes
 |description = ‹r› is similar to the ''r'' in the Scottish English pronunciation of ''f'''r'''ee'' or the ''tt'' in the American English and Australian English ''be'''tt'''er''.  It is often rolled like the Spanish ''R''.
}}
|}

===Differing Systems of Transcription===

There are several different systems of transcription in use for Persian, and no one official system. This can cause difficulties when more than one textbook is consulted, and may lead an absolute beginner to confuse the different letters. There are too many differences to be listed here, but it is useful to be familiar with the most significant examples: 

Some common differences include:‎ 

* {{Persian/text|آ|â}} {{Audio|fa-آ ا.ogg|listen}} may be transcribed as ''ā'', ''á'', ''A'', ''aa'', or ''a''.  For example, {{Persian/text|بابا|bâbâ}} may be written elsewhere as ''bābā'', ''bábá'', ''bAbA'', ''baabaa'', or ''baba''.  In texts where ‹â› is transcribed as ''a'', the short ‹a› sound may be written as ''æ'' or there may be no written distinction between the long and short sounds.
* Short ‹a› {{Audio|Fa-ا.ogg|listen}} may be transcribed as ''æ'', especially in texts where ''a'' represents long ‹â›. For example, {{Persian/text|ابر|abr}} may be written elsewhere as ''æbr'' and {{Persian/text|بابا|bâbâ}} as ''baba''.
* {{Persian/text|چ|c}} may be transcribed as ''ch'' or ''č''. For example, {{Persian/text|چطور|cetor}} may be written elsewhere as ''chetor'' or ''četor''.
* {{Persian/text|خ|x}} may be transcribed as ''kh''. For example, {{Persian/text|خوب|xub}} may be written elsewhere as ''khub''.
* {{Persian/text|ﺵ|š}} may be transcribed as ''sh'' or ''s''. For example, {{Persian/text|شما|šomâ}} may be written elsewhere as ''shoma'' or ''soma''.
* Long ‹u›, may be transcribed as ''oo''. For example, {{Persian/text|دوست|dust}} may be written elsewhere as ''doost''.

The '''gypsy moth''', ''Lymantria dispar'',  is a moth in the family Lymantriidae of Eurasian origin. Originally ranging from Europe to Asia, it was introduced to North America in the late 1860s, where it has been expanding its range ever since.

==Description==
The hatching of gypsy moth eggs coincides with budding of most hardwood trees. Larvae emerge from egg masses from early spring through mid-May.

Gypsy moths are dispersed in two ways. Natural dispersal occurs when newly hatched larvae hanging from host trees on silken threads are carried by the wind for a distance of up to about 1 mile, although most go less than 50 meters. Eggs can be carried for longer distances. Artificial dispersal occurs when people transport gypsy moth eggs thousands of miles from infested areas on cars and recreational vehicles, firewood, household goods, and other personal possessions. Females are flightless in most varieties, so these are the only means of spread.

==Symptoms and Signs==
The effects of defoliation depend primarily on the amount of foliage that is removed, the condition of the tree at the time it is defoliated, the number of consecutive defoliations, available soil moisture, and the species of host.
If less than 50 percent of their crown is defoliated, most hardwoods will experience only a slight reduction (or loss) in radial growth.

If more than 50 percent of their crown is defoliated, most hardwoods will refoliate or produce a second flush of foliage by midsummer. Healthy trees can usually withstand one or two consecutive defoliations of greater than 50 percent. Trees that have been weakened by previous defoliation or been subjected to other stresses such as droughts are frequently killed after a single defoliation of more than 50 percent.

Trees use energy reserves during refoliation and are eventually weakened. Weakened trees exhibit symptoms such as dying back of twigs and branches in the upper crown and sprouting of old buds on the trunk and larger branches. Weakened trees experience radial growth reduction of approximately 30 to 50 percent.

Trees weakened by consecutive defoliations are also vulnerable to attack by disease organisms and other insects. For example, the Armillaria fungus attacks the roots, and the two-lined chestnut borer attacks the trunk and branches. Affected trees will eventually die 2 or 3 years after they are attacked.

Although not preferred by the larvae, pines and hemlocks are subject to heavy defoliation during gypsy moth outbreaks and are more likely to be killed than hardwoods. A single, complete defoliation can kill approximately 50 percent of the pines and 90 percent of the mature hemlocks. This is because conifers do not store energy in their roots; an exception is larch.

==Ecology==
===Development and reproduction===
Larvae develop into adults by going through a series of progressive moults through which they increase in size. Instars are the stages between each molt. Male larvae normally go through five instars (females, go through six) before entering the pupal stage. Newly hatched larvae are black with long hair-like setae. Older larvae have five pairs of raised blue spots and six pairs of raised brick-red spots along their backs, and a sprinkling of setae.

During the first three instars, larvae remain in the top branches or crowns of host trees. The first stage or instar chews small holes in the leaves. The second and third instars feed from the outer edge of the leaf toward the center.

When population numbers are sparse, the movement of the larvae up and down the tree coincides with light intensity. Larvae in the fourth instar feed in the top branches or crown at night. When the sun comes up, larvae crawl down the trunk of the tree to rest during daylight hours. Larvae hide under flaps of bark, in crevices, or under branches - any place that provides protection. When larvae hide underneath leaf litter, mice, shrews, and ''Calosoma'' beetles can prey on them. At dusk, when the sun sets, larvae climb back up to the top branches of the host tree to feed.
When population numbers are dense, however, larvae feed continuously day and night until the foliage of the host tree is stripped. Then they crawl in search of new sources of food.

The larvae reach maturity between mid-June and early July. They enter the pupal stage. This is the stage during which larvae change into adults or moths. Pupation lasts from 7 to 14 days. When the population is spread out and running low, pupation can take place under flaps of bark, in crevices, under branches, on the ground, and in other places where larvae rested. During periods when population numbers are dense, pupation is not restricted to locations where larvae rested. Pupation will take place in sheltered and non-sheltered locations, even exposed on the trunks of trees or on foliage of nonhost trees. Sometimes the caterpillars create flimsy cocoons made of silk strands holding the leaf together, while others do not cover their pupae in cocoons, but rather hang from a twig or tree bark, like butterfly pupae do.

The brown male gypsy moth emerges first, flying in rapid zigzag patterns searching for females. The male gypsy moths are diurnal unlike most moths, which are nocturnal. When heavy, black-and-white egg-laden females emerge, they emit a chemical substance called a pheromone that attracts the males. The female lays her eggs in July and August close to the spot where she pupated. Then, both adult gypsy moths die. The European and most Russian forms of the gypsy moth have flightless females. Although they have large wings, the musculature is not developed. However, the Japanese gypsy moth females do fly and are attracted to lights. During outbreaks they have been known to fly to ships in port and lay their eggs on the ships.

The egg is the overwintering stage. After an acclimation stage, eggs can withstand freezing temperatures. The longer they are chilled in winter, the less heating is required for their hatch in spring.
Gypsy moth egg masses are typically laid on branches and trunks of trees, but egg masses may be found in any sheltered location. Egg masses are buff colored when first laid but may bleach out over the winter months when exposed to direct sunlight and weathering. As the female lays them, she covers them with hair-like setae from her abdomen. Many individuals find these hairs irritating, and they may offer the eggs some protection. Egg masses contain from a couple of hundred to about 1200 eggs.

===North American Introduction===
The gypsy moth was introduced into the United States in 1868 by a French scientist, Leopold Trouvelot, living in Medford, Massachusetts, who enjoyed raising many types of caterpillars including silkworms. It is now one of the most notorious pests of hardwood trees in the Eastern United States. The first outbreak there occurred in 1889. By 1987, the gypsy moth had established itself throughout the Northeast USA and southern Quebec and Ontario. The insect has spread south into Virginia and West Virginia, and west into Michigan and Wisconsin. Infestations have also occurred sporadically in Utah, Oregon, Washington, California, and British Columbia.

Since 1980, the gypsy moth has defoliated over 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km²) of forest each year. In 1981, a record 12,900,000 acres (52,200 km²) were defoliated. This is an area larger than Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut combined.

In wooded suburban areas, during periods of infestation when trees are visibly defoliated, gypsy moth larvae crawl up and down walls, across roads, over outdoor furniture, and even inside homes. During periods of feeding they leave behind a mixture of small pieces of leaves and frass, or excrement. During outbreaks, the sound of chewing and frass dropping is a continual annoyance.

Gypsy moth populations usually remain at very low levels but occasionally populations increase to very high levels which can result in partial to total defoliation of host trees for 1-3 years.

==Host plants==
Gypsy moth larvae prefer oaks, but may feed on several hundred different species of trees and shrubs, both hardwood and conifer. In the East the gypsy moth prefers oaks, aspen, apple, sweetgum, speckled alder, basswood, gray and paper birch, poplar, willow, and hawthorn, although other species are also affected. The list of hosts will undoubtedly expand as the insect spreads south and west. The gypsy moth avoids ash, tulip-tree, American sycamore, butternut, black walnut, catalpa, flowering dogwood, balsam fir, arborvitae, American holly, and shrubs such as mountain laurel and rhododendron, but will feed on these in late instars when densities are extremely high. Older larvae feed on several species of hardwood that younger larvae avoid, including cottonwood, hemlock, Atlantic white cypress, and the pines and spruces native to the East.

{{pestcontrol|
| Cultural controls = Stands of trees that are predominantly oak and grow on poor, dry sites (such as sand flats or rock ridges) are frequently stressed and often incur repeated, severe defoliations. Trees growing under these conditions frequently possess an abundance of structural features such as holes, wounds, and deep bark fissures that provide shelter and habitats for gypsy moth larvae and aid their survival.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;Appropriate action will be determined by an anticipated occurrence of gypsy moth defoliation, by characteristics of the stand, and by the economic maturity of the stand. Foresters refer to treatments discussed here as &quot;thinnings.&quot; Thinnings are cuttings made in forest stands to remove surplus trees (usually dominant and subdominant size classes) in order to stimulate the growth of trees that remain.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;''Predefoliation treatments'': When gypsy moth defoliation is anticipated, but not within the next 5 years, predefoliation thinning to selectively remove preferred-host trees can reduce the severity of defoliation, increase the vigor of residual trees, and encourage seed production and stump sprouting. Thinnings should not be conducted in fully stocked stands that will reach maturity within the next 6 to 15 years. Thinning results in a short-term &quot;shock effect&quot; to residual trees. This shock effect, coupled with defoliation-caused stress, renders trees vulnerable to attack by disease organisms such as Armillaria.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;In fully stocked stands that will reach maturity within the next 16 or more years, two kinds of thinning can be applied. The method of thinning should depend on the proportion of preferred host species present. If more than 50 percent of the basal area in a stand is preferred host species (mainly oaks), presalvage thinning should be applied. Presalvage thinning is designed to remove the trees most likely to die (trees with poor crown condition) from stress caused by gypsy moth defoliation. If less than 50 percent of the basal area in a stand is in preferred host species, sanitation thinning can be applied to reduce further the number of preferred host trees. This will result in fewer refuges for gypsy moth larvae and in improved habitats for the natural enemies of the gypsy moth.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;''Treatment during outbreaks'': If defoliation is current or is expected within the next 5 years, thinnings should be delayed because of potential &quot;shock effect.&quot; High-value stands can be protected by applying pesticides. In low-value stands or those that are at low risk (less than 50 percent basal area in preferred host species), protective treatments are optional.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;''Post-outbreak treatments'': After a defoliation episode, the land manager or woodlot owner should pursue efficient salvage of dead trees, but should delay decisions about additional salvage, regeneration, or other treatments for up to 3 years. At the end of 3 years, most defoliation-caused mortality will be complete and the need for treatments can be assessed on the basis of damage level, current stocking conditions, and stand maturity.
| Resistant varieties = 
| Trapping = Every year, over 100,000 pheromone traps are placed in uninfested portions of the US in order to detect new infestations that occasionally arise when people inadvertently transport life stages into uninfested areas (e.g., egg masses on recreational vehicles). When captures are positive for several consecutive years, this indicates that a population is establishing itself.
| Physical removal =  
| Barriers = 
| Repellents = 
| Pesticides = The most commonly used chemical pesticides currently registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use against the gypsy moth contain carbaryl, diflubenzuron, and acephate. Malathion, methoxychlor, phosmet, trichlorfon, and synthetic pyrethroids (permethrin) have also been registered by EPA for control of gypsy moth, but are used infrequently. The bacterial pesticide ''[[../Bacillus thuringiensis/]]'' ('Bt') is also used.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;Diflubenzuron represents a new class of pesticides called insect growth regulators. It kills gypsy moth larvae by interfering with the normal molting process. Diflubenzuron has no effect on adult insects.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;The decision to use pesticides is influenced by a number of factors:&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-bottom:10px&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of visible egg masses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The percentage of preferred hosts in a mixed stand of trees (50 percent or more of oak).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether trees already have dead or dying branches, especially near the top branches or crown.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether the property is located adjacent to wooded areas heavily infested with gypsy moths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;During periods when numbers of gypsy moth larvae are dense, pesticides may be the most effective method of reducing the number of larvae and protecting the foliage of host trees. Application of pesticides should be done by a certified applicator, because special equipment is required. Large areas, such as wooded residential areas and forests, should be treated by aircraft.
| Organic pesticides = 
| Alternate hosts = 
| Predators and parasites = Natural enemies play an important role during periods when gypsy moth populations are sparse. Natural enemies include parasitic and predatory insects such as wasps, flies, ground beetles, and ants; many species of spider; several species of birds such as chickadees, blue jays, nuthatches, towhees, and robins; and approximately 15 species of common woodland mammals, such as the white-footed mouse, shrews, chipmunks, squirrels, and raccoons. Predation by small mammals (mice and shrews) is the largest source of mortality in low density gypsy moth populations and this mortality is apparently critical in preventing outbreaks. Calosoma, a ground beetle of European origin, cuckoos, and flocking birds, such as starling, grackles, and red-winged blackbirds, are attracted to infested areas in years when gypsy moth populations are dense.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;Diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses contribute to the decline of gypsy moth populations, especially during periods when gypsy moth populations are dense and are stressed by lack of preferred foliage. Wilt disease caused by a particular nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) that is specific to the gypsy moth is the most devastating of the natural diseases. NPV causes a dramatic collapse of outbreak populations by killing both the larvae and pupae. Larvae infected with wilt disease are shiny and hang limply in an inverted &quot;V&quot; position. Infection with NPV is the most common source of mortality in high density populations and NPV epizootics usually cause the collapse of populations. Since the 1980s, the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga has also had a large impact on gypsy moth populations in North America.
| Biocontrols = Microbial and biological pesticides contain living organisms that must be consumed by the pest. Microbials include bacteria, viruses, and other naturally occurring organisms; biologicals include manmade synthetics of naturally occurring organisms. These pesticides should be applied before the larvae reach the third stage or instar of development. As they mature, larvae become more resistant to microbial pesticides and are, therefore, more difficult to kill.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;Nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV), a naturally occurring organism, has been developed as a microbial pesticide. It is presently registered under the name &quot;Gypchek&quot; and is available for use in USDA Forest Service sponsored suppression programs. NPV and Gypcheck are specific to the gypsy moth.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is microbial and biological. It is the most commonly used pesticide. In addition to being used against the gypsy moth, Bt is used against a number of other pests, including the western spruce budworm, spruce budworm, and tent caterpillar. When Bt is taken internally, the insect becomes paralyzed, stops feeding, and dies of starvation or disease.&lt;br style=&quot;margin:12px;&quot;/&gt;Chemical pesticides are contact poisons in addition to being stomach poisons. The timing of the chemical application is less critical to the successful population reduction of the pest than the timing of the application of the microbials and biologicals. Chemical pesticides can affect non-target organisms and may be hazardous to human health.
| Timing = Weather affects the survival and development of gypsy moth life stages regardless of population density. For example, temperatures of -20°F, (-29°C.) lasting from 48 to 72 hours can kill exposed eggs; alternate periods of freezing and thawing in late winter and early spring may prevent the over wintering eggs from hatching; and cold, rainy weather inhibits dispersal and feeding of the newly hatched larvae and slows their growth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Boyage has come to install Blender 2.42 about two weeks ago. Just a few days before 2.43 was released. Now he is using his spare time to learn Blender from various tutorials and has found the wikibook [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro]] especially interesting for here he cannot only reproduce but also contribute. So when he is going through one of the tutorials he tries to update and upgrade the tutorial such as he finds necessary. Thus he does by rewriting (mainly adding) text and adding (maybe some too many) pictures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Boyage, 28. Febuary 2007
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
PS: Thanks, palo, for suggesting Blender in the first place.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is it possible that Fawkes is a horcrux? This would seem possible, given that:
* Phoenixes are immortal, so Fawkes would be a safe place to put part of your soul.
* Fawkes is connected to Voldemort by his wand - therefore, Fawkes has the magical associations that Voldemort was looking for; except not from the past, but to the present.
--[[User:Sjlegg|Sjlegg]] 16:21, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
:Intriguing idea, but no. For Fawkes to be a Horcrux, someone would have to be murdered in his presence; soul fragments don't keep. Dumbledore hasn't murdered anyone as far as we know, and Fawkes would never be near enough to Voldy to be tagged that way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Master SME'''

We use an idea called M-SME (Master Subject Matter Expert) to help in the development of technical training.  This M-SME is typically a retired generalist that is experienced in the technical subject matter, but is not an expert on any individual area.  After the Instuctional Designers meet with the individual SMEs, the M-SME can help clarify content issues without taking up the SMEs valuable time.  This method allows one M-SME to be the single goto point with the designers so the individual SME does not need to get bogged down in the details of the development.  Similarly, the M-SME can go to the individual SME to get clarification on a technical point in a much smoother fashion than the non-technical ID or Technical Writer could.

2. Stakes and design effort do not match

3. Assessments not valid for intended purposes

4. Wrong type of assessments

      <text xml:space="preserve">Edutainment is the fun road to learning.  Most people don't realize when they've landed in this zone but what they do know is that some magic has happened and as a result they now know, think or do something as a result of this type of active engagement.  

Prime examples of edutainment are found in children's shows like Sesame Street, Barney, etc...  Adults also often learn this way but are not always acutely aware of what they've learned because they've had so much fun.  A great debrief will get at the acquired knowledge.

Being a &quot;edutainer&quot; opens new pathways to learning particularly as the Aging of America dominates the landscape.

      <comment>/* donner meat */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This article had to be written by an American!

I don't know what it's a recipe for, but it sure isn't doner kebab.

Ground beef?  No, lamb.

Chicken salt? I didn't know chickens produced salt.

Slow cooked?  No, fast rotary grilling is the key, with meat being sliced off as it reaches perfection.

But apart from that, the recipe is authentic!   :D

Add:

This is the döner I ate in england. No way german style. It sounds as if it was all ground meat. Its only a 10 to 20 % ground meat. There is a complete definition around, but it definatly isnt the one here. This döner is not the real stuff :) Ground meat döner sucks. Please verify this information.


== donner meat ==

I tried the recipe but made a few ammendments and it came out well. Quite authentic. Not all of us can aford a rotisserie so the foil method worked well as it kept the shape and allowed me to shave the meat off to mimic chip shop style donner meat.I changed the recipe by frying an onion, garlic and 2 fresh tomatoes then blitzing it all together with a level tea spoon of chilli powder then added it to the mixing bowl with the rest of the ingredients. The result was great.

== Angry Chef ==

Removed this from the main page, but might we worth reading/responding to: &quot;P;S from an angry and unpleased person &quot; this recipe is an fake i tried my self but i end up like mess look more like boiled dogfood&quot; so do not trust this recipe unless you want to waste money whoever who wrote this recipe I want my 4hours and my 40USD back.
Hateful regards an Angry chef&quot;</text>

[[Image:Ctenomorpha_chronus02.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An Australian Stick Insect perched on a piece of wood. Stick insects look like they are made from twigs.]]

Stick Insects are long, thin, slow moving insects that look like a stick or twig. They are also called walking sticks. Males tend to be smaller than females. Colors are usually brown or green, but may be grey or shades of red. Also shaded orange but in little places. Stripes, spots, and speckles are common. Males usually have wings, but females are often wingless. Short, tough forewings protect the large fan-shaped hind wings.

The common American Walking Stick is slender and shiny with long antennas. The adult male is 2 to 3 inches long with bands of color. The adult female is 3 to 4 inches long.

The New Guinea Spiny Stick Insect is big and bulky. It is 4-1/2 to 6 inches long. It resembles a branch more than a slender stick. Colors are dark brown to black. The legs are thick and prickly. Adult males have a long thorn on each hind leg. Nymphs are green-and-brown patterned. 

The Two-striped Walking Stick is also known as Prairie Alligator and Devil’s Riding Horse. It is large and relatively stout with three longitudinal black stripes down its back.

==Where can it be found?==

Walking Sticks are found in North America, Australia, and around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe. They are abundant in the rainforests of Asia, Africa, and South America. They live in tropical areas and warm temperate regions. Their natural habitat is woodlands and forested areas where there are many broadleaf trees. They live on the foliage of shrubs and bushes and on tree stems.

Common American Walking Sticks can be found east of the Mississippi River, from southern Canada to central Florida. They are also found in parts of Arizona and northern Mexico.

Giant Spiny Walking Sticks live on the ground instead of trees or bushes. They hide under bark and stones during the day.

==What does it eat?==

Stick insects are herbivorous, eating only plants and vegetation. They eat berries, vines, and leaves. They feed at night.

Adult American Walking Sticks prefer to eat oak leaves. Nymphs feed on oak leaves and various plants, berries and shrubs that grow under the oaks.
They also eat fabric textiles.

==How does it defend itself?==
Stick insects protect themselves by remaining motionless for hours. Sometimes, they gently sway back and forth like a small branch being blown by the wind. They hold their legs tightly along the body so they look like a stick or twig. The surrounding vegetation makes them almost invisible to predators. First-stage nymphs are tiny and have protective camouflage.  

Other defense tactics include using unpleasant smells, noises, postures, protective coloration, and sharp spines on the legs.
 
Sometimes the undersides of the wings are brightly colored. When the stick insect senses danger, the wings will open very fast revealing a bright flash of color to scare away predators. Often, wings act as miniature parachutes. The stick insect can fall from a branch, unfold its wings, and glide to safety.

The Two-striped Walking Stick has bright stripes that act as warning coloration. It is also called “musk mare” because it squirts a strong-smelling defensive spray when threatened.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

A Stick Insect undergoes incomplete metamorphosis, changing from egg to nymph to adult. There is no pupal stage. The female deposits eggs through a special tube (ovipositor) at the tip of the abdomen.

In a few species, the female lays eggs by hanging upside down from a branch. She arches her abdomen then straightens up and flicks the eggs away.  The eggs are thrown some distance and scattered over a wide area. In the spring nymphs emerge from a tiny cap at one end of the egg.

About two weeks after mating, the female flicks, drops, or scatters her eggs. Some species take care to protect their eggs. They bury their eggs in the ground or hide them in the bark of a tree. Often eggs are attached to leaves or branches by a special sticky substance. Some eggs look like seeds, and ants take them to their nests where they are protected.
 
To grow bigger the nymph molts, growing a new skeleton under the old one. The old skin cracks open and the nymph emerges with a new cover. The new outer casing is soft at first, and the nymph must be careful to avoid danger until it hardens.

Finally, after several molts, the nymph becomes an adult. The average lifespan of a Walking Stick is 1 to 2 two years.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

A Walking Stick adapts to its surroundings by appearing to be a twig. It is only active at night (nocturnal). It has claws and suction pads on its feet to climb stems and branches.

Nymphs can regrow or regenerate a leg pulled off while escaping a predator. Each time it molts, the lost limb gradually grows back. After three or four molts the lost limb is completely grown back, a little shorter than the original. When an antenna is lost, the Stick Insect grows a new leg in its place. Adults no longer molt, so only nymphs can replace body parts this way.

Males of the Giant Spiny Stick Insect species are also called Thorny Devils. They have large, sharp spines on their hind legs. Their legs are used as fishhooks in Papua New Guinea.

Female Two-striped Walking Sticks are large and carry the smaller males around for long periods.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Walking Sticks do not seem to have a great impact on humans. There may be problems when they are brought to areas where they do not belong naturally. Common American Walking Sticks are sometimes thought of as pests because large numbers feeding at once can eat most of the leaves on a tree.

The Indian Walking Stick is native to Madagascar where captive colonies are often kept on hedges. The Indian Walking Stick is often used as a study animal by scientists.

Some people keep Walking Stick insects as pets.

The Two-striped Walking Stick is capable of squirting a strong-smelling defensive spray that is painfully irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

In this module, you will create a volcano using the proportional edit fall-off tool. You should be comfortable with deleting and adding meshes.


__TOC__


==Adding a Plane==

Delete the basic cube. Add a plane, and {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}cale it up by 10. Rotate it so you see it in top-view (make sure it's in Orthographic view too).

Enter Edit mode and subdivide (with {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}}) 5 or 6 times. More subdividing will give you a &quot;smoother&quot; volcano, but it also needs more CPU power.

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=The difference between &quot;Subdivide&quot; and &quot;Subdivide Multi&quot;...}}
&quot;Subdivide&quot; divides every square in the plane into four new squares. So every time you press &quot;Subdivide&quot; you will have four times as many squares as before.
&quot;Subidivide Multi&quot; will make x horizontal and x vertical lines through your existing squares, so the new number of squares is: (squares_old)*(x+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas x is the number you enter.''
{{Hidden end}}

==Making the Mountain ==

In top view, select one of the points in the middle of the plane. With this point selected change to side view.
Press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|O}}, which enables the &quot;Proportional Edit Falloff&quot; tool in the Menu-Panel beneath the 3-D-Window. As seen in the previous tutorial [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Mountains Out Of Molehills]] when you move a vertex while edit falloff is enabled, all vertices in a defined radius of the selected vertex will align with the selected vertex when its position is altered. How they are adjusted can be chosen in the tab on the right of the yellow dot. I propose using &quot;smooth falloff&quot;.

[[File:Blender_Smooth_fallof.jpg|400px|]]

Now grab the vertex with {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}. You will now see a gray circle. You can change its size with the mouse wheel. Every vertex inside this radius will be affected by the falloff. Change the size of the circle so almost the whole plane is in it.

[[File:blender_circle_size.jpg|400px|]]

Now move the vertex a bit upwards, as seen in the picture. Optionally you can lock the z-axis to make the volcano go straight up by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}.

[[File:Blender_grab_1.jpg|400px|]]

As you can see all the other vertices will shift upward. We could keep moving this vertex at the same rate, but that would cause the plane itself to rise and bend, and that's not very good. So press {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} to apply the changes, grab the same vertex a second time and repeat the previous exercise as before, except now choose a smaller radius for the circle, about half the diameter of the plane ({{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} &amp;rarr; {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} &amp;rarr; scroll {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}}).

[[File:Blender_grab_2.jpg|400px|]]

Repeat this two or three more times and you will get something like this:

[[File:blender_grab_last.jpg|400px|]]

==Forming the Crater==
Now we're going to create the &quot;hole&quot; on the volcano. First change the falloff to &quot;root&quot;. Grab the vertex one more time, change the size of the circle so it's more or less as seen in the picture.

[[File:blender_grab_down_circle.jpg|400px|]]

Grab this vertex down a bit, apply, grab it one more time with a smaller circle. You now should have something like this:

[[File:blender_grab_down_last.jpg|400px|]]

If yours has such a jagged border like mine, you should follow the following steps:
First disable the fallout tool with {{B3D:N2P/Do|O}}.
Then select a vertex and grab it, then pull it up so it's on the same height as the other. Do this for every vertex till they're more or less the same height.

You can also select the jagged vertices and the vertices around them then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} &amp;rarr; Smooth (Older versions: '''Space''' &amp;rarr; edit &amp;rarr; vertices &amp;rarr; smooth) and this will get rid of some of the jagged edges. (I suggest using this method since this is only a basic volcano, and using Subsurf after this will make the jagged edges all but invisible anyway.)

[[File:blender_edges_corected.jpg|400px|]]


==Subsurf==
Now {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} to get into '''Object mode'''.  Add a Sub-Surf Modifier to the Mesh, set at level two (''' 'Modifiers' ''' tab &amp;rarr; Add Modifier &amp;rarr; Subsurf &amp;rarr; Catmull-Clark &amp;rarr; Levels: 2; Render Levels: 2).

[[File:blender_subsurf.jpg|400px|]]

Do not apply these settings yet, first we'll do a test-render. Press '''F12''' to enter Render, after adjusting the camera. If you like your volcano you may apply the modifier, but if you have some rather nasty edges like I do, don't apply the modifier yet. We'll correct this now.

First click on the marked button to disable the subsurf-modifier in Edit-mode.

[[File:blender_disable_modifier.jpg|400px|]]

Then enter Edit-mode. Then select the vertices on the top and pull one after another a little bit outwards, so they form a nice circle.

Optional Enhancement Method to form the circle:

I found this nifty method to help &quot;guide&quot; making this circle with the manual vertex manipulation.

1. Enter Object mode, we will be creating a new temporary object.
  
2. Center your cursor (either Shift+S-&gt;Cursor to center(if your original plane HAS NOT shifted from center of grid) or Shift+S-&gt;Cursor to Selected(if your original plane HAS shifted from center of grid), basically you want the cursor centered in your plane.

3. Once you have the cursor centered, hit Ctrl+NUM7, to bring up Bottom Ortho view.  You should now see the volcano from the inside out and your slightly edged crater opening.

4. Hit Shift+A-&gt;Mesh-&gt;Circle.  This will create a circle at the cursor which will also be completely centered on the crater.  Select the circle with RMB and Scale it with S, manually increase the size until it it slightly larger than your crater opening, or however large you want the out edge to be.

5. Once your circle is the correct size, make sure you have the translate manipulator turned on, select the circle and change to Front Ortho view (NUM1).  Now move the circle through and above the volcano along the Z axis (blue handle).  Finally, change to Top Ortho View (NUM7).

6. While still in object mode, deselect the circle and select the plane containing your volcano.  You now have a nice &quot;guide ring&quot; to grab your vertices to!  After you have finished positioning your vertices, deselect all with an A, spin your view by holding down MMB and moving the mouse, enough to be able to pick out the circle easily without selecting the plane. Tab to object mode, select the circle again with RMB and finally delete it with X.

[[File:make_circle.jpg|400px|]]

Once you have done this exit Edit-mode and press the &quot;Set Smooth&quot; Button in the Link and Materials Button. If you Render now again, it should look a lot better. (Don't worry about the color)

[[File:blender_volcano_render_final.jpg|400px|]]

==Adding Magma==

Let's add some &quot;magma&quot; using lighting.

# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} and choose ''Cursor to Center''.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} and choose ''Lamp &amp;rarr; Point''.
# '''Older versions only''': press '''F5''' to enter the shading menu
# Change the color to reddish-orange. (Red: 1, Green: 0.1, Blue: 0)
# Set the Energy to around 7.
# Raise the light until it's just above the bottom of the crater ({{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}rab along the {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} axis).
# If the ground level of your plane is reflecting light from the lava lamp this is because the bottom of your crater is above ground level of the plane you created; you'll need to turn on ray-tracing. in the object data menu for the light, open the Shadow menu and click &quot;Ray Shadow&quot;

* Alternate 1: Spot Lamp
# Change the light's type to ''Spot''.
# Raise the light until it's covering most of the crater. If the light is not pointing down, {{B3D:N2P/Do|R}}otate and angle it downwards.

* Alternate 2: Area Lamp
# Change the light's type to ''Area''.
# {{B3D:N2P/Do|R}}otate along the {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}} axis: 180 degrees.
# Set Gamma to 2.
# Set Distance to around 5.

Experiment with the values and positioning to get something that works with your volcano.


It should now look like this: 

[[File:blender_volcano_magma.jpg|400px]]

==Varying the Terrain==

Next, let's set the volcano's material.

# {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the volcano plane.
# Select the &quot;Material&quot; button [[File:Materials_button.png]] and press New.
# Change the color to ashen gray. (Red: .260, Green: 0.230, Blue: 0.230)
# Select the &quot;Texture&quot; button and press New.
# Change the Type to Stucci.
# In the Influence panel, uncheck Color, and check Normal. Set the Normal slider to 0.5. This will render the texture as a bump-map.


'''Older versions:'''

Select the volcano and press F5. Keep Pressing F5 until the Materials Buttons (symbolized by a red ball) is highlighted.  Then add a new material. You do this by clicking the Add New button in the Links and Pipeline Panel.  Once you've done that, set the settings similar to the picture below. Now press F6, then add a new texture to the material. Choose a stucci texture, set the noise size to 0.15.
Now switch back to the materials-window (F5) and click on the &quot;map to&quot; tab. Deselect the &quot;col&quot; button and select the &quot;nor&quot; button. This will render the texture as a bump-map on the volcano. Set the &quot;nor slider&quot; to 0.5, which should be the default. Switch to the &quot;map input&quot; tab and choose &quot;tube&quot;.

[[File:blender_material_volcano.jpg|400px|]]


If you now render you should get something like this: 

[[File:blender_volcano_stucci.jpg|400px|]]

This looks really smooth, like clay pottery. To get a more rough-looking volcano, try out these options:

* Option 1: Subdivide and increase the fractal.

* Option 2: Decrease the texture's basis size (in the &quot;Stucci&quot; panel when you select the &quot;Texture&quot; button).

* Option 3: Proportional edit tool.
*# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|O}} to turn on Proportional Editing mode. Select Random fallout.
*# {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}rab the center vertice, and raise it along the {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} axis.


'''Older versions:'''

Go into Edit mode, select all Vertices, and use the fractal (set from 15 to 30) to really get things looking rocky and mountainous. '''TAB''' (Edit mode) &amp;rarr; '''F9''' &amp;rarr; '''AKEY''' to select all &amp;rarr; Mesh Tools &amp;rarr; Fractal &amp;rarr; 15 - 30 (15-low, 30-high) &amp;rarr; OK &amp;rarr; '''TAB''' (Object mode) In Blender 2.5 you can use the random proportional edit tool: use '''NUM7''' to switch into top view, grab the central vertice of your volcano using a large-radius random proportional edit, and pul it slightly into Z-direction.

(A note: Seems there is no need in subsurf at all since fractal tool will dramaticly increase vertices quantity.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
There is little difference in grammar between HTML coding and XHTML coding. In this chapter we will discuss the similarities and the differences in the coding.

== What Is Still The Same In XHTML? ==
A lot actually, but it has to be more structured. For example, in HTML you do not have to put ''p'' (paragraph) tags in; they are optional. In XHTML you have to.

In other words you cannot put text directly into the body anymore, the user must add elements to the text. The elements have not changed drastically. The following sections discuss changes.

== Casing in XHTML ==
As mentioned, the coding is '''strict''' compared to HTML. One such case is that the tags and attributes have to be lowercase. In HTML you could get away with this:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
In XHTML, this is not valid. '''ALL''' tags and attributes must be in lowercase, like this:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This is correct XHTML, all the tags are in lowercase.

== Opening and Closing Tags in XHTML ==
As in normal HTML, you must close the tags. In HTML browsers, you could get away with it, it would still show the webpage, but it ends up looking unusual. Now XHTML, '''Opening''' and '''Closing''' tags are musts. Like this:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Cat&lt;/b&gt; sat on the mat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This is good XHTML coding, remember to open and close a tag. Notice that the tags are also well formed. The ''b'' (bold) tag is within the ''p'' (paragraph) tag.

== Empty Tags ==
No tag pair should be empty. If you need to represent an empty tag, you need to include a slash within the tag itself.  For example, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is replaced with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

== Dealing with Attributes ==
As mentioned, attributes must be lowercase. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;content=&quot;text/html; charset=iso-8859-1&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
Also notice that the value of the attribute is quoted. There are also some attribute values that are in capitals, such as:
&lt;pre&gt;http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
This is a rare case and is come across rarely. The attributes must have a value; they cannot stand alone any more.

== Linking and URL Techniques ==
When it comes to internal linking, things have changed. This is the XHTML way of doing it:
&lt;pre&gt;This is the link that takes you to the section on the page:
&lt;a href=&quot;#Fred&quot;&gt;Go to Fred&lt;/a&gt;
This is the position where the link will take you:
&lt;p id=&quot;Fred&quot;&gt;This is Fred&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Some criticise that the developer still has to add the old &quot;name&quot; attribute to the tag. This is still okay to do, as some old browsers may not read the new command.

The developer also has to worry about ampersand characters. These are special characters in page addresses or forms, such as those used in PHP forums. If the user has to code one of these into XHTML, he or she has to change the following:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;forum.php?&amp;amp;style=orange&quot;&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
becomes
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;forum.php?&amp;amp;amp;style=orange&quot;&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice that the &amp; became &amp;amp;amp;.

== Images ==
Nothing much has changed in the way of images. The only thing that the user has to consider is the '''alt''' attribute. In HTML, it was optional to have this. Now it is compulsory to put this in, in the event that the image cannot be rendered:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;photo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of the Beach&quot; /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
What this does is display a text were the photo is supposed to be when it cannot be found in the source file.

== Applets ==
Although the '''applet''' tag was usable but considered bad development, strict XHTML no longer allows it.  If you want to use an applet, whether Java or Flash, you will have to use the '''object''' tag from now on.

== Deprecated Tags ==
You can still use these tags when you declare the DTD Transitional or Frameset (except for &lt;xmp&gt;) but it is recommended that you do not use these:
*&amp;lt;applet&gt;
*&amp;lt;basefont&gt;
*&amp;lt;b&gt;
*&amp;lt;center&gt;
*&amp;lt;dir&gt;
*&amp;lt;font&gt;
*&amp;lt;i&gt;
*&amp;lt;isindex&gt;
*&amp;lt;menu&gt;
*&amp;lt;s&gt;
*&amp;lt;strike&gt;
*&amp;lt;u&gt;
*&amp;lt;xmp&gt;

These tags are invalid in XHTML 1.1

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind (Verses 1 - 12) ==

John Chapter 9 will reveal more of the man that was Jesus through the story of a blind man. The healing of the blind man is presented as a parable of spiritual illumination.  Thanks to the coming of the true light of the world, many of the people formally in darkness have been enlightened. Verses 1 through 12 detail this man's miraculous healing. 

As Jesus is traveling with his disciples, they come upon a blind man who has been blind since birth.  Jesus' disciples ask if the blindness is a punishment from God for the sin of this man or his parents.  Jesus, however, explains that the man's blindness has a higher purpose; to show the glory of God in his life.  At this, Jesus declares himself the light of the world and heals the man using mud and saliva.  The now-sighted man, so astonished at his healing, begins to tell those who recognize him about the man that is Jesus.  However, as in previous chapters of John, Jesus is nowhere to be found after the miracle, which again shows that His works may be less for the sake of his immediate image, and more guided toward the after effects of the witness and the discussion and depth to understanding at a later point.  Despite the fact that the man was healed, the Jews harass him in disbelief.  Even though Jesus had attributed the man's blindness to God's glory, rather than to sin, the Pharisees continue to label this man a sinner. We know that this was to God's glory when we look at verses 3-5. At first, the disciples are confused, and ask God who has sinned: his parents or the blind man to make him this way. Then in the following verses Jesus provides further information saying that it is neither. The reason why this man is blind is so that &quot;the works of God might be displayed in him.&quot; (NAS v.3)(reference to John 11:4, 10:38, 11:40) Glorification of Jesus being his upcoming death, resurrection, and accession is one of the major themes in the gospel of john. Further, in verse 4 Jesus states &quot;we must work the works of Him who sent Me, as long as it is day; night is coming, when no man can work.&quot; (NAS)(reference to John 7:33) This is also another reference to a popular theme in John in comparing day and night or light and dark. When Jesus inhabits the world He is the light and when He leaves it will be dark with sin. (Prologue of John) Then in verse 5 we have even more evidence of this when Jesus says &quot;While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&quot; (NAS)

The healing of a blind man is a continuation of the theme of Chapter 3 that God is a loving God toward mankind.  The disciples believe the man's blindness is caused by a sin his parents committed.  Jesus tells them the man is not blind as a punishment but as an example of God's glory and love.  Jesus then proceeds to make some mud and give the man sight. 

The Pharisees were so intent on proving the man wrong that they summoned his parents to the scene and interrogated them as well. Though they claim the man as their son, they are hesitant to get involved further out of fear of being removed from the temple. The family is clearly poor, as their son must beg outside of the temple to be able to get by. If the man and his family were to be thrown out of the temple, he would be unable to beg outside of it; indeed, people would probably shun him because of it. The family tries very hard to stay out of it, saying that their son is of age and can speak for himself. This plan did not necessarily work, however, as the son was thrown out of the temple anyway. 

Ironically, the Pharisees, who have clearly witnessed the aftermath of a miracle, disregard what they seem to not understand and say that they &quot;don't even know where he comes from&quot; (v 29).  This contradicts the passage in 6:41-42, which clearly states that the leaders &quot;know his father and mother&quot; (for those were leaders from an area more local to Jesus' home).  In chapter 7:27, once again the people say &quot;But we know where this man is from.&quot;  This contradiction in the words of &quot;the Jews&quot; may very well be intentional on the part of the author.  The entirety of chapter 9 demonstrates how the man who was once blind can now see in both a physical and a spiritual sense.  The Pharisees, then, are examples of those who are blind, in darkness.  Thus, the contradiction of their words with those previously stated by &quot;the Jews&quot; may very well be an attempt by the author to portray the Pharisees as the spiritually blind who are grasping at whatever argument may suit their opposition to the light.  The blame may be attached to the pharisees, religious leaders, who claim to be able to see, but are spiritually blinded--to be so self-deceived as to shut their eyes to the light.  Had they acknowledged their spiritual blindness and allowed Jesus to remove it, then they would have been blessed and could be enlightened.

Jesus talks about the principle of spiritual blindness. Although he only clarifies the principle in a quasi-cryptic way, it seems to mean that if you are a true believer you do not claim to have all of the answers or to understand fully. You follow in spite of not knowing. Claiming to know all is like having a blind man claiming to understand colors. One cannot fully express what they cannot see. He tells the Pharisees that since they claim to be able to see, they are, in fact, still with sin and do not see at all.

However, the verse continues, claiming that &quot;no one will know where he is from,&quot; which lines perfectly up with the Pharisees in 9:29.  Truly, however, none of these leaders knows where Jesus originally came from despite His repetitive claimed origin as being &quot;from the Father.&quot;

The chapter concludes with the man that was healed being thrown out and Jesus returning to him.  Jesus asks if he believes in the Son of Man, and the man says no, but asks who he is so that he may believe.  Jesus then reveals himself to the man and says that on Judgment Day the blind, in this case the spiritually blind, will not be saved, but those who can see will.  As in those who accept Jesus will be saved in the end.  Those who say they can see, but are lying to themselves will still suffer from their guilt in the end.

When the blind man is confronted, his response has become proverbial: &quot;... I was blind but now I see.&quot; (V 25).  The man is interpreted rather sarcastic.  &quot;He cannot yet render a theological judgment about Jesus, but he knows for sure what his previous condition was and how it has decisively changed,&quot; (Smith 197).  As the man continues to be questioned, the interrogators start to disregard that the event even happened.  The man has already described what had happened and as he continues to answer sarcastically, the Pharisees (presumably the interrogators) they revile him.  &quot;Their statements are weighty and telling, doubtless reflecting where things now stand between the synagogue and the Johannine Christians, (Smith 197).

The fact that Jesus is portrayed as spitting on the ground to make mud in order to heal the blind man is very unusual. John is including this detail, despite the fact that it seems to suggest that Jesus wouldn't be able to heal the blind man without this secret potion. Interestingly, in the story's predecessor, Mark 8, Jesus is said to have used the same methods for healing with mud, but has to attempt the healing twice because the first time didn't quite work. After the first attempt, the man remarked &quot;I see people but they look like trees, walking&quot; (Mark 8:24). John does omit this section, seemingly because it emphasizes that Jesus was not powerful enough to heal the man the first time (even with his mud). John does however keep the mud element itself. This is probably due to the fact that he was writing for a Jewish audience, and the inclusion of the mud could have been seen as a violation of the Sabbath 3 times over: Jesus kneaded the mud, which was forbidden; then made from it a potential building material, which was forbidden; then healed the man's sight, which was also forbidden.

In this chapter the sixth sign of the ministry of Jesus is revealed, the healing of a  blind man.  &quot;Was his blindness because of his own sin or that of his parents?&quot;, asked the disciples.  Jesus replied that this case was to be for the glory of God by the power of the Holy Spirit.  The issue is not the cause of the man's blindness, but the role that it plays in the work of God. The role is the power of the Spirit and of the word, making Christ known as the One sent by the Father, gives him sight. It is the divine teaching in the heart of man. Christ, as man, touches us. We are absolutely blind, we see nothing. The Spirit of God acts, Christ being there before our eyes; and then we see clearly (J. Darby, 1996)

Chapter 9 is a summary of John's concept of revelation and sin, according to Smith.  He says Jesus's coming reveals who people are and that we are all really in darkness.  We need the giver of sight and light and the ones who own up to this need accept Jesus as the Revealer and the giver of light and sight.  The ones who insist they see already in fact do not see and are kept away from God through sin.

'''&quot;The Jews&quot; in Chapter 9 and The Gospel of John as a Whole'''  The Gospel of John is a book that has frequently been used to attack Jews and claim their inferiority to Christians.  Therefore it is important to question if the Gospel of John itself is anti-Semitic.  There are many different sides of this argument.  On one hand, the Gospel in general paints a fairly strong caricature of the Jews, most especially in this chapter.  The Jews could be seen as naïve, ignorant, even “dumb.”  In verses 18 and 19, the Jews want evidence that the man who was healed was actually born blind.  They call this man's parents in.  The Jews are seen as illogical for doing this, and the parents' response stems from the fact that they are afraid of the Jews' &quot;wrath&quot; basically, and afraid of what they will do to those who believe Jesus is &quot;the Christ.&quot;  What if the actual Jews from this time in history understood exactly both what Jesus was saying and the situation with the blind man, and simply made a conscious, educated decision NOT to follow Jesus, based on what they believed to be true?  On the other hand the possibly condescending language between “the Jews” and those who were following Jesus in the Gospel of John wasn’t necessarily uncommon in Jesus’ day and the time period from which the narrator of John writes.  It is quite possible that the narrator felt he was depicting what actually happened in an unbiased way.  Whether or not the narrator of John meant this text to be anti-Semitic, or even be construed as anti-Semitic, it is important for the readers of this particular Gospel to realize this is a text that can be potentially dangerous to society, if it is used in a vengeful way against Jews or any other non-Christians.

As the question raised above suggests, John has been consistently accused of infusing his gospel with language that has come to be considered anti-Semitic.  While it is true that when we read these passages in a modern context we understand them to be anti-Semitic primarily  because of our understanding of the way in which John uses the epithet &quot;the Jews.&quot;  This, however, might very well be a mistake on our part.  As we have said consistently, it is vitally important when reading an ancient text that one not confuse modern understanding with the understanding of the author or the audience of the ancient text in question.  While not enough is known about the climate in which John was writing, or his motives for doing so, it is a distinct possibility that John was writing his gospel with a specific purpose and for a specific audience in which the term &quot;the Jews&quot; would have taken on a completely different meaning than what we understand today.  It has been wondered whether or not John was using the term ironically and that perhaps it is appropriate to use quotation marks when translating the term.  Considering the fact that the large majority of the characters in the gospel were in fact Jewish, the heroes as well as the villains, it is not completely illogical to think that John might have been taking a jab at those who were throwing the Jewish members of the early Christian groups out of the synagogue for not being &quot;Jewish&quot; enough.  Whatever the case, enough is not known about his intentions or the meaning of the term to his followers to conclude that he was or was not being &quot;anti-Semitic.&quot;
  
'''Ethics in John Chapter 9'''  Christ heals a man born blind in Chapter 9.  It is one of his miracles, and the man himself fully subscribes to the idea of Christ being a prophet.  But what of Christ's words regarding the healing?  He says, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.” (verse 3)  This raises an interesting question: if neither the man nor the parents had sinned, or rather, had not sinned gravely enough to warrant fierce punishment, why must the man be forced to endure such profound helplessness?  In other words, what kind of morality does Christ Himself profess?  Are the just rewarded and the wicked punished, or is suffering more equally or even randomly distributed?  It is certainly interesting to consider that this man only suffered years of blindness so that Christ could cure him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Color Swatches Panel (Cmd/Ctrl + F9) is similar to swatches panels found in other applications, such as Photoshop and Illustrator: swatches can be created and saved as color palettes and then loaded for use at another time. In fact, color tables created in Photoshop can be saved and then loaded for use in Flash. The options menu of the Color Swatches Panel gives you access to other palettes, as well as to reloading the default palette. The Tools Panel and Property Inspector both provide popup Color Swatches Panels, however they only represent the currently loaded palette and do not provide for the loading and modifying of other palettes.

Flash loads the Web-safe color palette into the Color Swatches Panel by default. This is a set of 216 colors determined to be consistent on both Mac and Windows platforms. Color in general is inconsistent and unreliable from one platform to another due to the fact that the Mac OS and Windows handle color differently. Custom color sets can be imported from photographs and GIFs when saved as a .act or .clr from Photoshop. An indexed color palette, loaded from a GIF, can contain up to 256 colors and is ideal for vector graphics with solid fills and strokes, but will create banding in photographic images due to the tonal nature of bitmaps. In Photoshop do a File&gt;Save for Web, save as a GIF with adaptive color, or Image&gt;Mode&gt;Color Table after the image is coverted to indexed color.

Color can be applied from the Color Swatches Panel to objects in Flash. Color fill can be applied using the brush tool, Paint Bucket tool, and various shape tools, such as the rectangle tool. Color stroke can be applied using the Line tool, Pencil tool, Ink Bottle tool, Pen tool, and the corresponding shape tools as previously listed with color fill. The Tools panel and Property Inspector both have pop-up color swatches with colorchips for both the fill and stroke. The fill swatches also contain gradient swatches along the bottom of the pop-up panels. Depending on the tool selected, the panels may also contain a &quot;no color&quot; button for removing a fill or stroke color. The Tools panel will display the most recently selected fill and stroke color whereas the Property Inspector will display the fill and stroke colors for the currently selected item. These panels contain a field for input of hex color numbers, RGB colors in base 16 comprised of 6 digits, using numerals 0-9 and A-F. The first two digits correspond to the red channel, second two digits to the green channel and the last two digits to the blue channel. Web-safe hex colors use only combinations of 00, 33, 66, 99 and FF. The panels also have a button to invoke the Color Picker, which acts like a color wheel with all ranges of value and saturation available for selection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Integrating a polar equation requires a different approach than integration under the Cartesian system, hence yielding a different formula, which is not as straightforward as integrating the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof==
In creating the concept of integration, we used Riemann sums of rectangles to approximate the area under the curve.  However, with polar graphs, one can use sectors of circles with radius r and angle measure dθ. The area of each sector is then (πr²)(dθ/2π) and the sum of all the infinitesimally small sectors' areas is :&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \int_{a}^{b} r^2\,d\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt; This is the form to use to integrate a polar expression of the form &lt;math&gt;r=f(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;(a, f(a))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b, f(b))&lt;/math&gt; are the ends of the curve that you wish to integrate.

===Integral calculus===
[[Image:Polar coordinates integration region.svg|thumb|The integration region &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by the curve &lt;math&gt;r = f(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and the rays &lt;math&gt;\theta=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta=b&lt;/math&gt;.]]
Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote the region enclosed by a curve &lt;math&gt;r = f(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and the rays &lt;math&gt;\theta=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta=b&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;0&lt;b-a&lt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, the area of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac12\int_a^b r^2\,d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Polar coordinates integration Riemann sum.svg|thumb|The region ''R'' is approximated by ''n'' sectors (here, ''n'' = 5).]]
This result can be found as follows. First, the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is divided into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; subintervals, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary positive integer.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the length of each subinterval, is equal to &lt;math&gt;b-a&lt;/math&gt; (the total length of the interval), divided by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the number of subintervals.  For each subinterval &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; be the midpoint of the subinterval, and construct a circular sector with the center at the origin, radius &lt;math&gt;r_i=f(\theta_i)&lt;/math&gt;, central angle &lt;math&gt;\delta\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and arc length &lt;math&gt;r_i\delta\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  The area of each constructed sector is therefore equal to &lt;math&gt;\tfrac12 r_i^2\delta\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the total area of all of the sectors is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \tfrac12 r_i^2\,\delta\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

As the number of subintervals &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is increased, the approximation of the area continues to improve.  In the limit as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the sum becomes the Riemann integral.

====Generalization====
Using Cartesian coordinates, an infinitesimal area element can be calculated as &lt;math&gt;dA&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;dx\,dy&lt;/math&gt;.  The substitution rule for multiple integrals states that, when using other coordinates, the Jacobian determinant of the coordinate conversion formula has to be considered:
: &lt;math&gt;J = \det\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(r,\theta)}
=\begin{vmatrix}
  \frac{\partial x}{\partial r}  &amp; \frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} \\
  \frac{\partial y}{\partial r}  &amp; \frac{\partial y}{\partial \theta}
\end{vmatrix}
=\begin{vmatrix}
  \cos\theta &amp; -r\sin\theta \\
  \sin\theta &amp;  r\cos\theta
\end{vmatrix}
=r\cos^2\theta + r\sin^2\theta = r.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, an area element in polar coordinates can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;dA = J\,dr\,d\theta = r\,dr\,d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, a function that is given in polar coordinates can be integrated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\iint_R g(r,\theta) \, dA = \int_a^b \int_0^{r(\theta)}  g(r,\theta)\,r\,dr\,d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;
Here, ''R'' is the same region as above, namely, the region enclosed by a curve &lt;math&gt;r=f(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and the rays &lt;math&gt;\theta=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta=b&lt;/math&gt;.

The formula for the area of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; mentioned above is retrieved by taking &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; identically equal to 1.

==Applications==
Polar integration is often useful when the corresponding integral is either difficult or impossible to do with the Cartesian coordinates.  For example, let's try to find the area of the closed unit circle.  That is, the area of the region enclosed by &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
====In Cartesian====
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dy \, dx = 2\int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{1-x^2} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;
In order to evaluate this, one usually uses trigonometric substitution. By setting &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta = x&lt;/math&gt;, we get both &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta = \sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta\,d\theta = dx&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\int\sqrt{1-x^2}\,dx &amp;= \int \cos^2\theta\,d\theta\\
&amp;= \int \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cos 2\theta\,d\theta\\
&amp;= \frac{\theta}{2} + \frac{1}{4}\sin2\theta+c= \frac{\theta}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sin\theta\cos\theta+c\\
&amp;= \frac{\arcsin x}{2}+\frac{x\sqrt{1-x^2}}{2}+c\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Putting this back into the equation, we get
:&lt;math&gt;2\int_{-1}^1\sqrt{1-x^2}\,dx = 2\left[\frac{\arcsin x}{2}+\frac{x\sqrt{1-x^2}}{2}\right]_{-1}^1 = \arcsin 1-\arcsin(-1) = \pi&lt;/math&gt;
====In Polar====
To integrate in polar coordinates, we first realize &lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{1} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and in order to include the whole circle, &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^1 r\,dr\,d\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} \left[\frac{r^2}{2}\right]_0^1\,d\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{2}\,d\theta = \left[\frac{\theta}{2}\right]_0^{2\pi} = \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi&lt;/math&gt;

===An interesting example===
A less intuitive application of polar integration yields the Gaussian integral
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt\pi.&lt;/math&gt;
Try it! (Hint: multiply &lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} \, dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-y^2} \, dy&lt;/math&gt;.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">1.1 Computer Hardware
1.1.1 Computer Concepts
A very basic model of a computer would be:


The refined diagram shows the basic components of a computer system.


RAM
Random Access Memeory. Stores loaded programs and data to be processed. There are two types: volatile and non-volatile. Unlike non-volatile memory, volatile memory is lost when the computer is switched off or reset.

ROM
Read Only Memory. Stores information about BIOS and startup routines.

1.1.2 Measuring Storage
Both the primary and auxiliary devices have capacity measured in bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes.

A 1 or a 0 is a BInary digiT (Bit).

There are 8 bits in a byte 
1024 bytes in a kilobyte 
1024 kilobytes in a megabyte 
1024 megabytes in a gigabyte 
Therefore there are 1,048,576 bytes in a megabyte.

A double density floppy disk holds 720Kb of data. A high density floppy disk contains about 1.44Mb of data.

Many computers store one character as one byte.

1.1.3 Computer Categories
System  Description  
Microcomputers:  This a computer which uses a microprocessor as its CPU. Includes PCs, laptops etc. They typically have between 1 and 128Mb of memory (RAM). They process data in anything from 8-bit ro 64-bit chunks.  
Minicomputers:  These are systems designed for multi-user access several terminals. Varies from processing power from a very powerful micro to a small mainframe.  
Mainframes:  Supports hundreds of terminals for multi-user access. Large amount of primary and auxiliray storage.  
Supercomputers:  These are the fastest and most expensive systems. Although they are not multi-user machines, they are used when a vast amount of processing is to be done.  

1.1.4 Computer Configuration
This term describes the collection of hardware in use. A large computer configuration would consist of several hundred micros in a building linked together by cabling to form a local area network (LAN).

1.1.5 Embedded Systems
An embedded system is dedicated to one specific task. They are special purpose systems.

Embedded systems typically have their programs stored in ROM as opposed to auxiliary storage and RAM. These programs are referred to as firmware - a combination of software and hardware.

The Moon has no atmosphere due to its weak gravity. It is composed of a 800 km thick lithosphere, covering a core of thin magma. The moon is a complex body in the solar system. Moon rocks are composed of minerals including aluminum, calcium, magnesium, oxygen, silicon, and titanium. Some gases are also trapped in these rocks, such as hydrogen and helium. These gases are said to have reached the moon by solar wind From studying the moon astronauts have found two different types of rocks basalt and breccias. Basalt is formed from hardened lava. Breccias are formed from soil and rock that have been squeezed together when hit by falling objects. The moon’s composition has always been interesting to scientists because it is so different than Earth’s is. With information that has been discovers and found it makes it easier to know what and how the moon works.

The Moon has two types of landscapes: bright, cratered '''highlands''' in the south, and dark '''mare basins''' in the north. One side of the moon always faces the earth; this side has many more mare basins.
 
From Earth the moon appears smooth but that is not the case of the true surface. The geography of the moon is dominated by impact craters. There are about half a million craters with diameters greater than 1 km on the moon. Due to the fact that the moon’s has no atmosphere it takes millions of hits of steroids and other flying debris in the solar system. The Moon actually takes saves the Earth because if the moon was not there to take the hits from the asteroids, the asteroids would plow straight in the Earth.

Rilles (narrow valleys) on the Moon sometimes resulted from the formation of localized lava channels. These generally fall into three categories, consisting of sinuous, arcuate, or linear shapes. By following these meandering rilles back to their source, they often lead to an old volcanic vent. One of the most notable sinuous rilles is the Vallis Schröteri feature, located in the Aristarchus plateau along the eastern edge of Oceanus Procellarum. (Earth’s Moon)

Domes, a variety of shield volcanoes can be found in selected locations on the lunar surface, such as on Mons Rümker. These are believed to be formed by relatively viscous, possibly silica-rich lava, erupting from localized vents. The resulting lunar domes are wide, rounded, circular features with a gentle slope rising in elevation a few hundred meters to the midpoint. They are typically 8–12 km in diameter, but can be up to 20 km across. Some of the domes contain a small pit at their peak.

The major products of volcanic processes on the Moon are evident to the Earth-bound observer in the form of the lunar maria. The lunar Maria is the moon’s version of a sea. These are large flows of basaltic lava that correspond to low-albedo surfaces covering nearly a third of the near side. Only a few percent of the far side has been affected by mare volcanism. Even before the Apollo missions confirmed it, most scientists believed that the maria were lava-filled plains, since they possessed lava flow patterns and collapses attributed to lava tubes(


Primary lunar craters were caused by meteors. Secondary craters were caused by debris. Lunar craters have '''rays''' around the edges. These are caused by the debris from meteors: since the moon has weak gravity and no atmosphere, it sprays out for a long distance.

Erosion is much slower on the moon than on the Earth. It is estimated that Buzz Aldrin's footprint will last 10 million years!

[[Image:Mhumboldtianum.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Mare Humboldtianum.]]
The maria (plural of mare) were caused by big asteroids strikes which ruptured the Lunar crust and released internal lava to flow up into the impact craters and flood-fill the bottom of the crater out to the crater walls. The lava solidified into basalt, creating the large, dark basins. This iron-rich basalt creates tension in the maria basins. This sometimes causes the crust to crack, forming graben.

Early in the moon's history, meteoric impacts caused the surface to melt. The liquid lunar surface underwent differentiation: the heavier iron sunk, while lighter aluminum rose to the top. The core was kept liquid by radioactive heating from uranium, potassium, and thorium.

	{
	   System.out.println(&quot;Inside A&quot;);
    	}
  }
class B  extends A
{
    static public void test() 
	{
	   System.out.println(&quot;Inside B&quot;);
	}
}
public class methosover
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        A a = new A();
        B b = new B();
	a.test();
	b.test();
    }
}
The simple answer is that static methods are associated with the class itself, not with an instance of the class, so when you call test(), which version gets called depends on what class you call it on, 
a.test(); or b.test();
Output:
Inside A
Inside B

:Static methods can be ''hidden'', not ''overridden''. --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] ([[User talk:Spoon!|talk]]) 07:13, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

== Method overriding section ==

Can somebody fix the section on Method overriding?  It's very confusing and I am trying to figure out what it's saying.  I have no idea.  The grammar is very badly written and the sentences ambiguous. It's not very helpful for trying to learn Java, as I am doing.  -[[Special:Contributions/68.144.12.65|68.144.12.65]] ([[User talk:68.144.12.65|talk]]) 03:46, 18 October 2010 (UTC)
: Hm actually it's specifically this section:

:''In the above example 'obj' reference has the type MyClass on both line 1 and line 3. However the 'obj' reference points two different objects. On line 1 it references SubOfMyClass object, on line 3 it references MyClass object. So on line 5 which method will be called, method define in MyClass, or the method that defined in its subclasses. Because the 'obj' reference can point to object and all its sub object, and that will be known only at runtime, a table needs to be kept with all the possible method address to be called.''

:Can anyone figure out what they're trying to say there? -[[Special:Contributions/68.144.12.65|68.144.12.65]] ([[User talk:68.144.12.65|talk]]) 03:49, 18 October 2010 (UTC)

I'm '''Konrad Roeder''', a Senior Systems Design Engineer at T-Mobile and an author of technical books and newspaper articles in my spare time.  I have an MS in Computer Engineering and a BS in Computer Science.  I currently have my name on 8 patents with 8 more pending.  I live in North Bend, Washington.  I've been a long-time user of the Wikipedia, and have contributed to Wikipedia and am now interested in contributing to a few WikiBooks.  At first I was using it for my benefit.  Now, I feel it's time to give back and contribute by being a second-wave Wikipedian. 

I am currently working on this book:
*[[Wireless_Mesh_Networks]]

I have started this book, but need to do more research:
*[[Wireless_Mesh_Sensors]]

And, I'm helping out on these books:
*[[CCNA_Certification]]
*[[UMTS]]

Here are some interesting books I've found:
*[[Consciousness Studies]]
*[[Bypassing_Internet_Censorship]]
*[[Lucid_Dreaming]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Wireless mesh networking topics...==
&lt;pre&gt;
== Topics ==
  * Mesh network basics
  * Taxonomy of Mesh Types
    - WAN, LAN or PAN?
    - Indoor or Outdoor
    - Hierarchical or Distributive
    - Low Cost
    - Real-time Multimedia Capable
  * Design Parameters
    - Latency
    - Jitter
    - Throughput
    - Handover Speed
  * How many radios?
    - One
    - Two
    - Three or More
  * RF concerns 
    - Channel Reuse, C/I
    - Transmitter Mask, Adjacent Channel Interference
    - Link Budget
    - Transmit Power
    - Receive Sensitivity
  * What layers does it operate on?
    - Layer 2 (switched mesh)
    - Layer 3 (routed mesh)
    - Both Layer 2/3
  * Loop Prevention
  * Handoffs
    - Layer 2
    - Layer 3
  * Mesh network vendors (I have a list of 17 of them)
    - BelAir
    - Cisco
    - Nortel
    - Proxim
    - RoamAD
    - Sky Pilot
    - Strix
    - Tropos
  * Power to the Node
    - Light Pole
    - Mains
    - Solar
  * Mounting Options
    - Light Pole
    - Communications Tower
    - Rooftop
  * Known City-Wide Deployments
    - Philadelphia, PA
    - Mesa, AZ
    - Chandler, AZ
  * Example Configurations
  * Applicable Standards
    - 802.11k
    - 802.11r
    - 802.11s
    - 802.11v
    - WIMAX ?
    - ZigBee ?
&lt;/pre&gt;

Whenever I start learning about a topic, I am often amazed by the depth of knowledge of those who know about the topic. A whole book could probably write on any one of those subtopics. I bet a book could be written on all the different ways to use light poles as a mounting option for wireless mesh networks, or how the wireless mesh network was implemented in Mesa, AZ (the politics, development history, people, technical details, etc). So that was the longerish answer to your question, but yes, definitely. 

Best. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 07:04, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== Structural Review ==
Having taken a quick look at the structure, I'd say it looks quite good. I like how you have a navigation template at the top of each page. That will help the reader feel in control when reading the book. I am not as familiar with the topic as I'd like to be, but it looks to be a thorough outline. If appropriate knowledge is placed in the proper area, it looks as if it could be a great book. Great work! :) --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 19:18, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

== I'll be with you soon... ==

I've been just hopping on and off the last few days, but I have read your questions, and I'll reply soon :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:20, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

== Wireless Mesh Sensors ==

Dear Kgrr,

I am planning a sensor network project that will probably be wireless, so I am happy you started the [[Wireless Mesh Sensors]] wikibook.

However, I'm a big fan of the [http://communitywiki.org/BigBucketsFirst big buckets first] style of organizing.
So I'm going to start merging [[Wireless Mesh Sensors]] into a chapter of the [[Wireless Mesh Networks]] book.
Even though you and I both know that, someday, that &quot;Wireless Mesh Networks&quot; book will grow so large that we'll need to split it up again again later.

Thank you.

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 16:45, 22 February 2008 (UTC)

David,
I will start working on the [[Wireless Mesh Networks]] book now that I've finished a few key wikipedia articles that needed to be finished.  I would prefer that the [[Wireless Mesh Sensors]] and the [[Wireless Mesh Networks]] books be kept separate because they are really very different technologies although they share the mesh element.

== Possible deletion ==

Hi - an IP has marked some pages created by you for deletion &quot;at author's request&quot;.  I have a suspicious nature - can you confirm that you do want them deleted or remove the tags (they are wrongly named by the way but that can be sorted).  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:22, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for asking.  Do delete them.  Cheers!

== Page Moves ==

I think i understand your question. If you want to create a link to a page, use double-brackets, like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Communication Theory]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Or, to create a link to a page, you can write it like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Communication Theory/Introduction]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Now, for some trickery, if you want the link to say something different then the title of the page, you can write this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Communication Theory/Introduction|This is the introduction!]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

That will create a link that looks like this:

 [[Communication Theory/Introduction|This is the introduction!]]

I hope this helps you. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:04, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Sorting elements number limit of this algorithm */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a nice code example. However, for two reasons this implementation is not very practical:

(i) A really unfortunate choice is to require the type &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt;  to provide a &lt;tt&gt;swap&lt;/tt&gt;  method. Most types and classes do not provide &lt;tt&gt;swap&lt;/tt&gt;  as one of its methods, and most types and classes (including ''built-in'' types) are not open to the user for adding such a method. For example, the code cannot be used to sort a simple array of &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;s because of that. The standard way (and the STL way) is to use a binary function &lt;tt&gt;void swap(T&amp;,T&amp;)&lt;/tt&gt;. Such a function can always be provided ''without'' having to edit the type &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; (which is often not possible). Ideally, one should be able to choose the &lt;tt&gt;swap&lt;/tt&gt; function as argument of the algorithm.

(ii) The operator &lt;tt&gt; &gt;= &lt;/tt&gt; is used for comparison. This is not very flexible, especially in case one wants to use several different comparison criteria in the same code. A better way is to allow one to provide a comparison function to the sorting algorithm -- as is possible for the STL sorting algorithms. Moreover, the &quot;&gt;=&quot; could be changed to the more commonly used &lt;tt&gt;less&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

B.t.w: really bad style is &quot;&lt;tt&gt;if(!(POINTER &amp;&amp; NUMBER))&lt;/tt&gt;...&quot;

== Some issues regarding the current implementation. ==

First off, thanks for taking your time to comment on this implementation, I very much welcome your opinions.

Regarding your comments on the unfortunate choices:

Whilst struggling to decipher Dijkstra's original paper and actualy writing the code I took my sweet time to decide how to parameterize both the swapping and the comparison. Although its true, the STL does use a different approach, I don't see how this is by any means the &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;most appropiate&quot; way of doing things. As a matter of fact, and since the ultimate idea was to keep the code concise and direct, I believe making the implementation &quot;STL compliant&quot; would be too much work for nothing. Those of you who care to modify the code are more than welcome (I may be modifying this after all, but only if I find enough time to spare).

Along the same line: both the issues mentioned before can be easily solved if a &quot;wrapper&quot; class is implemented in place of the type parameter, even a parameterizable, STL compliant one. So this shouldn't be much of a problem.


Regarding your comments on &quot;style&quot;:

I must disagree on this. Although there are way too many manuals of &quot;style&quot; there's simply no point on it, reformat/rewrite the code if this bothers you, in this case in particular its a single line and everybody who has read a C language manual knows what that means (this is a C++ implementation of the algorithm after all).


All in all, although I regard your comments as details which should be taken care of, I very much appreciate and welcome them, if I find the time I'll re-write the implementation to suit your needs.


Cheers


== Changed the use of swap ==

I've changed the use of swap methods into swap functions. It was only used 4 places and doing so allows people to use the code on standard types without modifing the code in any way. I hope this is OK (given the discussion above, I believe it is). As to the use of &gt;= over &lt; -- I couldn't care less. The same goes to the use of &quot;bad style&quot;.
[[User:FrederikHertzum|FrederikHertzum]] ([[User talk:FrederikHertzum|talk]]) 22:58, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

== Request for comments on the algorithm ==

First of all, thank you very much for your code.

I transcribed the original EWD796 to LaTeX a while ago, in order to do the same but I found that the way Dijkstra described the algorithm and his style of pseudocode simple was too alien to me. I hope that your code will help me in studying the algorithm.

Would you (if you have the chance and time) care to comment on the workings of the algorithm? The code helps immensely, but having someone who has implemented the algorithm describe it as well, would be even better.

''Just to say, i'm also reading the paper and trying to write an implementation (this time in java), and it is indeed utterly baffling. Why on earth did Dijkstra think this guarded command notation of his was a good idea? Most of the constructs map simply enough to normal languages, so there's nothing he wouldn't have had in one of those languages, and it has subroutines rather than procedures, so it doesn't have parameters or return values, which is a huge stumbling block in the path of understanding. That and his really unhelpful single-letter variable names, and the fact that he uses a few variables in the code without mentioning them at all in the text (all the ones ending in -1 or -2). It's not as if this all predates decent languages, either - he wrote that paper in 1981. I can't see any reason for it except obscurantism and arrogance. -- AnonymousCoder''

== Comparison function should be external ==

Choice of using &quot;&gt;=&quot; as the comparison function, and including it directly in the algorithm is a semantic error, because it mix different things in the same form.
Extracting the comparison function is a difficulty, which shows the bad construction.
For example, let's imagine we have to sort a table, with several indexes. Obviously, we cannot build several &quot;&gt;=&quot; functions, and we do not want to use some 'tricks', or any complex construction. It would be much more easier (and clear) to select a comparison function for each index, if the algorithm could use these functions.


== Improvements for the Delphi version ==
The Delphi version of this algorithm does function perfectly, great, and many thanks to the diligent programmer for (t)his work! But there are improvements possible: The isascending function is redundant(ly?) completely, simple comparisons have the same effect and use the computer ressources less. Moreover the +1 and -1 instructions can be replaced by the more efficent instructions succ and pred, and the additions and subtractions used for the same value with inc and dec.

== Python version? ==
I'm wondering if someone could whip up a Python version of the algorithm that works. I've been unsuccessful in my attempts, and getting rather frustrated at my lack of progress...

== Improvements for this algorithm ==
1. The both while loops in the main body (function) can be replaced with simple for loops because the number of loopings is determined (before the loop entry).

2. The both boolean operations „if b&gt;=3 then“ in the main body or main function (building sorted array part) and „if b1&gt;=3 then“ in the trinkle procedure seem to be redundant (unnessecary) because both variables never get the value 2 (this is a result of many experiments with different, also large numbers of sorting elements).

== Sorting elements number limit of this algorithm ==
The number of sortable elements is limited when only 32 bit integers are used, especially with the 32th Leonardo number (7.049.155), and this number (ore one few) is the limitation for the number of sortable elements. Otherwise some variables have to be 64 bit integers, namly: b, b1, c, c1, p in the main procedure, vb and vc in the up and the down procedure and p1 in the trinkle procedure.</text>

==Wheel Alignment==
[[Image:Axle insertion tool.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Axle insertion tool]]

[[W:Wheel alignment|Wheel alignment]] is the process of aligning the wheel vertically ([[w:camber angle|camber]]) and parallel to the direction of travel ([[w:toe (automotive)|toe]] and steer angles). When properly aligned, the wheel will &quot;float&quot; in the middle of the axle when the car is moving. This will reduce friction at the contact points between the wheel hub and the body or axle head.

Before starting the alignment procedure, mark each axle head to identify it as the up position. Always insert the axle with the mark facing up in the 12 o'clock position. This will assure that any effects of a slight bend in the axle can be removed by shimming. Each axle and wheel should be aligned and run at the same position. Use a muffin tin or egg carton bottom to store the wheels and axles during alignment. Mark the container Left/Right Front/Rear and put any components that you aren't using for that alignment step in the appropriate place.

===Rough alignment===
[[Image:Axle alignment.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|Coarse axle alignment]]
The goal of coarse alignment is to create an axle insertion hole in which the axle can be inserted perpendicular to the vertical and horizontal axis of the car. 

Insert a single axle (without the wheel) in the car body. Do not use a hammer, instead place the axle partially into the hole and gently press it into the body. Grasp the car body firmly and press the axle head against a flat surface and insert the axle until about 7/16&quot; is protruding. The surface should not be hard or slippery; a wooden workbench is ideal. If you are using axle slots, an axle insertion tool can be useful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derbyworx.com/Tools_Pro_Axle_Guide.htm Pro Axle Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The axle should have a snug [[w:Interference fit|press fit]] in the axle hole. If the axle is too tight, don't force it. A small amount of wax can be used to for a particularly stubborn axle. A #44 drill bit (0.086 inch decimal equivalent) held between the thumb and forefinger can be used to gently ream the axle hole and remove any paint, glue or body putty that may have accumulated there. 

Check the angle between the axle and body using a small ruler. When the ruler is flat against the car and touching the axle, there should be no gap at the inner or outer part of the axle. If there is, shim or bend the axle (see below) until it is straight. 

===Fine alignment===
[[Image:PWD wheel axle closeup.jpg|left|thumb|300 px|Wheel and axle viewed from above with the wheel at the OUT position.]]
Fine alignment is accomplished by rolling the car back and forth on a flat, smooth surface and observing the behavior of the wheels. Observe and make changes to each wheel individually.

'''Camber''':  If the wheel moves to the axle nail head when the car is moved backward and forward, then that wheel has a ''negative'' camber; the axle head is angled upward and should be adjusted downward by shimming on the ''top'' of the axle.  If the wheel moves toward the body when the car is moved backward and forward, then that wheel has a ''positive'' camber; the axle head is angled downward and should be adjusted upward by shimming on the ''bottom'' of the axle. 

'''Toe/Steer''':  If the wheel moves to the body when the car is moved forward and to the axle head when the car is moved backward, then that wheel is ''toed in''; the axle head is angled forward and should be adjusted rearward by shimming on the ''front'' side of the axle. If the wheel moves to the axle head when the car is moved forward and to the body when the car is moved backward, then that wheel is ''toed out''; the axle head is angled backward and should be adjusted forward by shimming on the ''rear'' side of the axle.
{{clear}}

Alignment should be performed on a smooth, flat surface with a slight incline. The rise of the incline should be no more than 1/4&quot; inch over the course of several feet (half a degree or less of angle). The car will roll slowly or can be pushed gently down the slope. Place a stop at the top and bottom of the slope. 

[[Image:Wheel IN IN.gif|300 px|left|thumb|Wheel IN-IN. Diagram of pinewood derby car wheel alignment under conditions where the wheel moves in toward the body when the car rolls either forward or backward. The view is from the front of the car (the downward cant of the axle is exaggerated).]]

[[Image:Wheel OUT OUT.gif|300 px|right|thumb|Wheel OUT-OUT. Diagram of pinewood derby car wheel alignment under conditions where the wheel moves out when the car rolls either forward or backward. ]]

Alignment is accomplished with multiple trials of running the car down the slope with the front end facing down the slope or, in reverse, with the rear facing down the slope in the direction of travel. Allow the car to run about a foot down the slope and observe and record your observations for one of the wheels.  

Start with the front wheel; in the raised wheel configuration, concentrate on the wheel that is in contact with the track. First assure that the car moves straight down the track without turning in one direction or the other. Shim the axle (see below) to turn the wheel with respect to the car body so that the car tracks straight. 
{{clear}}

[[Image:Wheel OUT IN F.gif|350 px|left|thumb|Wheel OUT-IN, Here the car has just rolled forward and the view is from the top of the car.]]
[[Image:Wheel OUT IN R.gif|350 px|right|thumb|Wheel OUT-IN, car moving backward.]]

Once the car tracks straight, observe the &quot;IN-OUT&quot; behavior of the wheels. Here, IN is toward the body and OUT is away from the body. Perform two trials with the car facing forward. First, move the wheel in to touch the body and roll (or let the car roll) down the slope. Next, move the wheel to the end of the axle and repeat the forward trial. If the wheel moves from the inside to the outside, and stays at the outside when starting there, the result of this trial is OUT. Likewise, if the wheel moves from the outside to the inside, and stays at the inside when starting there, the result of the trial is IN. If the wheel stays put each time, the axle is aligned or nearly aligned.
{{clear}}

[[Image:Wheel IN OUT F.gif|350 px|left|thumb|Wheel IN-OUT, car moving forward.]]
[[Image:Wheel IN OUT R.gif|350 px|right|thumb|Wheel IN-OUT, car moving backward.]]

Reverse the car so that the rear is facing down the slope and repeat the trial to determine IN, OUT, or no movement. 

If the wheel always moves to the inside (IN-IN), this means that the axles are canted downward and the downward force of the body tends to move the wheels in no matter which way the car is rolling. Shim or bend the axle slightly upward and repeat the trials.

If the wheel always moves to the outside (OUT-OUT) it is canted upward and must be shimmed or bent downward.

If the wheel moves out when the car is facing forward and in when facing backward (OUT-IN), this is an indication of rearward cant. Shim or bend the axle forward.

If the wheel moves in facing forward and out facing backward (IN-OUT), the axle is canted forward and should be shimmed or bent to a more rearward facing angle.

The axle angle should be changed slowly with repeated trials after small adjustments. Concentrate on one wheel at a time and use a pencil and notepad to record the results of the trials.

===Wax paper shimming===
[[Image:PWD Shimming.gif|300 px|right|thumb|Diagram of the wax paper shimming method (note that the dimensions are exaggerated).]]
[[Image:Wax paper wheel shim.jpg|300 px|thumb|left|Wax paper wheel shim.]]
[[Image:PWD Shimmed axle.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|Wax paper wheel shim inserted into the axle hole and bent back against the car body. As shown, the shim will rotate the angle of the axle toward the front to compensate for a rearward cant of the axle (the front of the car is facing left). ]]

The wax paper shimming method&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.stanpope.net/lbw1.htm Learn to Build A Winner by Stan Pope]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinewoodprofessor.com/ Pinewood derby speed secrets] by Dave Corr&lt;/ref&gt; relies on small strips of wax paper inserted into the axle holes to change the angle of the axle. Cut a few dozen strips of wax paper 1/8&quot; by 1/2&quot;. Bend the shim slightly along the long axis and insert it into the axle hole 1/8&quot; and bend it back along the car body. Place the shim on the side of the axle opposite to the direction you want the axle to move. For example, if the axle is canted downward and you want to angle it back up, place the shim(s) at the bottom of the axle (6 o'clock position). If the axle is canted forward, shim forward, if it is canted backward, shim back. If the axle is tilted upward, place the shim at the 12 o'clock position.

Place one shim at a time and work on one wheel at a time while checking the IN/OUT behavior of the wheel. Keep track of how many shims are placed and their location (12 , 3, 6, 9 o'clock positions) in each axle hole. If a set of shims falls out or is damaged, simply replace them with the same number of new shims and the axle alignment should be comparable. 

Once the alignment is compete, remove the excess wax paper by trimming with a sharp [[w:Utility knife|utility knife]]. Use care to avoid scratching the axles and be sure that there are no wax paper scraps inside the hub. 

Wax paper is approximately one one-thousandth of an inch thick (25 µm). Neglecting compression, a single thickness of shim should change the axle angle 0.1 degrees.

==Axle Lubrication==
Lubricants are used on the wheel-axle and wheel-body contact areas. 

===Dry lubricants===
[[Image:Graphite powder.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|Graphite powder lubricant.]]

;Graphite:Powdered [[w:graphite|graphite]] is one of the most common dry lubricants for Derby racing. [[w:alkyd|Alkyd]]-based graphite lubricating paint such as &quot;EZ-Slide&quot; can also be used.
[[Image:Graphite moly.jpg|thumb|250 px|left|Graphite powder with molybdenum disulfide lubricant.]]
;Molybdenum disulfide:[[w:Molybdenum disulfide|Molybdenum disulfide]] is a dry lubricant similar to graphite. Commercially it is known under the names &quot;Moly Lube&quot; and &quot;Dri-slide&quot;  and is used for lubrication for guns, automobiles and bicycles. It is also an excellent lubricant for pinewood derby applications. Moly/graphite mixtures are also used.

;Teflon:[[w:Teflon|Teflon]] is the trade name for polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymer. Powdered Teflon is a common Derby car lubricant.
{{clear}}

===Liquid lubricants===
[[Image:Nyoil.jpg|thumb|150 px|right|Nyoil II synthetic hydrocarbon lubricant.]]
;Krytox:[[w:Krytox|Krytox]] oils and greases are [[w:perfluoropolyether|perfluoropolyether]] (PFPE) synthetic lubricants made by [[w:DuPont|DuPont]]. Krytox 100 is an ISO Grade 5 oil with a [[w:coefficient of friction|coefficient of friction]] of 0.08 that has been used in pinewood derby racing ([http://msds.dupont.com/msds/pdfs/EN/PEN_09004a2f800063fd.pdf MSDS]).

;Nyoil:Nyoil II is a general purpose lightweight synthetic [[w:hydrocarbon|hydrocarbon]] oil that has been used with pinewood derby racers ([http://www.nyelubricants.com/pdf/nyoil_ii_copy.pdf MSDS]).

;Silicone:[[w:Silicone|Silicone]] is liquid lubricant that has been used with Derby racers. Not to be confused with the element [[w:silicon|silicon]], silicones are [[w:Silicone|polysiloxanes]], an organic/inorganic [[w:polymer|polymer]]. Note that the carrier solvent in some spray silicon lubricants can melt the wheel plastic.
{{clear}}

===Spray on lubricants===
[[Image:Graphite spray paint.jpg|thumb|200 px|left|Spray on graphite paint]]
[[Image:Graphite spray paint closeup.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Closeup of graphite painted surface; the horizontal axis is about 6 mm. ]]
[[w:alkyd|Alkyd]] based graphite spray paint in [[w:naptha|naptha]] and [[w:mineral spirits|mineral spirits]] carrier ([http://www.agspecialty.com/95120.pdf MSDS]) can be used to paint axles and portions of the car body with a thin graphite coating. Care should be taken with this spray since the naptha may dissolve plastic and paint. When the carrier solvent evaporates, the alkyd resin hardens and holds the graphite in place. Graphite coating is used on lawn mowers and farm equipment to keep cuttings and other material from sticking. 
{{clear}}

===Bushings===
[[Image:Axle bushing.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Stick-on graphite axle bushing]]
A simple bushing can be made from graphite tape:  sticky on one side and graphite on the other. The bushing is stuck to the car body before the axle is inserted. When it is in place, the inner axle hub will rub against the bushing rather than the car body should the wheel move inward. A similar effect can be achieved by painting the portion of the body near the axle with graphite spray paint.

{{TOC}}
Pinewood derby wheels are made by an [[w:injection molding|injection molding]] process that leaves undesirable blemishes and imperfections in the parts. Since the wheels are the only moving parts, their quality has a significant effect on performance. Stock wheels are 1.190 inch diameter and 0.415 inch wide with a 0.310 wide tread contact area. This chapter covers selecting wheels, sanding, shaving or lathing the tread, coning the hubs, polishing the bores, balancing and, as a final touch, highlighting the spokes and raised letters. As always, know the [[How To Build a Pinewood Derby Car/Rules|rules]] of your organization before starting your work. 
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

==Mold matching==
[[Image:mold_number_closeup.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Closeup of pinewood derby wheel from mold #4.]]
[[Image:pinewood_wheel_mold.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|A lathed pinewood derby wheel from mold #4.]]
BSA car wheels are pressed from 18 different [[w:Injection_moulding|molds]], each with slightly different characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maximum-velocity.com/wheelaxleqa.htm Maximum Velocity Wheel/Axle Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derbychamp.com/580.htm Derby Champ Premium Mold Matched Wheels Information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinewoodpro.com/pinewood-derby-car-matched-wheels.htm Pinewood Derby Car Matched BSA Wheel Set]&lt;/ref&gt; The wheels are split up and packed into boxes randomly, but the best performance results are often obtained from wheels from the same select mold. 

Out of round wheels can be corrected by lathing or shaving. Some wheels have a particularly bad wobble that can set up vibrations even when the wheels are lathed, balanced and run on polished axles. If you suspect that you have such a wheel, it may be advisable to discard it and use a wheel from a different kit. Note that a particular mold number does not assure a particular performance characteristic due to run-to-run variation within that mold. Always test your wheels and discard those that perform poorly no matter what the mold.
{{clear}}

==Sanding and Shaving==
[[Image:Sprue gate trim.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|Mold mark ([[w:sprue (molding)|sprue]] gate trim) on a stock BSA wheel]]
[[Image:Wheel shaver.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Wheel shaver for trueing and rounding.]]
The simplest wheel treatment is sanding. Here, the wheel is held in a [[w: mandrel|mandrel]] and inserted in the [[w:Chuck (engineering)|chuck]] of a drill or drill press. Sandpaper is used to dress the wheel tread surface to remove the [[w:Sprue (molding)|sprue]] gate trim and leave the outer surface of the wheel flat.
{{clear}}

==Lathing==
[[Image:Pinewood lathed wheel front.jpg|thumb|200 px|left|Front view of lathed wheel]]
[[Image:Pinewood lathed wheel side.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Side view of lathed wheel]]
[[Image:Turned wheel tread.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Outer tread area of a lathed wheel]]

Lathe work on a pinewood derby car wheel can range from simple truing of the outer diameter to the removal of substantial quantities of material from the wheel. A lathe can also be used to cut a V or H tread pattern in the wheel.
[[File:H-pattern.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Example of wheel lathed in H Pattern.  Less surface area contacting track means less drag, which translates to less energy lost.]]

Light wheels are advantageous because a large fraction of the kinetic energy of the car is contained in the rotational energy of the wheel (see the [[How_To_Build_a_Pinewood_Derby_Car/Physics|Physics]] chapter). Light wheels mean less rotational energy in the wheels and therefore more linear speed. True wheels mean less wobble and straight tracking. You want the wheel to remain in the middle of the axle and have the minimum contact with the car body and axle head.

==Coning==
[[Image:Hub tool.jpg|thumb|250 px |left|Wheel bore ream and coning tool.]]
[[Image:Coned wheel.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|Stock wheel (left) and coned wheel (right)]]
Wheel coning is the process of modification of the inside wheel hub to reduce hub-to-body contact area and thereby the drag. Although the hub should not ride on the body, it will make intermittent contact as the car moves down the track. 

The hub can be coned using a lathe, a [[w:rotary tool|rotary tool]]  or drill press with a grinder bit, or a special [[How_To_Build_a_Pinewood_Derby_Car/Tools#Hub_tool|hub tool]] for pinewood derby wheels. When the plastic has been removed, the hub surface should be sanded first with #220 and then #400 sandpaper and buffed with a plastic polish. The polish can also be used on the body where the hub makes contact and be sure to use lubricant here as well.
{{clear}}

==Bore reaming and polishing==
[[Image:Bore polishing tool.jpg|left|thumb|250 px|Wheel bore polishing tool]]
[[Image:Micro gloss.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|Micro-gloss plastic polish]]
[[Image:Wheel mandrel.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|Wheel mandrel for holding wheel in drill chuck]]
Polishing the inner surface of the hub can reduce friction between the wheel and axle. Bore polishing kits consist of a cylindrical tool that mounts in the chuck of a drill and has two prongs that hold a pipe cleaner. A liquid abrasive with 1 μm (0.001 mm) [[w:aluminum oxide|aluminum oxide]] abrasive crystal is used to polish the bore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.micro-surface.com/default.cfm?page_id=90&amp;ID=3MG2&amp;storeid=1 Micro-gloss Abrasive]&lt;/ref&gt; The polish can be used with the pipe cleaner holding tool or with a pipe cleaner or cloth alone. The abrasive is capable of removing scratches down to 5 μm (micromesh 4000)  The aluminum oxide abrasive also makes an excellent polish for the car's paint.

Note: &lt;u&gt;Do not use a high-speed rotary tool for wheel polishing!&lt;/u&gt; You can easily melt the plastic wheel due to the friction at high RPM. Use a variable speed drill at low speed or polish by hand.
{{clear}}

==Balancing==
[[Image:Wheel balancing tool.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|Wheel balancing tool]]
With balanced wheels, an equivalent mass is distributed about the axle slot. To balance a wheel using a static wheel balancer, insert the rod through the wheel and suspend the wheel in the wheel balancing tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rlnmachining.com/instructions.htm Precision Wheel Balancer]&lt;/ref&gt; Suspended in the magnetic bearings, the wheel will rotate so that the heaviest part is at the bottom. Mark the wheel, remove it from the device and remove a small amount of the material from the heavy side using sandpaper or a sharp knife (e.g. [[w:X-acto|X-acto]] knife) . Remove material from the inside of the wheel by scraping or sanding so that the tread area remains unaffected. Replace the wheel in the tool and repeat the balancing procedure until the wheel remains stationary in any position. 
{{clear}}

==Wheel Alignment==
See [[How_To_Build_a_Pinewood_Derby_Car/Assembly#Wheel_Alignment|Assembly:  Wheel Alignment]].

==Painting the spokes and letters==
Painting the mock [[w:wire wheels|wire wheels]] silver and raised letters white won't make your car go any faster, but it will make it look better. Use a silver enamel model paint and a fine brush to paint the spokes.  The brush should be nearly dry and gently touch the side of the brush to paint the raised spokes. To paint the raised letters, paint a small area of paper with white enamel and use the wheel like a stamp on a [[w:stamp pad|stamp pad]] to pick up a small amount of the paint on the letters. Let the paint dry thoroughly before doing any more work with the wheels.

{{TOC}}
This chapter covers designing the car, setting the wheelbase and drilling the axle holes, cutting out the block, adding weight holes, sanding, and painting. At the end of this process, you will have a car body that weighs approximately 4.25 ounces that is painted and is ready for the insertion of wheels and axles. If you are not ''absolutely'' sure about what is allowed in your pack, district, or other organization's rules, now is the time to find out. Remember, there is no single set of rules and there is wide variation among the different sets. Get a hard copy of your organization's latest rules and if you have any questions, ask. Of particular importance in this chapter is whether the stock wheelbase and axle slots must be used. Another issue is the weight of the wheels. If your organization allows light wheels, you will need up to one-third of an ounce of additional weight in the body to make up for the reduced wheel weight. 

==Designing the car==
[[Image:Standard Block Template.gif|left|thumb|250 px|Standard wheelbase (right is usually front}]]
[[Image:Extended Block Template.gif|right|thumb|250 px|Extended wheelbase]]
The standard pinewood derby block is approximately 7.0 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 1.25 inches tall.  It has a typical density of 0.0138 lbs/in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boysdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/bsa_block.pdf BSA Standard Block - Dimensions and Mass Properties]&lt;/ref&gt; The block is supplied unsanded with grooves cut on the bottom side to accept the axles. The blocks weigh approximately 3.4 ounces.

The first step in designing your car is picking the wheelbase. If the rules of your race do not specify that the original wheelbase or axle slots must be used, it is often possible to improve car performance using the longest wheelbase. WIth a long wheelbase, the weight can be moved further to the back while still remaining forward of the rear axle and errors in wheel alignment will affect the long wheelbase car less since it has a larger turning radius for a given angular wheel deflection. The standard pinewood derby [[w:wheelbase|wheelbase]] is about 4.5 inches. The extended wheelbase is 5.75 inches with the wheels 5/8 inch from the end of the 7 inch block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinewoodpro.com/pinewood-derby-quad-dual-block-2.htm Precision Drilled Block]&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the standard wheelbase is required by the rules, it may be possible to move the rear axle back by cutting off the back of the block, leaving 5/8 inch between the axle slot and the back of the block, and gluing the removed piece to the front of the car. 

A [[commons:Image:PWD_Template.pdf|design template]] may be useful for designing your car. There are templates available online (both free&lt;ref&gt;[http://boysdad.com/archives/409 Free Pinewood Derby Plans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.simplyweb.net/bosworth/template.htm Car Outline Cutting Guides]&lt;/ref&gt; and commercial&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinewoodpro.com/pinewood-derby-howto-design.htm Pinewood Derby Car Design Help]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maximum-velocity.com/pinewood_derby_car_plans.htm Winning Pine Derby Car Plans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc-pinewood-derby.com/pinewood-car-designs.htm Pinewood Derby Car Designs]&lt;/ref&gt;) Keep in mind where the weights will go and how much space you will need. Remember that you want the [[w:center of mass|center of gravity]] to the rear and low.

==Drilling the Axle Slots==
[[Image:Drillpress.jpg||thumb|250px|left|A drill press is useful for drilling holes for axle and weight insertion holes.]]
[[Image:Axle hole tool.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pinewood derby car axle hole drilling jig.]]
Axles can be installed in slots or holes. Unless installation in the original slot is required, a drilled axle hole will make wheel and axle alignment easier. If the axle slots must be used, you should still drill a pilot hole in the slot to assure that it is the correct size. The holes should be drilled with a #44 bit (0.086 inch decimal equivalent) for a 0.087 inch axle. A #43 (0.089 inch decimal equivalent) can be used for oversize axles or pre-1999 car kits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/20000118165256/www.geocities.com/~pack215/pwd-newkit.html New pinewood derby kits in 1999/2000]&lt;/ref&gt; The bit should be held in a drill press or, if one is not available, an axle hole jig can be used.

The performance of the car can often be improved if one wheel (typically front) is raised approximately 1/32 to 1/16 inch on the car body. This wheel is not in contact with the track and doesn't spin, thus (ideally) the [[w:rotational energy|rotational energy]] is lower and translational [[w:kinetic energy|kinetic energy]] (and speed) is higher (see the chapter on [[How To Build a Pinewood Derby Car/Physics|Physics]] for more information). Note that the wheel-to-axle [[w: friction|friction]] is not reduced since the car's weight is distributed on three rather than four axles. The raised wheel may still contact the guide rail and, if it contacts the track, energy is expended when the wheel spins up to speed. The smoother the track, the greater the three-wheel advantage.

==Cutting out the block==
[[Image:Cut pinewood block.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Marked block]]
[[Image:Coping saw.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Coping saw]]
After you have settled on a design, drilled the axle holes and decided where the weights will go, it is time to cut out the block. Use a pencil to mark the cuts and use a [[w:coping saw|coping saw]], [[w:scroll saw|scroll saw]] or [[w:band saw|band saw]] to cut the block. The venerable wedge or &quot;flying doorstop&quot; design can be created with a single cut of a [[w:Mitre_saw|miter saw]]. After cutting, a [[w:File (tool)|wood file]] or [[w:rasp|rasp]] or a hand held rotary tool, such as the [[w:dremel|Dremel Moto-tool]] can be used to round edges and add detail. A small amount of wood [[w:whittling|whittling]] can be used to good effect.

Once the overall shape of the block has been achieved, use [[w:sand paper|sand paper]] to create a smooth surface. Start with coarse (50 to 60 grit), and move on to finer grit (150 to 220). 

It is often easier to cut the weight holes (see below) before cutting out the body.
{{clear}}

==Adding weight ==
[[Image:wedge_block.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The bottom of a wedge body with holes drilled for weights.]]
Before painting the block, you will want to add enough weight to bring the block, wheels, axles, and any accessories to about 4.9 ounces. Do not go over this weight; it is easier to add weight than to take it away, especially if you plan ahead. 

The best car designs typically have the [[w:center of gravity|center of gravity]] (balance point) such that most of the weight is over the rear wheels. A center of mass 1 to 1.25 inches in front of the rear axle is readily achieved and gives good performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.three-peaks.net/pinecar.htm Ol' Buffalo Pine Car Page]&lt;/ref&gt; A rear bias places more of the downward force on the rear wheels and less on the front wheels (one of which may be raised anyway&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanpope.net/scfair.html Learn to Build A Winner by Stan Pope: How To Improve A Pinewood Derby Racing Car]&lt;/ref&gt;) Another positive effect of rear weight bias is the slightly greater [[w:potential enery|potential energy]] that results from the car center of mass starting at a greater height above the flat portion of the track. However, if the weight is too far to the rear, the nose of the car may lift and the car may jump the track. This is a greater problem on older wood tracks. On S-shaped tracks with a gently sloping start, a front bias can be helpful for quick acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanpope.net/lbw3a.htm#3a_30 Learn to Build A Winner by Stan Pope: Science 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several materials and a number of different kinds of weights can be used and each requires planning for proper placement. 

;Lead:[[w:lead|Lead]] is the one of the most often used weighting materials for [[w:pinewood derby|pinewood derby]] cars. Lead can be easily cut to achieve the desired weight. Drawbacks are its toxicity, especially the fumes when heated. Melting and pouring lead is not recommended due to dust and fume inhalation and the possibility of splashing onto the eyes and skin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/dos/leaddocs/lead_firing.htm The Airborne Lead Hazard]&lt;/ref&gt; A 3/8&quot; diameter lead wire weighs one ounce for every 1-1/2&quot;.

[[Image:Weights_for_Pinewood_Derby_01218.jpg|right|thumb|250px|One 0.9 ounce lead weight (left) and two 0.5 ounce tungsten weights (right).]]
;Tungsten:[[w:tungsten|Tungsten]] is about 70% more dense than [[w:lead|lead]] (19.25  g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;compared to 11.34 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and therefore gives you the same weight in about 40% less volume. Another benefit is that, unlike lead, tungsten is not toxic. On the other hand, tungsten is hard and difficult to machine, so addition and subtraction of weight must be done by adding and subtracting tungsten ball bearings or powder. Two half-ounce 3/8&quot; diameter tungsten cylinders is just over 3/4&quot; end-to-end. 

;Zinc:[[w:Zinc|Zinc]] is less dense than either lead or tungsten (7.14  g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), but it is not toxic and can be cast into parts that can be attached to the car with screws or nails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinewoodpro.com/weight-sets.htm Pinewood Derby Car Weights]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard wheel and axle set weight about 0.65 ounces, therefore a good target weight for the block prior to wheel and axle insertion is 4.25 ounces. Put the block, wheels,and axles on the scale and add weights until the total is about 4.9 ounces. This leaves a tenth of an ounce to add prior to weigh-in; remember that it is almost always easier to add weight than to subtract it. At this point, make sure that you have a plan for bringing the car up to weight after painting and installing the wheels and that you can easily adjust the weight during the weigh-in process. Adhesive weights can be used, but it is critical that the correct guide rail clearance is maintained under the car. If you do not want to add weight to the top of the car, you should have a recessed area for weights underneath.

Weight holes can be cut using a [[w:Drill_bit#Lip_and_spur_drill|brad point]] drill bit either from the rear or across the car body. Use a [[w:Drill#Drill_press|drill press]] or use care with a hand drill. The brad point drill bit (also called the ''lip and spur'' or ''dowelling bit'') is a variation of the twist drill which is optimized for drilling in wood. Conventional twist drill bits do tend to wander when presented to a flat workpiece.

Center the weights in the body and glue them in place. Add body filler or wood putty and sand smooth. The center of mass of the body can be determined by placing the body on top of a drill bit and moving it back and forth in [[w:seesaw|seesaw]] fashion until the balance point is reached.

[[Image:PWD Truck.jpg|left|thumb|300 px|Pinewood derby truck design.]]
Once the block is at the proper weight with axle holes or axle slot pilot holes drilled, it can be painted. Use a good wood [[w:primer|primer]] and sand between coats with 400 and 600 grit wet or dry sandpaper that has been dipped in water. When the primer has been applied, a [[w:Aerosol paint|spray paint]] for [[w:Plastic model|plastic model]] or general applications can be used. 

Windows can be added using silver [[w:Enamel paint|enamel]] with black frames, [[w:Headlamp|headlights]] in yellow and [[w:taillight|tail lights]] in red. [[w:decal|Decals]] or stickers can be used for additional decoration. 

Be creative, have fun, but give the block a few days to a week to dry before assembly. 

Waxing your paint will make for less wheel braking friction also before assembly. A small amount of graphite spray paint can be applied to the point where the hub contacts the car body.

{{TOC}}
[[w:pinewood derby|Pinewood derby]] axles are one inch long, 0.087 inch diameter [[w:zinc|zinc]] plated steel nails. The minimal axle treatment is the removal of the burrs and crimp marks with a file, followed by sanding and polishing. When it is allowed by the [[How To Build a Pinewood Derby Car/Car construction rules|rules]], the axle shaft can be cut with grooved and the head tapered. The grooves reduce the contact area between the axle and wheel hub bore and tapering reduces the contact area between the axle head and the outer hub. 

The steps to axle preparation are

*File to remove burr and crimp marks
*Straighten 
*Bevel (if desired)
*Notch (if desred)
*FIle, sand and polish 

Note the difference between the [[w:axle|axle]], [[w:Axel jump|axel]] and [[w:Axl Rose|axl]].

==Straightening==
[[Image:stock_axle.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Stock pinewood derby car axle.]]
[[Image:Axle Press.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Axle press - straightening and beveling tool.]]
Straightening the axle is best accomplished using an axle press or with a small hammer and [[w:anvil|anvil]] such as on a [[w:vise (tool)|bench vise]]. In either case, the worst of the burr and crimp material near the axle head should be filed off by hand or with the axle [[w:Chuck (engineering)|chucked]] into a [[w:rotary tool|rotary tool]] or [[w:hand drill|hand drill]].

With an anvil, hold the axle flat against the face with the nail head over the edge. Rotate the axle until you can see a slight gap between the face and axle then gently tap near the head. Continue rotating the axle and gently tap around the axle. Check the axle straightness by chucking it into the drill and observing the runout as it rotates. If you are running a raised wheel car, select the axle with the most runout for the raised wheel position.
 
The axle press is an anvil split in two with a hole for the axle and an indentation for the axle head. A hammer is used to tap the head into the indentation and [[w:forge|forge]] the angle in the head. The press has a flat side and an indented side. To straighten the axle, first make a mark on the nail head. Insert the axle into the flat side of the press with the mark at the 12 o'clock position. Place the axle press on its side and strike it several times with a hammer, then rotate to the 4 o'clock position. Hammer, rotate to the 8 o'clock position, then hammer again.

==Beveling and tapering==
[[Image:Pinewood Derby Stock Axle Closeup.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Closeup of stock pinewood derby car axle showing stamp marks (left) and nail head burr (lower right).]]
[[Image:Dremel300+400.JPG|200 px|right|thumb|Rotary tools useful for axle work]]
Axles can be beveled or tapered with a file, axle press, or [[w:lathe|lathe]]. To taper with a file, clamp the axle in the chuck of a drill or drill press. Hold the file at an angle near the axle head. It is helpful to clamp the drill in a vise to hold the axle steady. A drill press is highly useful here, but excellent results can be obtained with hand held tools. 

To bevel the axle with the Derby Worx Pro axle press, place the press on a flat surface with the indentation facing upward and insert the axle with the notch at the 12 o'clock. Hammer lightly on the axle head. Repeat the process at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions. If you do not want a beveled axle head, use the opposite flat side of the axle press to straighten the axle head.

If you are fortunate to have both access to a lathe and the appropriate skills, bevels, grooves and any number of axle and wheel modifications can be performed. Since such use is rare in car construction, details of such processes will be omitted.

==Notches and grooves==
[[Image:Notch axle.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|A notched and polished pinewood derby axle.]]
[[Image:Pinewood Derby Lathed Axle.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Grooved and graphite coated axle.]]
Axles can be notched with grooved to reduce the contact area between the axle and the wheel. This won't directly reduce the friction because the downward force is distributed over a smaller area (see the [[How To Build a Pinewood Derby Car/Physics|Physics]] chapter). However, the groove can also serve as a lubricant reservoir and make it easier to get a good coating of lubricant on the axle.

You can use a metal file to make a 1/4&quot; groove that is 3/16&quot; from the axle head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinewoodprofessor.com/ Pinewood derby speed secrets] by Dave Corr&lt;/ref&gt; This process requires a lathe, drill press or rotary tool bench mount and a jig that will hold the file perpendicular to the axle shaft at the proper point. Remove a small amount (about 0.01&quot;) with the file and polish the axle using the method below. If you choose to purchase a lathed axle (check your pack rules to see whether this is allowed), you should polish it as well, starting with the finer grit sandpaper.
{{clear}}

==Polishing==
[[Image:PWD axle jig.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|A rotary tool wrapped in a shop cloth and clamped in a bench vise for axle polishing.]]
Polishing should be done last, after straightening, beveling and notching. Put the axle in the chuck of a rotary tool or drill with about 1/2&quot; of the axle showing. A rotary tool wrapped in a shop towel and gently clamped into a bench vise makes an excellent axle polishing lathe. 

Start with a file to gently remove any burr material that you missed in the above steps then move on to [[w: sandpaper|sandpaper]].

Use wet/dry sandpaper starting with CAMI 400 grit (30 [[w: Micrometre|micron]] = 30 μm = 0.03 mm). Cut the sandpaper into 1/4&quot; strips that are several inches long. Dip the paper in water and sand the exposed portion of the axle for approximately 30 seconds with the axle rotating at high speed. Don't forget to polish under the axle head. Folding the sandpaper in half can help here. Proceed to 600, 1200, and 1500 grit sandpapers. Cushioned abrasives are available down to 3 micron grit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.micro-surface.com/default.cfm?page_id=174 Micro-mesh sandpaper]&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond paste polishes are available from 45 μm down to 0.1 μm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tedpella.com/polish.htm Polishing Compounds, Paste, Sprays, Suspensions]&lt;/ref&gt;

After sanding to about 3 - 5 micron grit with sandpaper, use a shop rag with a small amount of metal polish to get a shiny finish.

Take the axle out of the chuck and rub away any remaining grit or polish.

==Oversize axles==
Official BSA axles are 0.087 inch diameter. A slightly oversize axle can reduce wheel wobble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanpope.net/pwfrictn.htm Pinewood Derby Wheel-Axle Friction by Bob Barga]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickel plating==
[[Image:Speed axle.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Nickel-plated pinewood derby car &quot;speed&quot; axle]]
Stock BSA axles are [[w: zinc|zinc]] plated. [[w:Nickel|Nickel]] plated &quot;speed&quot; axles can be polished to a smoother finish than zinc.

'''Thrips''' (Order '''Thysanoptera''') are tiny, slender insects with fringed wings (thus the scientific name, from the Greek ''thysanos'' (fringe) + ''pteron'' (wing)). Other common names for thrips include '''thunderflies''', '''thunderbugs''' and '''corn lice'''. Thrips species feed on a large variety of sources both plant and animal by puncturing them and sucking up the contents. A large number of thrips species are considered pests, because they feed on plants with commercial value.  Some species of thrips feed on other insects or mites and are considered beneficial, while some feed on fungal spores or pollen. So far around 5,000 species have been described.

Thrips are generally tiny (1 mm long or less) and are not good flyers, although they can be carried long distances by the wind. In the right conditions, many species can explode in population and swarm everywhere, making them an irritation to humans.

Like the word ''sheep'', the word ''thrips'' is used in both the singular and plural numbers. So while there may be many thrips there can also be a solitary thrips. The word thrips is from Greek, meaning ''wood louse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W. D. J. Kirk |year=1996 |title=Thrips: Naturalists' Handbooks 25 |publisher=The Richmond Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms and Signs==
[[Image:Ponticulothrips diospyrosi.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Thrips on finger]]
Many thrips are pests of commercial crops due to the damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables which causes discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop.

Thrips in the genera ''Frankliniella'' (flower thrips) and ''Thrips'' also spread plant diseases through the transmission of viruses, such as Tospoviruses. The western flower thrips, ''Frankliniella occidentalis'', has a worldwide distribution and is considered the primary vector of plant diseases caused by Tospoviruses. Over 20 plant infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world. Virus members include the [[../Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus]] and the [[../Impatiens Necrotic Spot Virus/]]es.

==Ecology==
Thrips feed by piercing plant cells with their paired maxillary stylets, which form a feeding tube. Thrips, unlike the Hemiptera, have only one mandibular stylet, or if a second is present it is greatly reduced and non functional. The one fully formed mandibular stylet is used to pierce an entry hole in plant cells or pollen grains, wherein the maxillary stylets can easily enter the cell and suck out the contents. Thrips feed on hundreds of different crop plants, especially during flowering where they also feed on pollen.

[[Image:Thysanoptera-thripidae-sp.gif|thumb|right|Thysanoptera diagram|250px]]To survive the winter temperatures most thrips species over-winter as either adults or as pupae under ground litter. A typical flower thrips generation time will be from 7 to 22 days depending on the temperature. The eggs are about 0.2 mm long and reniform (kidney shaped), and may take on average 3 days to hatch. Thrips have 2 larval stages then go through a prepupal and a pupae stage, with the adults taking 1 to 4 days to reach sexual maturity. In the two suborders, the females of the Suborder Terebrantia are equipped with an ovipositor which they use to cut slits into plant tissue into which they insert their eggs, one per slit, while females of the Suborder Tubulifera lack an ovipositor and lay their eggs singly or in small groups on the outside surface of plants.

'''''Capsicum''''' is a genus of plants from the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Some of the members of Capsicum are used as spices, vegetables, and medicines. The fruit of Capsicum plants have a variety of names depending on place and type. They are commonly called chilli pepper, red or green pepper, or just pepper in Britain and the US; the large mild form is called bell pepper in the US, capsicum in Australian English and Indian English, and paprika in some other countries (although paprika can also refer to the powdered spice made from various capsicum fruit).

Capsicums originated in the Americas, but are now grown worldwide. The name given to the fruits varies between English-speaking countries. 

In Australia, New Zealand and India, heatless species are called &quot;capsicums&quot; while hot ones are called &quot;chilli/chillies&quot;. The term &quot;bell peppers&quot; is rarely used, usually in reference to C. annuum and other varieties which look like a &quot;capsicum&quot; or bell but are fairly hot.

In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada, the heatless varieties are called &quot;peppers&quot;, &quot;sweet peppers&quot; or &quot;capsicums&quot; (or &quot;green peppers,&quot; &quot;red peppers,&quot; etc.) while the hot ones are &quot;chilli/chillies&quot; or &quot;chilli peppers&quot;.  

In the United States, the common heatless species is referred to as &quot;bell peppers,&quot; &quot;sweet peppers,&quot; &quot;red/green/etc peppers,&quot; or simply &quot;peppers&quot;, while the hot species are collectively called &quot;chile/chiles,&quot; &quot;chili/chilies,&quot; or &quot;chili/chile peppers&quot; (one L only), &quot;hot peppers&quot;, or named as a specific variety (e.g., banana pepper).  In many midwestern regions of the United States the Sweet Bell Pepper is commonly called a mango &lt;ref&gt;http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/mango&lt;/ref&gt;  With the modern advent of fresh tropical fruit importers exposing a wider latitude of individuals to the tropical fruit variety of the Mango, this definition is becoming archaic.  However many menus still call a stuffed Bell Pepper a ''Mango''.

The name &quot;pepper&quot; came into use because the plants were hot in the same sense as the condiment black pepper, ''[[w:Piper (genus)|Piper]] nigrum''. But there is no botanical relationship with this plant, nor with Sichuan Pepper.
[[Image:Thai peppers.jpg|left|thumb|Thai pepper]]

In Indian English, the word &quot;capsicum&quot; is used exclusively for bell pepper. All other varieties of chili peppers are called chilli. 

==Description==
Peppers are shrubby perennials, typically with simple, entire leaves. Flowers are white, in axillary groups.

==Growing Conditions==
Full sun, rich, well-drained soil, with adequate irrigation.

==Uses==
''Capsicum'' fruits can be eaten raw or cooked. Those used in cooking are generally varieties of the ''C. annuum'' and ''C. frutescens'' species, though a few others are used as well. They are suitable for stuffing with fillings such as cheese, meat or rice.

They are also frequently used both chopped and raw in salads, or cooked in stir-fries or other mixed dishes. They can be sliced into strips and fried, roasted whole or in pieces, or chopped and incorporated into salsas or other sauces.

They can be preserved by drying or pickling. Dried peppers may be reconstituted whole, or processed into flakes or powders. Pickled or marinated peppers are frequently added to sandwiches or salads. Extracts can be made and incorporated into hot sauces.

The fruit of ''most'' species of ''Capsicum'' contains capsaicin (methyl vanillyl nonenamide), a lipophilic chemical that can produce a strong burning sensation in the mouth (and, if not properly digested, anus) of the unaccustomed eater. Most mammals find this unpleasant; however, birds are unaffecte&lt;ref&gt;Mason, J. R., Bean, N. J., Shah, P. S. &amp; Clark, L. ''Journal of Chemical Ecology'' 17,2539–2551 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, D. M., Mason, J. R. &amp; Clark, L. ''The Wilson Journal of Ornithology'' 104, 549–551 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;.  Apparently, the secretion of capsaicin is an adaptation to protect the fruit from consumption by mammals while the bright colors attract birds that will spread the seeds. The amount of capsaicin in peppers is highly variable and dependent on genetics, giving almost all types of peppers varied amounts of perceived heat. The only pepper without capsaicin is the bell pepper. Chile peppers are of great importance in Native American medicine, and capsaicin is used in modern Western medicine—mainly in topical preparations—as a circulatory stimulant and pain reliever.

Most of the capsaicin in a pepper is found in the interior ribs that divide the chambers of the fruit, and to which the seeds are attached. At the stem end of the pod, glands secrete the capsaicin, which then spreads throughout, but is concentrated on the ribs and seeds. The amount varies very significantly by variety, and is measured in [[w:Scoville scale|Scoville heat unit]]s (SHU), ranging from the mild bell pepper to the scorching Habanero chile.

In addition to the colunary varieties, some peppers are also grown as ornamental plants, for their colorful and showy fruits. 

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Primarily by seed, though cuttings can be made if desired. Seedlings are usually started in flats, then transplanted to the field.

==Harvest==
Harvest fruits when green or when fully ripe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Use ==
The table tag is for creating a table in the HTML code. It is a simple way of organising a large amount of data. With the attributes the user can manipulate the table to create a table that suits the webpage.

== Example ==
This is an example of the layout coding for a basic table:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Hundredths&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Tenths&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Ones&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Seven&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Eight&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Three&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This is what the table looks like on the webpage:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
!Hundredths
!Tenths
!Ones
|-
|Seven
|Eight
|Three 
|-
|}

== Required attributes ==
====border====
This attribute sets the border to a value. The default value is Zero &quot;0&quot;.

====align====
This attribute aligns the table. The user has three choices: center, left or right.

====width====
This one tells the coding how wide the table is. It can be either in pixels or in a percentage, according to the screen

== Optional attributes ==
====cellpadding====
This sets the space around a cell. It has to be set to a value of 0 to 5. Default is 0.

====cellspacing====
This attribute is the space between cells. This attribute makes the border around them larger. It has to be set to a value of 0 to 5. Default is 0.

====spacing====
This attribute basically tells the user what the intentions to the table are. It is not seen on the webpage. It is is comment.

== Standard attributes ==
*[[HyperText Markup Language/Standard Attributes List#align|align]]
*[[HyperText Markup Language/Standard Attributes List#border|border]]
*[[HyperText Markup Language/Standard Attributes List#cellpadding|cellpadding]]
*[[HyperText Markup Language/Standard Attributes List#cellspacing|cellspacing]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Color Mixer controls the inventory of the Color Swatches Panels. New colors can be created using various color modes: RGB, HSB and hex, using manual values or from the color picker. The Color Mixer contains four channels: red, green, blue and alpha (transparency). These are all adjustable with sliders including a tint slider. In this manner, new colors can be created from existing colors, i.e. two web-safe colors combined to create a new color, and then added to the Color Swatches panel. The flexibility of the Color Mixer panel allows any color swatch to be loaded and modified. Using the Eyedropper tool, a color can be picked up from anywhere in the Flash interface, on the desktop, from other applications, etc. This can also be done directly through the Color Swatches panel, but cannot be stored unless added through the Color Mixer's &quot;Add Swatch&quot; command.

If you would like to fill a bitmap from your library with color, you have the option to.  Start by selecting your bitmap that you would like to fill with the selection tool.  Next, open up your color mixer panel and then choose Bitmap from the Color style menu.  If you have bitmaps stored in your present library, they're available from the Bitmap Preview section of your Color Mixer Panel.  Click on your bitmap and it will automatically fill the selected object.

The Color Mixer panel is also where gradients are accessed, discussed later in this section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Graphic Symbols are the most basic of the three symbols and are mainly for static images, but one can use animation in a Graphic Symbol, but Flash will ignore any sounds or actions inside it. They also do not play independently of the main timeline, this requires an allocated frame on the main timeline.

==When should you use a Graphic Symbol?==

Because shapes drawn on the stage are rendered in each frame of the Flash player, sometimes they take up more resources and processor cycles than are necessary. Using an instance of a Graphic Symbol, because it is a copy of a symbol in the library, will take up fewer resources because in each frame, the Flash player refers back to the original and makes the necessary changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and welcome to Wikibooks. I noticed you uploaded [[:image:AJC98F.jpg]] and called it public domain. I read the royalty-free EULA and it does allow redistribution so what you did isn't (as far as I can tell) a copyvio, but claiming that it is public domain is incorrect, it has a licence agreement for the royalty-free images even though they are royalty-free (all that means is you don't need to pay to use them). Perhaps a different tag would be more appropriate? I'm not sure what, we may have a template for things that're copyrighted but used with permission, but for now it may be best to mark it as {{tlx|fair use}} and state the source more explicitly on the image page. 

Good luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Saving the best for last, the Movie Clip has it all, Movie Clip Symbols are basically movies within the main movie. Movie Clips have an independent timeline in that their timeline is not dependent on the main timeline; therefore their play head can move in sync or out of sync with the main play head. Also, Movie Clips can have ActionScript within their own timeline and/or have ActionScript in their object actions. Movie Clips can contain sounds, actions, and other symbols. A Movie Clip can also be placed inside other symbols such as for animated buttons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Button Symbol is different from the other two symbols because it has a unique timeline. Used for creating interactive buttons, they have a timeline limited to four frames, which are referred to as states. The four states are labelled “Up” - (when the mouse cursor is not over the button), “Over” - (when the mouse cursor is over the button, but the mouse button is not pressed), “Down” - (when the user presses the mouse button over the button itself), and “Hit” - (this is a nonvisual state that enables you to define the area that will activate the button’s other states). Each state can be defined with graphics, symbols, and sounds. Button Symbols however, can be redundant, as it's possible by using ActionScript to produce a button using a MovieClip.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Symbols are really the foundation of interactive project development.  They help keep file size down, aid in organization, and allow you to use ActionScript to manipulate their appearance.  In this chapter, we will be looking at how to make and use symbols, as well as a consideration of the three symbol types and their uses.

A symbol is a reusable image, animation, graphic, movie clip, sound file, font or button that resides in the library. A bitmap (any imported graphic file) is not as controllable as a symbol. For example the alpha/opacity of a bitmap cannot be keyframed for dissolves but a symbol can be. A graphic can be placed in a symbol by entering symbol edit mode and importing the symbol into the symbol stage. Enter symbol edit mode by clicking the + button in the library. 

Moving an element to the library converts it to a symbol. (If the Library is not open, open it with '''Ctrl-L'''.) If a symbol is dragged into the Library and it has the same name as an existing symbol, the new symbol replaces the old. A Resolve Library Item Conflict requestor appears. Select Replace. Library folders can help avoid same file name problems. If a symbol is dragged out of the library an instance of it (a copy) is created. Changing an instance of a symbol on the stage does not change the master copy. The master symbol can be changed through symbol Edit mode (double click the symbol in the library.) Instances can be named in the Properties panel.
	
To create a new symbol: '''Insert &gt; New Symbol''' (or '''Ctrl-F8''') brings up a requestor that wants to know the type of symbol being created (movie clip, button or graphic) and a name for it. It then takes you to symbol edit mode where you create and edit the symbol. A symbol has its own Timeline and layers, independent of the scene Timeline that it is in. A symbol can be composed of many layers and manipulated as a single object. 
To convert a graphic to a symbol select it and '''Insert &gt; Convert To Symbol'''. A Symbol can also be created by dragging an object from the stage to the library. The object on the stage that was dragged into the library will be converted to a symbol and a symbol icon will appear in the library. A Convert to Symbol dialog box appears with several behavior buttons that determine how the symbol will be used. These behaviors are: 

'''[[/Graphic/]]''' – Used for static images and animations that are tied to the main Timeline. Graphic symbols are created with Flash draw tools. Their icons look like a hazardous waste symbol.

'''[[/Button/]]''' – Responds to mouse clicks and other events. Graphics are defined for various button states. Actions are assigned to the button instance. A button symbol icon is a finger on a button.

'''[[/Movie Clip/]]''' – Reusable animations. They have their own Timelines that run independently of the main Timeline. They are like mini-movies that run inside the main movie. They can contain interactive controls and can be controlled by ActionScript.  

The instance’s type can be changed at any time through the Property Inspector.

Symbols can be edited in context (with other elements on the stage, called Edit In Place) or they can be edited in a separate window. If a master symbol is changed  then every existing instance of that symbol will display the changes: '''Edit &gt; Symbol''' or double click on the symbol in the library or use the + icon in the library.
	
A symbol can be copied in the library panel by selecting it and '''Modify &gt; Duplicate''' Symbol. This is a good way to make new symbols using existing symbols as templates. 

Frames from one symbol can be copied into another symbol: Select the frames to be copied on the main Timeline and '''Edit &gt; Copy Frames'''. Then create a new symbol. Select frame one of the new symbol and '''Edit &gt; Paste Frames'''.

Each object has a registration point used to place the element on the stage. This info is listed in the Info Panel: '''Window &gt; Panels &gt; Info'''. An Align Panel is available for aligning elements relative to each other: '''Window &gt; Panel &gt; Align'''. A Registration tool is used to place the registration point on the object.
	
Effects can be applied to a selected symbol with '''Window &gt; Panels &gt; Effects'''. Effects include color/transparency, animation and sound effects. Single instances or multiple instances of a symbol can be edited. '''Edit &gt; Edit Symbols'''.	

The link between an instance and a symbol can be broken which turns the instance into a collection of pieces parts. Select the instance. '''Modify &gt; Break Apart'''.

Instances can be linked to different symbols in order to retain their properties. A rat symbol for instance could be changed to a cat symbol and its color and movements would be preserved.

To assign a different symbol to an instance select the instance on the stage and click the Swap button in the Property Inspector. Select a new symbol from the Swap Symbol dialog box. The Swap Symbol dialog box also has a Duplicate button that creates a copy of the selected symbol.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Use ==
This tag is used to declare an image in the webpage. There are two formats you are to use on the web. They are: .gif (Graphics Interchange Format) and .jpg or .jpeg (Joint Photographic Expert Group).

== Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Beach.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Beach Picture&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; title=&quot;Picture of the Beach&quot;
align=&quot;right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

== Required attributes ==
====src====
This &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be used by the user. It declares the path of the image, in other words the source of the image.

====alt====
This used to be optional, now with XHTML coming into the spotlight, it is now compulsory to add this to the attributes list. All this does is add text to were the image is supposed to be when it cannot be found by the browser.

== Optional attributes ==
====align====
Tells the browser were the image is supposed to be. The user has a choice of three values with this. They are: left, right and center.

====height====
This tells the browser how tall the image will be on the webpage. This must not be used to control the image size.

====title====
This declares text that is shown when the mouse is moved over the image.

====width====
Tells the browser the width of the image. Must not be used to control the image size.

== Standard attributes ==
*[[HyperText Markup Language/Standard Attributes List#align|align]]
*[[HyperText Markup Language/Standard Attributes List#height|height]]
*[[HyperText Markup Language/Standard Attributes List#title|title]]

These input data from the user. They can be inputs such as text boxes or selection boxes.

== Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;textinput&quot; size=&quot;30&quot;/&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

== Required attributes ==
====type====
Type tells the browser what type of input element this is. It can be one of the following:
*&quot;text&quot;: A one line text box.
*&quot;radio&quot;: Small circular choice buttons.
*&quot;checkbox&quot;: A small square choice button.
*&quot;password&quot;: A password box. For security, it shows all characters as &quot;*&quot;.
*&quot;hidden&quot;: Hidden text in a web page.
*&quot;file&quot;: Presents a text box for entering the full name of a local file.  Also has a &quot;browse&quot; button to select the file.
*&quot;submit&quot;: Submit button.
*&quot;image&quot;: Image Button.
*&quot;reset&quot;: A reset button.

== Optional attributes ==
====name====
Names the attribute. When the form is sent off, the user would want to know what the information is.

====size====
The size of the text box. This is done in a percentage.

====value====
Use this when the type attribute has been set to radio. Tells the form what the value is when the box has been high lighted.

====checked====
Use this to define a value in the checkbox. Use with checkbox only.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

Simply having a new microprocessor is not much of a benefit, unless you have a way to program it. The most simple and direct way to program a microprocessor is through the use of an assembler. An assembler converts mnemonics into corresponding machine code instructions. Once you have an ISA, it's a trivial task to map mnemonics to the various instruction opcodes.

Once an ISA is finalized, the design work can usually be split into two teams: a hardware team to design the datapath and control units, and a software team to write an assembler and other programs, such as a simulator and a compiler. This is not the way it is always done, however, as a single group of people is perfectly capable of doing both sets of tasks.

Simulators are software programs that have grown in popularity among design groups in recent years. Once an ISA is finalized, and the basics of the datapath are mapped out (especially the timing and delays), a simulator can be a very valuable project to work on.

A simulator allows software for your new microprocessor to be tested on a separate computer. This means that people can write and test software for your new processor even before you have finished designing it!

Simulators have lead to a fascinating new realm of productivity known as ''hardware software co-design''.</text>

With an assembler written, it is typically a good idea (although not always) to write a high-level language compiler for your new processor. Typically the high-level language in these situations is C because of its small number of built in constructions, and the close relationship that C shares with the underlying assembly language. 

Compilers help to speed up the development process, so that more complicated software can be written without the tedium of writing large assembly language programs. Another benefit to this is that there are a number of pre-existing tools for use with higher-level languages, such as simulators and debuggers that can increase the efficiency of your software team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Habermas first defines “linguistification of the sacred” on TCA2 p. 77.  There, it means that people’s behavior or thinking ceases to be guided by fears of the sacred, and instead becomes guided by criticizable validity claims.  This, he thinks, is an improvement:  the sacred becomes “sublimated” into those validity claims.  Basically, you stop behaving as you are told by norms that are protected by unquestionable sacred authority, and instead you experience a release or freeing of the potential for rational, communicative action.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wireless Mesh Networks ==
This book is an advanced topic book that follows after the basic Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi security books.  I am willing to contribute if there is interest in this book since I have experience in this area. 
[[User:kgrr|&lt;font style=&quot;background: lightblue&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;kgrr&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:kgrr|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]05:51, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
: I am very interested in learning about the topic. I have seen other people decide not to contribute because &quot;there is not interest&quot;. I guarantee that somewhere someone appreciates very much that you are willing to share your knowledge. It may go unsaid, but I think it is important to for contributors to remember that their content will be available for a long time (assuming Wikimedia foundation stays around) and with probably .5-3 billion people with potential access to the internet. This knowledge will be used and appreciate by at least a small percentage of those people. If you have the motivation, energy, and you think you can get something out of it for yourself, I would encourage you to contribute. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 05:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

[[User:kgrr|&lt;font style=&quot;background: lightblue&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;kgrr&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:kgrr|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]15:55, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== Thesis Statement ==
What is the point of this book?  Is it a survey of all the mesh types?  Is this a design book?
I think it should teach mesh technology to someone that already knows Networking and Wi-Fi as a pre-requisite.  It should give someone the basic understanding of the issues to buy, design and deploy mesh networks.  Can we discuss this?

[[User:kgrr|&lt;font style=&quot;background: lightblue&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;kgrr&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:kgrr|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]06:31, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== Type of Book ==
What type of book will it be? Reference, textbook, self-study course, (application) note collection, tutorial, experimentation instructions, travel report, etc.

I think it should be a textbook.
[[User:kgrr|&lt;font style=&quot;background: lightblue&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;kgrr&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:kgrr|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]15:49, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== Target Audience ==
Who are the target audience? How old are they, how advanced are their reading skills and background be? Are they children or adults; students, hobbyists, or professionals; researchers or scientists? (an advanced level for a hobbyist is something completely different than one for a researcher).

The target should be adults; students, serious hobbyists, researchers; professionals = engineers, economists, and marketers, and the like.  
[[User:kgrr|&lt;font style=&quot;background: lightblue&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;kgrr&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:kgrr|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]15:49, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== Scope ==
What is the scope of the book?
A second year IT book and a junior or senior level BS Engineering Book suitable for teaching a semester course with the intent of being able to skip over a few chapters.  Knowledge of Networking (CCNA) and Wireless Networking (Wi-Fi) are a pre-requisite.
[[User:kgrr|&lt;font style=&quot;background: lightblue&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;kgrr&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:kgrr|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]15:49, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== Outline ==
Once we have the list of topics and the thesis, let's work on the outline.  Perhaps someone can organize these into chapters.  Can we discuss a strategy?

[[User:kgrr|&lt;font style=&quot;background: lightblue&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;kgrr&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:kgrr|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]06:31, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== Merge? ==
I would prefer that the [[Wireless Mesh Sensors]] and the [[Wireless Mesh Networks]] books be kept separate because they are really very different technologies although they share the mesh element.[[User:Kgrr|Kgrr]] ([[User talk:Kgrr|talk]]) 20:46, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

:Are you still defending that position? I was going to merge the two but saw your opposition. Wireless Mesh sensors Wikibook is an empty stub (about the quality and quantity), the subject aren't that dissimilar you can only get wireless mesh sensors inside a wireless mesh network, and most of the content would have to be duplicated in both books so they cover individually similar subjects, merging does make a lot of sense and in this case will not create any structural damage...
:If no opposition is stated, in 7 days, I will proceed with the merge. I will try to contact you by email if available and make a note on your talk.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:30, 19 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Symbols

A Ruby symbol is the internal representation of a name. You construct the symbol for a name by preceding the name with a colon. A particular name will always generate the same symbol, regardless of how that name is used within the program.

 :Object
 :myVariable

Other languages call this process ``interning,'' and call symbols ``atoms.''

'''Greedy Scale''' is a scale insect with a wide range of hosts. Its origin is uncertain, but it has become an invasive species in many parts of the world. 

==Description==
Small, grayish-white armored scales, generally found in large colonies.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Severe infestations cause wilting, distortion, and the death of the host plant.

==Ecology==
Females do not produce wings, crawlers are spread mechanically or by wind.

==Host plants==
Greedy scale feeds on hundreds of species, including (but not limited to) species in the following genera:

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term &quot;Macro&quot; has been derived from the Greek word MAKROS which means large. Therefore macroeconomics is that branch of economics which deals with the economy as a whole. It is the study of economic aggregates, (or macro economic variables) such as national income, total employment, total savings, total investment, total consumption, general price level, etc. That is why it has also been called '''aggregative economics'''

'''Camellia''' is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae, native to eastern and southern Asia from the Himalaya east to Japan and Indonesia. There is some controversy over the number of existent species, with anything from 100–250 species being accepted. The genus was named by Linnaeus after Fr. Georg Joseph Kamel S.J., a Jesuit botanist.

==Description==
They are evergreen shrubs and small trees from 2–20 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, thick, serrated, usually glossy, and 3–17 cm long. The flowers are large and conspicuous, 1–12 cm diameter, with (in natural conditions) 5–9 petals; colour varies from white to pink and red, and yellow in a few species. The fruit is a dry capsule subdivided into 1–5 compartments, each containing 1–8 seeds.

==Growing conditions==
The genus is generally adapted to acidic soils, and does not grow well on chalk or other calcium-rich soils. Most species also have a high rainfall requirement and will not tolerate drought.

==Species==
There are about 100–250 species, including:
*''[[../Camellia assimilis/]]''
*''[[../Camellia brevistyla/]]''
*''[[../Camellia caudata/]]''
*''[[../Camellia chekiangoleosa/]]''
*''[[../Camellia chrysantha/]]'' – Golden Camellia

*''[[../Camellia crapnelliana/]]''
*''[[../Camellia cuspidata/]]''
*''[[../Camellia euphlebia/]]''
*''[[../Camellia euryoides/]]''
*''[[../Camellia forrestii/]]''
*''[[../Camellia fraterna/]]''
*''[[../Camellia furfuracea/]]''
*''[[../Camellia granthamiana/]]''
*''[[../Camellia grijsii/]]''
*''[[../Camellia hongkongensis/]]'' - Hong Kong Camellia&lt;br/&gt;
*''[[../Camellia irrawadiensis/]]''&lt;br/&gt;
*''[[../Camellia japonica/]]'' – Japanese Camellia&lt;br/&gt;
*''[[../Camellia kissii/]]''

*''[[../Camellia transnokoensis/]]''
*''[[../Camellia tsaii/]]''
*''[[../Camellia vietnamensis/]]''
*''[[../Camellia yunnanensis/]]''

==Uses==
One species, ''Camellia sinensis'' (tea), is of major commercial importance. Tea oil is a sweet seasoning and cooking oil made by pressing the seeds of ''Camellia sinensis'' or ''Camellia oleifera''.

Many other camellias are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers; about 3,000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected, many with double flowers, as in the gallery featured below. ''Camellia japonica'' (often simply called '''Camellia''') is the most prominent species in cultivation, with over 2,000 named cultivars; next are ''C. reticulata'', with over 400 named cultivars, and ''C. sasanqua'', with over 300 named cultivars. Popular hybrids include ''C. × hiemalis'' (''C. japonica'' × ''C. sasanqua'') and ''C. × williamsii'' (''C. japonica'' × ''C. salouenensis''). They are highly valued in Japan and elsewhere for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter. Late frosts can damage the flowers.

==Maintenance==
Camellias have a slow growth rate. Typically they will grow about 30 centimetres a year until mature although this varies depending on variety and location.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theory of the Firm==
The theory of the firm is a series of economic models utilised to understand and explain the nature of firms and their interaction with the market. 

===Costs===
One such economic model is that of the costs which a firm faces. There are two main types of costs discussed; fixed and variable costs.'''Fixed costs''' are costs which remain constant at all levels of output. '''Variable costs''' are those costs which vary with the level of output. '''Marginal cost''' is the cost of producing an extra unit of output. '''Average cost''' is the average cost of each unit of output for a given level of output. '''Total cost''' is the sum total of costs for a firm at a given level of output.
===Calculating and Graphing Costs===
In addition to being able to define the different types of costs facing firms it also required that you are able to interpret cost curves and calculate costs. Below is a table illustrating the total, average and marginal costs of a fictional firm. 
{| border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| Output
| Total Cost
| Average Cost
| Marginal Cost
|-

| 10
|-
| 3
| 150
| 50 
| 40
|-
| 4
| 180
| 45
| 30
|}
As is demonstrated by the table the formula for calculating the average costs of firm is: &lt;math&gt;Average Cost={Total Costs}/{Output}&lt;/math&gt;

The marginal cost is the extra cost incurred by producing an additional unit of output, therefore, to calculate it the total cost of production at the current level of output is subtracted from the total cost of output at the previous level of output. 
===Revenue===
There are also equivalent revenues for each of the costs. Average revenue is the average amount of revenue from the sale of a given number of units. Marginal revenue is the additional revenue generated from the sale of an extra unit. Total revenue is the total revenue generated from the sale of a given number of units at a given level of output. 

===Objectives of the Firm===
There are  a number of possible objectives which a firm may aspire to. This may be to maximise profits or to maximise sales. Newspaper editors may want to maximise their readership and will therefore endeavour to produce at the lowest average cost possible in order to achieve the lowest price and the highest level of demand. A firm seeking to maximise profits on the other hand will produce at a level where the marginal cost and the marginal revenue intersect.

==Models of Market Structure==
Economists have developed and utilised a series of models of different market structures to explain the different behaviour of firms in markets with different structures. As a model by definition is an attempt to simplify a complicated behaviour each model is based upon a series of assumptions and is therefore of limited use based on the validity of these assumptions. 

===Perfect Competition===
[[Image:PerfectCompetitionFirmNormalProfits.png|frame|'''Figure 1''' - A perfectly competitive firm making normal profits]]One such model is that of perfect competition. This model attempts to create a situation in which the level of competition leads to both allocative and productive efficiency. It is based on the following assumptions;
*There are many firms all of whom produce the same quantity of goods or services and all of whom have perfect knowledge of the other firms within the industry. 
*There are many buyers all of whom posses perfect knowledge of the industry. 
*The goods or services produced by the firms are homogeneous and not differentiated by branding or marketing. 
*Firms have absolute freedom to enter and exit the market due to a total lack of barriers to entry. 
These four assumptions lead to a further salient characteristic of the model which means that both the consumers and producers are price takers as no single actor has sufficient market power to influence the price level within the industry. In addition to this any firm within the market who will accept the market price is able to sell all of its output, leading to perfectly competitive firms being faced with a perfectly elastic demand curve as shown in figure 1. As it is perfectly elastic both the marginal and average revenue remain constant.

===Perfect Competition In The Short and Long Run===
The '''short run''' is defined as any period of time in which there is at least one fixed factor of production (i.e. land, labour, enterprise, capital). In the '''long run''', however, all factors of production are variable, meaning that firms can achieve different levels of profit in the short and long run. In the long run it is only possible for a firm to make a '''normal profit'''. As all the products produced by the firms in this industry are homogeneous and there are a large number of firms, an increase in the price of one firms goods will lead consumers to switch to a competitor firm's product leading to the firm with the higher price making a loss and eventually going out of business. A firm may, in the short run, take advantage of a new production technique to increase output and therefore reduce the average cost and price of a unit and make a short run abnormal profit (a profit higher than normal profit). In the long run, however, as all firms have perfect knowledge regarding other firms within the industry all firms will copy this new production technique and too lower their average costs and price.

===Monopoly===
A monopolist is a sole firm in an industry. A monopoly market structure is essentially the opposite to the market structure of perfect competition. There must be high barriers to entry for a firm to stay as a monopoly. 

The following barriers to entry may exist:
*Natural cost advantages
*Legal barriers such as patents
*Marketing barriers
*Unfair practices

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Prerequisites ===
The ant manual contains the following statements.  I have edited text on this page which conflicts with this:

To build and use Ant, you must have a JAXP-compliant XML parser installed and available on your classpath, such as Xerces.

The binary distribution of Ant includes the latest version of the Apache Xerces2 XML parser. Please see http://java.sun.com/xml/ for more information about JAXP. If you wish to use a different JAXP-compliant parser, you should remove xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar from Ant's lib directory. 

You can then either put the JARs of your preferred parser into Ant's lib directory or put the jars on the system classpath. Some parts of Ant will fail if you use an old parser, especially one that is not namespace-aware. In particular, avoid the Crimson parser.

Tip: &quot;ant -diagnostics&quot; will list the XML parser used and its location.

For the current version of Ant, you will also need a JDK installed on your system, version 1.2 or later required, 1.5 or later strongly recommended. The later the version of Java , the more Ant tasks you get. 

Note #2: If a JDK is not present, only the JRE runtime, then many tasks will not work.

      <comment>/* Air drag */ note that air viscosity doesn't matter</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{How To Build a Pinewood Derby Car/Table of Contents}}
This module has some simple physics and, at the end, some chemistry of the [[w:pinewood derby|pinewood derby]]. A pinewood derby car converts gravitational potential energy to translational kinetic energy (and resulting velocity), rotational kinetic energy in the spinning wheels, and heat from friction. The fastest car is the one that starts with the most gravitational potential energy (weight in the back), ends up with the least rotational kinetic energy (light wheels with one lifted) and loses the least energy through friction (proper lubrication and alignment). Pinewood derby cars are a five ounce laboratory of practical physics, chemistry and engineering.

The Pinewood derby car problem is treated in two different ways below:  1) using the equations of motion and 2) using energy. Both are equally valid and arrive at the same result.

==Equations of motion treatment==
We'll build a physical model that considers all of the predominant forces acting on the Pinewood Derby car. First and foremost is the force of gravity, which is the only (allowed) force to accelerate the car down the ramp. Next, we'll consider the frictional forces of the axles on the wheels and the wheel treads on the track. Finally, we'll consider air drag and how it affects the motion of the car.

Throughout this section, we'll consider an idealized car and track. The car has a mass ''M'' of 5 [[w:ounce|ounces]] (141.7 [[w:gram|grams]]), a length ''l'' of 7 inches and wheels each having mass ''m'' of 2.6 grams and radius ''r'' of 0.5&quot;. The track has overall length ''L'' and consists of a ramp of length &lt;math&gt;L_r&lt;/math&gt; at an angle of incline of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; followed by a flat of length &lt;math&gt;L_f&lt;/math&gt; to the finish. Given this geometry, an expression for the starting height is &lt;math&gt;H=L_r\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;. To keep things simple, we will not concern ourselves with the transition between the ramp and the flat at this time. Values for a typical Pinewood Derby track are &lt;math&gt;L_r = &lt;/math&gt; 8' (2.44 m), &lt;math&gt;L_f = &lt;/math&gt; 24' (7.32 m), &lt;math&gt;H = &lt;/math&gt; 4' (1.22 m), and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; = 30&lt;math&gt;^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;.

It will also be helpful to consider the equations of motion for an object with no external forces. This will be the case for the car on the flat part of the track when friction and wheel rotation are neglected. In this case the equations of motion are:

:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = 0\, ;\, v(t) = v_0\, ;\, d(t) = v_0t + d_0\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''a(t)'' is the acceleration, ''v(t)'' is the velocity and ''d(t)'' is the distance at time ''t''. The initial distance and velocity at time ''t=0'' are given by &lt;math&gt;d_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.


===Force of gravity on a falling object===
[[image:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogg|right|thumb|300 px|'''Hammer and Feather Drop''' - Apollo 15 Commander David Scott demonstrates that Galileo was right. (1.38 [[w:Megabyte|MB]], [[w:ogg |ogg]]/[[w: Theora|Theora]] format). ]]
First consider the most basic case of a falling object of mass ''M'' (an apple?). The force of gravity is given by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt; F_g = Mg\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''g'' is the [[w:acceleration due to gravity|acceleration due to gravity]] (9.807 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 32.17 ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the earth's surface). This force is directed downward and results in the object accelerating toward earth.

The equations of motion (neglecting frictional forces) for this object are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = g\, ;\, v(t) = gt + v_0\, ;\, d(t) = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0t + d_0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

An object falling the height of 4' (1.22 m) would take 0.499 seconds and reach a maximum velocity of 4.892 m/s. If this object were then instantaneously turned to slide along the 24' flat track with no friction, the time would be an additional 1.496 seconds for a total time of 1.995 seconds.

===Force of gravity on a Pinewood derby car===
The Pinewood Derby car does not fall straight downward but rather proceeds down a ramp with an angle of incline &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Only the component of the gravitational force along the track surface will result in the acceleration of the car. The resulting accelerating force is:

:&lt;math&gt; F_a = Mg \, \sin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The car only accelerates when on the ramp of angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. On the flat part of the track where &lt;math&gt;\theta=0&lt;/math&gt; this accelerating force becomes zero. This can be thought of as acceleration with a reduced gravity &lt;math&gt;g_\theta&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; g_\theta = g \, \sin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;.

This reduced gravity can be used in the above equations of motion to solve for the car. In a Pinewood Derby on the initial slope, &lt;math&gt;v_0=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_0=0&lt;/math&gt; so (neglecting friction and wheel rotation) these equations become:

:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = g_\theta = g \, \sin\theta\,;\, v(t) = g_\theta t\,;\, d(t) = \cfrac{1}{2}g_\theta t^2\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The time &lt;math&gt;T_r&lt;/math&gt; to roll down the ramp is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; d(T_r) = L_r = \cfrac{1}{2}g_\theta T_r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;,

Solving for &lt;math&gt;T_r&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; T_r = \sqrt{\cfrac{2L_r}{g_\theta}} = \sqrt{\cfrac{2L_r}{g \sin\theta}}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The maximum speed at the bottom of the ramp is:

:&lt;math&gt; v(T_r) = v_{max} = g_\theta T_r = \sqrt{2gL_r\sin\theta} = \sqrt{2gH}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

For the idealized ramp, &lt;math&gt;T_r&lt;/math&gt; = 0.998 sec and &lt;math&gt;v_{max}&lt;/math&gt; = 4.892 m/s. This has taken twice the time of the falling case above, but the same maximum velocity was achieved!


The equations of motion for the car on the flat part of the track (&lt;math&gt;\theta=0&lt;/math&gt;) for &lt;math&gt;t&gt;T_r&lt;/math&gt; are given by the following:

:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = 0\,;\, v(t) = v(T_r) = v_{max}\,;\, d(t) = L_r + v_{max}(t-T_r)\,;\, t&gt;T_r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The time &lt;math&gt;T_f&lt;/math&gt; to finish the flat portion of the race is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; d(T_r+T_f) = L_r+L_f = L_r + v_{max}T_f\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving for &lt;math&gt;T_f&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; T_f = \cfrac{L_f}{v_{max}}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The total time to finish the race for this idealized car is:

:&lt;math&gt;T = T_r+T_f = \cfrac{v_{max}}{g_\theta} + \cfrac{L_f}{v_{max}}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The flat-track time is 1.4953 seconds for a total time of 2.4933 seconds. Since the same maximum velocity as the falling case was achieved, the (frictionless) flat time is identical. The total time includes the extra half second it took to move down the ramp.

==Energy treatment==
Some key understanding of the physics of the Pinewood Derby car can be gained through energy considerations. Through this deliberation, we can consider the potential energy available in the system as well as the linear kinetic energy and the rotational kinetic energy in wheels. Above we considered only the linear motion as the car moved down the ramp and across the track. In fact, the rotation of the wheels requires energy and thereby removes energy from the system that would otherwise be available to accelerate the car. To account for the rotation of the wheels, we will consider the energy of the system.

We'll start out with the potential energy in the system, then move on to the simple linear case, and finally add the rotation of the wheels. 

===Potential energy===
The energy that makes a pinewood derby car roll down the ramp is [[w:potential energy|potential energy]] (symbol &lt;math&gt;U_g&lt;/math&gt;). At the bottom of the ramp, this energy is converted into [[w:kinetic energy|kinetic energy]] (symbol &lt;math&gt;E_k\,&lt;/math&gt;).

The potential energy can be calculated using the formula

:&lt;math&gt;U_g = m g h \,&lt;/math&gt;.

where ''m'' is the mass of the car, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:acceleration due to gravity|acceleration due to gravity]] (9.807 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 32.17 ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the earth's surface) and ''h'' is the height of the car on the starting ramp (about 4 feet = 1.22 meters). The potential energy stored in a 5 ounce pinewood derby car is about 1.7 kg m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;= 1.7 J. The quantity 1.7 joule of energy is the same as 1.7 watts of power applied for one second.

===Translational kinetic energy===
The [[w:kinetic energy|kinetic energy]] can be calculated using the formula

:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;.

where v is the [[w:velocity|velocity]] (speed) of the car, measured in meters per second (in [[w:SI units|SI units]]). If all of the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, then

:&lt;math&gt;U_g = E_k  \,&lt;/math&gt;

and, substituting from above,

:&lt;math&gt;m g h = \frac{1}{2}mv^2  \,&lt;/math&gt;

since the mass is on both sides of the equation, you can divide both sides by &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and cancel (remove) the mass from the equation.

:&lt;math&gt;g h = \frac{1}{2}v^2  \,&lt;/math&gt;

and, rearranging, the velocity is found from

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{2 g h}  \,&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity doesn't depend on the mass, just as [[w:Galileo#Physics|Galileo]] demonstrated at the [[w:Leaning Tower of Pisa|Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and, during the [[w:Apollo_15#Lunar_surface|Apollo 15]] landing, [[w:David Scott|David Scott]] demonstrated on the moon. The velocity of any object falling from a height of 1.219 m is 4.890 m/s (11 MPH).

===Rotational kinetic energy===
Moving forward isn't the only kind of kinetic energy; it also takes energy to spin the wheels. The [[w:rotational kinetic energy|rotational kinetic energy]] of each wheel is given by

:&lt;math&gt;E_r = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where I is the [[w:moment of inertia|moment of inertia]] of a wheel and ω is the [[w:angular velocity|angular velocity]]. Since we consider only a wheel that does not slip on the track, the angular velocity is related to the linear velocity through
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = v / r\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''r'' is the radius of a wheel. The moment of inertia for a ring of radius r and mass &lt;math&gt;m'&lt;/math&gt; is 

:&lt;math&gt;I_{ring} = m'r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

and for a disk, it is 

:&lt;math&gt;I_{disk} = \frac{1}{2}m'r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

For a Pinewood Derby wheel, the moment of inertia can be approximated by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Cowley | first =E. Roger | title =Pinewood Derby Physics | journal =The Physics Teacher | volume =27 | issue =8 | pages =610-612 | publisher =merican Association of Physics Teachers  | date =November 1989  | doi =10.1119/1.2342889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I = 0.58\,m r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''m'' is the mass of one wheel and ''r'' is the radius of the wheel. 

The rotational kinetic energy for N wheels is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;E_{r} = \frac{N}{2} (0.58\,m  r^2)\omega^2 = \frac{N}{2} (0.58\,m)v\,^2\,&lt;/math&gt;.

This turns out to be 0.094 J of energy stored in four wheels at the car's top speed of 4.75 m/s (see the table below). Compare that to the 1.7 J gravitational potential energy from above. Almost 6 % of that energy is stored in the spinning wheels and about 94 % is available for the car's forward velocity.

If we again convert all potential energy into kinetic energy, we can find the maximum kinetic energy and velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;U_g = E_k + E_r \, \Longrightarrow \, M g H = \frac{1}{2} \left(  Mv_{max}^2 +  0.58N\,mv_{max}\,^2 \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving for the velocity,

:&lt;math&gt;v_{max} = \sqrt {\cfrac {2gH} {1 + 0.58N \cfrac {m}{M} } } \, = \sqrt {\cfrac{2g H}{\alpha_R}} \, &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this result is again independent of the track geometry. The rotational factor, which has the effect of reducing the gravity, is expressed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_R = 1+0.58N \cfrac{m}{M} \, &lt;/math&gt;.

This factor can be used with the gravity in the above equations of motion. It must be combined with the reduced gravity due to the slope of the track. The resultant effective gravity is

:&lt;math&gt; g'_\theta = \cfrac{g\sin\theta}{\alpha_R} \, &lt;/math&gt;.

This reduced gravity with wheel rotation can be substituted into the equations of motion to calculate the car's distance, velocity and acceleration at any point. the equations of motion become:

:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = g'_\theta = \cfrac{g\sin\theta}{\alpha_R} \,;\, v(t) = g'_\theta t\,;\, d(t) = \cfrac{1}{2}g'_\theta t^2\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Now it is clear why the heaviest possible car is the fastest: for large M, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_R&lt;/math&gt; approaches 1 and the velocity is the same as the above case for the frictionless block:  4.9 m/s. With standard 3.6 g wheels, a 141.7 g (5 ounce) car has a velocity of 4.75 m/s at the bottom of the track. A 113.4 g (4 ounce) car has a velocity of 4.72 m/s.

The advantage of light wheels is also clear. The slowest car is one with the most mass in the wheels. If &lt;math&gt;m=M&lt;/math&gt; (four 35 g wheels rolling down the track!) the velocity is 2.7 m/s. With 3.6 g wheels, the velocity is 4.75 m/s; with 1 g light wheels, the velocity is 4.85 m/s. Another way to look at it is that a light wheel car has less than 2 % of its kinetic energy in the wheels while the standard wheel car has almost 6 %.

Raising one wheel reduces the rotational energy as long as that wheel doesn't touch the ground. The velocity of a three wheel (3.6 g) car is 4.78 m/s, while a raised light wheel car can reach 4.86 m/s.

===An idealized track===
Now that we know how fast an idealized car can go, let's let it run down an idealized track. A typical pinewood derby track is 32 feet long with 4 feet for the starting gate and [[w:arresting gear|arresting gear]], leaving 8.534 m for travel. The first part of the track has a slope of about 20°, a curved transition section, followed by a flat section to the finish. The track can be approximated by a straight ramp section with length &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; followed by a flat section with length &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;. Times calculated using the straight track approximation differ by less than 0.001 s compared to those obtained using a curved track and [[w:numerical integration|numerical integration]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowley ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; With the straight track and 20° slope, &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; = 3.564 m and &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; = 4.970 m. The car travels down the sloped section &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; starting at zero velocity and accelerating to a velocity &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; with an average speed of &lt;math&gt;v/2\,&lt;/math&gt;. It then travels the distance &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; at a velocity &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt;. The total time is then

:&lt;math&gt;t= 2\frac{d_1}{v} + \frac{d_2}{v} &lt;/math&gt;

or 12.098/v seconds, if the velocity is specified in meters per second. Run times under different conditions are given in the table below.

===Center of mass===
Up to this point, we have approximated the car as a point mass that starts 1.219 m above the finish and winds up at 0 m. As anyone familiar with pinewood derby knows, it is usually best to keep the center of mass as far back as possible, in part to increase the gravitational potential energy. How much faster is a car with the center of mass shifted to the back? Consider two cars, Car A with the center of mass at the center of the block and Car B with the center of mass 25.4 mm (one inch) in front of the rear axle in an extended wheelbase configuration with the axle 15.9 mm (5/8&quot;) from the rear of the block. The center of mass of the Car B is 47.6 mm behind Car A and 23.8 mm higher on a 30° slope. Car A starts at 1.219 m and (as shown above) has a maximum velocity of 4.75 m/s and 2.55 s time; Car B starts at 1.243 m and has a maximum velocity of 4.80 m/s and a 2.52 s time.

==Friction forces==
[[Image:Rownia tarcie.svg|right|thumb|300 px|diagram showing the forces acting on a block that is resting on an inclined plane.]]
[[w:Friction|Friction]] is the force that opposes the motion of two objects in contact. In general, there are two types of frictional forces - static and kinetic. Static friction is a force that resists motion. Kinetic friction, also called sliding friction, is a force exerted between two objects in motion relative to one another. The primary types of friction associated with a Pinewood Derby car are the kinetic friction of the axles on the wheels and the static friction of the wheels rolling on the track. Both of these will be discussed in further detail below. Air Drag is considered a special topic and is discussed in detail below.

Other types of friction, including contact between the wheel inner hub and car body, the wheel outer hub and the axle head, the wheel and the track guide rail, can be greatly minimized or completely eliminated through proper car design and tuning. 

===Sliding (axle) friction===
Sliding friction occurs whenever two surfaces are in contact and are in motion relative to one another. For the Pinewood Derby car, the primary source of contact friction is axle on wheel. This friction occurs within the car &quot;system&quot; and always occurs with the metal axle on the plastic wheel. The friction force ''on the axle and wheel'' (&lt;math&gt;F'_f&lt;/math&gt;) is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;F'_f = \mu N_f \,&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;N_f&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force (perpendicular to the contact surface) exerted between the surfaces and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:coefficient of friction|coefficient of friction]]. The coefficient of friction is a property of the two materials in contact. For a Pinewood Derby car, the value of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is about 0.24 for smooth plastic on metal and can be reduced to 0.10 or less if the axle is polished and a lubricant, such as graphite, is used. 

The normal force is the force of the body mass on the axles. On a track with slope of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the total normal force of all load-bearing axles is

:&lt;math&gt;N_f = (M-Nm)g \cos\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''M'' is the mass of the car, ''m'' is the mass of a wheel, and ''N'' is the number of load-bearing wheels. &lt;math&gt;M-Nm&lt;/math&gt; is 127.3 g for a car at maximum weight with four 3.6 g load-bearing wheels. 

The force of friction relative to the track is reduced by the [[w:mechanical advantage|mechanical advantage]], which is the ratio of the wheel radius to the wheel bore hole radius. For every rotation of the wheel, the car travels one wheel circumference:  95.0 mm. The axle travels only 7.19 mm around the wheel bore hole circumference per rotation. The wheel-to-axle friction is then

:&lt;math&gt;F_f = \mu \left( \cfrac{r}{r_B} \right) (M-Nm)g   \cos\theta = \mu' (M-Nm) g \, &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;r_B&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the wheel bore hole and the adjusted coefficient of friction &lt;math&gt;\mu'&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu' = \mu \left( \frac{r}{r_B} \right) \, &lt;/math&gt;. 

The linear acceleration due to this force, including the effect of wheel rotation, is opposite the direction of motion and is

:&lt;math&gt;a'_f = \cfrac{\mu' g \left( 1-\cfrac{Nm} {M} \right) \cos\theta}{\alpha_R} =  \cfrac{\mu' g \alpha_m \cos\theta}{\alpha_R}\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where the factor for wheel mass &lt;math&gt;\alpha_w&lt;/math&gt; has been defined:

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha_w = 1- \frac{Nm}{M}  \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Because this is a constant acceleration, it can be written as an effective reduced gravity in the equations of motion. The reduced gravity for all geometric, rotational and sliding frictional effects thus far is

:&lt;math&gt;g'_{\theta f} = g \cfrac{\sin\theta - \mu' \alpha_w \cos\theta}{\alpha_R}  \, &lt;/math&gt;.

Using the above values, the wheel-to-axle frictional force is 0.00946 N.

Note that the wheel-to-axle friction for a light wheel car is 8% ''larger'' than for the stock wheel car due to the greater mass of the body (137.7 g body plus four 1.0 g wheels). However, the frictional force can be cut in half using needle axles, which are allowed in some open class races. A 1 mm needle axle has a mechanical advantage of 30 and a frictional force of 0.00453 N (assuming light wheels).

Another result is that a raised wheel does nothing to reduce wheel-to-axle friction. A three wheel car simply distributes the weight among three axles rather than four and the frictional force is the same. All of the raised wheel advantage stems from rotational kinetic energy.

===Rolling friction===
There are two kinds of friction:  static and kinetic. Static friction is the resistance of an object at rest, for example, a heavy box at rest on concrete floor. [[w:Rolling resistance|Rolling resistance]] is the friction between a rolling wheel and surface. It is a static friction because, even though the wheel is moving, it is not sliding against the surface. Kinetic friction is the force that opposes the motion of a moving object. Using the box example, this would be the force that must be overcome as you slide the box across the floor. In the wheel example, rolling resistance is static, while [[w:skid|skidding]] or doing a [[w:Burnout (vehicle)|burnout]] involves kinetic friction. In this sense, rolling resistance is for the most part a &quot;good&quot; friction for a pinewood derby car because it does very little work and because it helps to convert what would otherwise be skidding friction into the significantly lower friction between the wheel and axle.

The force that results from rolling resistance is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{r} = C_{rr} N \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C&lt;sub&gt;rr&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the coefficient of rolling friction (CRF), and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:normal force|normal force]] (perpendicular to the track). The CRF value for a low rolling resistance tire is about 0.002 (see the [[w:Rolling resistance|rolling resistance]] article). 

On a track with a slope of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the normal force is perpendicular to the track and is given by

:&lt;math&gt; N_\theta = Mg \cos\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;.

The frictional force from rolling resistance is then

:&lt;math&gt; F_{\theta r} = C_{rr} Mg \cos\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;.

This force acts in the opposite direction of the motion of the car. The linear acceleration due to this force is

:&lt;math&gt; a'_{\theta rr} = g' C_{rr} \cos\theta = \cfrac{g C_{rr} \cos\theta}{\alpha_R} \,&lt;/math&gt;,

resulting in an effective rolling resistance reduced gravity of

:&lt;math&gt; g'_{\theta rr} = g \cfrac{\sin\theta - C_{rr} \cos\theta }{\alpha_R} \,&lt;/math&gt;,

The rolling resistance reduced gravity can be substituted into the equations of motion to solve for the the car distance, velocity and acceleration at any point in time.

On a flat section of track, &lt;math&gt;\theta=0&lt;/math&gt; and 

:&lt;math&gt;F_{r} = C_{rr} Mg = 0.002 \times 0.1417\,kg \times 9.807\,m/s^2 = 0.0028\,N \ &lt;/math&gt;.

The wheel-to-axle friction and rolling resistance are of comparable magnitude. From the above section, the rolling resistance was estimated to be about 0.003 N compared to the wheel-to-axle friction estimated above to be about three times larger. 

Car modifications that can reduce the CRF can reduce the rolling resistance by the same factor. For example, a &quot;V&quot; or &quot;H&quot; tread pattern limits the contact area between the wheel and track and thereby reduce the CRF and rolling resistance. Note that a raised wheel does not reduce the overall rolling resistance since the full weight of the car is distributed over the remaining three wheels and increases their rolling resistance. However, the rolling resistance is greater for the rear wheels in a rear biased car since they bear a greater fraction of the weight.

===Motion with friction===
The &quot;all-in&quot; reduced gravity that includes the effects of track geometry, wheel rotation, sliding friction and rolling friction is:

:&lt;math&gt;g'_{\theta fr} = \cfrac{g_{\theta fr}}{\alpha_R} =  g \cfrac{\sin\theta- \mu' \alpha_w \cos\theta - C_{rr} \cos\theta }{\alpha_R}  \, &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the reduced gravity can be negative. In particular, it is negative on the flat track when &lt;math&gt;\theta=0&lt;/math&gt;. Also of interest is that there will be some minimum value for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, below which the car will never overcome frictional forces and begin rolling - even on the sloped track!

The equations of motion become:

:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = g'_{\theta fr} \,;\, v(t) = g'_{\theta fr}t+v_0\,;\, d(t) = \cfrac{1}{2}g'_{\theta fr}t^2+v_0t+d_0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

At the start of the race, &lt;math&gt;v_0=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_0=0&lt;/math&gt;. At the start of the flat section, simply reset the time to zero and use &lt;math&gt;\theta=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_0=v_{max}&lt;/math&gt; (you must calculate &lt;math&gt;v_{max}&lt;/math&gt; from these equations) and &lt;math&gt;d_0=L_r&lt;/math&gt;.

===Measuring friction===
The static and dynamic friction can be measured using the apparatus in Figure 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.clarku.edu/courses/110labs/Lab4.pdf Lab 4 - Static and Dynamic Friction]&lt;/ref&gt; From [[w:Newton%27s_laws_of_motion|Newton's Second Law of Motion]] we know that the forces balance, therefore the normal force balances the gravitational force on the car

[[Image:Static friction flat.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Figure 1. Measuring the coefficient of friction on a flat surface.]]

:&lt;math&gt; N_f = mg \,&lt;/math&gt;.

At the point where the mass M just balances the static frictional force

:&lt;math&gt; \mu N_f = mg \,&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt; \mu = M/m\,&lt;/math&gt; .

[[Image:Static friction angle.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Figure 2. Measuring the coefficient of friction on an inclined surface.]]

The reader can verify that, in the inclined case of Figure 2, the coefficient of friction is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{ \left ( \frac{M}{m} - \sin(\theta) \right ) } {\cos(\theta)} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

The kinetic friction can be determined using either of the above apparatus, but the procedure takes a bit more patience. Add or subtract from the mass M until the car moves at a constant velocity when pushed. At this point, the gravitational force is equal to the kinetic frictional force. The trick is that the car can neither accelerate nor decelerate; we want F=ma=0, but this time when the car is in motion.

==Air drag==
The frictional force of a gas or liquid on a body is called [[w:Drag (physics)|drag]] and the drag force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; can be calculated from&lt;ref&gt;[http://carini.physics.indiana.edu/E105/drag-force.html Drag Force]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_d= {1 \over 2} \rho  A C_d v^2 = b v^2&lt;/math&gt;

where  ρ is the air density (about 1.2 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), '''v''' is the velocity of the air relative to the body, ''A'' is the frontal area of the body, and ''C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[w:drag coefficient|drag coefficient]], which depends on the shape and surface of the vehicle (but about 0.4 for a typical car). The constant ''b'' is defined above as a convention. For a Pinewood Derby car, ''A'' is dependent on the car design - an uncut block is 0.0014 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Using the 4.75 m/s for a 5 ounce car with standard wheels gives a drag force of 0.0081 N. Using &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt;, we get an acceleration of -0.057 kgm/&lt;math&gt;s^2&lt;/math&gt;, about 0.6% of the gravitational force, but still enough to slow the car from 4.75 m/s to 4.69 m/s on the flat section of the track alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mot.html#mot6 Motion equations]&lt;/ref&gt; A numerical integration with a similar track resulted in an a run that was 1.8% slower.&lt;ref&gt;Cowley ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, all cars experience some air drag, but a low and sleek design may have an advantage of a few hundredths of a second against a less aerodynamic car.

At the sizes and speeds of pinewood cars, the [[w:Viscosity|viscosity]] of air does not matter at all; the only important air resistance force is the drag force, proportional to the density of the air and the speed squared.  The drag force is a kind of [[w:Ram pressure|ram pressure]].

To get to the equations of motion for a vehicle subject to ram-pressure drag, we consider the car on a sloped track with rotating wheels and friction forces and add to this model the air drag force. The acceleration of the car based on the balance of forces is the following:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathbf{F}_d}{M}= a(t) = \cfrac{g_{\theta fr} - \frac{b}{M} v^2}{\alpha_R} &lt;/math&gt;,

Recall that the force is related to [[w:Acceleration|acceleration]] through [[w:Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton's second law of motion]] and the acceleration is the derivative of velocity. Thus, an equation for the velocity of motion can be written:

This is a non-linear differential equation for the velocity. It's solution is not straightforward but is tractable. The equations of motion are:

:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = g'_{\theta fr} \left[ 1 - \tanh^2 \left( t \sqrt{\cfrac{g'_{\theta fr} b}{\alpha_R M}} \right) \right] \, &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; v(t) = \sqrt{\frac{g'_{\theta fr} \alpha_R M}{b}} \tanh \left( t \sqrt{\cfrac{g'_{\theta fr} b}{\alpha_R M}} \right) \, &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; d(t) = \frac{\alpha_R M}{b} \ln \left[ \cosh \left( t \sqrt{\cfrac{g'_{\theta fr} b}{\alpha_R M}} \right) \right] \, &lt;/math&gt;.

==Tribology==
[[Image:Graphit gitter.png|thumb|right|200 px|The molecular structure of graphite. The carbon atoms are the gray balls that form a hexagonal plane structure. The planes can easily slide across each other which makes bulk graphite slippery.]] 
[[w:tribology|Tribology]] is the study of friction, lubrication and wear. Since friction is the force that slows a Pinewood Derby car and lubrication reduces friction, tribology is an essential science of the sport. Wear is not an important consideration since, as we have seen above, the forces are low. The lubricant must reduce the friction between the wheel and axle and also be compatible with the [[w:polystyrene|polystyrene]] wheels. Expanded polystyrene is known as [[w:styrofoam|styrofoam]] and makes a great cup for hot cocoa, but is a poor container for an organic solvent such as [[w:gasoline|gasoline]] or [[w:naptha|naptha]] (ask your Dad about the old auto shop trick). Pure polystyrene can be [[w:crosslink|crosslink]]ed to form a [[w:copolymer|copolymer]] with [[w:polybutadiene|polybutadiene]] that is called high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) or high-impact plastic. HIPS is excellent for [[w:injection molding|injection molding]], so it is no coincidence that it is the material used for Pinewood Derby car wheels. Nonetheless, care must be taken to keep inappropriate solvents from lubricants, paints, or cleaners away from the wheels. Another consideration for lubrication is the possibility of fouling the track with excess lubricant, especially liquids. Some [[How_To_Build_a_Pinewood_Derby_Car/Car_construction_rules|race rules]] permit only dry powder lubricants for this reason.
[[Image:Molybdenite-3D-balls.png|left|thumb|300 px|X-ray crystal structure of molybdenum disulfide, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Molybdenum is blue and sulfur is yellow.]]

'''Graphite'''

[[w:graphite|Graphite]], like [[w:diamond|diamond]] is one of the several forms of [[w:carbon|carbon]]. Unlike diamond, graphite is a poor gemstone, but it is an excellent lubricant. This is because the chemical bonds in diamond form a three dimensional structure, while the bonds in graphite form a two dimensional structure. The two dimensional sheets of graphite slide easily over each other, giving graphite powder its lubricating properties.

'''Molybdenum Disulfide'''

[[w:Molybdenum disulfide|Molybdenum disulfide]] has the chemical formula MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is similar in chemical structure to graphite in that it forms two-dimensional layers that slide upon each other. In pinewood derby applications, molybdenum disulfide powder is typically mixed with graphite powder.

'''Teflon'''

Teflon is the [[w:DuPont|DuPont]] brand name for [[w:Polytetrafluoroethylene|polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE), which is a synthetic [[w:Fluoropolymer|fluoropolymer]] (a [[w:fluorine|fluorine]] containing [[w:polymer|polymer]]). Teflon has the lowest coefficient of friction of any known solid material. It is used in powdered form as a Pinewood Derby lubricant.

# [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] onions, garlic, and peppers in bacon grease, add lime juice and hot sauce and set aside.
# Prepare grits and add cheese and butter when done cooking to allow for them to melt, then set aside.
# Stir when done melting.
# Sauté the shrimp until they turn pink, about 2 to 3 minutes.&lt;br/&gt; ''If you are planning to use unpeeled shrimp, plan an extra 20 minutes to peel the shrimp!''
# Place the grits and cheese in large serving container and place the shrimp down the center of the container.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* If served on individual dish/platter, slice limes on the side.
* In preparing the grits, you may want to use [[Cookbook:Milk|condensed milk]] instead of [[Cookbook:Water|water]] to make the grits for an extra creamy texture!
* As an alternative, add garden peas to grits and serve steamed peppers, zucchini, yellow squash, and mushrooms on the side. Adds a great taste texture with the peas!

== Base Notation (in alphabetical order) ==

 &lt;math&gt; [i]_{n} &lt;/math&gt; : Molarity of species i in stream n
 a, b, c, d: Stoichiometric coefficients.
 A: Area
 C: Molar concentration (mol/L)
 K: Equilibrium coefficient
 m: Mass
 MW: Molecular Weight (Molar Mass)
 n: Moles
 n: Number of data points (in statistics section)
 N: Number of components
 P: Pressure
 r: Regression coefficient
 R: Universal gas constant
 T: Temperature
 v: Velocity
 V: Volume
 x: Mole fraction in the ''liquid phase'' OR Mass fraction &lt;ref&gt; Unless specified explicitly, '''assume that a given percent composition is in terms of the overall flowrate'''. So if you're given a flowrate in terms of kg/s and a compositoin of 30%, assume that the 30% is a mass fraction. If a given equation requires one or the other, it will explicitly be stated near the equation which is necessary. &lt;/ref&gt;
 X: (molar) extent of reaction
 y: Mole fraction in the ''gas phase''
 z: Overall composition
 Z: Compressibility

&lt;references/&gt;

== Greek ==

 &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt;: Density
 &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;: Sum

== Subscripts ==


If a particular component (rather than an arbitrary one) is considered, a specific letter is assigned to it:
* [A] is the molarity of A
* &lt;math&gt; x_{A} &lt;/math&gt; is the mass fraction of A

Similarly, referring to a specific stream (rather than any old stream you want), each is given a different number.
* &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the molar flowrate in stream 1.
* &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{A1} &lt;/math&gt; is the molar flow rate of component A in stream 1.

'''Special subscripts:'''

If A is some value denoting a property of an ''arbitrary'' component stream, the letter i signifies the arbitrary ''component'' and the letter n signifies an arbitrary ''stream'', i.e.
*&lt;math&gt; A_n &lt;/math&gt; is a property of ''stream'' n. Note &lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_n &lt;/math&gt; is the molar flow rate of stream n.
*&lt;math&gt; A_i &lt;/math&gt; is a property of ''component'' i.

The subscript &quot;gen&quot; signifies generation of something inside the system.

The subscripts &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; signify flows into and out of the system.

== Embellishments ==

If A is some value denoting a property then:

&lt;math&gt; \bar{A}_n &lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''average'' property in stream n

&lt;math&gt; \dot{A}_n &lt;/math&gt; denotes a ''total flow rate'' in steam n

&lt;math&gt; \dot{A}_{in} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the flow rate of component i in stream n.

&lt;math&gt; \hat{A} &lt;/math&gt; indicates a data point in a set.

&lt;math&gt; A_i^* &lt;/math&gt; is a property of ''pure component'' i in a mixture.

== Units Section/Dimensional Analysis ==

In the units section, the generic variables L, t, m, s, and A are used to demonstrate dimensional analysis. In order to avoid confusing dimensions with units (for example the unit m, meters, is a unit of length, not mass), if this notation is to be used, use the ''unit equivalence'' character &lt;math&gt; \dot= &lt;/math&gt; rather than a standard equal sign.

This is one of the block-level tags in HTML. This means that is displays the text on a new line. In this case it is a paragraph. HTML does not recognise the return button on your document, so this element '''has''' to be used by the user.

== Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an example of the paragraph element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

* 1 sprig fresh [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]]
* 1 sprig fresh [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Sea salt]] and freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* ½ cup freshly grated [[Cookbook:Cheese|Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese]]

==Procedure==

# [[Cookbook:Soak|Soak]] beans and spelt overnight in separate bowls of cold water.
# Drain, set aside.
# Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
# Add sausage.
# Cook stirring occasionally, until meat begins to separate and brown (3 to 5 minutes).
# Stir in kale, onion, carrot, celery, and garlic.
# Cook until softened (about 10 minutes).
# Add beans, spelt, chicken stock, and tomatoes.
# Bring to [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]].
# Stir in rosemary and sage.
# Reduce heat.
# [[Cookbook:Simmering|Simmer]] mixture for 60 or 70 minutes, until beans are tender, (If soup is too thick, add chicken stock.)
# Season to taste with salt and pepper.
# [[Cookbook:Ladle|Ladle]] soup into bowls.
# Drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle on cheese.
# Serve immediately.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Have this soup first with bread, like [[Cookbook:Ciabatta|ciabatta]], then finish with some cold cuts, like [[Cookbook:Salami|salami]] and prosciutto.
* Instead of using spelt, you can substitute [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]].
* If you can't find Tuscan kale, you can put in regular kale, mustard greens, or Swiss chard.
* This soup tastes even better the next day.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Southern cuisine|Southern cuisine (USA)]] 
| [[Cookbook:Seafood|Seafood recipes]] 

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]], canned or fresh
* 1 quart rich [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], [[Cookbook:Scald|scalded]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] salt [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
* 1 quart [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]] [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]], if desired
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], diced or [[Cookbook:Chopping|chopped]]

==Procedure==

# Remove black parts from clams, saving the liquor.
# Cut pork in small pieces and [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] until crisp and golden brown, then remove small pieces of pork from the fat.
# Discard fat.
# Add potatoes and onion, with just enough hot water to be seen through the potatoes.
# Cook over low heat-just [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]]-until done.
# When potatoes are done, add clams and pork and cook for 2 minutes after coming to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]]. (Longer cooking will make the clams tough).
# Remove chowder from heat and let stand for few minutes, then add hot milk, the clam liquor and seasoning to taste. (If seasonings are added before hot milk, chowder may curdle.)
# May add butter to each bowl, for extra taste.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Chowder is usually better if left till the next day.

{{closed|1=Vote is to &lt;span style=&quot;background:green; color:white&quot;&gt;'''keep'''&lt;/span&gt; --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)}}

I'm risking a flaming here but this book is in a bit of a mess due to past disagreements.  I'm nominating it for deletion but I doubt it will be a popular choice but do we have any other suggestions? [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:12, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

*&lt;s&gt;'''Support'''&lt;/s&gt; -- This book has been stagnant for years, and possibly incorporates material from non-GFDL texts. The primary author ([[User:Panic2k4]]) has been arguing with new contributors about making alterations to the book, has insinuated that his contributions give him the right of editorial control (or &quot;responsibility&quot;, as he puts it), and has hinted that he might revoke the GFDL release of his contributions if things don't go his way. The book as it stands is really just a many-paged stub, and given the interest in the topic on wikiversity, I think a fresh start for the book might both yield a better result and help us build a community of programming authors. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:55, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
**Neutral, since WK is trying to look into the copyrights. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
*&lt;s&gt;'''Delete''' - There have been issues with the potential that it might contain copyrighted material which is not been released under the GFDL, and difficulty in determining what exactly was used from what. For these reasons I believe there is no way to determine which specific parts of the book should be removed. Additionally there have been problems with a contributor who has made threatening remarks and taken actions which threaten to undermine any continued contributions to the book. I believe its in Wikibooks' best interest to delete the book in its entirety and to start from scratch. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:01, 27 February 2007 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt; 
:* '''Comment''' - I would be willing to start working on it from scratch and I believe there are others who may be willing as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:13, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
* &lt;s&gt;'''Delete''' - or is that &quot;Support&quot;? - whilst there is in fact some good content in this book already, I have to trust the comments made above and support this deletion. C++ has a strong enough body of users expert in its ways to allow the possibility of good authors resurrecting this book without the many issues that have plagued it to date. (I might even help out, although my C++ experience is all from last century, and I have other tasks to complete first) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:20, 27 February 2007 (UTC)&lt;s&gt;
:* '''Keep''' - in light of Whitenight's investigations, it would seem that there is no basis to the allegation of plagiarism (now).  [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:43, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. [[User:Panic2k4]], despite his threats, may not remove his contributions as per [[GFDL|Section 9 of the GFDL]]. This much, therefore, is a non-issue. Also, any accusations that a text is a copyvio should be backed up with evidence. We don't normally delete texts here that ''might be copyvios'', we instead ask for evidence (usually through a google test, although that doesnt prove which version of the text came first), or a request from an author who's work has been infringed. Without proper evidence, we shouldn't declare this to be a copyvio: it sets a dangerous precident that things could be deleted on any unfounded accusation of copyright violation, and I am not willing to set that precident. Furthermore, despite the issues with Panic in the past, we do not:
**Delete stub books, especially books that have structure, or books that have active contributors (and this book has attracted a number of contributors)
**Delete books out of revenge against the authors of that book.
**Delete books that conform to [[WB:WIW]], or delete books without proper justification from [[WB:DP]]. 
:Issues with panic should not even be mentioned on this page, and any other accusations of violations or inadequacy should be backed up with evidence and policy justifications. Without such evidence, looking only at the text of this book, I can see no reason to delete it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
:* As a brief addendum, I have been having a discussion with panic in which many of the &quot;threats&quot; originated. It is my opinion that no actual threats were made, we were talking about hypothetical situations involving copyrights. I do not believe that Panic has threatened, nor intends, to try and remove his contributions from this book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
:* '''Comment''' - My vote to delete is not out of bad faith (if thats what your implying). Rather concerns with past mentions of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;oldid=234683#Plagarism_.3F Plagarism] that were not looked into at the time by administrators and seeking the opinion of another current administrator on that and looking into other authors that have been listed in the book as having given permission to use their work under the GFDL, the difficulty in determining one way or another and his shared concern about the matter. If someone such as yourself is willing to look into the matter and try to resolve that issue. I'll recant that reason for deleting the book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
:** I am contacting the authors listed and determining whether any of the claims of copyvios are substantiated. If there are no copyvios to be found in this book, I dont think there is any policy justification for deleting this book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:07, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
:**'''Update'''. I have contacted the first two authors, Scott Wheeler and Steve Ferg, and both sent back timely replies stating that they have released content under the GFDL or compatable licenses, and that they do not view inclusion of their material on the C++ book as being copyvios. I will post links to the content in question within the next few days. The third author, Ivor Horton, cannot be tracked down, and I am unable to verify if he has donated any material to the C++ book, and if so what material originated from him. Given the fact that the first two authors check out so quickly and readily, it is my recommendation that it be taken at Panic's word that the third author's contributions, if any, are likewise free from violations. I realize that this is not going to be a popular request, but rest assured that it is not one that I make lightly. Take this as you will, my vote will stay as &quot;keep&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:47, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''', if it is really low on quality, the correct way is not to completely delete it... With the ongoing mess already, the timing of this nom could be better. --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Cool Cat|Cat]] [[User talk:Cool Cat|out]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:35, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Strongly Keep''' - From a legal point of view, copyright violations need to be eliminated such as would happen anywhere else on Wikibooks, and that content does not require a VfD.  I guess I'm confused as to what the problem is here.  I know that Panic is now trying to revoke permission, but that issue was dealt with a very long time ago when the disclaimer was added that &quot;all contributions to Wikibooks are considered released under the GNU Free Document License&quot;.  There is legal preceedence that this is the case, and the only reason you should doubt that the content is a copyvio is if you can find a published version that predates its inclusion into Wikibook (such as using the Google test or find a book, or the copyright owner wants the content removed).  Retroactively asking for the content to be removed is too late after you press the &quot;save page&quot; button.&lt;p&gt;Besides all this, I can't imagine that a Wikibook about C++ Programming can possibly be considered inappropriate for Wikibooks.  While I may agree that some overhaul of the content is in order, that is something to be worked out ''within'' the talk pages of that book.  The VfD page here is mainly concerned with if the subject matter is inappropriate or if there really is a need for this content.  It is particularly sad that once upon a time we had two different C++ Programming Wikibooks, and it appears as though much of the current mess is due to trying to merge the two books together, for whatever reason that was back elsewhen.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:27, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Since Whiteknight got confirmation from 2 out of 3 authors about contents being GFDL'ed I recant my previous reasons for deletions. However, I agree with SB_Johnny's view of the quality of the book, many-page stubs and given potential interest in the subject, I believe a fresh start would be beneficial. The mess, as Robert put it, may very well be due to trying to merge two books together. I think books have been deleted for similar reasons in the past. I'm willing to admit this may be better left as a decision of those working on the book though rather then fit for VfD. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:39, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - This book needs to be improved, not deleted. Copyright violations should be removed when we find them. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Keep''': I think it is a dangerous precedent to delete an entire book over an edit dispute(especially one with this much information; yes there are a lot of stubs but there is also a lot of useful information). The only time this should occur is if there is some fundamental problem with the content itself that cant be resolved. While it is alleged that one person is trying to exercise undue control over the content, the content that exists there is surely better than nothing and would be a good base on which to either rewrite or expand the existing infrastructure... I don't think that the current structure is unfixable but then again I dont know much about the topic or how it should logically be organized. The aforementioned GFDL issues are, as mentioned, not issues, it's made pretty clear in the license itself. I will rescind this vote if it is found that there are significant copyvios but it doesn't appear that there are at least from the initial investigations. As far as the merge goes, I don't know much about that, but we should definitely only have one book on a single topic (unless they have significantly different audiences or focuses or something like that; did those two?) [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 02:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
:* '''Keep''': We seem, at this time, to have no known copyright problems.  While there are a number of stubs, they make up a small proportion of the material.  The material needs work, but is still one of the better free, online tutorials on C++.  If we can get past the current/ongoing mess (which isn't closely related to the content), it would not take too much effort to make this into a good text, and it seems that there would not be a shortage of volunteers. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 04:34, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.

== [[:Image:Teststress1.gif]] is missing a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|fair use rationale]]==
{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
'''Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Teststress1.gif]].''' The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Teststress1.gif]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|rationale]] for a fair use claim is provided.

In order to upload fair use material, specific rationale must be provided as to why fair use media is necessary, and how there are no free alternatives. Images or other media that do not have such rationale will likely be deleted as a copyright violation. If the information of a fair use media component could be duplicated by a free alternative, that media may not be uploaded. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add {{tlx|fair use rationale}}; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or [[WB:HELP|ask another Wikibookian]].

See {{UserImages2}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. [[User:MonoBot|MonoBot]] ([[User talk:MonoBot|talk]]) 04:12, 16 March 2008 (UTC)}}</text>

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:Animal.jpg]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Animal.jpg]]. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask them at the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]]. Thank you.

== Image Licensing ==

Hello and welcome to Wikibooks. I noticed that one of your images (and possibly more than one), [[:Image:RyanCombs.jpg‎]], does not have a copyright tag attached to it. As such, it is presumed to be a copyright violation on Wikibooks. Therefore, I would like to ask that when you upload an image that you create, you give it a license (it is one of the pull-down menus on the form you need to fill out to upload it). If you want I would be happy to add one to that image, I am just not sure what you would like to license it under (as the creator you can choose anything but not licensed at all, and preferably something with a free license like GFDL, creative commons, or if you don't care what people do with it, Public Domain). Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 03:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

== [[:Image:After effects logo.jpg]] is missing a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|fair use rationale]]==
{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
'''Thanks for uploading [[:Image:After effects logo.jpg]].''' The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:After effects logo.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|rationale]] for a fair use claim is provided.

In order to upload fair use material, specific rationale must be provided as to why fair use media is necessary, and how there are no free alternatives. Images or other media that do not have such rationale will likely be deleted as a copyright violation. If the information of a fair use media component could be duplicated by a free alternative, that media may not be uploaded. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add {{tlx|fair use rationale}}; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or [[WB:HELP|ask another Wikibookian]].

See {{UserImages2}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. [[User:MonoBot|MonoBot]] ([[User talk:MonoBot|talk]]) 04:20, 8 March 2008 (UTC)}}</text>

== Shahmukhi lessons help ==

I thought about it I thought I might try to write the lessons myself, but there is one problem: I don't know Punjabi.

This isn't a big problem, I just may need to ask for some Punjabi words to transform into Shahmukhi for examples once in a while.  

Thanks for what you wrote on [[Punjabi/Shahmukhi]].  It gave me the feeling that I made an important contribution to the book.  I'm glad to help out.

[[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) 23:26, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

== Do you want me to transform some words? ==

If you want me to transform some words from Gurmukhi into Shahmukhi for integration into the language lessons, just post a list and I'll try to make them into Shahmukhi.

One thing though: because of the multiple letters for s, h, z, and t, I won't be able to transform words containing ਸ (sussa), ਹ (haha), ਜ (Jujja pair bindi), ਤ (tutta), or ਥ (thutha).  Anything else should be fine.  

[[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) 23:52, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

:Yes, that will be great. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] wrote [[Punjabi/Writing lessons plan]] for me. This page contains many English words some of which I used in Gurmukhi examples. I suggest that you also follow a similar approach. That will give a sense of consistency to the reader. In due course I will add some Punjabi words to [[Punjabi/Writing lessons plan]] which could be used in both Shahmukhi and Gurmukhi.

:I am very grateful to for the taking the trouble of adding lessons to [[Punjabi/Shahmukhi|Shahmukhi]].

:Jaspal Singh 04:07, 3 August 2008 (UTC)

No problem.  Oh, for Lesson 1, could you help me out by providing some words containing ਬ, some ending in ਪ, and ਤ?

[[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) 17:30, 3 August 2008 (UTC)


:I have added some Punjabi words to [[Punjabi/Writing lessons plan]] containing ਬ, ਪ and ਤ some of them ending with ਪ and ਤ.

:Jaspal Singh 18:11, 3 August 2008 (UTC)

== category ==

Can you please add the pages of your book [[Punjabi]] to [[:Category:Punjabi]]? See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Punjabi/Muharni/Velars&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1305948 an example] . Bye! --[[User:Ramac|Ramac]] ([[User talk:Ramac|talk]]) 17:55, 11 October 2008 (UTC)

== Pinewodd Derby Car ==

Hello Kkmurray, I saw your pinewood derby car book, and i'm impressed! It's a very good book, and a valuable resource. As a former scout, I can understand the value of a book like this, because all too often kids are told to make a good car, but not told &quot;how&quot; to make it good. Beyond that, It typically happens that the kids with the best cars are those whose parents are the best craftsmen, something that prevents a level playing field. A book like this really puts everybody on the same level.

Anyway, congratulations on a good book. I will pass a note to my local scout pack so they can make use of it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 21:25, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:1Bx.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|rationale]] for a fair use claim is provided.

== [[General Chemistry/Thermodynamics/Entropy]] ==

I think that the original page could fit somewhere in physical chemistry. Even then, it would need a massive rewrite to make it more like a textbook than a lecture. Unfortunately, I don't know much about physical chemistry, so I won't be of much help. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 21:45, 19 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

== [[:Image:TextPic3.jpg]] is missing a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|fair use rationale]]==
{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
'''Thanks for uploading [[:Image:TextPic3.jpg]].''' The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:TextPic3.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|rationale]] for a fair use claim is provided.

In order to upload fair use material, specific rationale must be provided as to why fair use media is necessary, and how there are no free alternatives. Images or other media that do not have such rationale will likely be deleted as a copyright violation. If the information of a fair use media component could be duplicated by a free alternative, that media may not be uploaded. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add {{tlx|fair use rationale}}; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or [[WB:HELP|ask another Wikibookian]].

See {{UserImages2}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. [[User:MonoBot|MonoBot]] ([[User talk:MonoBot|talk]]) 00:46, 10 March 2008 (UTC)}}</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Typical video file formats are MPEG (.mpg or .mp4), QuickTime (.mov), RealVideo (.rv or .rm), Windows Media (.wmv) and Theora (usually .ogg).

MPEG file formats contain either MPEG 1, MPEG 2, or MPEG 4. MPEG is a ISO group. MP3 files are not MPEG 3; they are MPEG 1 Audio Layer 3. MPEG video has algorithm patents.

QuickTime is a file format created by Apple. Although it sounds like another codec, often it contains a licensed version of MPEG 4.

RealVideo is a partially proprietary format by RealNetworks. It is a codec and is often good quality. It is patented. However, an 'open' implementation is available from RealNetworks called 'Helix Player'.

Windows Media is a proprietary format by Microsoft. It is common and is often forced on people via the Windows operating system.

Theora is an open, non proprietary file format. It is often contained in an Ogg file. In this container the file is called 'Ogg Theora'. However, other containers are occasionally used, such as Matroska. Theora, Ogg and Matroska are patent free.

Ogg Theora is the recommended format because it is non proprietary, open and patent free.

== What is a Mesh Network? ==
&lt;!-- list of ideas that need to be discussed here --&gt;

A mesh network is a multiple path and multiple hop area wide network that are ideal for outdoor deployment. The mesh network consists of wireless networking devices (known as nodes)connecting within the range of the. Hence, it will forms a decentralized networking as each nodes will only need extend its own wireless range up to next node only. Each nodes are consistently communicating with each other in the local mesh network and are responsible to be acting as gateway for the packets to travel inside the mesh network.

A wireless mesh network have 3 characteristic of autonomic system which are
* Self forming / self organizing
* Self healing 
* Self optimization
* Multi hop

=== Self-forming / Self-organizing ===

New nodes joining the mesh network are transparently supported because meshing functions such as neighbours discovery and topology learning are implemented. Wireless routers rapidly detect the presence of new paths, thus enhancing the overall performance and coverage

[[File:Mesh network self forming.gif|none|The self forming properties in the mesh network]]

The picture above shows the mesh networking self forming ability.

[1] A new node joins the mesh network &lt;br \&gt;
[2] Surrounding node are alerted to the new node presence and configuring on the fly to provide optimized routing for the packets&lt;br \&gt;
[3] The new node are accepted in the mesh network&lt;br \&gt;

=== Self-healing ===

A node may leave a mesh network due to unexpected circumstances such as failure in the networking devices, natural disaster/man made disaster and such.Therefore ,the mesh network are inherently designed to be more robust and resilient. There are many ways to do this such as make it a multi-path for packets to travel from one nodes to another (the amount of connections between 2 nodes is 2 or more) , decentralized connections and redundancy.

[[File:Mesh network self healing.gif|none|The GIF is to illustrate the self healing inside the mesh network.For use in the wikibooks .]]

The picture above shows the mesh networking self healing ability

[1] One of the nodes in the mesh network are showing intermittent failures &lt;br \&gt;
[2] Surrounding nodes connected to the intermittent failing nodes are re-configuring to respond to the failing node &lt;br \&gt;
[3] The failing node when offline but the mesh network is still operating without downtime &lt;br \&gt;

=== Self Optimization ===
The mesh network have the self optimization to enlarge the mesh coverage as large as possible, to minimizes the interferences and also to maximizes the bandwidth capacity of the mesh network.

=== Multi-hop ===
Multi-hop connectivity allows several devices to access the network at once by relying on other mesh nodes without affecting the overall network performance. It will guarantees larger coverage zones and an enhancement of the network capacity. In fact, line-of-sight constraint no longer matters because the intermediate nodes relay the information to their neighbors on short wireless links using a reduced power transmission.

[[File:Mesh network multi hop.gif|none|This GIF is illustrating the multi hop concept in the wireless mesh network in wikibooks]]
&lt;br /&gt;

The picture above shows the multi-hop of mesh network in progress.&lt;br /&gt;
[1] Node A want to access to the node D &lt;br /&gt;
[2] Node A sends wireless transmission links to nearby nodes &lt;br /&gt;
[3] Node B &amp; node E forming link with node A &lt;br /&gt;
[4] Node E already found the node D forming mesh connection A-E-D &lt;br /&gt;
[5] Node B is still searching for node E but find node C instead &lt;br /&gt;
[6]Node C already found the node D forming mesh connection A-B-C-D &lt;br /&gt;

== Mesh vs. Point to Multi-point ==
=== Reliability ===
In a classic wireless network, each node monitors that path between itself and an additional node. These networks are configured in a hierarchical fashion that ensures that each node uses a single connection path. The drawback to this approach is its lack of failure protection. If a node fails, the dedicated link is lost and the endpoint is unreachable until service is restored.

The establishment of multiple connection paths is a logical answer to this problem. Unfortunately, classic nodes lack the intelligent technology to select from alternate transmission paths.

Developers studied the idea of adding intelligence to each node to solve this problem. Such intelligence would track each available communication path and would logically select the best route. Added together, the multiplicity of nodes would create a mesh. This mesh would eliminate single points of failure. If one link went down,other network nodes would be alerted and could select an alternative node path. The design's self-healing nature would ensure that the network continued to operate. User access would be maintained as would productivity levels.

Today, the concept of intelligent mesh networks is a reality. Mesh is an increasingly applied network topology as researchers improve and enhance it, and businesses deploy and utilize it. Mesh has become the technology of choice for applications as diverse as securing military perimeters to regulating product flow down factory assembly lines to facilitating the intelligent navigation of one's morning commute.

* [http://www.unep.org/GC/GC24/download.asp?ID=135 Final updated water policy and strategy of the United Nations Environment Programme as it relates to freshwater for the period 2007–2012].  &quot;At its 24th session on 9 February 2007 in Nairobi, the Governing Council (GC) of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) adopted the updated water policy and strategy for 2007-2012. Various minor amendments, such as the removal of references to payments for ecosystem services, proposed by Argentina, were included. In relation to regional and subregional cooperation mechanisms, language was added on creating or strengthening capacity to evaluate, manage and coordinate the environmental management aspects of transboundary resources.&quot; (from EMWIS [http://www.emwis.net/thematicdirs/eflash/flash44 Flash] newsletter)</text>

There is no single set of Pinewood Derby rules; each Pack, District or Council is free to set its own rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/20090510005416/www.geocities.com/~PACK215/pwd-rules.html Pinewood Mania Rules and Race Procedures]&lt;/ref&gt; However, car construction rules have appeared in some [[w:Boy Scouts of America|BSA]] publications. Many rules such as size, weight, bearings, bushings, and springs are common to nearly all Pinewood Derby rules. For example:
;Dry Lubricant:Many rules sets specify dry lubricant only and some allow only graphite and Teflon explicitly. Other rules allow liquid lubricants as long as they are not wet at the time of the race.
;Axle Modification:  Some rules prohibit axle grooves and beveling. Most prohibit substitution of non-BSA axles (e.g. nickel-plated).
;Wheel Modification:  Some rules prohibit light wheels. This is typically worded as prohibiting removal of &quot;substantial mass&quot; and requiring that the inner wheel wording be visible. Some rules prohibit wheel coning or modification beyond light sanding. More detailed rules prohibit narrow wheels or those with one (V-tread) or two (H-tread) raised tread areas.
;Wheel Mounting:There are three levels of wheel mounting rules:  1) no restriction, 2) original wheelbase dimension, 3) original wheelbase and axle slot (no new holes). In some cases, the raised wheel modification may be prohibited.
;Aftermarket Parts:Most rules (e.g., the BSA rules above) do not preclude the use of aftermarket parts as long as they are derived from the BSA kit. For example, lathed wheels or grooved axles are acceptable if the parts originate from BSA kits. Some rules expressly prohibit this type of substitution, although enforcement can be problematic.
;Ready Made Cars:It is generally regarded that ready to run cars violate the spirit of the Pinewood Derby even if they do not violate a specific rule specifying that the car be built substantially by the Cubscout. However, ready to race cars created from BSA kits can be found on eBay and other sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.wi.rr.com/rickscars/ Super Fast Pine Wood Derby Car]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc-pinewood-derby.com/completed-car.htm Completed Pinewood Derby Cars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pinewood-derby-cars.net/index.htm AG Derby Cars ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules in the box==

==Wotamalo Rules==
[[Image:PWD Bullet.jpg|300 px|right|thumb|Bullet design with shaved and coned wheels, beveled and notched axles, and drilled axle holes.]]

Wotamalo District rules section on car construction&lt;ref&gt;[http://wotamalo.wdboyce.org/wot03pwe.htm Wotamalo District Pinewood Derby Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;.
:[[Image:One gram compare.jpg|left|thumb|200 px|Standard wheels (left) and one-gram light wheels (right)]]

#'''Material''':Race cars shall be constructed for this event from the parts contained in the Official Grand Prix Pinewood Derby Kit (referred to below as the kit) as sold by the Scout Service Center, &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;for the District in which the race is run&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Materials from the kit may be supplemented but not replaced.
#'''Weight''': Race cars may weigh no more than five (5) ounces (total weight) as determined on the official scales during race day inspection.
#'''Wheels and Axles''': The car shall roll on the wheels from the kit. The wheels shall turn about the axle nails from the kit. The axle nails shall be firmly affixed to the wood of the car body. The axle dimensions may not be changed substantially. The outside surface of the axle head (the non-contact surface) may not be changed substantially, such as, by polishing. It must be obvious to the judges that the wheels and the nails from the kit are being used.
#'''Size''': Race cars may be no longer than 7 inches, nor wider than 2 3/4 (2.75) inches, nor taller than 3 inches, as determined by the official gages during race day inspection. (Underside clearance of at least 3/8 (0.375) inches and inside wheel to wheel clearance of at least 1 3/4 (1.75) inches is recommended, so that the car will run on the racetrack. Adequate clearance is the responsibility of the race car builder.)
#'''Weights and Attachment''': Weight may be added to the car and will be considered part of the car for purposes of all measurements. &quot;Weight&quot; is considered to be any material on the car that is not provided in the kit. All weight must be securely fastened to the car, e.g., by permanent glue, nails or screws, but not by &quot;sticky substances&quot;, e.g., tape, or tack spray. Weights shall be passive, i.e. non-movable, non-magnetic, non-electric, non-sticky, etc.
#'''Wheels''': Wheel treatment (hub and tread smoothing and polishing) may not result in substantial removal of mass nor in reducing the tread (track contact) width from the original kit wheels. Wheel tread surface must be cylindrical. The words &quot;Official B.S.A. Made in U.S.A.&quot; and other lettering on the wheels shall remain intact and clearly visible to the inspector. Some of the original &quot;tread marks&quot; on the wheel face must be intact, i.e. apparent to the inspector.
#'''Unacceptable Construction''': The following may NOT be used in conjunction with the wheels or axles: hubcaps, washers, inserts, sleeves, bearings.
#'''Gravity Powered''': The race car may not be constructed or treated in such a way that the track's starting mechanism imparts momentum to the car. (For instance, this provision disqualifies cars with sticky substances on the front of the car and protrusions which may catch on the starting pin.)
#'''Lubricants''': Lubricants must be dry at the time of inspection and racing.
#'''Staging''': The entire car must stage behind the starting pin.
#'''Body''': The car body may have no moving parts.

==Pack 254 Rules==
[[Image:Nyoil.jpg|right|170 px|thumb|Nyoil liquid lubricant.]]
From the Virtual Cub Scout Leader's Handbook, these are a stricter version of the Watamalo Rules.
:[[Image:Axle bushing.jpg|250 px|thumb|left|A stick-on axle bushing.]]
#'''Material''': Race cars shall be constructed for this event from the parts contained in the Official Grand Prix Pinewood Derby Kit (referred to below as the kit) as sold by the Scout Service Center, &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;for the District in which the race is run&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Materials from the kit may be supplemented but not replaced.
#'''Weight''': Race cars may weigh no more than five (5) ounces (total weight) as determined on the official scales during the pre-race check-in. Note: The official scale will be available in the Palmer School office from January 4th until registration.
#'''Wheels and Axles''': The car shall roll on the wheels from the kit. The wheels shall turn about the axle nails from the kit. The axle nails shall be firmly affixed to the wood of the car body, and MUST be placed in the original 'axle grooves' in the supplied wooden block. It must be obvious to the judges that the grooves, wheels, and the nails from the kit are being used.
#'''Size''': Race cars may be no longer than 7 inches, nor wider than 2-3/4 (2.75) inches, as determined by the official gages during the Registration and Inspection. Underside clearance of at least 3/8 (0.375) inches and inside wheel to wheel clearance of at least 1-3/4 (1.75) inches is recommended, so that the car will run on the race track. Adequate clearance is the responsibility of the race car builder.
#'''Weights and Attachment''': Weight may be added to the car and will be considered part of the car for purposes of all measurements. &quot;Weight&quot; is considered to be any material on the car that is not provided in the kit. All weight must be securely fastened to the car, e.g. by permanent glue, nails or screws, but not by &quot;sticky substances&quot;, e.g. tape, or tack spray. Weights shall be passive, i.e. non-movable, non-magnetic, non-electric, non-sticky, etc.
#'''Wheel Treatment''': Wheel treatment (hub and tread smoothing and polishing) may not result in substantial removal of mass nor in reducing the wheel width from the original kit wheels. Some of the original &quot;tread marks&quot; on the wheel face must remain intact, i.e. apparent to the inspector. Wheels may not be machined to a beveled condition and the portion of the wheel surface that contacts the track must remain parallel to the axle.
#'''Unacceptable Construction''': The following may NOT be used in conjunction with the wheels or axles: hubcaps, washers, inserts, sleeves, bearings.
#'''Gravity Powered''': The race car may not be constructed or treated in such a way that the track's starting mechanism imparts momentum to the car. (For instance, this provision disqualifies cars with sticky substances on the front of the car and protrusions which may catch on the starting pin.)
#'''Lubricants''': Only dry lubricants such as graphite or powdered Teflon &quot;white lube&quot; will be allowed for lubricating the wheels. Lubricants may not foul the track. There will be a lubrication table set up at the race. In the interest of fairness, only one lubrication is allowed before the beginning of the first heat race and then once again before the beginning of the first race of the semi-finals and finals.

==Favorites Lists==
==Add the channel you are watching to an existing Favorites list==
#Press the '''Info''' button twice
#Scroll to the ''heart'' icon
#Select the list to which the channel should be added
==Add a channel from the Guide to an existing Favorites list==
#With the Guide displayed, scroll to a program on a channel that you want to add
#Press the '''Info''' button twice
#Scroll to the ''heart'' icon
#Select the list to which the channel should be added

==Selecting the Favorites List to use==
There are three ways to select which ''Favorites'' list to use.  
#You can use the Setup Menu to make a list active.  Simply use the '''Menu''' key to get to the Setup screen and select the list you want to use.
#You can have the Guide display only the channels in a Favorites list, switch between lists, or display all channels.  While displaying the Guide,  press the '''Fav''' key on the remote repeatedly.  This will cycle between showing the entire Guide and each of the Favorites lists.  The name of the Favorites list will be displayed.
#You can view a mini-Guide that shows only the channels in a Favorites list, switch between lists, or display all channels.  While watching a program, press the ''Info'' key on the remote and then press the '''Page up''' or '''Page down''' key.  This will display a two or three-line version of the Guide.  Now, pressing '''Fav''' will cycle between showing all channels and each of the Favorites lists.  The name of the Favorites list will be displayed.</text>

Parental Control allows you to control viewing programs based on the title, channel, TV rating, or movie rating. When you try to view a channel, title, movie or program that has been locked, you must enter the 4-digit PIN code before the video and audio will be enabled.

=Basic Parental Control Setup=

The Parental Control panel allows you to set global controls based on channel or rating. You can also bypass or clear all locks from this menu, and control the display of Adult (and as of version A25, TV-MA) titles.

Parental Control setup can be accessed through two methods:
#Press '''Menu''' twice to get to the main menu, select ''Parental Controls'' (''Parental Control'' as of version A25)
#Press '''Menu''' twice to get to the main menu, select ''Setup'', select ''Locks Setup'' (''Parental Control Setup'' as of version A25)

If you do not have a Locks PIN defined, you will be asked to create one (type in a 4-digit number) and then confirm it.

If you do have a Locks PIN defined, you will need to enter the 4-digit number.

As of version A25, ''Service Locks'' and ''PINs Setup'' were moved from the main ''Setup'' menu to the ''Parental Control Setup'' menu.

==Title Locks==
This is a list of titles that have been locked. You can use the left and right arrow keys to select a title, and then press '''OK/Select''' to unlock it. If you do not exit the menu, you can also re-lock it by pressing '''OK/Select''' again.&lt;br&gt;
If you have no locked titles, this will display ''No Title Locks''.

(Version A25 or newer)&lt;br&gt;
The first program listed will be the currently viewed program. Otherwise, use the up and down arrow keys to select the program. Press '''OK/Select''' to lock or unlock a program.

Locked programs will display a padlock icon.&lt;br&gt;

==TV Ratings Locks==
Use the left and right arrow keys to select the rating you want to lock, then Press '''OK/Select''' to enable or disable the lock.

(Version A25 or newer)&lt;br&gt;
Use the up and down arrow keys to select the rating to lock, then Press '''OK/Select''' to enable or disable the lock. If you enable a rating, all stronger ratings will automatically lock (example: locking TVY7 will also lock TVG, TVPG, etc...). If you disable a rating, all weaker ratings will automatically unlock (example: unlocking TVG will also unlock TVY7 and TVY).

Locked ratings will have a padlock icon.
==Movie Ratings Locks==
Use the left and right arrow keys to select the rating you want to lock, then Press '''OK/Select''' to enable or disable the lock.

(Version A25 or newer)&lt;br&gt;
Use the up and down arrow keys to select the rating to lock, then Press '''OK/Select''' to enable or disable the lock. If you enable a rating, all strong ratings will automatically lock (example: locking PG-13 will also lock R, NC-17 and Adult). If you disable a rating, all weaker ratings will automatically unlock (example: unlocking PG-13 will also unlock PG and G).

Locked ratings will have a padlock icon.
==TV Content Locks==
(Version A25 or newer)&lt;br&gt;
This offers 4 categories: ''Violence'', ''Sexual Situations'', ''Language'', ''Suggestive Dialog''. Choose a category. Use the up and down arrow keys to select the rating to lock, then Press '''OK/Select''' to enable or disable the lock. If you enable a rating, all stronger ratings will automatically lock. If you disable a rating, all weaker ratings will automatically unlock.

==Channel Locks==
Use the up and down arrow keys to select the channel you want to lock, then Press '''OK/Select''' to enable or disable the lock.&lt;br&gt;
Locked channels will have a padlock icon.

==Master Locks==
This leads to a sub-menu with two selections:
===Bypass Locks===
If you change this to ''Yes'' and confirm, all title, rating, and channel locks will be bypassed.
===Clear all Locks===
(This is named '''Remove all locks''' in software version 75.58 and newer.)&lt;br&gt;
If you change this to ''Yes'' and confirm, all title, rating, and channel locks will be removed.

==Adult Titles==
(As of software version 75.58, this has been changed to '''Hide Titles''')&lt;br&gt;
Enables or disables the display of Adult titles and descriptions.

When set to ''Show'', Adult titles and descriptions will be displayed as normal in the Guide.&lt;br&gt;
When set to ''Hide'', Adult titles will display as ''Adult Programming'' and there will be no program description.
==Hide Titles==
(This is new in version A25.)&lt;br&gt;
Enables or disables the display of Adult or TV-MA titles and descriptions.

Use the up and down arrow keys to select the option you want, then press '''OK/Select''' to enable that option.

Hidden titles will display as ''Adult Programming'' or ''TV-MA Programming'' in the Guide and there will be no program description.

==PINs Setup==
These options allow you to clear or create Personal Identification Numbers ([[w:Personal Identificaiton Number|PIN]]s).

As of version A25, this has been moved into the ''Parental Control Setup'' menu.

The Locks PIN is used for Parental Control.

The Purchase PIN is used for approving [[w:Pay-per-view|PPV]] and OnDemand purchases.

===Enter new Locks PIN===
This is only shown if you do not have a Locks PIN defined.&lt;br&gt;
To create a PIN, type in a 4 digit number. You will then be asked to re-type it to confirm.

===To clear, enter current Locks PIN===
This is only shown if you DO have a Locks PIN defined.&lt;br&gt;
Type in the 4 digit number to clear the PIN. With no Locks PIN, Parental Control is disabled.
===0000===
This is only shown if you do not have a Purchase PIN defined.&lt;br&gt;
To create a PIN, type in a 4 digit number. You will then be asked to re-type it to confirm.

===To clear, enter current Purchase PIN===
This is only shown if you DO have a Purchase PIN defined.&lt;br&gt;
Type in the 4 digit number to clear the PIN. With no Purchase PIN, anybody can order a PPV or OnDemand movie.
===If power is lost...===
''If power is lost, would you like to lock all programs until ratings and titles are restored?''&lt;br&gt;
This is only shown if you DO have a Locks PIN defined.&lt;br&gt;
If set to ''No'', anybody can view programs, even if the program guide does not have information about it and displays '''To Be Announced''' as the title.&lt;br&gt;
If set to ''Yes'', programs cannot be shown until the guide data is received and matches any parental control settings.

==Service Locks Setup==
This option allows you to enable or disable locks for services such as OnDemand. You must have a Locks PIN defined.

As of version A25, this has been moved into the ''Parental Control Setup'' menu.

After entering your Locks PIN, there will be a list of supported services.&lt;br&gt;
Use the arrow keys to select the service.&lt;br&gt;
Press '''OK/Select''' to lock or unlock a service.&lt;br&gt;
Locked services will display a padlock icon.</text>

Ozone can be assigned two different Lewis structures, but neither one accurately represents the structure and bonding in the O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.

:[[Image:Ozone-resonance.png|center|400px|Canonical structures of ozone]]

Spectroscopic data indicates both O−O bonds in ozone are equal in length and strength.  The central oxygen atom is positively charged and the terminal oxygen atoms each carry partial negative charge.

      <comment>/* Physical properties */[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: explination → explanation using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Naming==

The halogen name is put before the alkane chain name, in alphabetical order.  For example, CBrClFI would be named ''bromochlorofluoroiodomethane'' because Br &lt; Cl &lt; F &lt; I in the alphabet. The -x- notation is then used to describe the position of the halogen in relation to the rest of the chain. The halogens are listed in alphabetical order, before finally the alkane name change is suffixed on to the end.

==Physical properties==

The halogenalkanes' boiling point increase as the atomic mass of the halogen atoms increase, or as the number of halogen atoms increase. Effectively the mass is what determines the boiling point.

A simple explanation for this is that the amount of instantaused dipole-induced interactions increase. With this increase in intermolecular force, more energy is required to break the intermolecular bonds, so the boiling point is higher.

==Bond enthalpies==

The bond between carbon and the halogen itself gets weaker as the size of the halogen increases. For example, the C-I bond is much weaker than the C-F bond due to the much bigger size of the Iodene atom. With a weaker bond, it becomes easier to break said bond and thus the reactivity increases. As a guide:

* Fluoro- compounds are extremely unreactive
* Chloro- compounds are somewhat reactive. This is what causes the breakdown of ozone with CFCs.
* Bromo- and iodo- compounds are reactive and are useful as catalysts and the like in chemical synthesis.

==Homolytic fission==

The first type of fission that Halogenalkanes go through is homolytic fission. In this the C atom and Halogen atoms become radicalised

==Hetrolytic fission==

In hetrolytic fission the C-X bond breaks and both become ionised. The halogen atom becomes negatively charged and the carbon becomes positively charged − a carbocation.

==Substituion reactions==

In this a nucleophile from another group replaces the halogen and leaves the halogen ionised outside the molecule.

==Preparation and reactions of halogenalkanes==

Radonc, thanks for helping out with the [[Radiation Oncology]] project! [[User:Brim|Brim]] 03:46, 4 March 2007 (UTC)


*Welcome to the RadOnc textbook!
*For the radiation oncology project, please use the '''bold''' function reasonably
**Please make sure that the overall formatting doesn't change, since location of the quotes makes a difference. Please use the preview function to verify this
**This is a public resource, so please only bold things that are truly important to ''everyone''. We have tried to follow a format where only the name of the institution or the name of the study and year of publication are bolded. This way, it is easy to find trials and studies, and not be lost in a sea of bold text. I suppose I think of it as having a textbook in a library, and highlighting in the textbook. Some things should clearly be emphasized, but it should be used sparingly. Thanks for your consideration!
**You may consider ''italics'' or &lt;u&gt;underlines&lt;/u&gt; instead

== Categories ==

[[:Category:GCE Advanced Level]] is the full category name for all the A-level books.  [[OCR Advanced GCE in Chemistry‎]] is already in that category.  [[:Category:A-level Chemistry]] is for the [[A-level Chemistry]] book, not [[OCR Advanced GCE in Chemistry‎]].  Categories that are the same name as a book are reserved solely for that book.

[[OCR Advanced GCE in Chemistry‎]] is in [[:Category:GCE Advanced Level]] and [[:Category:Chemistry]], both of which are general categories that classify it based on its content.  

When you put [[OCR Advanced GCE in Chemistry‎]] into the category for the book [[A-level Chemistry]], that actually took it out of the display for [[Subject:Chemistry]], which is where readers find the books they're looking for.  I hope this explains why I had to undo your most recent edits.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:23, 16 April 2010 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Microeconomics vs Macroeconomics */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Economics== 
Simply put, economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources to satisfy competing ends&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Gary Becker&lt;/ref&gt;. In general, this applies mainly to microeconomics. This is because in Macroeconomics, there are many situations where resources are not scarce. 

==Microeconomics vs Macroeconomics==
'''Microeconomics''' applies to small elements of an economy. This may be trade between two people, or trade between two countries. It usually focuses on a small basket of goods being traded between a small group of agents. On the other hand, '''Macroeconomics''' is the  study of an entire '''economy'''. It looks at aggregate inputs and outputs with the goal to understand the flows of total consumption, employment rates, wages, prices and many other aggregate parts of an economy. In macroeconomics we look at both the long run and short run changes in the economy.

Microeconomics is the study of decisions that people and businesses make regarding the allocation of resources and prices of goods and services. This means also taking into account taxes and regulations created by governments. Microeconomics focuses on supply and demand and other forces that determine price levels for specific companies in specific industry sectors. For example, microeconomics would look at how a specific company could maximize its production and capacity so it could lower prices and better compete in its industry.

Macroeconomics, on the other hand, is the field of economics that studies the behavior of the economy as a whole and not just on specific companies, but entire industries and economies. This looks at economy-wide phenomena such as Gross National Product (GDP) and how it is affected by changes in unemployment, national income, rate of growth, and price levels. For example, macroeconomics would look at how an increase/decrease in net exports would affect a nation's capital account or how GDP would be affected by unemployment rate.

While these two studies of economics appear to be different, they are actually interdependent and complement one another since there are many overlapping issues between the two fields. For example, increased inflation (macro effect) would cause the price of raw materials to increase for companies and in turn affect the end product's price charged to the public.

The bottom line is that microeconomics takes a bottoms-up approach to analyzing the economy while macroeconomics takes a top-down approach. Regardless, both micro- and macroeconomics provide fundamental tools for any finance professional and should be studied together in order to fully understand how companies operate and earn revenues and thus, how an entire economy is managed and sustained.

==Main Questions==
The study of Macroeconomics looks to solve one broad question:
* What Causes Economic Growth?

In pursuit of solving this question, macro economists look at causes of business cycles, inflation, employment and many other aspects of the economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Maybe you can explain briefly why an atmosphere is unattainable at extreme temperatures. 

When you say that the atmosphere later contained water vapor and gases, maybe you can give a brief reference of when.

Maybe discuss more about what caused life to form during the Archean era--primordial soup, CHNOPS formation possibly and other specific conditions.

Perhaps go into more detail about Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic eras.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Spreadsheets ==

This tutorial probably works with other spreadsheets (such as [[w:open office]]) with minor modifications.

A '''spreadsheet''' such as Excel is a program that lets you analyze moderately large amounts of data by placing each data point in a '''cell''' and then performing the same operation on groups of cells at once. One of the nice things about spreadsheets is that data input and manipulation is relatively intuitive and hence easier than doing the same tasks in a programming language like MATLAB (discussed next). This section shows how to do some of these manipulations so that you don't have to by hand.

== Anatomy of a spreadsheet ==

A spreadsheet has a number of parts that you should be familiar with. When you first open up the spreadsheet program, you will see something that looks like this (the image is from the German version of open office)

[[Image:OOo-2.0-Calc-KDE-german.png]]

First off, notice that the entire page is split up into boxes, and each one is labeled. ''Rows are labeled with numbers and columns with letters''. Also, try typing something in, and notice that the box above the spreadsheet (to the right of &lt;math&gt; \Sigma = &lt;/math&gt;) will change automatically as you type. When you're just putting in numbers, this '''info box''' will just have the same number in there. But when you're putting in formulas, the cell will display the value calculated from the formula, while the info box will display what the formula was.

== Inputting and Manipulating Data in Excel ==

The first step in any spreadsheet analysis is to input the raw data you want to analyze. It is most effective if you put it in columns, with one column for each variable. It lets you see more data at once, and it also is less limited because the maximum number of rows is much larger than the maximum number of columns.

It is good practice to use the first row for the names of the variables, and the remaining for the data points. Make sure you include units. In this section, the following data will be used as illustration:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! (Rownumber) !! Column A !! Column B
|-
| 1 || t(min) || D (yards)
|-
| 2 || 1.1 || 559.5
|-
| 3 || 1.9 || 759.5
|-
| 4 || 3.0 || 898.2
|-
| 5 || 3.8 || 1116.3
|-
| 6 || 5.3 || 1308.7
|}


=== Using formulas ===

In order to tell the spreadsheet that you want to use a formula rather than just enter a number, you have to start the entry with an equal sign (=). You can then use combinations of decimal values and '''cell designations'''. A cell designation is simply the column letter followed by the row number containing the value you wish to manipulate. For example, if you wanted to find the product of the distance traveled and the time spent traveling, you could put in the formula:

 = A2*B2

into any empty cell and it would give you the answer. From here out it will be assumed that this value is in cell C2. You should label the column with the type of calculation you're performing.

=== Performing Operations on Groups of Cells ===

The question may arise: why not just put in the numbers themselves instead of referencing the cell? There are two major reasons for this:

# If you change the value in the referenced cell, the value calculated in the formula will automatically change.
# The built-in '''dragging''' capability of most spreadsheets.

The dragging capability is a simple concept. If you have put a formula into a spreadsheet, you can have it ''copied'' to any number of cells you want. To do this, select the cell with the formula and bring the mouse pointer to its lower-right hand corner. You should see a dark '''+''' icon:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| || '''Info Bar'''   || &quot;=A2*B2&quot;
|-
| (rownum) || Column A || Column B || Column C
|-
| 1 || t(min) || D(yards) || t*D
|-
| 2 || 1.1 || 559.5 || &lt;br&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt; ------------- &lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt; |  625.45  | &lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; ------------'''+'''
|-
| 3 || 1.9 || 759.5 ||
|-
| 4 || 3.0 || 898.2 ||
|-
| 5 || 3.8 || 1116.3 ||
|-
| 6 || 5.3 || 1308.7 ||
|}

Click on the + and drag it down. '''This will cause the formulas to change according to how you drag the box.''' In this case, if you drag it down to row 6, the spreadsheet will produce the following:

     A            B              C
 1  t (min)      D (yards)      t*D
 2  1.1         559.5         615.45
 3  1.9         759.5         1443.05
 4  3.0         898.2         2694.6
 5  3.8         1116.3         4241.94
 6  5.3         1308.7         6936.11

If you click on the last value in column C (6936.11) the info bar will display:

 =A6*B6

This is very useful for performing the same operations on multiple sets of data at once; rather than having to do the multiplication 5 separate times here, we just do it once and drag down the box.

=== Special Functions in Excel ===

In order to do many mathematical operations in Excel (or at least the easiest way), it is necessary to use ''functions'' (not to be confused with formulas). A function is simply an implementation someone already wrote for the mathematical operation, so all you have to do is know how to tell it to do the operation and where to put it when it's done. In excel, you can call a function named &quot;function&quot; by typing the following into a cell:

 =function(inputs)

The function will then execute, and the cell containing the call will display the answer. The necessary inputs are sometimes numbers but are more often the cell addresses. For example, in the data above, say you wanted to take the exponential (&lt;math&gt; e^x &lt;/math&gt;) of all the time points in column A, and place the result in column D. The function for exponential is '''exp''', and it can only accept one input at a time, but due to the dragging capability of Excel this will not matter much, you can just call it once and then drag the cell ''as you would with any formula containing cell addresses''. So to do this you would type into cell D2:

 =exp(A2)

Hit enter, then click the + in the bottom right and drag the cell down. You should end up with something like this after labeling the D column appropriately:

          A          B            C          D
 1       t (min)   D(yards)     t*D       e^t
 2       1.1      559.5       615.45    3.004166024
 3       1.9      759.5       1443.05   6.685894442
 4       3        898.2       2694.6    20.08553692
 5       3.8      1116.3      4241.94   44.70118449
 6       5.3      1308.7      6936.11   200.33681

All excel functions output only one value at a time, though some can accept multiple cells at a time as input (mostly statistical functions). 

Following is a brief synopsis of the functions available. For a complete list, see the help files for your spreadsheet, as the availability of each function may vary depending on which one you are using. CELL signifies either the row/column designation of the cell you want to pass to the function as input, or some numerical value you enter manually.

==== Mathematics Functions ====

Generally these only take one input at a time.

 abs(CELL): [[w:Absolute value|Absolute value]] of CELL
 sqrt(CELL): [[w:Square root|Square root]] of CELL [to do nth roots, use CELL^(1/n)]
 ln(CELL): [[w:Natural logarithm|Natural log]] of CELL
 log10(CELL): Log of CELL to base 10
 log(CELL, NUM): Log of CELL to the base NUM (use for all bases except e and 10)
 exp(CELL): [[w:Exponential function|Exponential]](e^x) of CELL. Use since Excel doesn't have a built-in constant &quot;e&quot;.
 sin(CELL), cos(CELL), tan(CELL): [[w:Trigonometric functions|Trigonometric functions]] sine, cosine, and tangent of CELL. CELL must be in '''radians'''
 asin(CELL), acos(CELL), atan(CELL): [[w:Inverse trigonometric functions|Inverse trigonometric functions]] (returns values in '''radians''')
 sinh(CELL), cosh(CELL), tanh(CELL): [[w:Hyperbolic function|Hyperbolic functions]]
 asinh(CELL), acosh(CELL), atanh(CELL): Inverse hyperbolic functions
 
==== Statistics Functions ====

These are examples of useful statistics functions in Excel, they are not by any means the only ones. 

GROUP means a group of cells that are directly next to each other. Define a group by the syntax FIRSTCELL:LASTCELL, for example, using GROUP = A2:A5 passes all the cells between A2 and A5 (inclusive) to the function. If a function requires two different groups (for example, a y and an x), both groups must be within continuous groups of cells.

 average(CELL1, CELL2, ...) OR average(GROUP): Computes the arithmetic average of all inputs.
 intercept(GROUP1, GROUP2): Calculates the y-intercept (b) of the regression line where y = GROUP1 and x = GROUP2.
    GROUP1 and GROUP2 must have the same size.
 pearson(GROUP1, GROUP2): Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) between GROUP1 and GROUP2.
 stdev(CELL1, CELL2, ...) OR stdev(GROUP): Computes the ''sample'' standard deviation (divides by n-1) of all inputs.
 slope(GROUP1, GROUP2): Calculates the slope (m) of the regression line where y = GROUP1 and x = GROUP2. 
    GROUP1 and GROUP2 must have the same size.

==== Programming Functions ====

== Solving Equations in Spreadsheets: Goal Seek ==

Excel and possibly other spreadsheets have a very useful tool called ''goalseek'' which allows the user to solve single-variable equations (and can be used as an aid in guess-and-check for systems of algebraic equations). Let's suppose for the purposes of this tutorial that you wish to find a solution to the equation:

&lt;math&gt; 0 = X^3 + 2X^2 - X + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

In order to set up the problem in Goalseek, it is necessary to define a cell for the variable you want to change (X) and a cell for the function you want to evaluate.

{{NOTE|Goalseek will '''only work''' if you tell it to evaluate some function until it reaches a ''constant value''. You cannot tell it to equal something that can change, so for example you cannot do something like this:

&lt;math&gt; X - X^3 = 2X^2 + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

because neither side is a constant. The easiest way around this is generally to solve the function for zero and then use that as the evaluating function.}}

Here, we could set up the cells as follows:

    A    B          
 1  X    f(X)
 2  -1    =A2^3 + 2*A2^2 - A2 + 1

To solve this one, go to 

 Tools &gt; Goalseek...

It'll give you three boxes: &quot;Set Cell&quot;, &quot;To Value&quot;, and &quot;By Changing Cell&quot;. Since we want the value in cell B2 to equal 0, enter B2 into the &quot;Set Cell&quot; box and 0 into the &quot;To Value&quot; box. Since cell B2 depends on cell A2, we want to change A2 so that B2 equals 0. Hence, the &quot;By Changing Cell&quot; box should contain A2. Put that in and click &quot;OK&quot;, and Goalseek will converge to an answer:

    A           B          
 1  X          f(X)
 2  -2.54683   -0.00013

Notice that ''the success of the goalseek depends on what your initial guess was''. If you try to put in an initial guess of 0 in this example (instead of -1), goalseek will diverge. It will tell you so, saying &quot;Goal Seeking with Cell B2 May Not have Found a Solution&quot;. However, the algorithm is generally fairly robust so it shouldn't take too many guesses to obtain convergence.

{{NOTE|You can only enter ''one cell'' into each of the &quot;Set Cell&quot; and &quot;By Changing Cell&quot; boxes, and the value in &quot;To Value&quot; must be a constant}}.

== Graphing Data in Excel==

In Excel, there are a variety of ways to graph the data you have inserted, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and many others. The most commonly-used in my experience is the '''scatterplot''', which is the name Excel uses for the typical x-y &quot;line graph&quot; plot that you probably think of first when you think of a graph.

=== Scatterplots ===

Scatterplots can be made relating any one independent variable to any number of dependent variables, though if you try to graph too many it will get crowded and hard to read. Excel will automatically give each different dependent variable a different color and a different shape, so that you can distinguish between them. You can also name each &quot;series&quot; of data differently and Excel will automatically set up a legend for you.

This is how to make a scatterplot:

# Put the data into columns just like it was given in the problem statement.
# Now we need to set up the graph. Go to: &lt;math&gt; Insert \rightarrow Chart &lt;/math&gt;. 
# Select &quot;XY (scatter)&quot; and click &quot;next&quot;.
# Click the &quot;series&quot; tab (on top). If there are any series present, remove them with the remove button (since it usually guesses wrong what you want to graph).

Now we can add a series for each dependent variable we want to graph as follows:

# Click &quot;add&quot;.
# Next to &quot;X values&quot; click the funky arrow symbol to the right of the text box. A small box will pop up.
# Click on the first value for the ''independent variable'' and drag the mouse down to the last value. Click the funky symbol again to bring you back to the main window.
# Do the same thing with the &quot;Y values&quot; but this time you want to select the values of the ''dependent variable''.
# Click next, and give the graph a title and labels if you want. Then click next and &quot;finish&quot; to generate your graph.

=== Performing Regressions of the Data from a Scatterplot ===

Once you have a scatterplot of your data, you can do one of several types of regression: logarithmic, exponential, polynomial (up to 6th degree), linear, or moving-average. Excel will plot the regression curve against your data automatically, and (except for moving average) you can tell it to give you an equation for the curve. To do this:

# Right click on one of the data points (it doesn't matter which). Click &quot;add trendline...&quot;
# A new window will come up, asking you for the type of regression. Choose the type of regression you want to use.
# Click on the &quot;options&quot; tab, and check the &quot;Display Equation on Chart&quot; box (and, if you want, the &quot;Display R-squared value on Chart&quot; box). Click OK.

If you chose a &quot;linear&quot; regression with the sample data above, the equation and &lt;math&gt; R^2&lt;/math&gt; value appear on the graph as &lt;math&gt; y = 177.87x + 391.28, R^2=0.9843 &lt;/math&gt;. Note Excel displays &lt;math&gt; R^2&lt;/math&gt; rather than R (so that we don't need to worry about negative vs. positive values); if you want R just take the square root, which is 0.9921 as we calculated in the section on linear regressions.

=== Polynomial Regressions ===

[[MATLAB]] is able to do regressions up to very large polynomial orders, using the &quot;polyfit&quot; function. The syntax for this function is:

 polyfit(XDATA, YDATA, Order)

The x data and y data must be in the form of ''arrays'', which for the purposes of this application are simply comma-separated lists separated by brackets. For example, suppose you want to perform the same linear regression that had been performed in the &quot;linear regression&quot; section. The first step is to define the two variables:

 &gt;&gt; XDATA = [1.1,1.9,3.0,3.8,5.3];
 &gt;&gt; YDATA = [559.5,759.4,898.2,1116.3,1308.7];

Then just call polyfit with order '1' since we want a linear regression.

 &gt;&gt; polyfit(XDATA, YDATA, 1)
 ans = 1.0e+002 *
   1.77876628209900   3.91232582806103

The way to interpret this answer is that the first number is the slope of the line (1.778*10^2) and the second is the y-intercept (3.912*10^2).

=== Nonlinear Regressions (fminsearch) ===

      <comment>Critical errors of fact in elements</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Mizar and Alcor--maybe mention briefly where they are, which galaxy they're in.

Maybe explain what you mean by &quot;period of 10,000 years&quot; in case don't understand. Also, maybe define binary system more clearly.

Maybe can clarify on what is a star's &quot;proper motion&quot;. Pictures of wavy and straight paths? 

Maybe explain why escape velocity gets smaller as a star gets bigger in addition to mathematical relationship given by equation, seems counterintuitive, at least to me...

==Elements==
The elements section here is grossly wrong as it stands.  Nearly all stars are about 75% H, 25% He, and 2% or less other stuff ... yes, I know that sums to more than 100%, but those are good ball-park numbers.  Main sequence stars fuse H to He.  Red giants continue that, and also fuse He to C and O, and fuse to heavier elements still, depending on stellar mass, evolutionary stage, and so on.  AGB stars make elements heavier than Fe via the s-process.  Only white dwarfs and neutron stars don't have hydrogen as their primary constituent!  (And yes, there are other oddball things like the hydrogen-deficient carbon stars that seem to be lacking H, but there is not yet a consensus about what those things are and how they are made, so omitting those is within the tradition of textbook writing for low levels, as is the complex variety of binary star evolution, maybe.)  Getting into the nuclear processing is part of stellar structure and evolution, a later part of the book.  Here, the point should be that most stars are H and He and a percent or so of other elements, and heavier elements produced in stars' interiors stay there until the end stages of stars' lifetimes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There was once two types of culture: the &quot;high&quot; culture of the rich, and the &quot;low&quot;, folk culture of the poor. The rise of the middle class created a &quot;middle&quot; culture. The concomitant rise in technology and industrialization created a &quot;democratic&quot; entertainment for the mainstream. From the mid-1800s on, entertainment began to be mass-produced, and literacy boomed.

As printing became cheaper, newspaper prices were slashed. News baron Gordon Bennett's ''Sun'' was the first penny newspaper. The news in these papers was often sensationalized, to encourage sales. Papers also carried serialized fiction. Newsboys were employed to hawk the papers on streetcorners.

Books were still expensive (around $10), so paperbacks were invented. These cardboard covered books sold for 25 cents. Popular authors at this time were Walter Scott and James Fenimore Cooper. There were also female authors, whose books often expressed anti-male, pro-domestic, and puritanical sentiments. Western and southwestern fiction expressed Calvinist attitudes, and often portrayed blacks and Mexicans as inferior. Native Americans, however, were viewed ambivalently. Poetry was very popular, such as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's ''Voices of the Night.'' Poems from this period were primarily optimistic, encouraging progress.

Theaters were another well-liked form of entertainment. Expensive tickets were 75 cents, while gallery seating was 12 and a half cents. At the Bowery in New York, tickets went for 10-30 cents. Theaters offered both high-class and pop culture entertainment, sometimes even melding the two into a kind of &quot;high pop.&quot; The most popular play was &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin.&quot; Other popular plays were written by Shakespeare, or based on the works of Charles Dickens.

Minstrel shows were plays done by white men wearing blackface (in imitation of African-Americans). Two well-known blackface comedians were Thomas &quot;Daddy&quot; Rice and Edwin Christy. Rice was called &quot;the Father of American Minstrelsy.&quot;[http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/who.htm] Characters played by these minstrels, such as Uncle Ned and Zip Coon, portrayed African-American males as stupid and lazy. Black women, on the other hand, were portrayed as large and genial (the &quot;mammy&quot; stereotype). [http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/mammies/]

In 1841, P.T. Barnum purchased the American Museum in the Manhattan borough of New York. Barnum's museum was for entertainment, not education, and featured oddities like ventriloquists, midgets, and albinos. One of his &quot;freaks&quot; was General Tom Thumb, who was 2 ft. 1 in. tall at age 5, and then quit growing.

New York's Central Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. People were beginning to worry that cities would become unlivable. In 1850, New York city only had 500,000 people, and it was already crowded. So, Central Park was created as a place for people to get away and relax. In the park, people could ice skate during the winter, and bicycle during the summer. It was meant to be a meeting place for all citizens; however, the richest lived near the park, and the poor far from it.

The Antebellum Period of American history is before the Civil War (''antebellum'' means &quot;before war&quot;). The Early Period falls between 1860 and 1920. The &quot;Jazz Age&quot;, also known as the &quot;Roaring 20s&quot;, was dominated by corporate oligopolies. Many industries were controlled by a small number, and more and more people were working in factories. 

As universities began to appear, this new middle class had access to a more formal education than the lower classes. The US GDP increased by 3300%. The work week went from 60 hours in 1860 to 40 hours in 1920. The birth rate boomed.

==Dawn of Consumer Culture==
Out of this, the consumer culture was born. The first department stores began appearing at the end of the 19th century. Macy's was founded in 1858. Other department stores from this period were Wanamaker's in Philadelphia and Fields.[http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/soc/shoppingcenter4.html]

Most department stores were run by families. The stores were glamorous and grandiose, with a large inventory geared towards the upper class. They had skylights, chandeliers, lounges, and even in-store restaurants.[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/wanamaker_hi.html] For advertising, they  bought full-page ads. Competition between department stores created the end-of-season sale, and price wars. 

Some stores, like Montgomery Ward and Sears, were mail-order only, mailing out catalogs to customers. These companies appealed to people who didn't live near a department store. Richard Sears, founder of Sears, Roebuck and Co., gained a loyal following of rural customers.

Chain stores began to crop up, with names like Woolworth, Great Atlanta, Pacific Tea, and A&amp;P. Frank Woolworth opened his first store, the Great 5 Cents Store, in Utica, NY in 1879, his strategy being to sell nothing for more than a nickel. Although that store closed down, Woolworth succeeded with a similar store in Lancaster, PA, extending the prices to a dime. Woolworth's &quot;5-and-10&quot; stores were a huge success.[http://www.history.com/tdih.do?id=5737&amp;action=tdihArticleCategory]

The Great Depression occurred during 1929-1939.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One advantage to using Flash to deliver online content is the ability to '''embed fonts'''.  On a standard HTML page, the fonts that are displayed are limited to those found on viewer’s computer.  Flash, however, allows the developer to determine exactly which fonts will be displayed regardless if the user doesn’t have the font installed on his or her computer.  Static text automatically embeds the necessary font outlines so the .swf displays the font properly.  For more control over  embedding dynamic and input text, the designer may choose to use the embedding dialogue box.  This allows the designer to specifically control which characters, symbols, &amp; glyphs to embed into the .swf.   To use the embedding dialogue box, create a dynamic or input text field.  Then click on the embed button in the properties inspector.  In the embedding dialogue box, select the specific character sets to embed or use the auto-fill button to automatically load all the characters in the current text field.  Selectively choosing character sets can reduce file size and optimize the performance of the movie.

To add a filter, first select a MovieClip, text field, or button symbol. Next, either click on the Filters tab in the Property inspector, or open the filters panel. After a filter is selected, it will appear in a list on the left side of the filters panel, and you will see the filter effect applied to the selected item.

The settings for each filter are different, so it is best to try them out and see what each one does. It will be fairly simple to adjust each filter to your liking. If you would like to remove a filter, just select the name of the filter in the list and click the minus symbol at the top of the panel.

To select the individual settings for an applied filter at any time, simply select a single filter in the filter panel list. Be careful of using too many filters at once, though, as it has a tendency to make your project look tacky. You can also toggle these on and off to view different filter combinations. This is done by clicking the check mark or cross icon that appears next to the filter name.

It would be impossible to let you know all about every filter combination, but I can go over some of the main settings as a place to start your experimentation. 

'''Blur X, Blur Y:''' This sets the distance that the edge of a shape will extend either horizontally (X) and vertically (Y).

'''Strength:'''  This sets the opacity of the filter effect you are using. The default is 100, or 100 % opacity. You will usually want to change this to anywhere between 1 and 100 to achieve the desired opacity. If you wish to change the opacity of a filter past 100 percent, it will add opacity to the softened area of the shape. The maximum strength is 1,000 percent, but the result will be an expanded solid shape with a jagged edge, much like something rendered without anti-aliasing, so use this only if you have a good reason.

'''Quality:''' This sets the smoothness of the rendered filter. It also has an impact on the performance of the finished movie. Quality is low by default, and as the quality is increased, gradients are smoother, and the steps in blurs are softened. However, if performance is an issue, you should make adjustments in the color and blur settings instead.

'''Color:''' Click on color chips to access currently loaded swatches, and set the colors you will use for rendering Drop shadow and Glow effects. These colors can be picked on the color wheel, or by their specific hexidecimal number values.
Drop shadow's default solid color is black. Glow's default solid color is red.  The solid color set will fade from solid to transparent, making a soft glow or shadow effect, depending on the color choice.
The Bevel filter requires a shadow and a highlight color, by default black and white. The Gradient bevel and glow make it possible to add multiple colors to gradients. If you click the color anchors on the gradient strip, you can change the colors being used in that particular gradient.

'''Angle:''' This sets the direction of offset that is applied with the Distance setting. For instance, if you set the distance to 0, the angle setting will have no visible effect. By default, this setting is at a 45 degree angle, and the range is at 0 to 360 degrees. You can change this setting either by entering numbers manually, or by clicking and dragging on the circle.

'''Distance:''' This sets how many pixels the distance is between the center of the item, and the center of the gradient.

Angle: Sets the direction of offset to be applied with the Distance setting. If Distance is 
set to 0, changing the Angle (or degree of offset) will have no visible effect. The default 
is a 45-degree angle and the range is 0 to 360 degrees. You can change this setting by 
manually entering a number (decimals are allowed), or by dragging a small circle icon 
around a fixed 360-degree arc invoked by clicking the arrow (drop-down menu) icon 
next to the Angle value field. The higher the Distance setting, the more obvious the off- 
set direction or Angle will be. 

Distance: Sets the pixel value for the distance between the center point of the original 
item and the center point of the rendered filter (gradient). The default setting is 5 and 
the range is from -32 to 32 pixels. If the distance setting is 0, the rendered gradient and 
the original item will be center-aligned. 

In addition to the adjustable settings, there are some check box options that expand the 
visual possibilities for filters: 

Knockout: Converts the original shape into a transparent area, while leaving the ren- 
dered effect visible in any area that was not cut out by the original shape. 
Filter types: For Blur and Drop shadow filters, this is a check box to switch the ren- 
dered gradient from outside to inside the boundary of the original shape. For the multi- 
color gradient filters (Bevel, Gradient Glow, and Gradient Bevel), the options are listed 
in a drop-down menu that enables the filter to be set to render inside (Inner), outside 
(Outer), or inside and outside (Full) the boundaries of the original item. 

Hide object: This option is the secret to creating sophisticated Drop shadows (as we 
describe later in this chapter). When Hide object is enabled, the original object disap- 
pears, but the drop-shadow is preserved. 

The filter settings we have described thus far relate to the various gradient-based filters. 
The sliders available with the Adjust Color filter settings for adjusting various color qualities 
will be familiar to anyone who has worked in image editing programs like Photos hop or 
Fireworks. Flash updates the selected item on the Stage as you make color adjustments, 
so it is easy to experiment with the filter settings. However, it is important to know when
to apply the Adjust Color filter and when to use the color controls available from the 
Properties panel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why use Blend Modes? ==

Blends use different formulas on a pixel by pixel basis to mix a blend image with any images underneath. This can produce interesting, but sometimes unpredictable results, so the best way to go about figuring out which blend mode to use is to simply experiment. Each type of blend mode will produce a different result, so just play around with them until you see what you can do with each of them. It will be important to remember the concepts behind each of the blend modes for future projects.

[[Image:Blendmodes1.gif]]

This is a list of Blend modes available in Flash 8:

'''Normal:''' This is the default blend mode. Pixel values remain unchanged.

'''Layer:''' This also creates no visual change, but it is a requirement for Alpha and Erase blend modes.

'''Darken:''' Pixels in the base image that are lighter than the ones in the blend image, are replaced with the ones in the blend image. Pixels that are darker in the blend image will remain the same.

'''Multiply:''' This blend mode multiplies the RGB values of the base image pixels with the blend image pixels. Multiplying a color with black leaves it black, while multiplying it with white leaves the pixel unchanged.

'''Lighten:''' This compares the brightness of the base image pixels with the blend image pixels. Bas image pixels that are darker than the blend image are replaced with blend image pixels. Pixels in the base image lighter than the blend image are left unchanged, and the blend images disappears over white. 

'''Screen:''' Screen multiples the inverse of the blend and base colors. The results are a lighter combination of the base image and the blend image. Screening the image with black leaves the base image unchanged. Screening with white makes white. This one also disappears over white.

'''Overlay:''' If the base color is lighter than middle gray, the image is lightened. If it is darker than middle gray, it is darkened. 

'''Hard Light:''' If the blend color is lighter than middle gray, the image is lightened. If the blend color is darker than middle gray, the image is darkened. If you overlay the image with white or black, it will appear either solid white or solid black. 

'''Add:''' This adds the color values of the blend image to those in the base image.  Results are the bleached out combination of the two.

'''Subtract:''' This subtracts the blend color value from the base color value. Results for this one are a darkened combination of the two images.

'''Invert:''' The result of this blend mode is a reversal of color values.

'''Alpha:'''This blend mode is used to apply the contents of a nested Movie Clip as a mask for a parent Movie Clip.

'''Erase:''' This can be used to apply a nested Movie Clip as an eraser to cut out an area of an image in a parent Movie Clip.

Just came over from wikipedia, so probably won't contribute a heap to this.  I'm only really on wiki during my holidays (or when I'm procrastinating over assignments) so my contribs are pretty sparse and sporadic anyhow.  Let me know if you want to talk about any of my edits, I do make mistakes and when I do I like to know about them!</text>

= Motivation =
Below are listed of several reasons on why the &quot;hacktivist&quot; are keen on developing the mesh network technology
 
=== Digital Divide ===
In rural area, there are often lack of Internet access.
There are few projects in the world that tries to bridge the digital divide in the rural area.

(1) (India) SARI (Sustainable Access in Rural Area) 

Mesh network created India to let the rural India have access to Internet 
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |url=http://edev.media.mit.edu/SARI/mainsari.html  
  |title=Sustainable Access in Rural Area
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) (India) Aravind Teleophthalmology Kiosk

Mesh network created to let the patients self diagnosed himself in a kiosk and send the results to the doctors who maybe hundreds of kilometer away

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |url=http://laico.org/v2020resource/files/Atn.pdf  
  |title=Teleophthalmology
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(3) (Tibet) Dharamsala Wireless Mesh Network

In remote northern India region of Dharamsala where the Internet connection is patchy and unreliable, a group of networking experts helped the local people to set up the network.Using recycled PC parts and materials for antenna, they managed to connect over 2000 devices to the mesh networks itself.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Service Provider ===
(1) (South Africa) Mesh Potato by Village Telco

Mesh Potato is the wifi based mesh network services that provided data and free voice call to anyone in the network

Thanks for experimenting with Wikibooks. Your test worked, and has now been removed. Please use [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] for any other tests you want to do, since testing material in modules will normally be removed quickly. Please see the [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome page]] if you would like to learn more about contributing to our project.

Bone is living too.  We lose sight of this, but somehow the bone bound creatures that are osteocytes have managed to find a cooperative arrangement whereby they are transported from place to place while remaining comfortably ensconced in their protective surroundings.  They have their side of the bargain to uphold as well which is to manage the volume and pattern of structure which is their immediate environment and tend it like a garden.  They are like beavers it seems, mending breaks and leaks in their dam to restore the integrity of the structure upon which they rely.

What causes carpal tunnel syndrome?  It is a bit like asking what causes traffic jams.  It depends; many things. but then it all amounts to the same thing; sitting in traffic.  On the other hand, the cause is nice to know as it is likely to influence how long you will be sitting there.  If it was an accident, then  the delay will be self limiting, if it was a cave in at the tunnel ahead then you had best figure a way to turn around.  Similarly carpal tunnel syndrome can come about as a result of unaccustomed use.  Use of the hands it seems can result in a transient thickening of the lubricating linings around the tendons.  Their cumulative volume being increased has the effect of increasing the volume of tissue transiting the carpal tunnel, and a choke point is created. But the tendons do not come completely to rest, they continue to move as does the nerve only with more friction, and a higher interstitial pressure with resultant venous congestion, possibly leading to intercalary segment ischemia of the nerve, even eventual fibrosis.  So it seems that whatever the initial cause of the traffic jam, secondary accidents happen as well as road rage and the situation eventually can become a nightmare.  Why did they not make the road bigger in the first place? That is all well and good, however do we all wish to lug about great thick appendages with lots of room for all moving parts, how unwieldy would that be? 

So it seems we know a bit more about what it is like to be in a traffic jam than we know about how to prevent traffic jams.  We know what is happening to the nerve in carpal tunnel syndrome,  we know what to watch for when it is coming on, we know who tends to get it.  Life deals us some interesting problems, menapause means the tissues, have retained more fluid, the volume of the tendon, perineurium and tenosynovium collectively is enlarged and the space must be made larger to accommodate the change.  

What causes carpal tunnel syndrome may be the question that is voiced, but the question being asked is really this.  Who needs to pay for the surgery and the recovery and any residual disability from this carpal tunnel syndrome.  It matters then whether the cars have gotten larger and slower, or whether there was a land slide on the roadway.  The fix it different and the fault lies with different responsible parties.  

Investigators may continue to work on what we mean by thickening.  Are the tissues inflammed, are they bogged up with insoluble protein debris?Surgeons can work on ways to make the road way bigger without holding up the works too long.  Epidemiologists and occupational medicine specialists and rheumatologists can hold forth on whats to be done to lessen the probability of the occurrence and individuals can listen to their bodies and live in harmony with their physiologic limits but when all is said and done we are likely to be dealing with carpal tunnel syndrome for some time to come.</text>

;Alignment:The process of aligning the wheel vertically ([[w:camber angle|camber angle]]) and parallel to the direction of travel ([[w:Toe_%28automotive%29|toe]] and steer angles). 

;Axle Slot:One of two slots cut in the stock BSA kit block.

;Beveling:tapering the axle to reduce the contact area between the axle head and the outer wheel hub.

;Balancing:Wheel modification to achieve an equivalent mass distributed about the hub.

;Block:The 7 x 1-3/4 x 1-1/4 pine block.

;Bore polishing:Polishing the inner surface of the hub to reduce friction between the wheel and axle. 

;BSA:Boy Scouts of America.

;Coning:Modification of the inside wheel hub to reduce hub-to-body friction.

;Center Rail:On wood tracks, a lane guide that is approximately 1/4&quot; inch tall and 1-5/8&quot; wide that the car straddles to keep it on the track.

;Deburring:Axles are essentially one-inch nails that have two burrs under the head from the stamping process. A typical axle treatment consists of removing these burrs followed by sanding and polishing. 

;Dominant Wheel:The front wheel that touches when the car is on a flat surface. In a raised front wheel configuration, this is the wheel that is ''not'' raised.

;Extended Wheelbase:The largest distance possible between the axles such that the wheels do net extend past the end of the block:  5-3/4&quot; with the axle holes 5/8&quot; from the end of the block.

;Graphite:A form of [[w:carbon|carbon]] that is found in [[w:pencil|pencil]] lead. It is one of the favored dry lubricants 

;Grooving:Notching of axles to reduce the contact area and thus the [[w:friction|friction]] between the axle and the wheel.

;H Tread:A wheel modification in which the tread is cut with a &quot;H&quot; cross-section to allow contact with the track surface on the inner and outer parts of the tread only. 

;Kit:The Official BSA &quot;Grand Prix Pinewood Derby Kit&quot; with block, 4 axles, 4 wheels and instructions.

;Krytox:A liquid synthetic lubricant ([http://msds.dupont.com/msds/pdfs/EN/PEN_09004a2f800063fd.pdf MSDS]).[http://www.dupont.com/lubricants/en/index.html], [[w:krytox|Krytox]] oils and greases are [[w: perfluoropolyether |perfluoropolyether]] (PFPE) synththetic lubricants made by [[w:DuPont|DuPont]]

;Light Wheels:Wheels that have been reduced in mass, typically by removal of material from the inner side of the wheel.

;Matched Wheels:Wheels taken from the same mold number.

;Mold:The plastic [[w:Injection_moulding|injection mold]] for pinewood derby wheels.

;Mold Number:The number on the inside of a wheel, indicating the injection mold.

;Moly:[[w:Molybdenum disulfide|Molybdenum disulfide]] lubricant.

;Molybdenum disulfide:[[w:Molybdenum disulfide|Molybdenum disulfide]] is a dry lubricant similar to graphite. 

;Nickel plating:Nickel plated axles can be polished to a smoother finish than stock zinc BSA axles.

;Notching or Grooving:Axles can be notched or grooved to reduce the contact area and thus the [[w:friction|friction]] between the axle and the wheel.

;Nyoil:A liquid synthetic lubricant ([http://www.nyelubricants.com/pdf/nyoil_ii_copy.pdf MSDS]).

[[Image:Outlaw wheels.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Pinewood derby car &quot;outlaw&quot; wheels]]
;Outlaw Wheels:Thin wheels machined from a high-performance polymer such as [[w:delrin|delrin]] that are typically allowed only in open class races.

;Oversize Axles:Oversize axle (e.g. 0.091 diameter) axles can reduce wheel wobble. Official BSA axles are 0.087 inch in diameter. 

;Rail Riding:Adjustment of the dominant front wheel alignment to induce a slight steer toward the track center rail to cause the car to hug the rail as it goes down the track.

;Raised Wheel:One wheel (typically front) raised approximately 1/16 inch on the car body. This wheel is not in constant contact with the track and thus contributes less to the rotational inertia.

;Silicone:A [[w:Silicone|polysiloxanes]] organic/inorganic [[w: polymer|polymer]] lubricant.

[[Image:Speed axle.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Nickel-plated speed axle]]

;Speed Axles:Nickel-plated aftermarket axles.

;Teflon:The trade name for polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymer. Powdered Teflon is a common Derby car lubricant.

;V Tread:A wheel modification in which the tread is cut with a &quot;V&quot; cross-section to allow a single radial point of contact with the track surface.

;Wheelbase:The spacing between the front and rear wheels from wheel center to wheel center. The standard pinewood derby [[w:wheelbase|wheelbase]] is about 4.5 inches and the extended wheelbase is 5.75 inches with the wheels 5/8 inch from the end of the 7 inch block.</text>

== Concentris Systems LLC ==
http://www.concentris-systems.com

Concentris Systems uses open standards wireless mesh networking technology to develop unique solutions that solve real life, challenging problems for rugged and severe-duty applications.

Concentris pioneered the versatile RapidLink network architecture that offers reliable, secure, high performance wireless mesh data networking. Easy to deploy and manage, RapidLink is ideal for situations where conventional data networking techniques are impractical or cost prohibitive.

Concentris Systems is focused upon making other people’s technology work better. The company provides a comprehensive suite of hardware and software products, coupled with training programs and hands-on service, for OEM and System Developer customers. Its toolkit is flexible and intuitive making it possible to create application-specific solutions in a surprisingly short time.

MIT graduate Tareq Hoque founded Concentris Systems. Before Concentris, Hoque was the president of Firetide, a successful early innovator in the field of mesh networking protocol and ad-hoc mesh networking. He was also president of Adtech Inc., the largest contributor to the Spirent Communications group of companies.

Concentris Systems LLC is a small, disadvantaged minority-owned business based in Honolulu, Hawaii.

== Mesh Dynamics ==
http://www.meshdynamics.com

Incorporated in 2005, MeshDynamics is a privately held, profitable, U.S based corporation. Our headquarters are in Santa Clara, Northern California, USA. 
   
Target Markets: Emerging outdoor enterprise wireless market opportunities such as those in mining, materials processing, military and border security, video surveillance, seismic oil exploration etc., place high demands on the wireless network infrastructure. Beyond data, critical real-time voice and video streams must also be supported, often in motion. Traditional wireless mesh architectures have been unable to support demands of this traffic, and thus have not penetrated these fast-developing markets to date.

Extensive testing by USAF, Battelle and others confirm that MeshDynamics' patented wireless mesh technology provides the highest throughput, low latency, and low jitter demanded by these applications through the use of dynamic channel allocation and a robust tree-based (deterministic and scalable) topology. High quality voice/video transport in demanding underground mine environments some up to 40 hops deep are in operation. No other mesh provider has demonstrated this level of scalability. 
     
MeshDynamics mesh nodes have been installed in demanding applications requiring performance over multiple hops, noise free voice and video and rapid mesh formation with high speed mobility nodes. Applications include: municipal networking, underground mining and industrial, video surveillance, homeland security and public safety.

= How many radios? =
Meshes can be built with nodes that have a single radio, two radios and multiple radios.  The number of radios in mesh nodes depends on the throughput and latency demands of the mesh network.&lt;ref&gt;

  |title=Solving the Wireless Mesh Multi-Hop Dilemma
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== One ==
Single radio wireless mesh nodes are low cost, but are limited by latency and scalability.  The single radio node has take turns providing client access and transport to the network.  The node is forced to store and forward and thus introduces latency.

&lt;!-- need diagram showing throughput and latency versus the number of hops --&gt;



== Two ==
Dual-radio wireless mesh nodes enhance the scalability and capacity of the wireless mesh network.  One radio is used for client access and the other radio provides transport.  Since the radios operate independently on two different frequencies, one radio can send while the other one is receiving.  This reduces the latency from the access link to the transport link.  However, when one node is relaying from one node to the next, a two radio node still needs to store and forward, which introduces latency.

&lt;!-- need diagram showing throughput and latency versus the number of hops --&gt;

== Three or More ==
A multi-radio wireless mesh node solves the latency problem for both the access link and the transport link.  Multi-radio wireless nodes perform with very low latency and work well with real-time applications such as multimedia, voice and video applications.  Because the throughput is related to throughput, multi-radio nodes address high density coverage areas, and can be used to aggregate traffic from single- and dual-radio wireless mesh nodes.

Colgate University
&lt;!---
Colgate University in New York state is broadening its Wi-Fi horizons by launching a campus-wide outdoor network using Tropos Networks' MetroMesh equipment— but none of the units are meshing, reports Wi-Fi Planet

The university decided that it needed to expand its reach after a student survey found that students had as many as three to four IP-based devices—everything from PCs to game consoles to handheld devices used primarily for text messaging.

    &quot;We just wanted maximum throughput,&quot; says Rich Grant, the associate director of technology planning for the liberal arts school. &quot;We have backhaul on all the Tropos access points. That's an unusual implementation, but we wanted to maximize the number of users. It wasn't about geographical area — we wanted to service a large volume [of users].&quot;

    &quot;To be competitive, any campus needs to support some kind of Wi-Fi,&quot; says Grant. The network was installed for Colgate by Integral Wireless Solutions, an integrator based in Atlanta.

There have been some technological hurdles in implement in wider Wi-Fi system, however.

It was hoped that the Tropos hardware would provide a very strong signal strong, which worked fine on the lower part of campus where most of the buildings are wood-frame construction. The upper campus, however has stone buildings and needed interior APs. For that, Colgate turned to Cisco products supporting 802.11a/b/g.

The network is free to the college community of 2,750 undergraduates plus faculty and staff, plus it's open to visitors for Internet access.

When is a mesh network not a mesh network?

http://www.colgate.edu/ in central New York State knows. It recently completed the rollout of a campus wide outdoor network using http://www.tropos.com/ MetroMesh equipment but none of the units are meshing.

“We just wanted maximum throughput,” says Rich Grant, the associate director of technology planning for the liberal arts school. “We have backhaul on all the Tropos access points. That’s an unusual implementation, but we wanted to maximize the number of users. It wasn’t about geographical area we wanted to service a large volume [of users].”

Colgate’s foray into wireless started after the school’s Student Services group performed a survey of the student body, the vast majority of whom live on campus. Most reported owning as many as three to four IP-based devices. That includes everything from PCs to game consoles to handheld devices used primarily for instant messaging.

“To be competitive, any campus needs to support some kind of Wi-Fi,” says Grant. The network was installed for Colgate by http://www.integralwireless.net/, an integrator based in Atlanta.

Originally, Grant hoped the Tropos hardware would provide a signal strong enough to punch through walls and give students, faculty, and staff access to the network indoors. That worked fine on the lower part of campus where most of the buildings are wood-frame construction. However, on the upper campus filled with big stone buildings, it required interior APs. For that, Colgate turned to http://www.cisco.com/ products supporting 802.11a/b/g.

For now, the 5GHz 11a aspect is unused. It could come into play in the future for wireless VoIP. “It wasn’t that much more expensive to have a/b/g than b/g,” says Grant. “We’re hoping it’ll be upgradeable to 11n.”

Colgate uses http://www.bluesocket.com/ controllers to manage both the indoor and outdoor networks.

The outdoor Tropos-based network also extends into downtown http://www.hamiltonny.com/, Colgate’s hometown not far from Syracuse. The downtown hotspots are limited to areas around the http://www.colgateinn.com/ (owned by the college) and a centralized park. “It’s not an attempt at a pervasive metro network in town,” says Grant.

The network is free to the college community of 2,750 undergraduates plus faculty and staff, plus it’s open to visitors for Internet access.

ZigBee does not incorporate electric power lines into its technology therefore it is all wireless. ZigBee is very efficient, it can send up to 128 kilobits at a range of 250 feet. It is expected to be seen every from smoke detectors in your house to medical sensing devices. The best part is that it can function for a long time, on inexpensive batteries. Z-Wave also consists solely of wireless technology which is power efficient. It can send about 127 kilobits per second to a range of 100 feet. When you compare you would notice that Z-Wave and Insteon are very much similar. The only difference is that Insteon used electric power cables and Z-Wave doesn't.

= Introduction =

Wireless networks nowadays are part of our everyday life, as witnessed by several features: the number of cell (mobile) phone subscriptions reached 7.3 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/mobile-phone-world-population-2014/#!yXfeL
| title      = Number of mobile phones to exceed world population by 2014

}}&lt;/ref&gt;, short-range radio technologies such as WiFi and Blue-tooth are widespread as well as radio frequency IDs (RFIDs).
 
In a search on Google for “next generation wireless network,” top hits mostly refer to evolutions of the cellular technology collectively named 4G, including technologies such as LTE (Long-Term Evolution), LTE Advanced, etc. These technologies are essentially aimed at improving quality of service (QoS) in cellular networks,especially that which concerns data services, which are expected to play an increasing role in connected world. The improvements are mostly obtained through advancements in the physical and medium access layer of the network protocol stack, for example, through extensive use of multi antenna systems, while the overall architecture of the cellular network is mostly unchanged. Thus, forthcoming 4G networks can be considered as an evolution of the well-established cellular network concept.

On the other hand, the class of networks (ad hoc networks, mesh networks, wireless sensor networks, vehicular networks, and opportunistic networks) that we collectively call next generation wireless networks are characterized by very different features compared to cellular networks:

* Cellular networks rely heavily on a wired, very expensive communication infrastructure – the network of cellular base stations – to perform communication; on the contrary, next generation wireless networks are characterized by a lightweight – or even absent – infrastructure.
* Cellular networks are based on the use of relatively long wireless links,with typical communication ranges in the order of up to a few kilometers; on the contrary, next generation wireless networks use short-range – in the order of a few tenths of meters, or hundreds of meters at most – wireless links.
* Cellular networks rely heavily on the presence of several centralization points, where servers are used for optimizing resource allocation and coordinate radio channel access between the different users in a cell and in adjacent cells; on the contrary, in next generation wireless networks, centralization points are typically lacking, and most network functionalities must be realized in a fully distributed, self-coordinated environment.
* Cellular networks are single-hop wireless networks, since a mobile terminal directly communicates with a base station in the vicinity; on the contrary, next generation wireless networks typically make extensive use of multi-hop communications to compensate for the short radio range and increase coverage.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Header text !! Cellular network !! Wireless mesh network
|-
| Infrastructure || Yes || No, lightweight
|-
| Radio range || ≤ 2km || ≤ 300m
|-
| Centralization points || Yes || Mostly no
|-
| Type of communication || Single-hop || Multi-hop
|-
| Radio channel access || Coordinated || Mostly uncoordinated
|}

It is then evident that the class of emerging short-range wireless networks mentioned above displays striking differences with respect to traditional cellular networks, and that the design and realization of a network of this class entails defining brand-new network architectures and networking solutions spanning the entire network protocol stack. This explains our choice of naming the emergent class of short-range, multi-hop, decentralized wireless networks “next generation wireless networks.” Unless stated otherwise, in the remainder of this Wikibook we will use the term next generation wireless network exclusively to refer to a member of the class of short-range, multi-hop,decentralized wireless networks

== What it is actually ? ==
Wireless mesh network is a multi-hop, peer-to-peer wireless network in which mesh nodes connect with
redundant interconnections and cooperate with one another to route packets inside the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mesh nodes are small radio transmitters that function in the same way as a wireless router. Nodes use the common WiFi standards known as 802.11a, b and g to communicate wirelessly with other nodes.

Nodes are programmed with algorithms that tells them how to interact within the mesh network. The packets that carries informations travels across the network from point A to point B by hopping wirelessly from one mesh node to the next. The nodes automatically choose the quickest and safest path in a process known as dynamic routing.

There are two types of mesh network which are partial mesh and also full mesh. 
Partial mesh is mesh where not all the nodes are connected to each other meanwhile the full mesh is mesh where all the nodes are connected to each other

'''''Malus''''' is a genus of about 30-35 species of small deciduous trees or shrubs in the family Rosaceae, including the domesticated Orchard Apple, or Table apple as it was formerly called (''M. sylvestris domestica'', derived from ''M. sylvestris sieversii'', syn. ''M. pumila'').  The other species and subspecies are generally known as &quot;wild apples&quot;, &quot;crab apples&quot;, &quot;crabapples&quot; or &quot;crabs&quot;, this name being derived from their small and tart fruit.  The genus is native to the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, in Europe, Asia and North America.

==Description==
Apple trees are small, typically 4-12 m tall at maturity, with a dense, twiggy crown. The leaves are 3-10 cm long, alternate, simple, with a serrated margin. The flowers are borne in corymbs, and have five petals, which may be white, pink or red, and are perfect, with usually red stamens that produce copious pollen, and an inferior ovary; flowering occurs in the spring after 50-80 growing degree days (varying greatly according to subspecies and cultivar). Apples require cross-pollination between individuals by insects (typically bees, which freely visit the flowers for both nectar and pollen); all are self-sterile, and (with the exception of a few specially developed cultivars) self-pollination is impossible, making pollinating insects essential. The honeybee and mason bee are the most effective insect pollinators of apples. ''Malus'' species hybridize freely, so identification can sometimes be difficult.

The fruit is a globose pome, varying in size from 1-4 cm diameter in most of the wild species, to 6 cm in M. sylvestris sieversii, 8 cm in M. sylvestris domestica, and even larger in certain cultivated orchard apples; among the largest-fruited cultivars (all of which originate in North America) are 'Wolf River' and 'Stark Jumbo' . The centre of the fruit contains five carpels arranged star-like, each containing one to two (rarely three) seeds.

''Malus trilobata'', a species from southwest Asia, has three- to seven- lobed leaves (superficially resembling a maple leaf) and with several structural differences in the fruit; it is often treated in a genus of its own, as ''Eriolobus trilobatus''.

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Species==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
Many consider crabapples unpalatable, but others enjoy eating them raw or using them for cooking or juicing. Cultivars such as 'Whitney' have been independently domesticated for better fruit quality.

For ''Malus sylvestris domestica'', see Apple. The fruit of the other species is not an important crop in most areas, being extremely sour and (in some species) woody, and is rarely eaten raw for this reason. However, crabapples are an excellent source of pectin, and their juice can be made into a ruby-coloured jelly with a full, spicy flavour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rombauer|first=I.|authorlink=Irma S. Rombauer|coauthors=Becker, M. R., &amp; Becker, E.|title=All About Canning &amp; Preserving (The Joy of Cooking series)|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|origyear=2002|pages=p. 72|id=ISBN 0-7432-1502-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A small percentage of crab apples in cider makes a more interesting flavour.

Crabapples are widely grown as ornamental trees, grown for their beautiful flowers or fruit, with numerous cultivars selected for these qualities and for resistance to disease. 

Some crab apples are used as rootstocks for domestic apples to add beneficial characteristics. For example, Siberian crab rootstock is often used to give additional cold hardiness to the combined plant for orchards in cold northern areas.

They are also used as pollinators in apple orchards. Varieties of crab apple are selected to bloom contemporaneously with the apple variety in an orchard planting, and the crabs are planted every sixth or seventh tree, or limbs of a crab tree are grafted onto some of the apple trees. In emergencies a bucket or drum bouquet of crab apple flowering branches are placed near the beehives as orchard pollenizers. See also [[w:Fruit tree pollination]].

==Maintenance==
Prune in early winter.

==Propagation==
Most cultivars are propagated by grafting or budding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to view completed .fla files on the internet or allow others to view it,
the .fla must be published through Flash to access the file in a format viewable 
by their own computers. Publishing saves the multimedia project, from layers and 
music to channels and text, in a compressed streaming file that even those viewers on dial-up 
don't normally have a problem viewing, unless your project contains large multimedia 
files embedded within its library.

Flash makes it easy for anyone to put their files online after the engine has finished processing the file.  However, there are some steps that need to be taken before the files can be fully viewed online.

'''Checking your publishing settings'''

Though flash can be fairly intuitive most of the time, the author of the flash project still has to go into the publish settings to customize where the SWF as well as the HTML files are going to be saved to. 

This menu is located under &lt;b&gt;File&gt;Publish Settings&lt;/b&gt;.

Most of the time, the SWF and HTML options are the only ones which need to be checked, though the others have their purposes as well.  As each option is checked, a new tab appears in the Publish Settings menu that corresponds to the check.

*Options within the Publish Settings dialogue box
**Flash (.swf)
***Web browsers must have flash player or Shockwave player installed to view any movies
**HTML (.html)
***This file is needed in order for the flash file to be contained somewhere.  If an .swf is directly linked to in a web browser, the movie will automatically resize to the dimensions of the viewer's web browser, possibly causing some distortion or scaling in any graphics used within the movie
**GIF Image (.gif)
***Saves the movie as animated or still GIF images.  The tab for it offers various optimization options.
**JPEG Image (.jpg)
***Will publish the first frame of the movie.
**PNG image (.png)
***This format is not supported by all browsers or computers yet, but it also contains optimization options.  Will publish the first frame of the movie.
**Windows Projector (.exe)
***Creates a standalone movie that is playable on any Windows-based operating system without the use of a flash player or Shockwave plug-in, but is a considerably larger file than a swf.
**Macintosh Projector
***The same as the Windows projector but for Macintosh computers instead.  Will create a considerably larger file than a SWF.
**Quicktime Movie (.mov)
***Creates a Quicktime standalone movie

An option also appears here is the &lt;b&gt;Use Default Names&lt;/b&gt; checkbox.  If this option is enabled, the SWF and HTML files that are about to be created will be automatically named whatever the original .fla file was labelled as.  This may lead to problems if someone creates a new flash file and accidentally overrides their old one.  To avoid this, uncheck the box and feel free to edit the boxes next to SWF and HTML to whatever filename you desire.


Once the settings are in place (typically the HTML and SWF boxes are the only ones that need to be checked), the user can then press the &lt;b&gt;Publish&lt;/b&gt; button in the settings dialogue box to have Flash create the HTML and SWF documents for upload and placement on the internet.

Another viable option is to press the &lt;b&gt;OK&lt;/b&gt; button and then go to &lt;b&gt;File&gt;Publish&lt;/b&gt; to accomplish the same thing.


'''Publishing onto the Internet'''

With both the SWF and HTML files created, the files must be uploaded onto publicly accessible webspace.  Both files must be present for the SWF to display correctly. By default, the SWF will be aligned left in the HTML file.

Hello, I noticed your recreation and contributions to the game guides The Sims and The Sims 2. I believe you would be better off contributing to [[StrategyWiki:The Sims]] and [[StrategyWiki:The Sims 2]]. Both of these guides on Wikibooks, were previously transwikied there and deleted from Wikibooks as part of the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/The Sims]] community decision and will be deleted again shortly, because pages and books which were previously voted to be deleted are [[WB:DP#Speedy_deletions|candidates for speedy deletion]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:54, 3 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hi, post unmaintained scripts here.

Be wary of malicious code, especially the OS module, check in the history every so often for edits to see nobody's doing bad stuff.

Currently there are two scripts here in need of nice mothers or fathers. 

This script is a simple L system that allows you to use pre-defined meshes. It DOES work in 2.43
and could possibly be a building generator (with some work).

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#
# =====================
# README
# =====================
#
# this is a simple L-system that uses pre-made mesh elemental blocks
#
# source blocks are in a different layer - press tilde (`) in 3d view
# to see them all
#
# a new mesh is created every time; edge creases are carried over from
# source meshes to allow subsurf work
#
# this system uses the turtle concept with pushable/poppable state,
# just like most other L-systems
# however, the &quot;drawing&quot; operation here is to place a pre-made mesh
# instead the usual plant-oriented stuff
# as a result, this should be pretty well suitable for Discombobulator
# style work such as generating lots of small detail
#
# turtle instructions and any other tokens are XML-like tags
# instead of single characters; they can also contain an arbitrary
# argument string
# rewriting rules are actually defined as functions to allow
# procedural flexibility
#
# things left to do really depend on what the actual use is
# some ideas include using lists instead of strings for arbitrary
# argument data (may help with speed); supplying environment
# info to the rule function (for queries, like in some advanced
# L-systems out there) as well as the current model info
# for true Discombobulator-style detail generation there has
# to be a mode to populate the axiom (initial state) with
# existing model faces
#
# of course, more code cleanup is in order

# Jamesk's Walk-o-matic version 0.49.9 (MODIFIED)
# for Blender 2.25 and a fully installed Python 2.0 [required]
# CHANGES FOR BLENDER 2.36 GENERALLY MARKED '#MDR:' ...
# Badly coded changes for Blender 2.43 by TwinStripe :) ! Appears to perform more passes but produces the same results!?!

# SET/CHECK THE PARAMETERS BELOW BEFORE EXECUTING THE SCRIPT.
# Make sure to select your proxy object, then run the script with ALT+P.
# Please consult the documentation for a full description of the parameters.
# ...Aaaaand check the console window for any messages.

# LIFT ENVELOPE SETTINGS:
LP = LIFT_PEAK = 0.5        # how far to lift above proxy initially 
FLATLP = FLAT_LIFT_PEAK = 0.2 # how far to lift foot look-at-target above proxy initially
TLATLP = TLAT_LIFT_PEAK = 0.2 # how far to lift toe look-at-target above proxy initially

MP = MID_PEAK = 0.4         # how far from proxy after lift-peak
FLATMP = FLAT_MID_PEAK = 0.4 # how far to lift foot look-at-target
TLATMP = TLAT_MID_PEAK = 0.4 # how far to lift toe look-at-target

#
# Special thanx to
# - [d0pamine] and [theeth] for some hints regarding vector math.
# - Martin [Strubi] Strubel from whom I borrowed the &quot;normalize&quot; function,
#   len3(x), dist3(x,y) and sub3(x,y) funcs found in his &quot;vect.py&quot; utility module.
# - [eeshlo] for pointing out how simple it was to give names to the empties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several different ways to generate new symbols, and the method you choose depends primarily on personal preference.  In essence, you can either build a shape and then turn it into a symbol, or make a symbol and then build the shape inside of it.  Regardless, symbols can always be edited after they are made.

==A. Build the shape first==
*1. Select the shape(s) you wish to convert into a symbol.&lt;br/&gt;
*2.  [choose one]
	a. Right-click and select 'Convert to Symbol'&lt;br/&gt;
	b. Press F8.&lt;br/&gt;
	c. Go to Modify&gt;convert to symbol.&lt;br/&gt;
*3. Name your symbol, and choose the type of symbol you want.&lt;br/&gt;

The symbol will then appear in your library indicated by the name you gave it.  In addition, it now has a name in the Properties panel, and a selection box.&lt;br/&gt;

==B. Create the symbol first==
*1. [choose one]
	a. Click the 'new symbol' button, located on the bottom left of the library panel.&lt;br/&gt;
	b. Go to Insert &gt; new symbol.&lt;br/&gt;
c. Press ctrl/cmd F8.&lt;br/&gt;
*2. Name and choose the type of symbol you want.
*3. You will then be presented with a blank screen to build what your symbol will look like.&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:1Bx.jpg]]

==C. Import an external file, such as an eps or bitmap.==
	1. Create/acquire the image you want, in a program such as Photoshop.&lt;br/&gt;
	2. Go to File &gt; Import &gt; Import to library / to stage.  If you import to library, the file will appear in your library with the name the external file has.  If you import to stage, the file will appear on the stage.  The method you choose is up to you, but I generally import to library and then drop the file into another symbol (see below).&lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A. Instances==

Once you have a symbol, you can then use them in other symbols, or on the main stage.  An occurrence of a symbol outside of the library is called an 'instance'.  Virtually all of the work done in Flash is done with symbol instances.  To create an instance of a symbol, just drag and drop from the library to the stage.  This process can be repeated many times, thus promoting a simpler work load, as well as a smaller file size.

==B. Combining symbols==

While an instance cannot be placed inside its own symbol, it can be placed inside other symbols.  This is a good practice when building complicated structures, such as a web page.  Symbol instances, such as buttons and content can be dropped into a page symbol, and then that super-symbol can be dropped onto the main stage in one step, rather than the several steps it would take with the individual symbols themselves.  In the example, I have combined the cat, tree, cloud, house, and BG symbols into the cat scene symbol, and then dropped the cat scene symbol onto the stage.

==C. Global changes to symbols==

If you want to change all the instances of a symbol, say to make all the green buttons blue, you can edit the original symbol and all instances of that symbol will show the change.  To edit a symbol, just double-click on its name in the library, and a screen will just show that symbol.  In this example, I painted the cloud purple, and you can see that all the clouds are now purple in cat scene.

==D. Changing individual instances==
There are two ways to change individual instances; you can either apply filters to the instance, or make it into a new symbol.
a. Filters

Select the instance you want to change, and go to the filters drop-down in the properties panel.  Select the attribute you want to apply, and then modify it.  These apply to the whole instance, so you may need to go to a lower level (to one of its component symbols) to make the desired changes.

b. New symbol

You can also change any instance to a new symbol.  Use any of the aforementioned methods for symbol generation and make your desired changes.

==E. Naming instances for ActionScript==

If you are going to be using ActionScript in your project, you will need to name the instances you will be targeting.  Simply select the instance, go to the properties panel, and type in a new instance name.  It is advisable to use plain English names that make sense.  In the example, I named the instance 'cat_mc', because it is a cat.  The '_mc' means that the instance is a movie clip symbol.  There are standard extensions for each symbol type, such as _txt and _btn.  While not strictly necessary, it is good form, and helps Flash give you the appropriate code hints.

{{Problem|'''1.''' ''a)'' A salt solution is to be concentrated by evaporating the water in a salt pan, with a condensing surface above it to gather the evaporated water. Suppose 1200g of salt solution are emptied into the pan. Once all the water is evaporated, the salt is weighed and found to weigh 100g. What percent of the original solution was water?

''b)'' Now suppose that 0.1 L of the evaporated water was added back to the salt, to bring it to the desired concentration. How much water remains to be used elsewhere? 

''c)'' Do you think the salt solution would be safe to drink? Why or why not?}}

{{Problem|'''2.''' ''a)'' In a stone quarry, limestone is to be crushed and poured into molds for manufacture of floor tiles. Suppose that a limestone company uses three trucks, each of which is capable of carrying 3000 kg of limestone. The quarry itself is 20 miles away from the processing plant, and the trucks get there at an average speed of 30 miles/hour. Once at the plant, the limestone is ground into fine powder and then melted and poured into the molds. If each of the resulting slabs weighs 2 kg and the plant operates 24 hours a day, how many slabs can the company make in a day?

''b)'' How could this plant become more efficient? Plot the number of slabs the company can make as a function of distance from the quarry and capacity of the trucks. What factors might keep the company from simply moving as close to the quarry as possible and using the largest trucks possible?}}

{{Problem|'''3.''' What is the volumetric flowrate of a solution with density 1.5 kg/m^3 flowing at a velocity of 5 m/s and a mass flow rate of 500 g/min? What is the area of the pipe? If it is circular, what is the radius? }}

{{Problem|'''4.''' Suppose you have a pipe that constricts halfway through from a radius of 0.5 cm to a radius of 0.2 cm. A liquid approaches the constriction at a velocity of 0.5 m/s. What is the velocity of the fluid after the constriction? (Hint: Apply conservation of mass on both sides of the constriction).

'''Challenge:''' What kind of energy does the fluid gain? Energy is never created or destroyed, so where does it come from? }}

{{Problem|'''5.''' Suppose that a river with a molar flow rate of 10000 mol/s meets another, larger river flowing at 500000 m^3/s at room temperature. What is the mass flow rate of the river downstream of the intersection if you assume steady state? 

''b}'' Evaluate the feasibility of the steady state assumption in this situation. Also qualitatively evaluate the probability that the flowrates are actually constant.}}

{{Problem|'''6.''' Suppose that the population of a certain country n years after year 2000 if there is no emigration can be modeled with the equation:

&lt;math&gt; P = 2.5*10^8*e^{0.045*n}&lt;/math&gt;

Also, suppose that in the country, a net emigration of 100,000 people per month actually occurs. What is the total accumulation of people in this country from year 2000 to 2003?

''b)'' What was the population of people in 2002, according to this model?

A number of communication mediums exist in which Wikibookians may communicate with one another. Some of these, such as the [[Wikibooks:IRC_channels|Wikibooks IRC Channel]] at freenode, and the [[Wikibooks:Mailing lists|Textbook-l mailing list]] exist specifically for use by Wikibookians, and all Wikibookians are encouraged to join in discussions at both those venues. 

A number of other communications media exist, such as instant messengers, telephone, and personal email correspondence that Wikibookians may use for correspondence. This is neither encouraged nor discouraged.

The Textbook-l mailing list is archived, but other discussion media usually are not. It is a tricky matter, therefore, to make decisions here on wikibooks based on discussions that happened elsewhere and are not available for reference. The nature of the MediaWiki software is to maintain records of changes and of discussions, and without these records a number of our usual methods for making decisions and holding discussions are difficult to apply. It is for this reason that any discussions which are held off-wiki should be summarized and loaded here onto wikibooks for public viewing. These summaries should likely be approved by all people who participated in the discussions before they are posted.

It is acceptable for the community not to accept a decision that was made in secret, and to deny the existence of agreement or consensus if there is no record of it.</text>

== Featured Books, Revamp ==

: ''See earlier related discussion: [[#BOTM and COTM.2C January]] --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 18:30, 12 December 2006 (UTC)''

I would like to propose some basic changes to the Featured Book process, some of which are sweeping and are worth serious consideration. It is my opinion that the BOTM and COTM projects, while nice originally, have failed on a number of fronts. I won't list my perceived failures of those projects here, but I have listed them previously on staff lounge discussions.

#I would like to completely abandon the BOTM and COTM initiatives. After this month, I don't think we should have any more BOTM or COTM voting, no more winners for either project, etc.
#I would like to see instead, an improvement of the [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] page. Books can become featured books at any time, without a vote, by satisfying a few basic criteria. 
#The featured books could be separated into &quot;Featured Books&quot; and &quot;Featured Collaborations&quot;, as rough analogs to the current BOTM and COTM projects. Featured books should be good books, that statisfy strict criteria (must have a print version, must have consistant formatting and/or an LMOS, must be properly organized, properly categorized, must have inter-page navigation, etc). &quot;Featured collaborations&quot; should be books that satisfy less-stringent criteria (defined organizational structure, proper scope and definition, properly bookshelved and categorized, etc).
#The mainpage could be updated to randomly display (or display in a particular order) books from the featured books and featured collaborations lists. These could be cycled more often then once a month, but less often then once per day (like wikipedia's &quot;article of the day&quot;). 
#Links to &quot;Featured Books&quot;, and &quot;Featured Collaborations&quot; could be installed into the sidebar, so they are more visible then simply being on the main page.

These are my ideas on the topic, and I think the general premise of updating the BOTM and COTM projects with more fluid versions of them is a good idea. What do people think of making these kinds of changes? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:56, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

: I like your ideas but I think the 'Book of the Month' should be continued.  To be honest though I have no idea what the difference is between botm and cotm.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] 21:14, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I personally like both the book of the month and the collaboration of the month, and think that should still be continued.  I dislike the idea that [[wikipedia:featured books]] should move from voting to a set of criteria.  Thus I am opposed to changes 1 and 2.  I do see, however, the need for change.  I think that
:# A set of criteria should define what we call a &quot;good book&quot;
:# A voting process should remain in place for featured book candidates, but should be more like Wikipedia's process. Specifically, a book can come up for vote at any time, and if it is approved, it is in a queue to be featured [this is a change] for a full week. No more month-long feautures.
:# I also dislike the liberal use of the adjective &quot;featured.&quot; I think we should continue collaborations, but continue to call them &quot;collaboration of the month.&quot;
:# I agree that the main page should cycle through the good books.
:# And I tentatively agree with the sidebar idea. I may rescind my support depending on how it turns out.
: Those are my thoughts. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 02:14, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

:: A BotM implies that we are chugging out a good book once every month. Clearly, that is NOT the case here on Wikibooks. Maybe in a year if this place gets more popular. I agree with Whiteknight here. The specifics need to be worked out (maybe a community consensus on what constitutes a good book, maybe a vote will still work). --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:47, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

::: I agree with most of what [[User:Iamunknown]] said, except that I think the collaborations (whatever they are called) should be handled in the same way as the &quot;good books&quot; (a set of criteria, a vote, put in a queue, displayed for a week at a time). We should bring focus to as many new books as possible, to try and drum up support. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: Whats the point in getting rid of BOTM and COTM, if all thats going to happen is Featured Books is split into two like BOTM and COTM? I agree that BOTM and COTM should be discontinued, but not if Featured Books is going be turned into its substitute for them. I think Feature Books, should just be updated with some criteria thats, half way or a mix between what BOTM and COTM were, and as was suggested have a list of books that are cycled through during the time period. Keep it simple and see how it works out, if in the future there is more activity, then discuss making furthor changes. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:49, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: That probably makes the most sense, the COTM thing really acted more like a cleanup task then anything. We could lower the bar a little bit, and make it easier for a book to become &quot;featured&quot;, we could then take books that need to be cleaned up into a category &quot;Books needing collaborative help&quot;. or something like that. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:51, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

:::::: I have to agree with ''Whiteknight'' because it has become obvious books worthy of the BOTM award are not being produced, rather we are forced to adhere to a rule that makes us produce mediocre books to '''satisfy the front page'''. If we were to implement 'featured article' categorisation as our main structure of allowing users to clearly identify '''high quality books''' we would only see a difference if we were to place a '''strict criteria to filter''' those that should improve to pass their next ‘test’ thought this criteria would have to be aggred upon by the '''majority of administrators and editors'''. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 18:17, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

(reset) I also do not agree that we should rescind the vote, because if there is no vote, who would choose when and what books should go up? I do agree that COTM has not worked out, I know I myself often have been unable to contribute to them because I know little to nothing about the topics in the books, so I could do little more than check grammar and spelling. I think this is the case with the general public as well. BOTM, I think it is a good idea to replace with &quot;featured books&quot;, we'll have to carefully and individually decide which books should go on and which books don't go; don't just go by the current list, because it probably will change a lot with the new criteria.
I have a question as well: does this mean we'll get rid of the &quot;completed books&quot; and/or the &quot;hot picks&quot; page as well? If we're going to have a featured books page it should, in my opinion, be at the most three categories, somewhat like the ones that are up now but with more explicit criteria and a more explicit method of listing and unlisting books there. Oh yes, I didn't notice the featured books on the sidebar before but I think it would be useful to have the link there, especially since the list on the main page doesn't (and can't really) list ALL of them.

== Openness of Editability ==

Is everything as editable as it appears? I clicked on the edit box for different wikibooks, and it appeared to give me full control of the article. Is this correct?

: (edit conflict) Any person, on most pages, can edit Wikibooks. On some pages, anonymous users (i.e. users who are not signed in) cannot edit them. This is generally in order to prevent vandalism. An example is the [[main page]]. On other pages (and these are few), no one except administrators can edit them.
: These edits do immediately go live, but there are article histories (to the right of the edit button) with which other users can revert edits. Fortunately, just about every action on Wikibooks is somehow reversible, though it may be tedious. So vandalism can be cleaned up, but it is unfortunately kept in the article history.
: I think that your suggestion is a great idea. Right now the edit page does not really prominently tell people what they are doing by editing a page or by creating a page. Thanks for the suggestion. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 19:55, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

== Cleanup help needed ==

[[:Category:Files with unknown copyright status|Category:Images with unknown copyright status]] has a very large number of images that need to be deleted, but should not be deleted before the links are removed. 

At the bottom of each page, under the heading &quot;Links&quot;, is a list of pages used by a particular image. These images need to be removed from those pages before they are deleted, to avoid a red &quot;Image:blah&quot; appearing on the pages. Once the links are removed, the image can be deleted by an admin (manually or via bot). If we can get at least a few done per day, we can eventually clear the log on this. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

Would it not be possible to get a bot to remove all of the links to the images as well?  (Forgive me if this is a silly question, I am relatively new here and don't really know how bots work.)  Just thinking this would save a lot of manual effort if we could automate this process. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 11:26, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

:The links I ''might'' be able to take care of with my bot.  Actual deletion is another issue as admin rights are required for that and getting an &quot;admin bot&quot; of the ground has proved hard so far.

Deleting all of the links to images, especially from things like talk pages is a bad idea and should (I'm sorry) probably be reversed. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:46, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:All the images being delinked for deletion have no copyright license on them. This is due to a backlog of almost 3 years of neglect of requiring that images have a proper copyright license on them. We even had a warning that such actions would take place very soon on the site notice before the fundraising began again for over a month. Some admins also took the time to inform users that had a lot of images without a license on there talk page about the issue. I believe all approperiate notice that can be expected to be given has been done. This is simply carring out actions previouslly warned about. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:08, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:: You didn't understand my concern. I support the image removal. What I do not support is the removal of the ''links'' to the images, especially when these are on talk pages, as this is essentially rewriting history.

:I understand the concern... it's just some growing pains we need to go through right now. Keeping the images around without copyright info is a bad idea for us, because it opens us (and anyone else who downloads and mocifies our documents) up to legal problems. What we need to keep on top of now is the upload logs, making sure no new images are unlicensed. 
:The delinking is just a common practice we took from commons. The policy there is to remove links to any image before deleting it (including links from ''every'' wikimedia project... the backlog is stunning). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:49, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

: Delinking in many contexts makes sense, but does not at all for talk pages where the subject may have been the image itself or template in which the image is used. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:30, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

::Kinda agree with Kellen in some circumstances.  I &quot;saw&quot; one link go that was almost certainly the user's own photo - yes the photo should go, but the link?  Of course it is not rewriting history as the history is still there - go back and there will be a redlink to the image surely --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:35, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Oh, I agree... no need to remove them from talk pages. I suspect that was being done to allow the bot to do a clean run, but in those cases we should just manually delete the images if they're only linked on talks. I'd say just leave a not for whomever it was that was doing that, and rollback delinking edits that were on talk pages. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:56, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

G'day, please don't take this the wrong way, but - don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Ripping images out left, right and centre does not solve the problem, which is image licensing. It can in fact be hard to differentiate such &quot;cleanup&quot; action from simple vandalism. Better would be to look at the image, and work out how to fix it if possible. Fixing could be contacting the original author and asking them to provide license information. It could also be simply recreating anew, as I just had to do for [[:Image:Seasonality3.gif|Image:Seasonality3.gif]] - simple enough with almost any graphical editing tool. Alternatively, please look for a replacement image before ripping out the unlicensed one. Please help to make Wikibooks a richer, not poorer, project. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 02:23, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

:Further comment: removing links to images without licenses makes the problem worse. It means that when the license problem has been resolved (by licensing, replacement, substitution, or other means), the pages that used to link to the image in question cannot easily be updated to reflect any changes. It should be remembered that the problem is the licensing of the image, not the fact that there are pages linking to it. Please fix the image license, and don't break the pages instead. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 01:57, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

::One more thing - '''please stop'''. There are images now missing, with no links saying that they're even missing, and for no better reason than that they had no licensing information. I don't have the time to pick over ''long'' lists of contribs for users who are removing these images and any links to them, so please desist for now. 

::At least some of these images are either in existence on Wiki Commons or are easy to recreate (e.g. maths formulas). It would be far better for the project if these images were replaced, substituted, or fixed rather than deleted along with any reference to them. For just a couple of examples, please check out these pages (current, and edit history):

:: [[Engineering Acoustics/Piezoelectric Transducers]]
:: [[Swahili]]

::The Engineering Acoustics page has had graphic images of formulas removed. I've recovered a couple as maths formulas, now embedded as templates (see [[Acoustics/formulas]] for templates), but others are missing and ''someone'' will need to recover them. I found this page by reviewing the contribs of someone performing image cleanup, and checking out the page history. Otherwise, I'm buggered if I know how anyone would know that there were even formulas missing from this page! How many others are like this now? Looks to me like some serious &quot;undoing&quot; needs to be done.

::The Swahili page has an image that has been uploaded to Wikibooks without license information. However, the image exists on [[Commons:Image:Swahili area.gif|Wiki Commons]] with license information. I've requested a speedy delete on the local copy. Simple - no need to break the page. How many others are like this now? 

::If you need some help converting any formula graphics that you recover, let me know and I'll be happy to help. In the meantime, ''please stop throwing out images and image links just because they have missing license information''. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 13:40, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

----
Since this is for the benefit of the community all bots that are misbehaving even after this requests that raise some very valid points should be blocked ASAP, to preserve the books. Until a solution is found --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:This is a very difficult issue. On one hand, This is the way commons operates, and to a degree I think that we should try to make our own image management policies to be more like that of commons. I'm of the opinion that we should ban ''all local uploads of images'', and force everybody to to upload all images to commons. There is some precedent for this (although I can't remember which projects have done it). I won't push that issue any further, at this point in time. Deleting an image, while leaving links to an image serve as an encouragement for people to simply upload the images again, possibly with no proper copyright information attached. A book is better off having no images, then to rely on images that might infringe on copyright. I think the best thing to do at this point is to reconfigure any deletion bots to leave messages on the corresponding talk pages whenever they remove an image link. Leaving a message would be much better then leaving a red link on a page. 
:To another point, I dont think that we should be trying to fix all these images. There are literally hundreds of these images (or there were when the process started), and it's absurd to think that any team of volunteers is going to try and find appropriate solutions to every single image copyright problem that we have here. The problem is two-fold: Our administrative predecessors didn't manage the situation appropriately at the beginning of our project, and too many users have uploaded all sorts untagged images. Combine this with the fact that many authors who have uploaded images in the past are no longer active (and some are impossible to contact: I've tried). 
:In short, I dont see any problem with deleting book links. I think we should leave notes when we do delete such links, but I dont want to make that manditory. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::You seem to be missing the point. Some of these images ''are'' in Commons. Deleting the links to the local copies simply because they are tagged as having unknown copyright status means that when the local copies are deleted, there is no easy way to know which pages used to point to them. Leaving the links there allows those pages to pick up the images from Commons when the local copies are deleted. There are now a bunch of [[:Category:Files with unknown copyright status|images]] that have no links to them, and I have no way of knowing whether they have been orphans for some time or whether links to them have been removed as part of &quot;image cleanup&quot;. As Iamunknown pointed out to me only today, there is in fact a template for tagging such images without causing harm to Wikibooks: &amp;#123;{[[Template:NowCommons|NowCommons]]}}.

::Also, some of the images being deleted are simple maths formulas, extended character-set characters, and simple shapes. Whoever is deleting these images is apparently not looking to see what they are, and thus that they can be very simply replaced or substituted without breaking the pages linking to them. Breaking pages is bad and ''should be avoided!'' This is especially true when the images are maths formulas, as the pages become next to useless without this information.

::I don't think I'm suggesting anything radical here, simply that a functioning brain be passed across  images before they are deleted, and that links to images are not removed simply because the images have licensing issues. First and foremost, it should be recognised that the image is often not a problem, merely its lack of licensing information. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 03:27, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I will concede one point, and strongly refute the other. If you are absolutely dead-set against deleting the links, I wont argue that point any further. I dont feel strongly enough in either direction to fight it. However, I dont think at this point that any more consideration should be applied in deleting untagged images. If any of the authors would contact us, ''we have bots that could automatically tag images''. Unfortunately, the number of authors who have taken advantage of this is very small. Images with unknown copyright status pose an immediate legal threat to our project, and I doubt highly that wikibooks would be able to survive an infringement lawsuit. The probability of such an occurance might be small, but whatever the odds, I am not going to gamble with the future of this project. I've invested far too much time and energy to help this project to see it get shut down because of lawsuits and other legal nonsense. Compared to the potential legal problems we could get ourselves into, the inconveniences of book authors and readers who don't have images in their books is a minor issue. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:38, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::::That sounds a little extreme. I can't see anyone suing over [[Image:Arrow.png|this]], nor the image now replaced by [[Acoustics/formulas/Ultrasonic Intensity|this]]. A bot would delete these images without a second's thought (and if the links had been removed, there'd be no way to easily fix the page without possessing the knowledge of the original author). A brain easily sees that there is no copyright issue at all, and that a scientific formula in mathematical notation can be easily represented another (better) way in Wikibooks without reducing the value of the project into which you (and others, including me) have invested much time and sweat. 

::::But I guess I shouldn't really care what happens to pages that other people have created here on Wikibooks, when I have my own pages to tend to. Oh, wait, ''that's the point of wikis''. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 03:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Skins ==

Some people have been having issues with printing out textbooks and certain pieces of information showing up that shouldn't. From a quick look I believe the issue is due to the fact that the stylesheet information to hide that information was in monobook.css rather then in common.css, which meant that only people using the default monobook skin were having these things hiden from print versions. I went ahead and moved those styles to the common.css stylesheet so that no mater what skin is being used it will work, unless someone overrides it in their own skin. I did the same for a few other styles that seemed to be intended for everyone and not just monobook skin users. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:57, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== Addendum to ''Wikibooks language portal'' ==

:''See [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2006/December#Wikibooks language portal|original discussion]]

I researched into how to change the Wikibooks language portal. The [[meta:Www.wikibooks.org template|live portal]] at meta is, of course, locked so that only Meta sysops can edit it. We will need to get consensus at the [[meta:Talk:Www.wikibooks.org template|talk page]], and then can request help at [[meta:Meta:requests for help from a sysop or bureaucrat]]. There is a [[meta:Www.wikibooks.org template/temp|test page ]] we can edit.

I encourage you all to look at the [[meta:Www.wikipedia.org template|live Wikipedia portal]]. I think we will have a much easier time if we follow the established protocol.
*The &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; image &quot;WikipediA&quot; is [[meta:Image:Wikipedia-word.png|uploaded to meta]]. While I don't support converting [[commons:User:LadyofHats|LadyofHats]]' &quot;WikibookS&quot; &lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt;, I think that we should localise the image to meta.
*The image will need to be included as a normal &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. The text format to directly access uploaded images from http://upload.wikimedia.org/ is: 
*:http&amp;#58;//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/&lt;name of wikimedia project&gt;/thumb/&lt;(arbitrary?) technical text from the link directly below the image&gt;/&lt;#1 filename as you would include it in a module&gt;/&lt;width in pixels (height is scaled)&gt;-&lt;#2 filename as you would include it in a module&gt;&lt;if an &lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt;, the extension you want it in, with a preceding '.'&gt;
In the meantime, I will go the [[meta:Embassy|Wikibooks embassies]] and tell them of our interest in updating the main page. Whiteknight or another active user on the [http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/textbook-l textbook-l] mailing list, could you advertise our interest there as well? Thanks. &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 06:31, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
: &lt;s&gt;&lt;small&gt;Actually, strike out that last part. I feel a little uncomfortable advertising this when it hasn't really been planned out. I don't think I ''should'' feel uncomfortable. But I do. &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 07:06, 31 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:: &lt;small&gt;Unstrike. I'll do it. I'll just emphasize that this has not been thought out particularly carefully, and all their input would be very helpful! &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 07:10, 31 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

I don't understand the importance of changing last &quot;s&quot; letter to capital. If you want to change only this, why bother to inform all the languages? I thought we will be discussing something more serious. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:20, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
: I bothered to inform all the languages since there was no other process I could find, even after asking a meta admin and reading a ''ton'' of talk page archives spanning across different wikis, that would be appropriate.

For myself, I'm still not completely sure that moving the portal to Meta from [[Wikibooks portal]] was necessarily a good idea.  While we have substituted one group of admins with another, the exact community procedure for updating the portal still hasn't been defined.  That we have to go through a process like advertising on textbook-l that the portal needs updating, or the much neglected Wikibooks embassy shows that there are problems with this semi-recent change.  Don't make me say &quot;see I told you so&quot; about this issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:37, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
: I agree with you &amp;mdash; kind of. I did all this canvassing precisely because of lack of established process. My major fear is that if canvassing is done too often for ''minutiae'' like this proposed change, people might begin to ignore the advertisements like the village began to ignore the boy who cries &quot;wolf.&quot; (Yes I know that is a terrible simile.) I think it might be good to have it on meta, but at the same time, it was not good to move it there (apparently) whimsically without any forethought, established convention, or means of communication. &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 20:03, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
:: At the time the swtich happened, I was actually voicing some concerns about the change, arguing that the admins here on en.wikibooks were doing a pretty good job of maintaining the page and that there didn't seem to be a compelling rationale to warrent the move to Meta other than &quot;That's how Wikipedia is doing it&quot;.  Certainly there didn't seem to be any huge objections from the other Wikibooks projects, at least what I was aware of.  The page here on en.wikibooks was actively maintained with nearly constant updates including suggestions from some of the other language Wikibooks projects that were rolled into the design.  And by hosting the page here, we at least had a strong stake in keeping it maintained, something that the meta admins don't have BTW.

::All this said, there are some (very minor) advantages to doing it on Meta, as there are slightly more admins on meta than here and there is a stronger international langauge pool on Meta to deal directly with some of the multi-lingual issues that may come up.  The side issue of having a page entirely in HTML instead of Wiki markup language obscured the issue that really had to do with where all this was going to be hosted.  I'll also note that the switch occured in spite of objections like mine, and I don't think the issue had been fully vetted before it occured.  Switching back now, however, is more an admission that the whole thing was a mistake.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:15, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

:Rob's rant aside (whether the page should have been moved to meta or not isn't really up for discussion, even if it does cause a problem here), I dont necessarily think we should be updating the &quot;Wikibooks&quot; to say &quot;WikibookS&quot;. The change is certainly small, but I dont like change for the sake of change. If we are going to go through the trouble of altering the image on the portal, I think we should be aiming for a significant improvement, not just an altered formatting. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:07, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Math and Escher Book ==
Hi -

My name is Bryan Clair.  I’m a professor of math &amp; computer science at Saint Louis University.  My collaborator on this project is Anneke Bart, also a math prof. here at SLU.

We have been teaching an innovative freshman mathematics course “Mathematics and the Art of M.C. Escher” since 2000.  It’s a mature course in the sense that the material and topics have mostly stabilized, enough so that other SLU professors have taken over sections.   The course fulfuills a core qualititative reasoning  requirement for SLU students, and is a popular alternative to college algebra for art, humanities, and social science majors.  Prerequisites are light - a little knowledge of plane geometry, angle measure but not trig, basic algebra (adding fractions, solving linear equations).

The course covers a variety of mathematical topics, mostly related to geometry.  It  includes symmetries and symmetry groups, tessellations, non-euclidean geometry, fractals, topology, and the 4th dimension.  Of course, there’s lots of connections to Escher and his work.

It’s an innovative course in terms of pedagogy - the classes are capped at 19 students and it’s almost entirely based on group work and discovery.  There is little formal lecturing.

Because of the novelty of the material and the pedagogical layout of the course, we’ve begun writing a textbook for the course.  Our text (more of a “reader”, really) is supplemented by an art book of Escher’s work and another general interest book about Escher’s life and tessellations.  Our text is currently about 200 pages, although much of that is workbook-like group projects.  We’ve used it for a few semesters in its current form, but it is badly in need of considerable work.  

We don’t feel that the traditional bound and printed college textbook model is appropriate for this material.  Some reasons:
* The group projects constitute a sort of student workbook, but they are essential to the flow of the course.
* So much related information is available on the web that we would like to allow for copious hyperlinking.
* The text is intended to be supplemented with other resources.  In particular, Escher’s artwork would be referenced heavily but probably not included.
* Different instructors take different paths through the course and we would like to allow for non-linear progress through the text.
* Parts the text (group projects, particularly) should be customizable to better fit class skill level and available time.

A wiki based solution is appealing.  We can easily collaborate.  We get web presentation, with the ability to create a passable printed version.  We get semantic markup.  We get LaTeX.  We get professional looking design.  The students get it free, no paper.  Others may learn something, or even adopt it for their courses.

We’re seriously considering creating a WikiBook, which is why I’m posting this long letter.  We’re hoping to get feedback as to whether this is a good idea, and what problems to expect.  We have some specific concerns, but would value any encouragement, suggestions and/or warnings.

At the moment, I’m working on wiki-fying the book on my own computer, on which I’ve recently installed MediaWiki.  Hopefully, I’ll have enough of it moved over in the next month that I can demo it.

Specific questions:
# Has anyone ever taught a college course using a WikiBook for a required text?  If so, which book and can we chat?
# The main concern we have is stability.  Using a WikiBook for teaching a course seems problematic.  The text needs to be essentially static while being used, at least to some extent.  As the most extreme example, if I assign homework problems, I need assurance that, for example, the numbers won’t change - even for an hour or two.  I never want to hear “well, that’s not how it looked when I read it” as an excuse.  I think my ideal solution would be to have a “release”, much like open source software.  At some point in time (the start of the semester?) a snapshot of the book is taken and the students can access that snapshot.  I tell the students “we’re using Release 1.3 as our official text - read that version”.  Pages that have changed would have a prominent note that there is a more recent version of the changed page, and students could read the more recent (probably better) version.  I believe that the usual Wiki way is to always show the most recent version, allowing users to actively seek out an older version if they desire.  Knowing students, that’s not going to work - the versioning needs to be somewhat coherent so once they make the initial choice to see an older version, they stay in that version across the entire book.
# Many of our images are .eps or .pdf files, which are vector based and so look good at any scale.  It appears that inlined images in a WikiBook are required to be in a raster graphics format such as .gif or .jpg.  It also appears that there is a single namespace for all images?
# Just to double check.. the licensing is set up so that nobody can grab the book, change it a bit and then sell it to a publisher, right?

[[User:Bryanclair|Bryanclair]] 09:02, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

: Firstly, welcome! Your course does sound rather innovative and interesting. I always encourage inter-disciplinary courses. I am into math and science, but have always felt that art, music, philosophy, and the humanities in general are entirely appropriate and exciting areas of study.
: I would seriously encourage you to consider writing this as a WikiBook. There are, however, some points I would like to make.
:# ''The licensing is set up so that anyone can grab the book, change it a bit and then sell it to a publisher.'' This is the nature of the [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]]. They cannot, however, do it legally without attribution.
:# There is a single namespace for all media &amp;mdash; that is, raster ''and'' vector images, music / sound, video, pdfs, OpenOffice documents, whatever. Most music / sound and videos are generally uploaded in .ogg (Vorbis and Theora) / .flac, as they are open source. Vector images are generally uploaded in .svg, which the MediaWiki software can (I think) natively rasterise. I do not know about rasterisation of .pdfs or .epses
:# If you want users to see a specific version, you can add links from the [[WB:MODULE|module]] to specific revisions in the history. Or you could provide on static HTML (on your course website, for example) or in an e-mail a link to the specific revisions. This would become tedious, however, if you were to need many modules from different parts of the book.
:#* You could, however, relatively easily do a &quot;snapshot&quot; version, either off-wiki, or as a .pdf uploaded to the wiki.
: I'm sorry for not addressing all of your concerns and questions. I hope, though, this helps you with your options. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 10:36, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Welcome! Yes, it does sound like a Wikibook is what you need. #4 is probably the most important issue for you, but the GFDL does allow a publisher to do that. I hope that won't be too big a problem. :-/
:: I'm not too sure about vector images in eps or pdf files, but I'm pretty sure that svg files are allowed (another vector file format). Maybe ImageMagick could convert the files to svg format for you? &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Flag of Germany.svg | 50px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is an example of how you can use a svg (or png, or jpeg) image.
:: For your #2 question, you can provide &quot;stable&quot; links that '''never''' change to your students. Make the page, then hit &quot;permanent version&quot; on the left side of the webpage (it is under &quot;toolbox&quot;). That sends you to the page that will never change.
:: And I'm not sure if there are any wikitext -&gt; LaTeX programs. If you know of any, I'd be interested :-p --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 19:43, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

==== Problems and issues to look at ====

I absolutely am thrilled to see somebody like yourself becoming involved with the development of a formal textbook here on Wikibooks.  Having edited here and participating with many Wikibooks projects, I can certainly understand some of your concerns.  Some replies to what you are talking about:

As far as a university course using a Wikibook as a textbook, I am not aware of any.  However, there are several high school textbooks that are being used within the curriculum of South Africa (see [[FHSST Physics]]), and several of the [[Wikijunior]] books have been used on the elementary school level.

The best example of a collge level textbook following the Wikibooks model that I can think of is [http://lightandmatter.com/ Light and Matter], which was written by Ben Crowell and is in use at Fullton College in California, as well as a few other smaller colleges.  It should be noted that this textbook was written several years before Wikibooks was started, where Dr. Crowell had to come with from scratch much of what is now given through the Wikibooks environment.

BTW, [[User:Bcrowell|Dr. Crowell]] is semi-active currently on Wikibooks as well, even though this particular textbook is not hosted by Wikibooks.  He certainly can give you some insight into some of the issues/complications that have arisen with the use of the GFDL in a textbook, and his content information can be found [http://www.lightandmatter.com/area4author.html here].

One thing you do need to be aware of is that all images must be available under terms compatable with the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Document License]] if they are used here.  I do know that much of [[w:M. C. Escher|Ecsher's work]] is still largly under copyright and won't enter the public domain until the year 2042 at the earliest (if further copyright extensions aren't enacted through legislation).  This doesn't apply to all of what he did, but it is something to consider.  The current ''proposed'' [[WB:FUP|Wikibooks Fair Use Policy]] would make using the images found on the Wikipedia article improper to be used here on Wikibooks.  In fact, I'm very much surprised that they havn't been deleted on Wikipedia as a copyright violation.  Keep in mind that educational fair-use does not apply to Wikibooks, even though our intention here is to use these materials for educational purposes.  That area is filled with so many legal land mines that I strongly suggest you don't even go there.

On the other hand, if you are able to somehow persuade the estate of M. C. Escher that they would be willing to donate some of these images under terms of the GFDL or other [[w:copyleft]] licenses, there is certainly a place to have them here on Wikibooks.  I'm just giving strong caution before you get too far on this.  BTW, this would also be an issue for a commercially published book, but image licensing is a bit more straight forward in that situation and would require royalty payments to Mr. Escher's estate.  It may be possible that some of the famous images could also be in the public domain, but I highly doubt you will find many, if at all.

Artwork that follows the themes of M.C. Escher but are produced independently may be also available, so don't consider having the artwork in this Wikibook to be a completely lost cause either.

One other item you ought to consider is support for the book once you have completed the course.  In this situation, it appears as though you intend this to be something that is for an ongoing course, which is a bit different than what has been done in the past.  There are some Wikibooks like [[Instructional Technology]] that have been developed by the students themselves as a part of an organized class project.  What I've seen usually is a very good initial push to add a huge amount of content, but it tends to languish for some time before somebody else &quot;adopts&quot; the content and fixes some of the short comings.  Of course that tends to be typical for almost all Wikibooks as well, but these tend to be topics that are very specific and don't have a more general interest that tends to keep some of the Wikibooks (like the [[Cookbook]]) more fresh with new content on a regular basis.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:03, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

===Some more thoughts===
The problem of licensing Escher's work is actually not that daunting.  The fact is, his
work is all over the internet, although not typically at high quality resolutions.  I do doubt
that his copyright holders would free any of his images, but I think that could be worked around
with creative linking.

I am somewhat dismayed to hear that one can resell GPL licensed stuff, although thinking of
companies like Red Hat, of course it makes sense.  With OSS, the resellers add value through
ease of installation and support services.  With a book, the reseller adds value through materials
and convenience.  In addition, with software, companies like Red Hat have been hugely influential
and helpful to the quality of Linux.
On the other hand, I'm not sure there's such a direct comparison between free software
and free books.  I don't purchase free software, because it's easy enough (for me anyway) to
download and install/maintain it myself.  However, I've purchased free books (
Hatcher's
[[http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html Topology]]
and Raymond's
[[http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ Art of Unix Programming]]
)
because I find it's really much better to own the paper volume than to have to use the net.

Neither Anneke nor I feel like we're doing this to make a buck, so it's not that we're concerned
about getting paid.  But it would bother me if a publisher grabbed the wiki book, typeset it,
and sold it as a text.
* Would this be likely to happen?  Maybe not - the free availability on the net is a deterrent.
* Would this be helpful to the wikibook?  I don't know.  This seems like a place where the difference between software and books is significant.
* Maybe it's not even feasible, if the book is really, truly meant to be a wiki.

Finally, I'm still worried about the lack of stability over a semester for a book that's intended
as a textbook.  Creating a pdf, though useful, defeats the purpose of a linked, hypertext book.
Creating links (from where?) to a fixed version page-at-a-time would be infeasible.  Maybe only
the exercises need to be stable, which would make things a little easier.

Related to this, we've got (lots of) worksheets for in-class use.  I may still print these out
before class and distribute them to students as I've done in the past.  But if not, then these
must be stable, too - at least for the time they're in use.  In addition, depending on how much
time I've got to spare, I'll customize the worksheets from one semester to the next.
I don't see any real mechanism for creating
a custom, personal version of a wiki page, except by changing the public version.
These versioning/forking issues seem to be a striking difference between open source software
and wikibook.  Admittedly, you can't customize a printed book much at all.

Anyway, we're still mulling it over.  Thanks for the good feedback, and I'll still keep an eye
on this discussion.

:One thing you should note about a commercial publisher grabbing GFDL content is that they don't have an ''exclusive'' right to the content, which really is a very different situation compared to more traditional textbook publishing where a contract is signed and exclusive publication rights are granted to a specific publishing house.  In fact, if at that point you don't like the contract you are out of luck and can be sued into submission to even publish the book even if you decide it is an awful situation and not worth the effort.

:As bad as that gets, including trying to go into a legal fight to even obtain royalties due and other similar issues, some real slimeball publishers will grab some public domain text and then slap on a copyright reasserting copyright on something that has been previously in the public domain, claiming exclusive publication rights when there is no reason to believe they have that right legally.  Unfortunately you have to directly challenge that in court and most often these publishers get away with that tactic.

:You should note that with the GFDL, this sort of brazen abuse of the Public Domain is stopped cold.  If you republish content that has been '''''licensed''''' under the GFDL, you must conform to the term of that license, including citing the original authors as well as granting non-exclusive republication rights to anybody who purchases that content.  If they remove the GFDL notices or claim independent copyright, that publisher is in direct violation of copyright laws and can be sued for statutory damages.  In the USA that is up to $750,000 per incident (aka the infamous FBI warnings on the beginning of movies also apply here).  Clearly that is worth your time as an author to go after these creeps too.

:As a practical matter, any commercial republication of GFDL content will only cover the basic cost of the printing itself and a modest overhead to help pay for the effort.  And in a really strange twist of events, as a professor you are certainly within your means to take everything down to Kinko's (or other &quot;on demand&quot; publisher/photo copy business) and have your students purchase the stuff there, as was done ages ago until some of the commercial textbook publishers started to complain and filed a lawsuit against Kinkos.  Here at Wikibooks we do perform copyright vetting of the content and have established procedures to remove content that is in violation of copyright, whatever that reason might be.  This is perfectly legal, although your local Kinko's may be a bit perplexed at the suggestion and may have a manager that doesn't understand free content like this.  Or you can put a book on &quot;reserve&quot; and allow students to copy it at the college library.  This is not only legal but encouraged.  I promise that any commercial publishing will be considerably cheaper than going to the copy center.

:As far as maintaining a static version that is stable for the duration of a semister or other similar situation, we have some tools available to help with that.  In addition to &quot;fixing&quot; the content on PDF files and other such work-arounds, we can also block editing on a page for the purpose of making a stable version.  This has been talked about in the past, and is something that has been seriously considered for our sister project, Wikipedia, that would gave a more stable version for public consumption and an unstable version that is being edited and proofread that would then be moved to the &quot;stable&quot; version after it has been accepted, however that process is decided.  For example, this move from the &quot;unstable&quot; to &quot;stable&quot; version of the page can happen once a semister.  There are other tools available, and it is just a matter of what you want to have done here.  Having a stable version is very much in keeping with general Wikibooks philosophies.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:45, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

::Rob - That's a very encouraging response.  The licensing stuff didn't worry me overmuch, but it's nice to hear your confidence.  The possibility of a stable version that updates periodically is, I think, pretty essential to using a text for an active course.

::I've given this project plenty of thought over the last couple of weeks (and really for over a year).  Right now, I've got a full MediaWiki server running on my own machine.  I'm going to teach the course this semester, and slowly move the book to that private server as we go.  This way I avoid artist rights issues, unstable course material, and licensing issues for the time being.  During the spring or start of summer, we'll come back and invite Rob, whiteknight, and other kind souls who've offered assistance to take a look at what we've got.  That will give us some time to resolve these issues without the pressure of student use, and I think that seeing what this &quot;book&quot; looks like will help you guys as well.  Since it's already going to be set up for MediaWiki, it shouldn't be too hard to bring it over at that point.

I'll strongly object for a change of that nature, consensus is a very good policy, especially in a situation like we have here at Wikibooks (or other Wikimedia projects), some people with more time and more diplomatic skill could create a power base and control the community evolution, this has already occurred in the past, even to me, so I can't agree with that solution.

It's not fair to throw a wrench in and then take however long you want to respond. The bureaucrat that takes action must make a decision if consensus is achieved. Perhaps it is labeled a bit misleadingly, but the one oppose vote here had been countered and then discontinued, so I personally see that as consensus.

I closed a VfD as delete recently where there was not an overwhelming majority of votes for delete.  However - in my view - that was the correct decision BUT I will happily listen to anyone with other views - that is working towards consensus which is vital for a community.

::&quot;''A decision is reached when the Meeting as a whole feels that the &quot;way forward&quot; has been discerned (also called &quot;coming to unity&quot;) or there is a concensus. Occasionally, some members of the Meeting will &quot;stand aside&quot; on an issue, meaning that these members do not share in the general sense of the meeting but are willing to allow the group to move forward.''&quot;
:Sometimes meetings even &quot;split&quot; because 2 groups of opinions cannot be reconciled... just as there are other meetings, there are other wikis. If a minority view is unwilling to go in the direction the community wishes to go in, the community goes forward anyway (easier for quakers of course, we don't have a &quot;mystical understanding to guide us). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:03, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

::: Consensus isn't the same thing as unanimity, since unanimity doesn't support neutral votes (as per your example), consensus also conveys a sense of discussion, and don't particularly calls for a vote, debate, unanimity deals only with votes and the final result. 

::: When one says a decision was reached by consensus, one should understand it that after a debate  a point won with no one objecting.

::: Example, in the discussions about proposals to give administrators rights, the proposal should only need objecting votes, as &quot;I propose this and that, does any one object&quot; if a person objects then a discussion is proper (but may not reach consensus), a voting may only be useful to demonstrate to the debating parties how the rest of the community feels about the topic.

:::Of interest: Honeybees use a consensus process when choosing a new nest. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/61dk48etfcm9yugu/]

:::I would agree that consensus hasn't really been reached until all objections have been addressed -- to the satisfaction of the people who raised them -- or objectors have acquiesced to the consensus. But a key part of the consensus process is that people who see that their preference has no support do eventually acquiesce. I don't think we can have a bona fide consensus process here at Wikibooks because we have just too many people with a &quot;my way or the highway&quot; mindset. The rules we have come really close to it, though, and the practical result is the same as long as the discussion is allowed to continue long enough. Brian Brondel 23:36, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: Yup, the main problem here using consensus as a method is the lack of general interest most discussions get here, this can easily lead to a stale mate (with in itself is not really a problem, this will only lead to less innovation and a default resistance to changes), if we had more people expressing their views it would be easier to get  all parties to agree as it is, specific interest groups are generated that try to push they own agendas and most prefer doing that without other having a change to make objections. I would like the interpretation of consensus to be stated on the decision policy, and I take this change of referring to my proposal to reduce the scope of those involved on discussions, like the proper definition of book communities etc... (see the talk page). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:In concensus decision-making, not only the quantity of votes but also the ''quality'' of votes must be considered. 7 to 1 is a very strong majority, but a majority alone doesnt make concensus. Current policy lays out certain requirements to become a sysop (and admittedly those requirements are vague). Votes that say &quot;This user meets the requirements in the policy&quot; are more powerful votes then people who say &quot;This user is awesome, i like him&quot;. Likewise, a vote that says &quot;This user doesnt meet certain requirements and is unlikely to be a good admin&quot; is more powerful then a vote that says &quot;I don't like this user for some arbitrary reason&quot;, or even &quot;I dont think we should have (more) admins&quot;, or whatever. your objection aside, Panic, Az had 7 votes in favor (which is more then many admins have when they are elected), he does meet the requirements in the policy, and I dont think there have been any good reasons set forth why he shouldnt have been promoted.

==== Sysop Status ====

This whole issue regarding a &quot;sysop&quot; is something that was perpetuated by the MediaWiki developers.  The idea that administrator == sysop is something that has historical roots, and is a cause of a huge amount of confusion, particuarly if you start to dig into the MediaWiki documentation.  

Typically somebody with &quot;sysop&quot; privileges would be somebody who has root access to the computer equipment... or more likely a &quot;system operator&quot; who is physically present in front of the computer itself and has the ultimate authority on the computer... mainly the ability to yank out the power cord and reboot the computer.  On older mainframe systems this was generally considered a person of privilege as well, as a sysop in this context had the ability to control content on the system by deleting content and changing user privileges.  Keep in mind that once upon a time there was only three levels of users for Wikimedia projects:  anon user, &quot;regular&quot; registered users, and sysops.  And for a time many of the &quot;sysops&quot; were also hard core software developers who indeed had at least software level access to the Wikimedia computers who are now termed &quot;developers&quot; instead in the grand heirarchy.

Unfortunately the current &quot;keyword&quot; that establishes user categories on Wikimedia projects and granting access to &quot;administrator&quot; tools is currently called &quot;sysop&quot;.  Yes, this can cause confusion to no end and is something that unfortunately is very poorly documented.  No, when you become what we call an &quot;admin&quot; you don't get sysop privileges (or root acess) to the Wikimedia server farm, but you certainly have the ability to make some significant changes that other more ordinary users don't have access to.

Really, a much better term (had it been established back elsewhen) would have been the term &quot;moderator&quot; instead of &quot;administrator&quot; or &quot;sysop&quot;.  On Wikiversity the term has been changed to &quot;Custodian&quot;, which in some ways really fits better than the term &quot;administrator&quot;.  That is BTW one of my contributions to Wikiversity that I'm actually proud of.  There is historical inertia to changing the name here on Wikibooks, and really gets things confused when talking to people on other projects (especially Wikipedia) if you started to change the terminology here on Wikibooks.  

While the term &quot;sysop&quot; is very quick shorthand for those who are long-time users on Wikimedia projects (I understand the context, for example), we need to be mindful that not everybody here understand what is going on.  This is something I was very confused with myself... even when I was made an administrator back elsewhen.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:46, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

== Regarding the selective archival schema at the Staff lounge ==

As I was comparing comparing the staff lounge archives to the staff lounge history page &amp;ndash; merely out of curiosity &amp;ndash; I noticed that the current practice ends up with a lot of posts being de-contextualised. They end up out of order specifically because some discussions go longer than others, and those short-lived ones get archived before the long-lived ones do. I really don't think that this is appropriate. Some comments are posted here specifically because of a previous post, and for an interested user, shuffling the texts around is '''not''' helpful. I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AStaff_lounge%2FArchive_27&amp;diff=705615&amp;oldid=695111 copied the page headings] to the [[/Archive 27|current archive]] and pasted three conversations in there for starters. I hope this continues. &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 07:39, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:Something needs to be done.  I no longer read or watch the Staff lounge because it's a mess and impossible to follow.  My suggestion would be to have a central Staff section which links off to other pages like 'Administrators Talk', 'Policy Talk', 'General Talk' and provides links to every important section so that users can report vandalism in the correct place rather than on this page.  Any ideas?  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:01, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:: This might be a good idea. Discussion does abound on this page and it could make it easier to follow and find topics if it were split up. I'm not sure what the proper split should be, though. It seems that the topics are many and overlapping, but I think we should avoid breaking it up too much in order to keep it simple.
:: I recently [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Study_help_desk&amp;diff=703228&amp;oldid=703047 redefined] the scope of the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]] and think we could even solve some of our problems by directing general inquiries about WB practices there, leaving the SL for in-house discussions (i.e. policy + general) &amp;mdash; for admin talk, there is already the [[Wikibooks:Administrators'_noticeboard]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 22:15, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

: How about archiving discussions in order of their start-date? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 22:15, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
:: herr , Wouldn't this force the archiving of still running discussions ? I agree with [[User:Swift]] that a fragmentation of this page based on topics (on the scope of the discussion) will have to occur sooner or later... It will also provide a history for already debated topics (not based only on dates)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:05, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::: No. What I meant was that discussions could be placed in the archives depending on their start-date, not based on when they are archived. The archiver would thus not append the archived topic to the current archive, but place according to a time order &amp;mdash; following topics with earlier original posts in that archive, and preceding later ones. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 01:04, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: In that case I'm not against nor in favor, but this seems a task that over a time only bots would have the time to perform, the acceptance of such policy should depend on the bot source to be publicly available, this also seem to imply that no archiving may be done by humans (prone to errors and with a high level of difficulty to cross check) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:11, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: That's what I had in mind, Swift. I copied all the headings from the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AStaff_lounge%2FArchive_27&amp;diff=705615&amp;oldid=695111 this version] of the lounge to the [[/Archive 27|current archive]] and pasted three convos in there. Of course, right now there are ''way'' too many headings in there, and they will have to be moved to a new archive when the time comes, but I hope it is a start.
:::: Panic: It would be very nice to have a bot to archive the conversations. But a bot could not know when a conversation is finished. Even if it scraped the page history to see when the last time a conversation was added to, some conversations die down a little and then flare up. But if it were an semi-automatic bot operated by a user, that would be nice. :)
:::: What would be the most convenient, though, would be if each conversation were created as a sub-page and then added to everyone's watchlist that elected to do so. That would, however, require a new feature. I imagine if all of the English Wikibooks went to Bugzilla and voted for the bug, then the developers would do it. But that would be a ways off. &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 17:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

Here's a thought, what if we simply just stop archiving? Just delete old discussions from the page as they are finished. Provide a link to the FAQs to the top of this page and update that list as questions become more frequent and suggest people read the FAQs first before asking any questions. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::: The best way I can see to go about it is to split this page in several subtopics (reusing existing and related pages if and when possible), people that think very strongly or are having troubles dealing with the length this page can reach can and should probably do a mockup for a proposal, as examples, we can use this location for a simple menu where other pages are selected or we can even use a top menu to subpages and transclude all pages to here so people may use both solutions and provide equal visibility to all subpages, just some ideas... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:50, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== SVG → PNG bug? ==

G'day, I just created a few simple SVG files using code on [[XML: Managing Data Exchange/SVG|this page]], to replace the PNG versions of the examples. All OK, except for the text example - [[:Image:XML example text.svg]] - which doesn't render. The [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/d/d1/XML_example_text.svg image itself] will download and display just fine on Firefox 2.0 but nothing shows on pages with this image embedded in them. I'm picking that this is a bug in the SVG → PNG rendering software - can anyone confirm? Is it being addressed, or do I need to simply work around it? cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 02:54, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

: While I cannot point you to any bug listing at Bugzilla or a specific page at Commons, I do distinctly remember reading that fonts are not really supported by the MediaWiki SVG renderer. Many SVG artists on Commons do not use fonts at all, but instead convert them to paths. As evidence (of lack of support in general), please [[Commons:Commons:Transition_to_SVG|look at this page]] where it says that &quot;The servers cannot render all types of SVG features, so the generated PNGs are sometimes not as the author intended.&quot; &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 17:37, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks for chasing that up, I hadn't seen that page.

== &quot;Final Word&quot; clause (proposal) ==

(discussion copied from [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]])

There was one previously, but it appears to have been removed. I want to reinstitute the &quot;final word&quot; clause into this document. Wikibooks policy and guidelines are fragmented, as in it is distributed among multiple documents. It is very possible for one policy to disagree with another policy. Considering the amount of change that has happened in terms of policy recently, and considering the massive age disparities between some of our newest and some of our oldest policy documents, I think it's important that we have something that is the &quot;final word&quot;, that is something that trumps any other document in the event of a contradiction. I propose therefore the addition of the following text (barring revision) to the &quot;Enforcement&quot; section of this policy:
:''Any clause in a policy or guideline on the English Wikibooks that contradicts this policy is null and void.''
I think this is an important addition. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:31, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

----

Best to change it to ''Any policy or guideline on the English Wikibooks, approved before this one, that contradicts it will be null and void on the conflicting point(s) and should be marked for revision.'', since we rarely (I can't remember once) did vote a police clause/point by point. This should probably be added not only to this policy but to any policy we adopt/change in the future, this should cover all bases. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:39, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:I dont think we need to specify only policies that are approved beforehand. We could very easily approve a new policy that contradicts this one, and we still need some kind of final authority when a contradiction occurs. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:59, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:: So... The changes I propose to the phrase clearly state that only the points in conflict will be void (as in the ones that should be fallowed are on the present policy), that's basically the same as in you proposal, the change also states priority, the last approved changes/policy will have an higher priority. (the last text discussed and approved might if conflicts arise be taken as the final word of the community, it goes even further proposing for a new discussion on that specific problematic point, I can't see how more complete it can be made.) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:11, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

----

Just to be clear, I propose extending the idea of [[User:Whiteknight]] so that all new policies get the information added from now on. This will resolve any future interpretation problems on the specific case of conflicting rules in general. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:13, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

As an addendum to the proposal, I ask that next to that phrase, the close date of the discussion that validated the text should be included (policy texts are often changed due to the [[Wikibooks:Be_bold]] rule without changing the policy in itself but making the text history confusing).

''Policy discussion closed by &lt;signature&gt;'', if the policy was closed before as ''Revised Policy discussion closed by &lt;signature&gt;'', this is important also for historical reasons.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:28, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

----

Any objections or counter proposal ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:00, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

: While your point makes some sense, from what I've seen I disagree your phrasing is clear about what is invalidated, there is also the matter of interpretation that could be the source of disagreements if we allow some parts to be valid while other parts to no longer be so. I believe it would be better to make an entire policy invalid rather then leaving room for personal interpretation of whats policy still and whats not. I don't have any issue that I can think of with the idea of including from now on the date of when a proposal became a policy or guideline and who turned it into one, if that is what your suggesting. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:41, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

::A few points. First off, a discussion is never truely &quot;closed&quot; in the sense that a decision made is final. All discussions can be continued ad infinitem, or they can be picked up again at any time by any user. My point with the final word clause in the policy is that different documents change at different rates. WB:WIW, for instance, is a policy that has historically been very slow to change (perhaps because of it's importance). That's part of the reason why the current discussion on it appears to be going nowhere (or going somewhere painfully slowly). Consider (just as an example), that the deletion policy is expanded to allow for the deletion of videogame guides. In this case, the WB:WIW policy wouldn't be in agreement with the deletion policy, and we would be in a worse situation. To solve this problem, we make certain documents more important then other documents. As an analog (and forgive me that it's a strictly american analog), the US constitution is the final word in US law, but there are plenty of other law documents that are produced to deal with the fine points. If we set up WB:WIW to be our &quot;constitution&quot;, then it will be the final word, and all other policy documents will be ancillary to it. That's my rationale for this clause. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:03, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Yup [[User:Darklama]] as it is, it falls to the disagreeing party (the one that thinks there is a conflict) to initiate discussion of the conflict on the oldest page (as it is anyone can ask for any policy to be re-analyzed) so in that regard we are safe. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
----
I have added the proposed and still not objected wording, with a small modification (changed the objected &quot;discussion close&quot; to &quot;stage finished&quot;) to cover [[User:Whiteknight]] point  to the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy/Unstable]] if there is still any divergence lets continue this discussion there.

== Urantia United ==

Shouldn’t your main page be changed? It states: “Welcome to Wikibooks, a collection of free content textbooks that you can edit”. Free content encompasses all works in the public domain (Wikipedia). I edited every page of the Urantia Book (now in the public domain) with the approval of The International Urantia Assn., and called it [[Urantia United]] so it would appeal to all religions. It is not my own original work, but the Urantia Book was credited.(authors unknown) Why is it up for deletion? I read your contradictory requirements and intended to comply. It is a work in progress. [[User:Kkawohl|Kkawohl]] 00:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)kkawohl

: Wikibooks is a collection of free-content textbooks. One argument, as I see by reading the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#Transcendentalist Theology|section]] at [[WB:VFD]], is that this text reads not as a textbook would and should, but as a personal essay. While this reason alone does not discredit the text in any way, it is a reason to not include it on Wikibooks. As you said, Wikibooks is for textbooks.
: Also, concerns have been raised that, if you are the founder of Transcendentalism Today, Org., that you may have a conflict of interest in writing this Wikibook. Furthermore, this material appears to have been deleted twice before. While consensus can change, any person reposting deleted content should probably counsel with an experienced user before they recreate to ensure that it is distinctly different and appropriate.
: Also, while it is appropriate to post texts when one has person from their copyright owner, you must have proof. And if this text is a source text (which I infer from your comment that it is) then it should go on Wikisource.
: All that being said, you may be right in identifying our policies as contradictory. That we are trying to work on right now. And I hope that you understand that whatever happens to the text, you are still welcome around here. :) Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 01:10, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

:One of the major issues with this content that you are adding is that it is, unfortunately, unverifiable.  I know that is a fuzzy standard to apply, but one of the key premises that we have to content here on Wikibooks is that it must be verifiable in some fashion.  We do have a standard here that relates to what we call &quot;Original Research&quot;.  Our current guidelines are found here:  [[Wikibooks:Original research]]  It should also be noted that this is based off of the Wikipedia policy with a similar general philosophy:  [[w:Wikipedia:No original research]]

:This policy is currently being debated, with some thoughts about how much we should allow on this project in terms of allowing some original thoughts within a Wikibook.  Philosophical books such as yours are particularly vague in reference to this policy, especially very new philosophies like yours that don't have anything even resembling a wide body of literature about the topic.

:I should also note here that Wikibooks is not a vanity publisher.  While you are certainly free to edit and add content here, there are some basic standards that we are trying to achieve.  Keep in mind that the primary emphasis of Wikibooks, particularly over this past year, is to work in creating standards-based textbooks.  In particular we would like to cover things that would involve secondary education and collegete level textbooks, but other instructional materials are strongly encouraged.  It is particularly important if you want to see content remain here on Wikibooks that you provide a rationale related to these sort of textbooks as to why your content should be compared favorably to that sort of content.

== User Arbitration ==

Due to some issues between a few users and some apparent edit wars going on, I've decided to take on the whole situation as an arbitration &quot;case&quot;.

In many ways, this is very unfortunate, but it is starting to spill over into the rest of Wikibooks and has raised the stress level for just about everybody who is involved with developing Wikibooks in general.  I had hoped that this could be resolved in a less formal atmosphere, but that apparently is no longer a reasonable option.  Instead, it is now taking place on this page:

[[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny]]

This is a preceedent setting situation here on Wikibooks, and I hope that once this particular situation is resolved that we can more calmly come up with a formal process similar to what I've outlined to deal with these situations in the future.  This is being added here to the Staff Lounge mainly as a notice that this arbitration is happening, particularly because we have never done something like this before.

The alternative really is that Jimbo comes in here and makes a mess out of everything, banning several users from this project and creating a considerable degree of ill will.  I hope this can be something that will eventually help out Wikibooks in the long run, and air out some long standing issues that do in fact need to be resolved with Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:54, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

::::#'''&quot;Removal of nonpublic personal information''' such as phone numbers, home addresses, workplaces or identities of pseudonymous or anonymous individuals who have not made their identity public, or of public individuals who have not made that personal information public.
::::#'''&quot;Removal of potentially libellous information''' either: a) on the advice of Wikimedia Foundation counsel or b) when the subject has specifically asked for the information to be expunged from the history, the case is clear, and there is no editorial reason to keep the revision.

:::I also would like to point out the pros and cons of having multiple users with oversight permission. At first I thought we would not need three.

''I still think I would consider using oversight when a user writes personal information about him/herself here.'' For one thing, that is explicitly against wikimedia policy. &quot;'Removal of nonpublic personal information' such as phone numbers, home addresses, workplaces or identities of pseudonymous or anonymous individuals 1) who have not made their identity public, or 2) of public individuals who have not made that personal information public.&quot; People, whether working under pseudonyms or working in public, who post their own personal information online are making their identity public.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, personally identifiable information ''is'' necessary to establish ownership of copyright. While you may work under a pseudonym, you must, at some point, establish your true identity so that you can claim ownership of your works. And you have to be able to contacted so that said supplied information is verifiable. I am now getting wary about letting giving oversight permission to anyone &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 01:17, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

: As I view on the problem.
: 1) is there a guideline that details what personal informations a user may or may not use in references to another?
: (if not one should be created)
: 2) has anyone requested that personal information to be removed permanently from pages ?
: 3) author pages and userpages should be protected from removal of personal information (unless requested by the subject or after ownership of the data is verified).
: 4) before giving the rights a guideline should be created and adopted here on how users with &quot;oversight&quot; rights should exert their function.

: I don't see a need for the granting of &quot;oversight&quot; rights to more than a user, this user should have a good record of being active on Wikibooks and should have CheckUser rights (should accumulate both rights), if a problem arises that such function is needed then we should see if there is a need for having more people with the &quot;oversight&quot; right and a more evolved definition for the problem, this will be a preventive action that would solve an immediate problem if it arises. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:44, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

:Let me make a few points about this. First off, ''there are people with oversight'', just none on this project. For instance, any of the stewards could be asked to come in here and use oversight on our project, after a private request. This means, essentially, that whether we vote to allow users with the permission here, there are people who can do it anyway. With that in mind, it's not an issue as to whether we want people to use oversight, but whether or not we want the people who do use it to be members of our project (and not outsiders). 
:If we want to have the permissions at all, it would be wise to have more then one. Given the nature of oversight, when it is time to use it (hopefully a rare occasion), it should probably be used immediately. If sensitive information is on our server, it should be removed quickly to prevent too many people reading it. I propose therefore that people who get oversight should be active at different times of day (likely live in different time zones), and that they should be very active. The current active bureaucrats might be a good pool to choose from initially, but I personally won't accept any new permissions without the community voting on them individually (ie, they would have to vote to give me specifically the permissions, not just &quot;active bureaucrats&quot;). 
:Finally, bureaucrats can rename users, an ability that isn't used frequently, but that has been used in the past. Occasionally, a person may use their real name as their screenname (&quot;user:John smith&quot;), not realizing that this name is going to be used all over the internet, and everybody is going to know that person's real name. In these cases, users typically ask to be renamed to something more cryptic, but some references to that person's real name will still exist in the database. Without oversight, there is nothing we can do to remove it.
:As to the issue with publishing and copyright, i think it's a moot point: we currently dont publish, and we dont defend copyright. Even if we did, we can't force people to have their real names and contact information available for public reading. Some people would rather not list their real names then try to defend their copyrights here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:49, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:: ''As to the issue with publishing and copyright, i think it's a moot point'' I think that's a moot point. You missed my stated objective: to point out a case where publishing personally identifiable information is necessary.
:: I think your point that we (the project) should be able to react quickly to cases where oversight is a good point. Given your logic, we should have multiple users with oversight permission. As long as users with oversight agree to abide by Wikimedia policy and not hide conciously added personally identifiable information or vandalism, I will support this. Though I guess I'll never know if they hide these things or if they break policy. Maybe we should create a soft redirect from &amp;#91;[Wikipdia:Oversight]] to [[meta:Hiding revisions]] &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 05:20, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

==== Pressing need for this ability ====

I am again disappointed by some individuals who come up with a policy governing all Wikipedia projects, particularly when it is poorly written, such as these oversight policies seem to be.  And they seem to come from some individuals very paranoid about privacy issues, thinking you can legislate privacy.

A key part of this &quot;oversight&quot; privilege is really quite simple.  It allows the user to permanently delete content.  Nothing more, and nothing less.  It is recommended that the purpose of doing this is for protecting privacy and culling permanently copyright violations, and that this ability should be given to the most trusted members of the community, making sure that it is not inappropriately used for something like an edit war.

As far as the policy to &quot;Remove copyright violations on the advice of Wikimedia Foundation counsel&quot;, I think that is patently absurd.  Projects like Wikibooks already have copyright violation policies, and a notice that content will be deleted if you can't document that you in fact have copyright permission for using that content.  At the moment, I can only find one instance that [[w:WP:OFFICE]] has been invoked here on Wikibooks, and even that I find somewhat dubious.  As admins we certainly don't have regular access to Brad Patrick or any other legal counsel, unless there is a barrister or attorney lurking here somewhere?  Certainly nobody that would be willing to stick their neck out legally even for the most eggregious and blatant copyright violations.  Nor should we be expected to either.

At the same time, I think it is very reasonable for somebody to be able to permanently delete these copyright violations that we do find from time to time on Wikibooks.  As has been frequently mentioned in the past on mailing lists and other fora about this topic, the current admin &quot;delete&quot; action really doesn't remove the content.  This oversight ability would allow for these sort of very permanent deletions that would completely get rid of the illegal content.

On a more general note, and perhaps something instead to throw up on Bugzilla:  I, as an administrator, would really appreciate a simplier method to selectively delete some edits from a page.  Particularly to cull out blatant vandalism (they need no credit on page histories, for instance), but again also to remove copyright violations that are only on a portion of the page and not the whole thing.  In theory this is possible with current admin privileges, but it is a pain to do so right now.  It appears as though the oversight privilege also gives an easier time to selectively delete specific edits.

As far as culling private information such as a government ID number (aka SSN), birthdate, or other information from the edit history (when requested by the user who is so identified or because of inadvertant disclosure), that is a totally seperate policy issue.  I think there are valid reasons to want to have some information like this removed, but it would generally be a rare circumstance.  There are also some very valid reasons why some personally identifying information can be voluntarily published, particularly for copyright enforcement, so a blanket prohibition of publishing personally identifiable information is not necessarily needed or should even be wanted.

While the privacy issue may be something that is time-critical, it isn't so much for copyright violations.  Various common carrier laws (applying to ISPs like the Wikimedia Foundation in this case) allow for a &quot;reasonable length of time&quot; to be used before the content is removed.  The current Wikibooks policies in [[WB:DP]] is more than sufficient to cover these cases.   --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:04, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

:''I, as an administrator, would really appreciate a simplier method to selectively delete some edits from a page.'' &amp;larr; Well said. Recently, a user was asking for imports of wp articles related to the Holocaust... some of them had hundreds of vandal edits (to the point where the import tool couldn't work!), which don't belong in the history of those articles. Even just a  &quot;select all&quot; button for page restoration would be a step in the right direction, so we could just unselect the vandal edits rather than having to select every version we want restored (for example, if someone vandalizes the Staff Lounge, there's no reasonable way to remove that edit as it stands now). Something like this would be an excellent addition to the B'crats' toolboxes. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:53, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

== Wikibooks for DUMMIES?==

I find all of the instructions here extremely complicated and confusing.  I have been unable to accomplish what should probably be two easy tasks, and I am quite frustrated because of the amount of time I have spent trying to figure them out.  In both cases, I have read all the instructions and tried and retried the procedures several times and in several ways.

I cannot figure out how to put my new book [[American Literature]] on a book shelf.  The instuctions basically tell you just to do it.  I have gone to the bookshelves page and clicked on every possible link but cannot find a way to add a book title to the list.

I have also tried and tried to put a picture from the Commons on a page, and it just won't work.  I would love to have a picture of Robert Frost on the [[American Literature/20th Century/Robert Frost]] page and a picture of Langston Hughes on the [[American Literature/20th Century/Langston Hughes]] page.  I have folowed the instructions and even cut and pasted the command from other Wikibooks and Wikipedia pages, but nothing worked.  Instead of a picture I get a box with the file name in it and a request for the license information.

So could somebody tell me in simple and clear English how to do these things or do them for me?  [[User:Logophile|Logophile]] 08:41, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

Just noticed the elephant sitting in the corner of the room!!

Firstly Panic drew this one to my attention [[Ghost_Online/Monster]] as copyvio etc etc (I agree).  Then [[Gears_of_War_Guide/Table_of_Contents]] this one from Panic, Az1568 (&amp;I'd already watchlisted it).  However I notice that Final Fantasy 1, VII, X and XI have all been &quot;transwiki'd according to policy&quot; (tho not all tagged the same).  BUT IV, VI and VII (at the very least) are all still being worked on (and redlinks exist for others).  Frankly &quot;daft&quot; is the politest I get here.

I am not a &quot;policy&quot; person but this does needs sorting for users, admins and people interested in contributing.  I shall get grumpy if it isn't - you have been warned --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

: Yes, I have come across those quite a lot. I think we should have one single template for all the Wikibooks that have been moved out of here so that the template can be standardised and so that we can have one category [[:Category:External links|instead]] [[:Category:External Redirects|of]] [[:Category:Transwikied pages|four]] [[:Category:Links to where games walkthroughs have moved to|ones]]. &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt;
: And frankly, I dislike the &quot;according to policy&quot; clause because the policies (as we have been seeing lately) are open for interpretation. And I also think that we should create a link (in the template I hope is created) from the word &quot;transwiki.&quot; It's not exactly a common word, and it would be appropriate to define.
: Furthermore, if you're asking that we should either delete all games guides now or let them all remain here, I am somewhat opposed to that. (That is how I interpret your post. Please correct me if I am wrong.) It appears that many of the guides move by the will of their contributors. I generally dislike brutally pushing the texts through process.
: Those are some of my thoughts. [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 13:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

: Regarding the gaming guides, there still is no &quot;official&quot; policy on Wikibooks that governs this sort of content, including [[WB:WIW]].  I tried to push the development of the proposed policy [[Wikibooks:Game textbook guidelines]], but that policy has been strongly suggested that is simply be deleted due to the fact that &quot;game guides&quot; are no longer on Wikibooks.  I did point out that there certainly were legitimate Wikibooks that could be perhaps added to this project covering games ([[Chess]] is a noted example), but it would have to cover much more than simply a walk-through of the game and a macropedia of topics in the game.  It really is something more about the quality of the content rather than a specific ban of the content.  

: As for left over remains like what you have shown that was moved to the Strategy Wiki, perhaps some of that need to go.  Most of these images are a copyvio as well, even though fair-use is being claimed on them, which was also a significant problem with many of the video game Wikibooks in the past.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:23, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

:There really isnt any kind of policy on this matter to help us out either way. The general feeling of the community i think (and my personal opinion on the matter) is to generally let the sleeping dogs lay. However, we need to remember that these &quot;dogs&quot; are in a precarious position, and they very well could be forced out of the wikibooks project in the future ''if we dont all just ignore them''. The problem is that we have had problems in the past, especially a notable one where Jimbo himself left a message saying that videogame guides needed to be deleted. Because of all the drama, many of the videogame guides have been moving, of their own volition, out of wikibooks, and the ones that do move (to prepare for a videogame guideless future) are deleted here. If all the guides leave voluntarily, it is less likely they will need to be removed by force. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

== possible Haskell wikibook move ==

Some of us working on the [[Haskell]] book are contemplating a move to the haskell.org server (see the [[Talk:Haskell]] page for details).  Does anybody have experience with these kinds of decisions, i.e. where we have a community wiki &quot;competing&quot; with wikibooks?  What's the best approach to these kinds of situation?
* Moving to haskell.org gives us much better Haskell syntax support (we get highlighting for the Haskell language), and more importantly, brings us closer to the community.
* Staying here lets us stay closer to the general textbook-making community of wikibooks and gives us access to resources such as commons (then again, we could just move our images to the haskell.org server, and share them between different language versions of the book, for example)
* Forking the wikibook would likely involve lots of bots/people running around keeping things in synch.

Some specific questions:
* Would it be possible to have the same plugin on wikibooks that haskell.org (mediawiki) use for Haskell syntax highlighting?
* If the Haskell book authors established consensus that we should move, would wikibooks accept to delete this version here to avoid a fork?  The Haskell page could just point to haskell.org
* Are there any alternatives, any ideas for getting the best of both worlds?

Otherwise, any comments, advice? Thanks, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 18:10, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

: I like the idea of having syntax highlighting not just for Haskell, but for all programming languages. I doubt the book would be deleted, since its an approperiate book for Wikibooks and there may be people who may wish to continue to develope it here. Keeping books here in synch with another website is discouraged and can be a source of conflict, and issues of licensing and acknowleding people who contributed to the work. The only alternative I can think of, would be to invite and get the haskell.org community involved here and work on the book, but that may not work. If the people working on the Haskell book decide to move to haskell.org I think it would be best to just continue the work there and not worrying about what happens to the book here. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:53, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

: I don't share many of [[User:Darklama]] views and I will not pretend to speak for the whole community and so will give only my view on the problem, when you say move you are probably referring to the authors moving to another version (a fork) and requesting a deletion of the book here, as I see it the deletion would be almost impossible but the authors are free to propose it, I myself will vote against any deletion on those bases, as for copying the book and moving the authors there as it is I think its the best option if you wish to enforce a greater control of the book structure, as keeping the books in sync will be very hard (you can try to), but you will probably get into trouble as [[User:Darklama]] stated, please see discussion on the policy for proposal approval, I have proposed the clarification of book communities and the possibility of establishing book specific policies and that some restrictions should be passed to the be bold guideline (you are free and should participate on the debate), I will also be involved in the discussion of the local forking policy in the future as a solution for similar book control disputes (within some limitations) that would avoid a major part of similar conflicts. 
: I think that yet another way you can go is to within the actual rules to get specific book guidelines approved and continue to work here, this is not against Wikibooks policies and I'm also fighting a similar problem, but proper policies need yet to be discussed by the general community as I stated above, but you will get an higher visibility and even collaboration from other user that are not only interested on this specific book subject, you can even fork the book to another site later if you do get into heavy conflict and which to avoid it.
: As for the plugin I don't see a major problem you just have to get it approved, it would indeed be great if it could be extended to other languages. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:27, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
: Regarding your question about syntax highlighting, there is the [[meta:Syntax Highlighting Extension|Syntax Highlighting Extension]] for Mediawiki. Right now it is not installed on any mediawiki server (that I know of), though there is an outstanding [[bugzilla:7163|feature request]] for it to be installed. The extension apparently requires [http://www.beautifier.org/ Beautifier] to be installed. Haskell is supported. (See [http://www.beautifier.org/php/langs/].) It would very beneficial for the different programming-language textbooks to have the various languages installed and, with a real-live request (as opposed to just a, &quot;It'd be nice to have&quot; request), I think we could get it installed.
: All said, it would take a lot of work. Typically, to get bugs speedily processed, you must provide an implementation and, I imagine in this case, an off-wiki demonstration.  The developers have their own interests that they are working on, so unless something is in critically urgent in the utmost extreme, they will  work on it occassionally and spend their time on their own projects. I do not intend to be critical; indeed, they are volunteers and cannot be expected to everything we request.

:Interesting concept. Wikibooks is about the authoring of textbooks, not just textbooks that don't appear somewhere else, or textbooks without competitors, or textbooks for which there are no forks. In the end, the authors here are free to leave or project for greener pastures (i would hope they would stay), but there is no reason why the book here would have to be deleted. Also, remember that the content here is released under the GFDL, so you need to ensure that Haskell.org has a compatible license or else it is technically illegal for you to copy the material from here to there (I doubt this will be a problem, but still...) --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks for the comments, everyone!

::The Haskell syntax highlighting is working for us (I have no idea how, but it is some kind of MediaWiki plugin), so we do have a working demonstraction, one that is a alive and well.  For an example, see the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Simple_unix_tools Simple Unix tools] tutorial on the Haskell wiki.
::Two more questions:
::* Is there anybody in particular that I could contact re: getting this implemented in Wikibooks?  Taking care of the syntax highlighting would at least equalise this aspect of the debate; we'd only have the community aspect to consider.
::* Also, (Forgive my ignorance on such matters) how feasible is it to have a situation where a site, like, say http://book.haskell.org resolves directly to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell.  I gather that if anything, it'd be something for the haskell.org folk to implement, but if such a thing were possible, is there any reason not to do it?
::I am not surprised that Wikibooks finds itself unwilling to delete content :-) Thanks for clarifying that... it gives us one more point to consider when debating the move (or the fork).  The Haskell wiki runs under a Simple Permissive License; by analogy to us, they are BSD and we are GPL.  Clearly, we won't be able to import the wikibook directly into Haskell wiki because their license is too permissive wrt ours. What would likely happen, if anything, is that we create a sub page under the wiki, under which all content will be GFDL.

:::''Is there anybody in particular that I could contact re: getting this implemented in Wikibooks?''' Anyone at Bugzilla. Specifically, you should post at [[bugzilla:7163|bug #7163]] &amp;mdash; a request to install the [[meta:Syntax Highlighting Extension|Syntax Highlighting Extension]] on the Wikimedia servers. The current request is very vague, saying &quot;This will be an enormous value to WikiBooks as well as Wikipedia itself,&quot; yet failing to specify ''how'' and ''why'' it will be of enormous value. It doesn't even say for which books it could be implemented or which community wants it to be implemented. If you and the community started pushing and shoving (but only politely &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt;), then I think you could feasibly get the extension installed on the servers.
:::''Also ... how feasible is it to have a situation where ... http://book.haskell.org [#1] resolves directly to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell [#2].'' It would be feasible with Apache although I do not know the specifics. But one difficulty may be that, though #1 resolves to #2, users redirected to #2 (Wikibooks) would be unable to get back to #1 (Haskell.org). This could be resolved with extensive hyperlinking between Haskell Wikibooks pages to Haskell.org, but that might raise issues in itself, specifically regarding (possible) accusations of link spam. I would judge to those to be specious, specifically because (in my own opinion) the authors' (you and the Haskell community) consensus to systematically add the links is of greater weight than others' ideas &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 05:30, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal for a minor change of nomenclature ==

Following the lead of our &quot;little sister&quot; project (Wikiversity), I'd like to propose that we change our nomenclature a bit to reflect what &quot;admins&quot; really do. 

In short: let's rename &quot;administrator&quot;, and call those in the &quot;sysop&quot; usergroup &quot;librarians&quot;.

I think &quot;Librarian&quot; is a nice word with nice connotations. Librarians are the ones who say &quot;shhh!&quot;, keep people from bothering other people, tell the guy with the markers to stop vandalizing books (and perhaps ban him from the library), and help people find what they need. 

It's also just something different from our &quot;big sister&quot; project (Wikipedia), where &quot;admin&quot; has over time accrued connotations that don't apply on wikibooks. The extra tools &quot;admins&quot; have aren't meant to be for bossing people around, but rather for being helpful for making the &quot;library experience&quot; a good one for all who wish to make good use of the library. 

It's just a word, and a rose (or flea) is a rose (or flea) by any other name. But words do make a difference sometimes. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

: I agree. I think librarians is also less intimidating and confusing than &quot;administrator&quot; for new users and people who associate administrator with &quot;boss&quot;, &quot;network administrator&quot;, etc. Librarians generally help people find what they are looking for, enjoy helping people and enjoy reading. Qualities that are positive and I think are a good reflection of what Wikibooks encourages; creativity, cooperation and helping one another create books. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:09, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

* '''Strongly Disagree''' - I don't have a problem with the name change per-se but in the logic presented for the name selection, I don't think we should focus on shushing people up, this is not the focus and the principal task of an administrator, administrators are just normal users with a bit more of rights to perform some specific tasks, this rights at the moment are, well, given in a way that the major factor is only the need to have the rights, there is no special evaluation of the administrator, most have more a technical knowledge about the Wikibooks infrastructure than a broad social involvement in the community, there isn't an age limit or sanity check and most are almost given as to politicians you do a certain amount of community work, do as you are told, don't create waves and you probably get a few votes to get you in the club, etc... as it is, without first fixing the opened policy/guidelines discussions, redoing and rethinking the task of an administrator and it's limits I don't see this as an urgent need and in particular don't like the thinking behind the proposal. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

* '''Massive Support''' - I love this idea.  Administrator has a negative ring to it and makes us seem not dissimilar to Wikipedia.  Librarian is fun and a bit more appropriate to how we'd like to be perceived.  Administrator is also a bit inaccurate because the differences between them and regular users are not great enough for such a name.

*'''Apples''' - If people wanted to start calling sysops librarians then whatever, but I think I would still call them administrators because we administrate. It may be like other projects, but I think a rename is a bit silly.

==The need for fixed and verified editions of textbooks ==

I was just idly searching google for references to Wikibooks and came across a persistent and obvious comment: Wikibooks is no good for textbooks because the editions are not stable and verified.

'''The argument that &quot;what's OK on Wikipedia should be OK here&quot; does not apply because Wikibooks are supposed to be textbooks.  By definition a textbook is a stable and verified companion text for a course of study.'''

The solution to this problem has been around in the world of publishing for centuries:

# The publisher has an editorial board to vet content.
# There are fixed editions that can be used as stable references in other publications.

We could do the same.  Each category of books could have an editorial board.  Before PDF editions of books are created the editorial board would review the content and advise the author(s) on accuracy, impartiality etc.  The usual process that occurs on publication of books would then occur.  The editorial board and authors would need a single guideline to &quot;publishing a Wikibook&quot; to help them deal consistently and fairly with the process. Wikiversity could help here by contributing members of the editorial board and only recommending reviewed texts to students.

&quot;Certainly, Wikibooks has several shortcomings. One is its open nature, in which any registered user can edit existing entries. That means that any entry can be defaced or, more benignly, modified by someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.&quot;

Wikinews And The Growing Wikimedia Empire

By Eloquence in Internet
Sun Dec 05, 2004
http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/3/163158/922

&quot;Perhaps the biggest issue facing Wikimedia today is the lack of credibility of the content created by its world-wide community of volunteers. Wikimedians point to recent quality reviews which have found Wikipedia articles to be frequently superior to those in traditional encyclopedias, but the simple fact that an entry may have been turned into rubbish a minute before you have decided to look at it does not inspire much confidence. For this reason, lots of energy and thought has been spent on finding and implementing review methodologies.&quot;


http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous_conservative/2005/12/watch_your_wiki.html
&quot;I would never use or cite Wikipedia in any article or paper that I wrote. It is often not accurate and VERY often biased. When anyone can write and or edit something into an entry, the &quot;definitions&quot; can change from day to day.&quot;

===Suggested guidelines===

1. There should be several types of textbooks &quot;study guides&quot;, &quot;textbooks&quot;, &quot;complementary texts&quot; and these terms should be used in the book's subtitle.

2. The editorial board should insist on either removal of POV or, if appropriate ringfencing POV with a heading such as &quot;the following represents a particular point of view held by a minority&quot;. (Guides and textbooks should have little POV, complementary texts may have some POV for stimulation of debate)

3. References must be given.

4. Format must be followed.(TOC, Author list, GDFL licence etc.).

5. Verified books should have a seal of approval and the edition should be clearly stated. 

This suggestion only applies to PDF editions (or similar fixed editions), not to the online editing interface.

[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:Taking point 4 a little further, all included media (images, sounds, movies, PDF and other documents) would require appropriate licensing (as per current Wikibooks policy anyway). I mention this because a number of pages have recently been broken because they included media that did not specify copyright status, thus image links were removed and images deleted. This sort of thing would be ''undesirable'' for fixed and verified editions. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 11:35, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

: Perhaps, yes. To my knowledge however, there is only one published PDF (I'm sure there are more on the way, but they aren't announced or have been talked about). Each wikibook is kind of a personal project anyway. I agree though, there should be some official version with a nice stylebook. I just don't think wikibookians in general would want such restrictions put on them. Perhaps if it was given as a &quot;gold star&quot; to nicely done books. More of a reward than a necessary procedure. But then again; it would feel as if we were rewarding the bear minimum, nicely written books should be well organized, easy to read, have plenty of pictures and somewhat low text density (Newspapers and magazines go so far to achieve the goal of low text density, that they take quotes from the middle of a page, blow it up, and make it into a &quot;picture&quot; of sorts). --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 15:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

::What I meant by &quot;publishing&quot; was the production of a PDF file from the online text that is placed in a special area that is locked from further editing or updating.  The reason the PDF version should be chosen as definitive is that it cannot be edited and so constitutes a stable version.

::A gold star might make the authors feel good but we need to go further to fulfill the objectives of this site. Wikibooks is not Wikipedia.  It is a serious effort to provide quality textbooks at no charge to the whole world. Having reviewed comments on the web about Wikibooks it is very clear that we will not be a respected source of textbooks until we offer books that have been vetted by an editorial board and offer these in stable editions.

::This proposal is not a restriction.  Books that are too personalised for school or college use can be left as they are. However, we should offer verified and stable editions of textbooks for the core curriculum in schools and universities and display these prominently. If this is not done the project will, in the long run, have failed to fulfill its primary objective. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:16, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

::: I see, I agree then. Basically, do what Wikipedia 1.0 is trying to do. I have no problem with that, we just need the manpower to do it. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:Something that had received lots of hype in the past, but which is all but forgotten now is the concept of &quot;stable versioning&quot;. Stable versioning was the ability to maintain two versions of a page, the &quot;stable version&quot; (a version that looks good and was checked),  and a &quot;working version&quot; (where people make edits). If i remember correctly, only an admin could designate a stable version of a page, and new comers to the site would see the stable version first and then they would be given an option to see the working version. In the software world, this is analogous to software with a &quot;stable version&quot; and a &quot;beta version&quot;, where the beta version may contain more errors, but represented the most current code base. 
:Something that we could do is implement some basic types of stable versions here. Each book could have a page &quot;Book Name/Stable Version&quot;, that would contain a list of permanent links to known good versions of the pages. These stable version pages could be protected and edited only by admins.
:It's something to think about, perhaps, but it would certainly increase the workload of admins around here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:43, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:: There is another way, one that IMO is a little easier in one form at least. PDF versions lag behind the wikibooks version already. Why not take advantage of that fact and make the PDF versions the stable fork? Like software, an official stable version doesn't exist for newly found projects, or even some older projects. Just like print versions here on Wikibooks. Its harder because making a print version is pretty much &quot;outside the wiki&quot; work. I'm kind of experimenting by uploading the LaTeX sources for Ada to sourceforge as I'm making them, but I seriously doubt any &quot;open collaboration&quot; with hurdles like Subversion in the way. Ada Programming is an exception, programmers in general should be familiar with versioning tools, but asking the wikibooks community to use programming tools may cause problems. 

:: Not saying that subversion is ill-suited for the task. It keeps track of the history and all the files better than history pages do here on Wikibooks. But the learning curve involved in that... and then the curve in learning LaTeX to collaborate... I'm not sure how far it would go. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:23, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I had thought about using PDF versions for this purpose, but I have a few issues with that:
:::#Not all books have PDF versions. Not all authors are capable of creating them. 
:::#PDF versions that are created are not necessarily read over, edited, or checked in any way. These versions may not be faithful reproductions of the actual book content
:::#PDF versions, when uploaded, completely replace the previous version (no history for PDF files). In other words, the PDF version is only &quot;stable&quot; until it is next updated. Students who are relying on a partcular version of a PDF may wake up one day to a new file, with no trace of the old one.

::::Why not use a naming convention for authorised PDFs?  Suppose the Biology textbook were ready for an approved version, the authors would signal this fact to the editorial board and ask the board to read the current biology.pdf.  When the biology.pdf is approved it would be uploaded as Appr_biology_edition1.pdf.  This process is simple and answers all of Whiteknight's points except the first; but authors can ask for help on PDF creation - &quot;Open Office&quot; has really cracked PDF generation in the latest release. 

::::The provision of vetted and fixed versions would be as follows:

:::: * An editorial board is established.
:::: * A symbol or colour is chosen to mark approved PDFs ie: links to an approved biology text might always be green. 
:::: * Authors approach the editorial board with a perfected PDF when they want a book approved.
:::: * The editorial board vet the book and provide feedback. Authors resubmit etc. etc.
:::: * On approval the main page of the book's PDF should say something like &quot;Wikibooks Approved Text&quot;
:::: * Once approved the PDF is uploaded as Appr_(bookname)_ed(edition no).PDF
:::: * All links to PDFs for this book should then be changed to point to the approved version.

==== Problems with editorial board ====

I don't think an editorial board is such a good idea. Consistentcy between two very different subjects is generally not realistic. For example, books about cooking are not going to use the same styling, format, etc. as a book on computer programming and expecting them to look the same would create problems that have already been solved by applying solutions that work for the specific problem. I would rather see each book try to live up to quality based whatever established standards exist for writing books in a specific field that are used to make them look good, easy to follow and read. There is also the issue there are more than one standard typically and who decides which one is best? At any rate an editorial board would need to be made up of a large range of people with experience with book publishing on different subjects in order to have some idea of what works and should be used to make a print version its best.

An editorial board would be made up of volunteers and this seems like it would take a lot of time and effort from the volunteers to work out differences in POV over what works and is best. Perhaps more than anyone would be willing to do? Book writers are also volunteers and may not have the time or desire to put a lot of energy into perfecting the book to some standard that involves more effort than they have time to do or believe is necessary. I think most people are probably more interesting in having fun and enjoying the energy they put into contributing to books than they are in worring about what other people may think of it and getting involved in other tasks and processes. The exception to that rule I believe are probably anyone who reads the staff lounge. Thats why I believe things here are relatively relaxed and there is not much interest in doing more than what people came here to do. Wikibooks relatively few policies and guidelinesm and the nature of them are a reflection of a desire to have the freedom to just do it and reflect what the community does rather than trying to impose changes on the community.

I hope this hasn't discouraged you, just trying to point out the difficulty involved trying to get things to change and the problems involved in a project like Wikibooks where everyone is a volunteer. Hopefully I've also made it clear why I think its unrealistic. I believe for something like this to work will require some rethinking that doesn't involve much change, time and effort by the community. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:52, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

: Yes, you do bring up good points. But all you have to do is look at a &quot;For Dummies&quot; book, and realize, they have a consistant formatting for '''all''' their books, from cooking, to sports, to computers, to literature, to whatever. Similarly, newspapers have similar formatting for all their sections. (or at least, the Washington Post does) Consistant formatting across subjects is completly possible, though not without the effort. Additionally, consistant style has its advantages. Whenever you pickup a &quot;For Dummies&quot; book, it feels like all the other books, even if authors are totally different people (as is the case in the dummies series). O'Reilly also has that advantage. Not all publishers are like that of course, but it is something that should be considered. Should the community like this idea, then Wikibooks should build its own identity through layout, a complete stylebook and a board that will review books and modify them so that they are consistant.
: And at the risk of &quot;giving an idea without the will to follow through&quot; :-), there is the possibility that a publishing group is made at Wikibooks. A group of people who are interested in making such consistancies and so forth. I'm not sure if enough people exist to make such a group possible, but, it is an idea nonetheless that doesn't involve forcing authors to &quot;comply with the standards&quot;. Basically, we don't need &quot;reviewers&quot; as much as we need &quot;workers who review and revise&quot;. Not too many books are reaching the publishing phase, and I'm sure if we started, we would run out of books to reviewe and revise before other books are made. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 15:39, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

::The idea of an editorial board is not designed as a hindrance to the creation of books in general.  It is a response to the copious comments on the net which say that '''Wikibooks is not a credible source for academic textbooks'''.  This criticism does not apply to the cookbook and doesn't apply to presentation.  It applies to the content of academic textbooks.

::What I am proposing is a '''voluntary scheme for mature books'''.  When a textbook becomes mature the authors may wish that it should be vetted and issued in fixed editions so that it is credible and can be referenced. In these circumstances it should be possible to engage the services of an editorial board to provide a stamp of approval and to lodge the book in a special way on Wikibooks so that it can be a fixed and credible source for academic study.  If the [[Special relativity]] book is ever finished I would be keen for it to become an approved reference work and would happily go along with the necessary changes to make it acceptable.

::In the case of books where authors do not want the work to be approved I can see no reason why these books should not continue to exist and be developed as they do at present.  Similarly, the online version of approved textbooks should be changed by authors in the normal way and, when appropriate, the authors might ask for a second edition to be approved (the first edition would be kept for reference and the approved second edition given pride of place).

::This idea may come to a head this year as several books reach a sufficient state of maturity.  I would suggest that we put in place a &quot;beta&quot; system for creating editorial boards, lodging PDFs of approved versions and highlighting which books have passed the approval process. 

::[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] makes some good points, especially about the lack of books that are mature enough at present. Perhaps only 1 or 2 books would be sufficiently mature this year.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:52, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

===Process for creating verifed, stable editions===

I would suggest that when authors decide that they have a book that is good enough to serve as a reference work they should contact an editorial board and start the process described in the &quot;guidelines above&quot;.  However, to do this we need:

# A book that is good enough
# An editorial board
# An accepted guideline for stable versions.
# A separate folder for approved books
# A symbol to be used with approved PDFs

I would guess that there are several books (3 or 4) that are good enough to start the process. Any volunteers? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 17:38, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:Before we start taking names, I think it would be a better idea to lay out the criteria of what specifically a &quot;good&quot; book should have, and what specifically are the legal requirements for having a distributable or even a publishable book? The GFDL is a copyright (or &quot;copyleft&quot;, if i must use the terminology) license, and to enforce that license, all contributors to a book are going to need to provide personal information: Real name, date of birth, verifiable phone number or email address, etc. All books are going to need to include a copy of the GFDL, but if the book contains images that use other licenses (CC images are a common example), the book is going to need to include a copy of that license as well. It might also be good/necessary for the book to include a listing of individual images that use which license.
:If we aren't working to publish, we dont need ''all that information'', but it would still be nice to have for future use. An editorial board would be a good thing, but that's a job that every joe-schmoe off the street could do. I for one don't have the time, patience, or motivation to be part of such an enterprise (assuming i was even qualified for it, which I am likely not).

::In the first instance I think we should only consider online publishing ie: using a distinctive symbol or colour for links to the approved PDF for a book.

::The guidelines for a &quot;good&quot; book will need to be developed but should be able to use existing guidelines for format.

::As you point out, the editorial board is the biggest problem.  Possibly the editorial board should have 3 members, the lead editor being qualified in the field covered by the book and at least one of the other editors being peripherally qualified. For example, to approve an undergraduate physics book the lead editor should have a PhD in a closely related discipline (Physics, engineering, biophysics etc), one subsidiary editor should have a degree in a related discipline and the other subsidiary editor should be experienced on editorial boards. To approve a high school book the lead editor should have a degree in a closely related discipline (ie: a botany/physiology/zoology/microbiology/biochemistry degree for a biology textbook) and one subsidiary editor should have a science degree for a science book, arts degree for an arts book etc. and the other experience of editorial boards. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

:::An immediate problem that I see with this idea is that we would create a system where wikibookians would be qualified based on their external merits (degrees, education, etc). While this might make the most logical sense, I am highly against creating a hierarchy among users, or saying that certain users are more qualified or more desirable for certain topics. Beyond that, I would say that we simply dont have enough people with educational backgrounds in all areas to implement such a system. In essence, we would be limiting the kinds of books that could become &quot;good&quot; by the types of people we have on the editorial board. I would say that people who want to be part of an editorial board should be accepted without qualification, and we can blindly trust the authors of the particular book to have gotten the facts straight (a gamble, to be sure).

== Programming bookshelf locked ==

I am trying to put together a wikibook targeted to a sophomore level special topics course in C with Unix.&lt;br&gt;
I am wanting my students to be the primary contributers during the semester, with a view to merging the content back into existing books where the content has some value.
 
I want it to differ from the existing C programming book in a couple of germane ways,  first the collaborating authors (at least my students are the ones I am primarily interested in) will have had a minimum of 2 semesters of Java.  As a result a lot of the structural and syntactic issues common between Java and C only need to be addressed in a relatively superficial manner.  In addition, some advanced topics such as embedded assembly language code, interprocess communication and database connectivity can be handled.  Finally, as part of an attempt to make our students more aware of platform issues we are insisting on ANSI C on Unix.  The results of this decision is that we need to incorporate shell management, scripting and make. 

Having begun the process of establishing the contents page, the help pages indicate that I should add the new book to a bookshelf.  However the programming Languages bookshelf is locked.  Am I supposed to add the book to the Miscellaneous shelf and wait for someone to notice it is in the wrong place?  Is there a reason why that particualr bookshelf is locked?

Peter Cooper [[User:Petercooper|Petercooper]] 21:31, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:[[Wikibooks:Programming languages bookshelf]] is set so that users have to log on to edit it and need to be admins to move it. If you are logged on when you try to make the adjustments you want to make, you should be ok. Alternatively, it may be that you tried to do that whilst the database was temporarily locked to everyone earlier this evening - if so, this is a temporary problem that happens from time to time. Trying a little bit later normally works.

You also might like to look at [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] if you haven't already done so. Although it's only at &quot;proposal&quot; stage, it offers good advice, and is likely to become an official guideline shortly. All the best with your book.

== Metric/English units ==

In my [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book|project]] there are a lot of places where we have been using both metric and English measurements.  Sometimes we put the metric first with the English in parenthesis, and sometimes vice versa.  We think this is ugly, and are exploring alternatives.  If we just switched to metric and dropped English, I fear we would not be serving our readers, most of whom use the English system.  My first stab was to make a template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Units|default|alternate}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; that would diplay the default units and show the alternate when the mouse hovered over a calculator icon, just like the short_stage template does:

::The speed of light is {{Units|300 million meters per second|1.8 trillion furlongs per fortnight}}.

I would like it better if the reader could express a preference and have whatever units he prefers show up and have the other suppressed, or perhaps swap the default and alternates in the template.  Is that possible?

[[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 18:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

: It might be possible if you wrap each unit with a span element and a specific class. You could then use a custom monobook.js to hide all elements with that particular class. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:32, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

Just use metric.  I presume that by 'English' measurements you mean 'imperial' measurements.  Calling them 'English' is a bit much considering the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and most other English-speaking countries use metric measurements.  The USA is one of only 3 countries in the world which still use imperial measurements (the others are Libya and Burma/Myanmar).  Metric measurements are also the only measurements used by scientists even in the USA (as it's much easier to do calculations with a base of 10 and if everyone uses the same system less errors will be made).  Sorry, I don't have any great solutions to your problem but if you find one please let me know as I'm trying to convert the cookbook recipes to show measurements in both systems.

:A few points to make here:
:#This isn't the first time somebody has asked for this kind of feature. It's a common request here on wikibooks, and also at other projects (en.wikipedia gets it alot). Unfortunately, there is no good way to solve the problem (unless we do implement something in site-wide javascript). Unless somebody has the knowledge/ability to do this locally, it's not going to get done.
:#Jim is correct in that a large number of readers of this site are american, and therefore are more familiar with the imperial units. Regardless of the merits of one system or another, we need to speak to people in a language that the audience can understand. If we need to cross-reference every metric unit with an equivalent imperial one (or vice-versa), then that's what we should do. I won't pick one set of units over the other, it does a disservice to our readers.
:#Scientists and engineers may use metric, but the children reading the youth honors book are not likely to be professional scientists nor engineers. Again, we need to consider audience.
:We could probably get together and write up a bunch of templates to handle conversions like this.

:If I get time, I'll look at it, but first I'd like to point out that a JavaScript solution is probably not optimal. Better would be to do it as CSS, using the :hover selector.

:::: That's pretty good, but I can ''imagine'' something better. Ideally, the reader should be able to click a link at the top of the page that would switch the units from metric to Imperial, and that would carry over to the print version.  The monobook.js suggestion is probably beyond the capabilities of most who would want to switch from metric to Imperial (that is, not engineers or scientists), so though that is intriguing, I don't think it would work.  Instead, I'd hafta make Imperial the default and assume the metric crowd possessed sufficient web-aptitude to switch to metric.  But then the default is... &lt;small&gt;imperial&lt;/small&gt;.  If I were doing this in php, I would set a cookie and switch on it in the code.  But this is not php, and I am fluent in neither CSS nor Javascript (nor in php for that matter, but I can get by).  I may well adopt the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{H:title|212°F|100°C}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; solution in the meanwhile.  [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 00:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I think kids come with less baggage, and if we gave them metric and allowed conversion they might just come away from this better off. I think the problem is that for too many years in the United States, we have tried to make life easy by printing both units on signs, or in books, but that makes people think that metric units are some type of alien torture device because I need to remember strange conversion factors 2.2 kg= 1 pound ~39&quot; = Meter etc. (I don't know why I even remember this number of digits of conversion accuracy) &lt;br&gt; We all know what a 2 liter bottle is now because that is what they call it. It would take about a month to get used to gas prices in $ per liter (the transition would be painful for some) but once every pump was measured this way you could rapidly know which was the better deal, and know if price is going up or down. If we are approaching this with the idea that only scientist and engineers can understand it, then I think we are missing the boat. Kids are flexible, and rapidly learn what a meter, cm, liter, kilogram, etc are. They will master it before the Adults do, and might be the generation to finally get us to move to the metric system. Maybe, just maybe, we won't have to suffer another Mars explorer.

*(reset)
I've just made a template, using existing classes in the stylesheets:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Explain|term|explanation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This combines the title attribute trick with printing the explanation within parentheses. It's a little inelegant (as I'm not hacking the stylesheets, and besides, MSIE6 don't do CSS2 stuff like :after), but it works. It won't allow your readers to switch between SI and imperial, but it will allow them to see imperial if they can't be bothered joining the rest of us in SI units ;-)

A trivial appication of Javascript could be readily applicable to address the issue. I designed an incomplete implementation at [[User:Iamunknown/jstest]] which is readable by users who do not have Javascript but does not includes Javascript in the actual document. It does not  yet, however, use native Wiki Javascript functions (as I was testing it off-wiki) or test whether or not the browser will support the functions used. Furthermore, it does not yet allow the user to pick which units they want to view; indeed, they can only pick metric. I will address this and other issues further.

I would like to express my support for both units. I think that a selection process can be elegantly and discreetly executed. You will likely, however, have to choose between either &lt;code&gt;metric (imperial)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;imperial (metric)&lt;/code&gt;. But either way, the user may, by way of Javascript or by way of CSS (if they are registered) pick either &lt;code&gt;metric&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;imperial&lt;/code&gt;.

Finally, I would encourage other users to mess around with my JavaScript code and suggest improvements on the talk page. We could all learn a lot from this. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 05:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

:I think we could create a set of templates for &quot;weight&quot;, &quot;mass&quot;, &quot;volume&quot;, &quot;distance&quot;, and other types of measurement with common imperial/metric equivalents. Each template would create a span HTML object with the class &quot;span_conv_mass&quot;, or equivalent. The site javascript could be expanded to search for these spans and automatically convert the contents. A link could easily be added in the sidebar to take care of this conversion process, so that it wouldnt take the time to convert when the page is trying to load. I think that Darklama and myself could figure this situation out, if anybody is interested in seeing the results. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:22, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

::Put me down as &quot;interested&quot; - this sounds very close to what I was asking for, and I think it could possibly work in the cookbook as well.  I think the authors should be able to choose the units (i.e., cm, m, km vs in, ft, miles).  I also think temperature should be included, but I'd need two different types - absolute and differential.  To illustrate, I'll just note that a temperature rise of 32°F is not the same as a rise of 0°, even though 32°F = 0°.

:::Okay, I've been working on this for a while, and I think I have a pretty decent solution to the problem (barring future improvements). I've written some javascript at [[User:Whiteknight/convert.js]]. People who would like to use this javascript can either copy+paste it to their own local monobook.js files, or simply include my script into yours with a link. My monobook javascript includes an example of such a link. The javascript includes a link into the toolbox (on the sidebar) that says &quot;Convert Units&quot;. When you click the link, the javascript will search through the page for spans with certain classnames, and perform the conversions as necessary. I've created a test template, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:Whiteknight/Convtest}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which is a mass template. To use the template, write: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:Whiteknight/Convtest|120}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (for 120 kilograms). Clicking the link will cause the number to change to say &quot;264Lbs&quot;. Clicking the link again will cause the number to change back (actually, the roundoff error causes the number to say 119.999). 
:::At the moment, the script only covers mass conversions from Kg to Lbs. However, i've made it extensible so that other units can be added by only adding in a single line of code. We can therefore add lots of other convertable units by creating the necessary templates, and adding a single line of javascript. At the moment, the code is only tested to work in firefox.

== reusing modules across textbooks ==

i am working on an animal behavior textbook [[Animal Behavior|Animal Behavior]]. in this i am including a summary of neuroscience and what we know about the physiological mechanisms that control and coordinate behaviors. a similar section is included in the intro psychology textbook. 

#[[Introduction to Psychology/chpt3 | Biological basis of behavior]]

given the overlab in scope i think it would make most sense if contributors would work on improving one set of files that can be used in both books - at least initially. branching out would just double the effort at this point. alternatively, i would start a separate project, reinvent the wheel and spend much effort on coordinating the material in these sections across the two projects. i guess a &quot;see also&quot; approach could be included but really does not work well for textbooks. i could copy the content that is currently in the psych book as a startiing point, but that probably would be a no-no - right? i could link to the chapter from my table of content, but then all included navigation would be to the psych book instead of back to the animal behavior one. i could try to do an import with WB:RFI but that would only copy the current status of the file.

now, a great solution would be via aliases in the folder hierarchy. if the original chapter resides in the psych book, i could place an alias for the chapter into my folder structure and call the alias instead of the original. navigation would be intact as long as the authors coordinate how they use page navigation across the textbooks, this ought to work but i havent seen any mention of aliases. - sorry, just trying to be bold :-)

are there any collective thoughts on how to handle such situations? any input and help greatly appreciated, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

:That's a tough call. Books sharing modules doesn't seem a good idea at all. The best option would be to somehow &quot;import&quot; the page from one book to the other, then integrate it into it's now home. I've thought about something like having reciprocal import functions between here and wikiversity for that, but it seems awfully complicated. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:29, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

::You can include content from another module like this:
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Name of other module}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
::I do this in my [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] a lot, but that's a slightly different case.  Most of my chapters are meant to stand alone, but information is shared between chapters.  For instance, a lot of the First Aid stuff is needed in multiple places - not only in the first aid chapters, but also in some of the camping/wilderness chapters as well.  I would hesitate before including content from an entirely different book though, but if that's what you want to do, this is one way to do it (within the Wikibooks project anyhow). [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 14:48, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

:::That works for some purposes, but if you were writing a science textbook for a UK curriculum, you might want to use a modified version of a US or Australia book on the same subject. They'd be similar, but not absolutely the same approach (and of course the spelling difference problems).

: To use another book's pages in a book, one must be aware of some facts, both books communities (or if you wish since there isn't a definition) people working on those books must agree in having shared pages, you have to give credits to the original work on the book that will be importing the page(s) (as per GFDL) you probably should use transclusions as stated by [[User:Jomegat]] since it reduces duplicated of content and permits collaboration of both book communities on the same page (probably a notice on that book talk page wouldn't be a bad idea also), this is the best option but the evolution and subject matter of books tend may tend to diverge and with time the evolution of the page that is shared will make it difficult to keep the shared.
: I personally don't like to refer to book pages as modules, books are modules of Wikibooks, book pages are part of a book. It is my view that this is a result of the limitations of the Wikimedia software, in Wikipedia each article has a single page, not here. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:35, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

*reset

folks, thanks, i really appreciate your thoughts on this and i perfectly agree that in its final version each book should have its particular version of covering a specific area of interest. my main concern is that it will be a bear of time to get the community to contribute a concise summary on a highly complex field with contributors in different areas of academia who rarely talk to each other. Wouldn't it be great if a couple of different book communities (which will share about 99% of the material on the subject eventually) would actually have to rough it out during the early stages. i bet the final result would be infinitely better and the effort to arrive there would be a lot less. - just a thought. so, i take it that it is neither encouraged nor particularly feasible :-) thanks, ciao, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

:Well, it's certainly not ''dis''couraged, it's just a new idea. The authors of the two books wouldn't necessarily have to &quot;formally agree&quot; to share, but if a module from one book is to be signifigantly altered to fit into the other, it would be nice if we had some way of making an attributed copy for use in the derivative version. There might be some way of creating an import space on meta or perhaps wikiversity, where the module could be uploaded as a copy, then re-imported to wikibooks as a second copy with the edit history intact. The other way would be to just do things as we used to transwiki in the past, namely copying the content to a new page, and placing a copy of the edit history on the talk page for reference. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:43, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

::Wouldn't that be only for &quot;finished&quot; books, Wikibooks books aren't never, well, finished (they can reach a &quot;usable&quot; version), the need to keep the attributed copy isn't a imposition to use content (it is a nice concept) but can be problematic as books have in the past been merged without giving credit to the original work, as for single or even multiple pages if the content is to remain shared on both books a simple trasnclusion would suffice, if content were to diverge, a simple copy and resync of history logs would suffice, we should probably work out some sort of guideline. I think I saw several books talking about similar proposal, if I'm not mistaken the last one I took notice  was between the Vi and Vim books. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:15, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

==== reusing modules across textbooks, section break ====
&lt;small&gt;(break added because the edit button was too far up!)&lt;/small&gt;

Well, the problem in the past was because no-one knew that histories could be merged (I'm afraid I'm mostly responsible for introducing the laborious yet advisable history-merging thing... I sort of came across it by accident). I think the best option by far would to use export/import to make 2 *full* copies (each with a version of the history). This might be easy to set up actually, because wikiversity has the same need (forks are actively encouraged there). I'll scribble up a proposal on both projects. 

Unless the module served the exact same purpose in the two (or more!) books planning to share it, it's probably a better idea to just duplicate the module (and it's history) so that it can be developed independently on both. I guess the best way to explain it would be to use a gardening page as an example (the subject I know best).

*I mostly work on a book about gardening. The chapters in that book are fairly specific in their audience though, in that they deal with issues for temperate-climate gardening. When I started working on the book, I thought it could be of universal scope (for all gardens, everywhere), but I've come to realize that there's just no way. A horticulturist in Panama might want to talk about the same plant, but what applies to that plant in a temperate climate won't apply to it in a tropical climate. Or a greenhouse. And how a Farmer treats the plant won't be the same as how a gardener treats it. 
*In other words, this book can't cover all the bases for everyone, but the individual chapters come pretty close. If someone came along later and wanted to write a book on tropical gardening, they should have some mechanism for making a copy of the chapters they want, and then modifying them to be relevant for tropical horticulture. 
*The original chapter in the temperate garden book might change over time as new methods are developed or more contributors add to it. The tropical version would change too. After a few years, they might not resemble each other much, but they'd share a common deep history.

I think Robert Huber's project runs along similar lines... one book is about zoology, the other about evolutionary human biology (and psychology?). Very similar, but different, and the work that's already been done can be brought in two directions in the two books. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:36, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

:I am a pretty firm believer that we don't always need to copy the history pages, or even go to great lengths to copy pages (and thus their histories). A simple footnote that says &quot;The orignal text of this page came from another place&quot; should suffice as the necessary attribution. Also, I would far prefer the use of page transclusions to solve the problem over any sort of content copying. Beyond even the transclusions, It would be the absolute best thing for you to include a hyperling that says &quot;For more information about this topic, see module  X&quot;, or even, &quot;As module X will show, there are a number of points about neurology that are common between animals and humans. We will summarize those similiaries here:&quot;. Copying material between two different books should be avoided, because it's a practice that simply isn't used (and generally isnt legal) in the world of real textbook. A textbook should be self-contained, and if it can't include all the information it needs, then it should be able to reference outside sources. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:23, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:: I think there are circumstances where this might be very useful. In Wikijunior The Elements, there are these very interesting and extensive articles on basic chemistry. They, in fact, would be a good foundation for a Wikijunior &quot;Chemistry&quot; book. But I strongly feel that the information should be pared back extensively for the purpose of &quot;The Elements&quot;. If we could fork in this way, then both copies could keep the history, we'd have good material for two different books and each would be able to evolve in it's own way. I don't think it's the best solution for every situation, but it seems like a good idea in some circumstances to me. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:02, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:I agree with [[User talk:Whiteknight]], It is clear that we don't need to copy the history page (unless the authors of the works chose to use trasclusion from pages into different namespaces, what would be good as this would keep low the need for duplicated pages), the only imposition to make references to the other works comes from the license we use, several books already have acknowledgments to other works or/and authors (the authors page is probably  the best place for it as it has already a special status inside a work), but there is several issues on the use of the GFDL and Wikibooks I don't see eye to eye with many of you so please take this only as a statement of my opinion and not as initiating a discussion on that. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:55, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

::A book on &quot;Wikijunior Chemistry&quot; can build off the material from &quot;Wikijunior The Elements&quot;, without having to duplicate that material. The two projects should be asked to work together, so that the elements book will contain all the information necessary in the chemistry book. The chemistry book would contain discussion about the elements book that is necessary for chemistry, but is not necessary in the elements text. Page transclusions could be used in this situation as well, but i don't think it would be useful or even beneficial. A statement of prerequisite at the start of the book should grease the wheels: &quot;Readers of this book are assumed to have a basic working knowledge of the periodic table and the elements. Wikijunior's The Elements is a good book to read to gain this knowledge&quot;. Also, another statement will help ensure that readers will keep both books in their list of bookmarks: &quot;This book will make frequent use of information from the Wikijunior The Elements book. That book should be viewed as a companion text to this text.&quot; Remember, wiki isn't paper, and it is completely acceptable (if not expectable) for people to have two books open in different browers (or different tabs of the same browser). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:56, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I think you've missed the point. The reason you'd copy from one book to another is to make use of the work that's already been done, without having to start from zero and without doing an unattributed copy-pasteed new page. Books and modules are GFDL documents, and the reason we use those kinds of licences is so that a book '''can''' be stripped down and rewritten for another purpose, while at the same time honoring the contributions of past contributors. It's the same thing as what we do with wikipedia articles when we import&amp;rarr;strip&amp;rarr;expand them, this just lets us do that within one project. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:02, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

::::I understand the possibilities. Typically articles are imported from a place where they are less appropriate to a place that is more appropriate. I would think that information is rarely suitable for two projects simultaneously, and only under condition that the two copies become sufficiently divergent within a set timeframe. Besides the fact that it is theoretically possible, I suppose I can't think of a single instance where duplication of a book or book module is preferable or even necessary. In general, it is always better to maintain a single copy of information, and therefore maintain a single pool of potential contributors. duplicating the material only serves to divide the number of people willing and able to contribute to each module, and this is something that wikibooks cannot afford with it's low population. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:19, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::Transclusion would increase collaboration and should be given a chance before we make any action against it's use, we should have a project or two using it with other projects to see if there are problems or even a source for conflict, the number of works that could benefit from another book's pages is not that big, authors interested into getting into it would be even less, as for dividing the number of people by the duplication of content across projects it is a fact that can't be avoided but as we know the ratio of number of active authors (not contributors) to any project is pretty small, the real problem would be resynchronization of content that was intended to be equal in several works but we should leave this up for the people working on the books as it will not affect the community in general. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:34, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::In this situation I think it would be appropriate to *remove* (permanently) about 2/3 of the material from the Introductory sections in the book. The primary reason I haven't done this yet is because I see that material as being very valuable in a different context. Transclusion would not be an effective way of dealing with this situation because the content (though related) would be dissimilar and have different aims. While I understand that Wikibooks is not paper, the goal of Wikijunior has always been to develop books *for print*. 

:::::Our options are to (a)Leave the large amount of content in the introductory sections. (currently there are more words in the &quot;introduction&quot; than all the other articles combined.) (b) Pare down that content that someone worked hard and well to create without regard for its usefulness in another context. (c) Copy it with limited attribution. (d) Fork it, leaving a copy in both contexts that can be reworked to fit the new context. (The Chemistry fork expanded and the Elements fork contracted.) 

:::::To my mind, it's not even close as to what is the best course of action in this situation. The fork solves every problem and creates only a limited number of workable problems in place. The primary downside, that we would have duplicate content for a short time, and overlapping content for a longer time doesn't seem like that big a deal to me, especially since there would be no reason or need to keep them synchronized. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 17:55, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

==== reusing modules across textbooks, section break 2====
:in my specific case, transclusion would be the best solution in the short term, and once the basic material is far enough developed, it should go through forking. the chapter is a good start but needs a lot of fleshing out of elements before it can really be called useful for the readers of either book. i rather do the fleshing out instead of starting over. i will probably run out of effort, time, or whatever when i get to the same place where the psyc chapter is right now :-)

:so how can i transclude (or request transclusion of) the page #[[Introduction to Psychology/chpt3 | Biological basis of behavior]] into the textbook [[Animal Behavior]]? i have the empty entry for it in chapter 3 (Intro to neurscience). i assume that i can keep editing and adding to transcluded text like normal? where do i go to have the chapter forked lateron when i have the material fleshed out? much obliged ... [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

:: First you should post a message in both books talk pages to see if anyone objects with the idea and give them some time to comment on it and later remember to give the credit to the original book on the destination book. As for transclusion you use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:namebook/page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; as for the fork you best be involved on the debate that is still active on that point, but  simple pages reuse doesn't fall under the fork definition, to fork a work you must copy all the content (or a very significant part of it).
:: If the book communities later later decide to remove the trasclusion, just ask any administrator to copy the page and the history as replacement for the trasclusion. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:::''&quot;Typically articles are imported from a place where they are less appropriate to a place that is more appropriate.&quot;'' &amp;larr; that's one reason, but there are others. The cookbook, gardening book, some dance books, and now the Holocaust book all are in part transwiki-built, taking Wikipedia articles and adapting them for another use. The wikibooks versions and wikipedia versions often link to one another, but there's no need to keep them &quot;synchronized&quot;... each copy develops in a different direction independently sharing only the history up to the particular historical version that was duplicated. Transclusion is a very awkward solution, because it creates an inflexible element that can't be altered for the use of one book or the other (in a way, an invariant section), limiting the creative flexibility of both projects. It might be different if you could just transclude paragraphs or even sentences which could be couched with other stuff, but this seems to be making a lot of work (it's also harder to edit if you can't &quot;see&quot; all the text in the actual edit window). It seems to me that if a contributor wants to take a text on one subject and use it as a basis of a text on a similar subject, we should be helping them, not making them jump through transclusion hoops :-). 
:::They don't need permission to make a new book out of an old one... the fork (is &quot;branch&quot; a better term, perhaps?) would be a separate project, and have no effect whatsoever on the first book.  ''&quot;...just ask any administrator to copy the page and the history as replacement for the trasclusion&quot;'' &amp;larr; that's precisely what I'd like to be able to do, upon request (and perhaps even some approval process). But there's no way currently to make a copy like that, which is why I'm proposing the bugzilla request. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:32, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

::::Well, so how is that for a plan, you guys help me copy the text and history into the respective chapter in the book that i am working on. i will flesh it out into a formal chapter and if there is interest from the original psych book then they newly fleshed out version can be transfer from my side back into theirs. i think there will be little overlap given that there hasn't been anybody working on the pages since nov.. so if you can make this work, then i will happily propose that solution on the psych book pages. ciao and thanks, [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]]

:Perhaps we should submit a request to bugzilla asking for a &quot;copy&quot; feature, where we can copy the text and history of a page to another page with a different name.

==ISBN for Wikibooks==

Completed Wikibooks should have an ISBN number. ISBN numbers are globally accepted (part of ISO) and not solely a US standard.  As a US based organisation we would need to obtain ISBN's from http://www.isbn-international.org/en/agencies/usa.html unfortunately it will cost a couple of hundred dollars for a 100 ISBNs.  

One advantage of ISBNs, amongst others, is that Wikibooks might be advertised for free on Google Books http://www.google.co.uk/books?hl=en . [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 22:14, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:Can't Wikimedia come to a deal with Google that will remove a need to spend money registering ISBNs ? (in a later date if books do get published on paper) will probably get an ISBN. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

:I definitely think that we an ISBN number should be on our to-do list. Currently, however, that is not the goal of Wikibooks, nor do we have an infrastructure set up to become a free-content publishing house. It would require a lot more commitment than I am currently giving and (I assume) than some others are also giving.
:Regarding infrastructure, I would like to point out to [[Special:Specialpages|the special pages]]. There is quite a bit of clean-up to be done (especially with categorisation) and I would immensely appreciate any help I can get there. It would be nice to take inventory of what we have here. I am unsure whether categorisation is appropriate, but until we can find out what we have, we can (as far as I am able to discern) not feasibly begin on larger projects of professional typesetting and publication. --[[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 19:49, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

::From what I have read about ISBN it would be up to Wikibooks to decide which books should be given ISBNs and the format of such books.  ISBNs can be given to ebooks where there is no printed edition so the ISBN could be applied immediately to any Wikibook.  My suggestion is, if Wikibooks obtains, say, 10 ISBNs these are applied to books that pass through [[Wikibooks:Wikipublish]] and [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]] and lodged with Google Books.

====Problems with ISBNs====

Just as an FYI, several Wikibooks have already been issued an ISBN number... under a Canadian registry interestingly enough, but we are still trying to work out the details on this.

The primary issue with obtaining an ISBN number is that it is registered to a &quot;publisher&quot; who is able and willing to provide copies of the published material (usually dead-tree format) that can then be ordered by book retailers.  The infrastructure that needs to be set up here is that we need to establish some organization, for profit or not for profit, that is going to be handling this sort of situation.

I have a few suggestions on how to get such a project going, and I've deliberately tried to go slow on getting this going mainly to avoid getting too many people pissed at me.  If Jimbo's reaction to the publication of the Wikijunior Big Cats book is any indication, this is going to cause explosively negative feelings if any substantial amounts of money are earned off of these books.  It is also very unclear how and when logos and mentions of Wikimedia registered trademarks (aka &quot;Wikibooks&quot;, &quot;Wikijunior&quot; and the associated logos) can be used.

I will note that another very famous trademark, &quot;Linux&quot;, is a regsitered trademark by Linus Torvalds (he got it from somebody else a while back) and is held by him for and in behalf of the community to make sure that mainly nobody else can claim trademark status on that name.  I wish that the WMF felt the same way about the use of the name Wikibooks, but unfortunately they want to use the WMF trademarks for some kind of future fundraising efforts.

I'll have to add some notes on how I would like to proceed, but there is obviously some interest in trying to get a formal publishing group put together.  I certainly want to be involved with that, and make sure that such a group is made up of Wikibooks users and volunteers.  This does not have to be run by the WMF (or certainly approved by them), but the stronger the spirit of volunteerism and cooperation between those doing the publishing and those creating the content here on Wikibooks, the better off both projects would be for each other.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:30, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

:Rob, thanks for this info. Are you absolutely sure about the need for &quot;dead tree format&quot;? I cant find any reference to an absolute requirement for paper copy. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:16, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
::I think it has to be on some sort of &quot;tangible&quot; medium, but I may be mistaken.  The whole ISBN numbering system was mainly set up by book retailers to help coordinate publication of material, and is in the format of &lt;country code&gt;-&lt;publisher code&gt;-&lt;publication id&gt;-&lt;check digit&gt;.  That is where the dashes come into the number, BTW.  As an interesting point too, once you have done a formal registration of the content with a government agency (we are doing that right now with the Wikijunior Big Cats book), it also gets assigned a Dewey decimal/card catalog number as well.  That might get interesting where some of these books actually end up.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:18, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== Featured Books ==

I think this is the time when we need to decide what to do about the BOTM and the COTM projects. It's my opinion that both should be replaced, but i know some people have suggested keeping COTM and replacing BOTM. These are my suggestions for what to do next, I would like to get some more input on these:
#Disband BOTM and COTM projects permanently
#Use [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] as the new mechanism for promoting books that are &quot;good&quot;. Good books can be listed as such on a continuous basis (more or less then one book per month). 
#Come up with some kind of set requirements for a book to be listed as &quot;good&quot; (perhaps give the job of good book selection to a wikiproject) 
#Create a wikiproject to replace the functionality of COTM. This wikiproject would select books in need of help on a continuous basis (as need and resources allow), and work as a group to improve these books.
#Place prominent links on the main page to [[Wikibooks:Featured books]], and [[Wikibooks:Wikiprojects]], as well (perhaps) links to the most active wikiprojects.
These suggestions are aimed at performing a number of tasks. First, they improve the old BOTM and COTM ideas, without completely abandoning the ideas of &quot;good books&quot;, or &quot;books needing help&quot;. Also, it helps to strengthen the &quot;Wikiproject&quot; initiative, which is something that i think will really help the wikibooks community in the long run. Any comments/suggestions? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:15, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:There is a difference between good, completed or nearly completed books and books that have made good progress or are worth an edit or two.  BOTM has always seemed to be about &quot;nice&quot; books rather than good, nearly complete books. 

:That said, featured books need more attention, particularly an effort to push them forward to being completed, published e-books. Other books also need to be encouraged towards featured status.  As a first step the project that you are proposing could produce a set of phases that books should complete to go from an idea to an approved and published ebook. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 22:24, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

::Having a set process and dedicated volunteers that will move &quot;good&quot; books to the status of &quot;better&quot; books, and eventually &quot;great&quot; books is something that we need to establish. The use of wikiprojects will be, i think, a good way to accomplish this, and the wikiprojects themselves will constitute the stages in this process:
::#Books that are decent are found and listed by the [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] mechanism (based on a forthcoming set of criteria).
::#The [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]] wikiproject will see these good books, review, edit, and revise them. The good books become &quot;better&quot; books.
::#The [[Wikibooks:Wikipublish]] wikiproject will find the &quot;better&quot; books, create printable versions, PDF versions, and work to make them publishable. The books become &quot;great&quot; books, and we can work to distribute our great books (print them, distribute CDs, have them hosted on other websites, etc).
::The best part of this pipeline process is that people can participate in the process at any point they want. I could help to edit a book, but not feel obligated to create a PDF for it (or vice-versa). Also, people who dont know what to do or how to help can be given tasks to work on. I think it's the best solution to the problem. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

== Images with unknown copyright status ==

I am in need of some guidance,

What is the policy for dealing with the images with unknown copyright statuses? The copyright tag clearly states that:

&quot;This image does not have information on its copyright status. Unless the copyright status is provided, the image will be deleted seven days after this template was added (Date). Once a copyright tag has been added, this template may be removed.&quot;

I know that copyrighted images are not allowed on wikibooks. What is the best practice for removing these images? After how many days of the tag being attached to an image should the links to such a file on pages be removed? 

Is there any specific reason, in general, why images are not deleted on time, as there are over 500 images currently with unknown copyright statuses. Is this due to a lack of people who have enough time to deal with deleting all of the images?

[[User:Urbane User|&lt;b&gt;Urbane User&lt;/b&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane User|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane_User|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:47, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

&lt;i&gt;Please note, this is in no way a derogatory set of questions, no matter how they are read.&lt;/i&gt;

:The only people who can delete images (or any pages for that matter) are admins. The number of admins that we do have is preciously small, and of them few want to take the time to delete 500 images outright. There has been some progress made (a month or two ago there were over 3000 images in this category), but this is also a continuous problem and new images are uploaded all the time with improper copyright status. In short, we will get to it when we get to it. While we might not delete the images within the 5 day timelimit, rest assured that we will do it eventually. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:27, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

::Whiteknight's answer is pretty much what I would have said.  Despite there being a numerical quantity of admins the active ones are rare on the ground and there is a fair amount of housekeeping to do.  That said there is really quite a lot that folks other than admins can do.  Watch Recent Changes (great insight to what is going on).  This means you will see when someone uploads images and you are welcome to tag any that are unlicensed and inform the user - templates are [[WB:TM|here]].  Another place that is worth a look is [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks maintenance]] - there is work to be done and it helps in getting to know the place.  I do hope that these comments help you to understand some of the issues involved and that you may consider assisting where you can.  The deletions will get done but time here is a little different (how often was I told that!). --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:16, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

:I would like to add that it is far more important to actually identify those items that may have some problems.  If you see something that may be a copyright violation or where it certainly should be questioned, please mark it up with the appropriate tags from [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Cleanup]], [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Deletion]] or some other notification message.  Adding these notification messages on a page automatically add it to a category and I promise that eventually action will occur.  Adding messages like this is something that any Wikibooks contributor can perform, and it will certainly be something reviewed carefully by others in the Wikibooks community, especially administrators.  Far too often some content will simply be added that nobody is even aware of, as it was missed by those who have performed a routine review of the project, but with over 20,000 pages to review, we don't always get to everything.  I certainly have not seen every page on Wikibooks (although I've done a pretty good job of seeing most of it).

:BTW, as a general suggestion, if you want to help out Wikibooks and eventually serve as an administrator to help clean out this backlog of problems, I would strongly suggest that you help with marking up pages you might see on Wikibooks with these template messages.  It is a very good way to let others know what sorts of content that you value, and if you seem to be making good decisions.  Don't worry about trying to &quot;overload&quot; the other administrators with work to do in terms of cleanup on these messages, as you may likely get the job yourself to help with the cleanup.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:10, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

::Just a side note here in response to a comment rob made, The current administrators around here typically do a good job of avoiding &quot;overload&quot;. While this means that some jobs don't get handled in a timely manner, it also means that our staff can stay energized and enthusiastic about the project. I personally value keeping our administrators happy and productive over getting all those work backlogs cleaned out. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:06, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

:::And something else for non-admins (like me) to do: look at the [[:Category:Files with unknown copyright status|images with unknown copyright status]] and see if you can do something constructive about them. For example:
:::* Find an equivalent image on [[Commons:|Commons]] to replace the image, change linked pages to use that image, and tag the local image with &amp;#123;{[[Template:NowCommons|NowCommons]]}}
:::* If the image is trivial (like, say, a green circle or a simple chart), build a new one and donate it to Commons or Wikibooks
:::* If the image is something that could be replaced with wiki markup, then do so - e.g. [[Acoustics/formulas|formulas]], [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Logic#Laws of Boolean algebra|tables]] (see [[m:Help:Displaying a formula]], [[m:Help:Table]] for more information)
:::Incidentally, could one of the admins please resurrect the deleted images that [[Engineering Acoustics/Piezoelectric Transducers|this page]] links to, so that the above process can be applied?

== Wikibooks Merchandise ==

I dont know if anybody knows about this, but there has been a shop created to sell wikibooks merchandise. I think this shop is relatively new, because it didnt exist last time i went looking for it. I am certainly not trying to advertise this stuff, and I have no idea where the profits from these sales go. However, there are some interesting things in this store, and since they contain the original wikibooks logo (considering that the official logo is going to change eventually) they might be partly nostalgic for people who have grown accustomed to the old logo. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

:Do you have a URL?  I highly doubt that they have permission to use the logo, as I've tried persistantly to get those permissions.  The only place that has &quot;permissions&quot; to sell Wikibooks-related merchandise is:

http://www.cafepress.com/wikipedia/529053

:The profits from the sale of this merchandise goes directly to the Wikimedia Foundation, and is used to support Wikibooks specifically, even if it is to help out with the server farm in general.  If you see anything else, I would strongly recommend that you notify the Wikimedia Foundation at the following address:

board at wikimedia dot org (to keep the spam bots from killing this e-mail address)

:Or simply post a message on Foundation-l about the issue.

:There are some logo licensing options being discussed on Meta, but those are very preliminary and I've been trying desperately to stay on top of any changes to those discussions.  Certainly nothing official has been issued by the WMF about the topic.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:52, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

::That cafepress address is the shop I was talking about, sorry i didnt include a link. I had been to the cafepress shop some time ago, and they didnt have anything wikibooks at all.

:::Just thinking out loud here, but I wonder if it might be possible to have a link to this Cafepress website from somewhere here on Wikibooks, in terms of &quot;fundraising&quot; and such.  I was thinking mainly something simple and discrete, and certainly not a &quot;banner ad&quot; or anything as obtrusive.  The side bar may be over the top, but something on the &quot;main page&quot; might be reasonable.  Any ideas?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:20, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

:If the merchandise benefits the WMF as Rob mentioned, then maybe we should post a link to it somewhere? How cool would it be to see people walking down the street wearing wikibooks clothes? I know that I would feel good about that (even if it is unlikely).

== Adopt-A-User ==

I don't know how many of you will have seen/been involved in the adopt-a-user programme on wikipedia, but i believe that it may possibly be a useful project to setup here on wikibooks.

For those of you who may not know about the adopt-a-user programme, it is a way of formally pairing new users who know little about the site, and pairing them with an experienced editor in order to help them learn how to work with the site. There is no formal selection process for being an adoptee or adopter, but rather the system works through volunteering.

What do people think of the idea of perhaps implementing such a programme here at wikibooks? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Urbane User|Urbane User]] ([[User talk:Urbane User|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Urbane User|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

:It's an interesting concept, but I dont know how it would work.

::New users will ask for a mentor by placing an 'Adopt Me' template on their user page. The mentors will then search through those pages which have this template and will assign themselves to one of the adoptees. For a better explaination, see here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ADOPT|Official Page]

:::I find placing welcome templates tends to mean I adopt some whether I want to or not &lt;g&gt;.  That isn't a complaint btw.

:I would agree with Herbythyme, it's my experiance that the first user who leaves a friendly message and offers to help becomes an unofficial mentor to the new user. That user will then go to the first familiar user to ask questions. An &quot;Adopt Me&quot; template might be a nice idea, but I would feel pretty bad if somebody put that template on their page, and nobody ever responded to it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:16, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== Influx of copyright violations ==

Look at the [[Special:Log/upload|upload log]]. We are getting a massive influx of images with copyright tags, without sources, or with ''totally wrong'' tags. I've tried to tag and notify some uploaders, but for other images, I'm totally unsure how to go about it. I'd like to start developing more user-warning templates, but I don't know enough legal jargon. For example, on my sub-page [[User:Iamunknown/Cleanup/Image tags]], I'm trying to identify the copyright status of the OSI Adaptive Public License, which is the license for images a user [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=upload&amp;user=Vincent+Salzgeber}} uploaded] the [[SwisTrack]] wikibook. Any help or ideas would be very appreciated. I'm going to Commons to ask about the OSIAPL now.

People tend not to capitalize in their searches, or else they tend to use title-capitalizations (first letter of each major word).

== Mathematics series of textbooks ==

I have recently been thinking of creating a '''series''' of mathematics textbooks that don't conform to any particular curriculum, but just progresses at the rate of one's learning and organised with adherence to one's prerequisites. My current thoughts for the textbooks are for them to be used from the introduction of a toddler/child learning how to write numbers to pre-university. This obviously will be a big task to undertake but I think its importance will most definitely attract many editors from other wiki's and society in general. What I have written is only an inspiration for other thoughts and I expect many constructive criticisms. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 20:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

:This sounds like it would be an excellent task for the Mathematics wikiproject. The first thing that we need to do is prepare an outline of the various subjects. We should be able to break the whole of &quot;mathematics&quot; into various sub-disciplines in a logical way. A number of books already exist for [[Arithmetic]], and [[Algebra]], and [[Trigonometry]], for instance, and they already contain TOCs that include logical amounts of information. Using these books as a starting point, we can use our outline to identify gaps in our &quot;curriculum&quot;, and start to prepare books to fill those gaps. For instance, we could set up a general progression as such:
:#Numbers and Counting (being a first course for pre-school and kindergarten)
:#Elementary Arithmetic (basic arithmetic operations using pictures and diagrams, for elementary students)
:#Arithmetic Problem solving (introduction to word-problems, pre-algebra, long division)
:#Algebra
:And we would go on from there. I do know that many school curricula break &quot;algebra&quot; into a number of numbered segments such as &quot;algebra 1&quot;, or &quot;algebra 2&quot;. We would have to decide whether to segment our algebra books in a similar way, or to have only a single book with different sections, etc. But, we can worry about that problem much later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:00, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

As a result of the merger between AT&amp;T (formerly SBC) and BellSouth, Cingular Wireless is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T and is being rebranded as ''wireless from AT&amp;T'', whereupon the Cingular name will be retired. When that happens, the [[Cingular Wireless FAQ]] will have to be moved/renamed and substantially reworked. Before undertaking that effort, and because of my bad experience with my former ''Wireless'' book here (which was summarily deleted without warning or even notice, forcing me into a painful crash move to [http://wireless.wikia.com Wireless Wikia]), I'd like some substantial reassurance that my reworked Cingular/AT&amp;T book will continue to be welcome and hosted at Wikibooks. Otherwise I'll probably move my reworked content to Wikia. Thank you. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 20:45, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

:Having a ''FAQ'' doesn't seem much like Wikibooks material to me, but a book about working with a Cingular/AT&amp;T phone definitely could be. I wouldn't title the book to be a FAQ but something more book-like. By the looks of its content, this is much more than a FAQ. I would say your content is safe here but if you find a more helpful wireless community at Wikia then that may be a better move. Your choice (as well as other active authors of the book here) of course. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:21, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

::Semantics aside, this book has been deemed in the past to be acceptable for wikibooks, and even though the name of the book may change, the book doesnt need to be reconsidered for deletion. As a simple suggestion, when you come up with a new title for your book, you may want to omit the word &quot;FAQ&quot; from the title, so that we dn't raise any eyebrows over inclusion criteria. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== Sister project for Freistil ==

[[Freistil]], launched on January 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2007, offers actual German texts adapted from Wikinews or written from scratch by native speakers with English comments and explanations. I'd simply love to launch a mirror project [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Freestyle Freestyle] in German wikibooks offering the reverse, i. e. actual English texts with German annotations.

If you are interested in participating in such a project, please let me know. Although advantageous, knowledge of the German language ''is not'' required. Things you might want to do include:
* writing short English texts of about 100 to 300 words about actual topics, either once or on a regular basis,
* annotating articles with vocabulary translations or in-detail boxes,
* layouting existing articles on the web or for printing via PDF,
* reading existing texts aloud and making OGG recordings,
* finding and recruiting potential writers for singular or regular participation,
* ...
I will offer help in any stages of the project, including the setup, translations and interlanguage cooperation in between the sister projects. --[[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]] 16:46, 20 January 2007 (UTC)


Some more details:
The basic idea is this: a native speaker writes a short article on an actual topic for foreign language learners. The text is then enriched with vocabulary translations that show up on hovering the mouse cursor over words in the text and provided with one of the grades ''beginner'', ''intermediate'' or ''advanced''. Other annotations may be provided as well, such as &quot;What's worth learning?&quot; boxes that compile the vocabulary of the text that is of daily use, &quot;In detail&quot; boxes that explain surroundings of the topic in the learner's own language and activities known from common language books. Eventually, an audio recording of a native speaker reading the text aloud is attached to the article. And finally, the article is provided as a one or two page PDF optimized for printout.

There is also administrative work to be done: taking care of the project's layout and templates, administrating the archive of existing articles, strolling the grounds looking for people that will contribute an article or two or will read one aloud, ...

You're free in choosing your favorite task or tasks in this process. The tasks vary in requiring the ability to speak German: as can easily be seen, writing an English article or reading an article aloud does not require any knowledge of a foreign language whatsoever. You're welcome, no matter whether you want to contribute on a regular, once-in-a-while or once-and-never-again basis.

My request is also listed in the German Wikibooks. If some more people show interest I will launch the project including technics and templates. The projects here and there will then be linked for interlingual collaboration and all cooperative pages will be offerd in English as well as German. --[[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]] 10:41, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
:I would certainly be interested in writing some of the articles for such a project.

==Development Page==

Is it acceptable to create a temporary page to do development in?  I want to rework the Monoploy book contents page, but want to spend a few days trying different things out.  Is it acceptable to create a page for this purpose and where should I create it?  Can I create sub pages to my user page? Or add it as a sub page to the monopoly book? --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 09:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
:You can create 'sandbox' sub pages on your user page for this purpose. These are ordinary sub pages that are usually used for testing and development of other pages. I myself have used them myself for the development of other pages, specifically the main [[Wikijunior Bugs|Wikijunior Bugs]] page. This method is perfcetly acceptable. [[User:Urbane User|&lt;b&gt;Urbane User&lt;/b&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane User|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane_User|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 10:02, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
::My view (similar to [[User:Urbane User|&lt;b&gt;Urbane User&lt;/b&gt;]]) would be a time based one.  Own sandbox is fine and would normally be my answer.  The only thing ''might'' be how quickly you get it done.  If others contribute not know you are working on it there could be confusion.  If that might be the case a subpage in mainspace with a pointer to &quot;work in progress&quot; ''might'' be useful?  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:07, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
Thanks. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 10:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== Completion-o-meter ==

I've started to edit the [[Welsh]] language wikibook, but was wondering how the completion-o-meter can be updated on the languages bookshelf? When I have added enough, is there a review mechanism I have to submit it to? Also, this is an appeal for any welsh-speakers to come and contribute! [[User:Kijog|Kijog]] 15:19, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

:The completion-o-meters (also known as the &quot;Stage template&quot;) can be updated by anybody, even yourself. At the moment, we don't have a good set of criteria for what qualfies a book for different levels of completion, so you have to use your best judgement. I would recommend that you don't give your book a status of &quot;100%&quot; unless you are absolutely certain that it doesnt need any additional contributions (and most books need more contributions). If you think your book is really good, and worthy of some recognition, then you can submit it to the [[Wikibooks:Good books|Good Books Wikiproject]], and eventually your book may end up on the list at [[Wikibooks:Featured books]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:07, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
::Thanks for your quick reponse, I think my confusion might have arose from the fact I might not have logged in when looking at the bookshelf, I couldn't edit it, could only look at the source so rushed in and thought it was a peer/admin thing. As for criteria, I suppose it's a question of how long is a piece of string - is a Wikibook ever complete?.... [[User:Kijog|Kijog]] 19:30, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
:::That confusion is common, several new users are confused by the protection on the bookshelves. Unfortunately, it's needed because of the spam and vandalism that we get here.

== Edittools ==

G'day, could a superbeing type please take a look at the request at [[MediaWiki talk:Edittools#Fractions symbols]] and either comment or action? It would be just a bit easier than having to pull up the Windows character map when I need ⅓ or ⅛ (used too infrequently to remember arcane magical key manoeuvres). thanks, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:40, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

I need help, I have a SanDisk Sansa mp3 player and I dumped my computer, now I cannot find the sever or whatever I need to transfer my music,the spot were it was before now sais remove hardware..what do I do?

== Editing Wikibooks ==

I am a new user that just discovered wikibooks.  I was reading through an ancient history book and there are many gaps in the information.  Sections that the author has left out.  I have studied a little bit in this area and would like to do some research and fill in some of those gaps, is there any way I could go about doing that?

[[User:Muffiner|Muffiner]] 16:16, 25 January 2007 (UTC)Doug  January 25, 2007

:G'day Muffiner, just click the link that says &quot;edit this page&quot;, and start filling in those gaps! I'm sure that what you have to offer will be most welcome. Click on the [[Help:Editing|Editing help]] link below the edit box, to find out how to write and format a page. You might also want to check out our [[WB:PAG|policies and guidelines]], to see what is and isn't acceptable.

== Software configuration ==

It's a bit weird seeing in the block log examples like the one below:
* 11:12, 25 January 2007 [[User:Herbythyme|Herbythyme]] (Talk | contribs) blocked &quot;193.60.223.142 (contribs)&quot; with an expiry time of 1 day (anonymous users only, account creation disabled, autoblocker enabled) ''(warned vandal)''.

Looks too similar to [[Special:Ipblocklist]] rather than a block log. This looks a bit confusing to some people.... it should revert back to the original way it was (like in MediaWiki 1.8)

I preferred the original, which was:
* 11:12, 25 January 2007 [[User:Herbythyme|Herbythyme]] (Talk | contribs) blocked &quot;193.60.223.142 (contribs)&quot; with an expiry time of 1 day ''(warned vandal)''.

anyone else agree this should be changed?? --[[User:82.42.237.84|82.42.237.84]] 16:47, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

:The change represents an update to the software where admins are given a large number of options when performing a block. The block log needs to make explicit mention of those options. Also, we don't have any kind of control over the source code of mediawiki, for that you need to go complain at meta. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

On another software configuration note, Wikipedia now has a javascript trick in Common.js that allows editors to manipulate the way a page title is displayed. If you have javascript, try [[w:E (mathematical constant)]]. This would be great for us. Any chance we could get something like this? --Brian Brondel 21:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

==copy feature==
([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) started a discussion to implement a &quot;copy&quot; feature, where we can request to copy text together with its history to another page with a different name. man, it would be great to have that tool. you could use some elements as starting points and go from there without reinventing the wheel. how far did this proposal go?

if this is not available, i would like to request a forking of [[Introduction to Psychology/chpt3 | Biological basis of behavior]] so i can tailor it to the animal behavior book, this fork should be called [[Animal Behavior/Neuroscience]]. i had proposed it about 2 weeks back on both books - with no objections. your help is greatly appreciated. [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] 12:21, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

:OK, I made a copy following the old (pre-import) transwiki protocol. If we get the import stuff enabled at a later date, we can duplicate the history after the fact (feel free to modify it now). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:41, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

== Wikitables ==

I'm looking add some format to the table of contents of the [[Welsh]] wikibook. I can use a simple 'wikitable' but could anyone point me in the right direction to a 'How to' guide for tables so I can find out the correct syntax for more complex stuff such as borders, alignment etc.? [[User:Kijog|Kijog]] 17:09, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
:G'day, your best bet for wikitable syntax is [[m:Help:Table]]. However, if you want to play with stuff like custom borders, you'll need to know some [[CSS Programming|CSS]]. Take a look at what I did with the logic truth tables [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Logic#Laws of Boolean algebra|here]]. Drop me a line on my talk page if you need a hand.

== Bot needed for printouts... ==

I'm wondering if any of our local scripting gurus could help me come up with a bot for making semi-automated author lists using edit counts. I'd also like to know how to make some slight modifications to the css (or maybe js?) to hide links to the parent directory and categories, since those aren't useful in print versions. 

See [[User:SBJohnny/Print version thinksheet]] for details... the boldface stuff is what I need help with. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:45, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

:I'll take a look at it. It sounds like the kind of thing that I could probably take care of, especially considering all the massive amounts of wiki-related source code that I have lying around on my computer. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

Once the microprocessor is designed, there is typically a large amount of room for that design to be made more efficient through optimization. The control unit specifically can be subject to logical minimizations.

As the specific requirements of each component are understood better, through simulation and prototyping, the clock speed of the system can be increased to reduce waste. 

The most common operations, memory loads, memory stores, and basic arithmetic can be laid out in such a way that they can be performed quickly and easily.

The word &quot;optimization&quot; is likely a misnomer because it is unlikely that the best possible solution will ever be found to the complex problems that arise during microcontroller or microprocessor design. However, there are typically ways to make things better, even if they can't be made optimal.</text>

{{Problem|'''1.''' ''a)'' Look up the composition of air. Estimate its average molecular weight. 

''b)'' Qualitatively describe whether the density of air should be large or small compared to the density of water.

''c)'' Qualitatively describe whether the mass density of air should be large or small compared to that of oxygen if the same number of ''moles'' of the two gasses are contained in identical containers.

''d)'' If the density of air under certain conditions is 1.06 g/m^3, how much does a gallon of air weigh?  }}

{{Problem|'''2.''' ''a)'' Using both of the formulas for average density, calculate estimates for the density of a 50% by mass solution of toluene and benzene. Comment on the results.

''b)'' Repeat this calculation for varying concentrations of toluene. When does it make the most difference which formula you use? When does it make the least? Show the results graphically. Would the trend be the same for any binary solution?

''c)'' Suppose that a 50% mixture of toluene and benzene is to be separated by crystallization. The solution is cooled until one of the components completely freezes and only the other is left as a liquid. The liquid is then removed. What will the majority of the solid be? What will the liquid be? What temperature should be used to achieve this? (give an estimate)

''d)'' In the crystallization process in part c, suppose that the after separation, the solid crystals contained all of the benzene and 1% of the toluene from the original mixture. Suppose also that after melting the solid, the resulting liquid weighed 1435 g. Calculate the mass of the original solution.}}

{{Problem|'''3.'''. Consider a publishing company in which books are to be bound, printed, and shipped. At 5 a.m. every morning, a shipment of 10,000 reams of paper comes in, as well as enough materials to make 150,000 books, and 30000 pounds of ink. In this particular plant, the average size of a book is 250 pages and each uses about 0.2 pounds of ink. 

''a)'' How many books can be printed for each shipment? (Hint: What is the limiting factor?)

''b)'' Suppose that, on average, 4% of all books printed are misprints and must be destroyed. The remaining books are to be distributed to each of 6 continents in the following proportions:

 North America  15%
 South America  10%
 Europe         20%
 Africa         20%
 Asia           25%
 Australia      10%

Each book that is printed (including those that are destroyed) costs the company US$0.50 to print. Those that are shipped cost the following prices to ship from the US:

 North America  $0.05
 South America  $0.08
 Europe         $0.10
 Africa         $0.20
 Asia           $0.12
 Australia      $0.15

If each book sells for an equivalent of US$1.00, what is the maximum profit that the company can make per day? 

''c)'' '''Challenge''' What is the ''minimum'' number of books that the company can sell (from any continent) in order to return a profit? (Hint: what is the total cost of this scheme? Does it matter where the books are sold once they are distributed?)

''d)'' How many pounds of ink per day end up in each continent under the scheme in part b? How many pages of paper?

''e)'' Can you think of any ways you can improve this process? What may be some ways to improve the profit margin? How can inventory be reduced? What are some possible problems with your proposed solutions? }}

[[Image:Black_widow_ventral_1370.jpg|thumb|A Black Widow spider]]

A Black Widow is a shiny black spider. It has an orange or red mark that looks like an hourglass. Its abdomen is shaped like a sphere and has an hourglass mark on the bottom. Often there are just two red marks separated by black. Females sometimes have the hourglass shape on top of the abdomen above the silk-spinning organs (spinnerets). Females are usually about 1-1/2 inches long including their leg span. In areas where grapes grow, females are very small and round. They resemble shiny black or red grapes. 

Male Black Widows are much smaller than females. Their bodies are only about 1/4 inch long. They can be either gray or black. They do not have an hourglass mark, but may have red spots on the abdomen. 

Black widows are sometimes called “comb-footed” spiders. The bristles on their hind legs are used to cover trapped prey with silk.

Young spiders are called “spiderlings”. They shed their outer covering (exoskeleton) as they grow. Spiderlings are orange, brown, or white at first and get darker each time they shed their skin (molt).

== Where does it live? ==
The ''Latrodectus'' genus of Black Widow spiders is found throughout the world, especially where grapes grow. They live in North America, South America, and southern Europe. They are also found in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. 

Their range in the United States is from Massachusetts to Florida, west to Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and California. They are most common in the southern states. 

Western Black Widows (''Latrodectus hesperus'') live in western Canada, the Pacific Northwest of the United States, and Mexico. Southern Black Widows (''Latrodectus mactans'') are found in warm regions of the United States. Northern Black Widows (''Latrodectus variolus'') are found from southeast Canada to north Florida. 

Outdoors they can be found in dark sheltered places such as fallen branches, piles of wood, and rock piles. Sometimes they live in rodent burrows and hollow tree stumps. Other habitats include garages, outhouses, sheds, and basements. 

[[Image:Black_widow_(Latrodectus_mactans).jpg|thumb|200px|left|A Black Widow Spider with the remains of her prey.]]

== What does it eat? ==
Black Widow spiders usually eat small insects such as mosquitoes, grasshoppers, and beetles. They sometimes eat mice, lizards, and snakes caught in the web. 

In hot dry places Black Widows are “specialist” feeders, living on a diet of scorpions. When a Black Widow spider bites, the venom subdues the prey. The prey is bathed with digestive fluids. The softer parts dissolve to a liquid that is sucked into the spider’s stomach. The spider’s pincer-like appendages (chelicerae) can be used to puncture the exoskeleton of hard-bodied insects to get the juices. The shell is discarded afterward. 

To catch prey, black widows build a “tangle” web. There are three distinct levels: supporting threads at the top, tangle threads in the middle, and vertical trap threads at the bottom. The trap threads are beaded with sticky droplets and attached to the ground. The black widow usually hangs upside down near the middle of the web. When a crawling insect breaks the ground attachment, the web lifts it up toward the waiting spider. Before the insect can get loose, the spider bites it and wraps it in silk.

== How does it defend itself? ==
The Black Widow’s red or orange markings warn predators of danger. It is very quick and is able to detect small vibrations made by a predator. If threatened, it escapes down to the ground on a silk safety line. When disturbed, it often pretends to be dead.  

Black Widow venom is poisonous. When fangs enter skin, they remain for several seconds. The venom glands are squeezed to deliver the poison through ducts in the fangs. 


[[Image:Black_Widow_Spider_07-04-20.jpg|thumb|300px|Right|A female black widow guards an egg sac.]]

== What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

The Southern Black Widow typically mates during the spring and summer. The female produces an egg mass containing about 200 eggs. She covers it with silk then shapes it into a sac that protects the eggs. The sac is suspended in a web to keep it away from predators. Eggs take about one month to hatch. Very few of the young spiders survive because they eat each other as soon as they emerge.
 
Spiderlings molt several times before reaching adulthood. Diet and temperature are factors that influence development. It takes 2 to 4 months for females to mature. They live about 1-1/2 years. Males mature in 2 to 4 months and live about 4 months.

== What special behavior does it exhibit? ==

Although its bite is dangerous, a Black Widow spider is usually very timid. It may bite if accidentally pressed against the body. If not guarding eggs, it will attempt to escape rather than bite. 

Females are said to eat males after mating, so are called “Black Widows.” This behavior is called “mate cannibalism”. It has mostly been observed in laboratory cages where males could not escape. It has only occasionally been seen in the wild, where it is easier for males to escape. 

If small bits of prey are hard to digest, they are not eaten. Sometimes they are hung up in the web like trophies.

== How does it affect people? ==
The species ''Latrodectus mactans'' is abundant in California and accounts for about half of the spider bites in the United States. The bite makes a double puncture mark on the skin and is very painful. Female Black Widow venom is very toxic, but a very small amount is injected so people do not usually die. Males reportedly do not bite. 

The syndrome resulting from a Black Widow spider bite is known as “latrodectism”. The painful symptoms are felt throughout the body. Doctors refer to these as “systemic” symptoms. Black widow venom is called “neurotoxic” because it affects the nerves. When nerves do not work, muscles cannot move. The body becomes rigid with severe cramps and paralysis. Sometimes the breathing muscles stop working causing suffocation. 

Many people dislike spiders. In fairy tales, spiders are usually cast as villains. Some people believe they bring bad luck; others believe they bring good luck. Black widows have been helpful in controlling pests, such as imported fire ants and harvester ants. 

Early American frontiersmen were often bitten inside dark outhouses by ''Latrodectus mactans''. The rigid condition of the chest and abdomen caused doctors to misdiagnose the symptoms as perforated appendix. 

In the 1600s people of southern Europe danced and raved after being bitten by the ''Malmignatte'' species of Black Widow. The movement was said to relieve the painful symptoms. Their antics were called the “tarantella” dance, named after the Taranto region of Italy.

{{Shortcut|WB:AGF|WB:FAITH}}

This page explains why you, as a contributor to Wikibooks, should assume good faith, even when the actions of other users seem to cause harm to the project, or seem to have bad intent. It also explains ways that you can counteract bad actions without assuming bad faith.  

To '''assume good faith''' is to believe without proof that others have good intentions. Good faith is acting without malice, or trying to do your best. At Wikibooks good faith also encompasses using tools and capabilities to advance the aims of the project and not to damage the project. The assumption of good faith is a fundamental principle on any publicly-editable wiki, including Wikibooks. We provide the &quot;edit this page&quot; feature to anyone on the Internet because we assume that most people who contribute at Wikibooks are trying to help it, not hurt it. If this assumption was false, then Wikibooks would be destined to fail.

=== Intentions, not actions ===
Assuming good faith is about ''intentions'', not actions.  Those who mean well do sometimes make mistakes; you should correct them when they do. You should not behave as if a mistake was deliberate. Inevitably, you will disagree with some other users on Wikibooks. Even if another user is clearly wrong, that does '''not''' mean that they are trying to wreck the project. Everyone makes mistakes and sometimes a poorly written or poorly considered message can give the impression of bad faith even when there is good faith intent. Assuming good faith does not mean that no action by editors should be criticized, but instead that actions should not be attributed to malice unless there is specific evidence of bad faith.

=== Dealing with bad faith ===
In some cases, bad faith might seem obvious, but it is ''never'' necessary to attribute the actions of an editor to bad faith. All countermeasures can be performed on the basis of ''behavior'' rather than intent. [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] can block problematic users from editing this wiki. All users have the ability to revert pages to earlier versions. However, editors are not required continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Actions inconsistent with good faith include repeated vandalism, confirmed malicious sockpuppetry and lying.

=== Correcting errors ===
In general, when you find an error, correct it instead of reverting all changes. You should use the the &quot;Summary&quot; field (above the &quot;Save page&quot; button) or the user's [[Wikibooks:talk page|talk page]] to explain. This helps reduce misunderstandings and avoid escalation of conflicts. If a user makes the same error repeatedly, discuss the errors on an appropriate talk page. 

Despite this, sometimes it is appropriate to simply revert changes; however, you should generally make an effort to explain reverts unless they are used to repair outright vandalism.

=== Outright vandalism is NOT good faith! ===
Sometimes it is necessary to not assume good faith.  For outright vandalism, for instance, it is obvious that this is not good faith editing, and you should not waste time trying to see if it really was good faith and was just an error, because the fact of the matter is, it ''isn't!''

Examples of outright vandalism include the blanking of pages and the deletion of whole paragraphs of content without good reason.  Addition of inappropriate words, phrases, or comments, or the addition of uninformative or useless material, is also outright vandalism and should be reverted on sight.

If you see outright vandalism, '''''immediately revert it, warn the user, report them, and, if necessary, block them!'''''

=== Not a shield for bad behavior ===
This policy is not a shield for you to ignore your own bad actions. Instead of telling other users to &quot;assume good faith&quot; when they claim that you cause problems, you should also assume that those other users are trying in good faith to help you.

{{problem|'''1.''' Perform the following conversions, using the appropriate number of significant figures in your answer:

''a)'' &lt;math&gt; 1.5 \frac{g}{s} \rightarrow \frac{lb}{hr} &lt;/math&gt;

''b)'' &lt;math&gt; 4.5 * 10^2 \mbox{ W} \rightarrow \frac{btu}{min} &lt;/math&gt;

''c)'' &lt;math&gt; 34 \frac{\mu g}{\mu m^3} \rightarrow \frac{oz}{in^3} &lt;/math&gt;

''d)'' &lt;math&gt; 4.18 \frac{J}{g*oC} \rightarrow \frac{kWh}{lb*oF} &lt;/math&gt; (note: kWh means kilowatt-hour)

''e)'' &lt;math&gt; 1.00 \mbox{ m}^3 \rightarrow L \rightarrow dm^3 \rightarrow mL \rightarrow cm^3 &lt;/math&gt;}}

{{problem|'''2.''' Perform a dimensional analysis on the following equations to determine if they are reasonable:

''a)'' &lt;math&gt; v = dt &lt;/math&gt;, where v is velocity, d is distance, and t is time.

''b)'' &lt;math&gt; F = \frac{m*v^2}{r} &lt;/math&gt; where F is force, m is mass, v is velocity, and r is radius (a distance).

''c)'' &lt;math&gt; F_{bouy} = \rho*V*g &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is density, V is volume, and g is gravitational acceleration.

''d)'' &lt;math&gt; \dot{m} = \frac{\dot{V}}{\rho} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \dot{m} &lt;/math&gt; is mass flow rate, &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} &lt;/math&gt; is volumetric flow rate, and &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is density.}}

{{problem|'''3.''' Recall that the ideal gas law is &lt;math&gt; PV=nRT &lt;/math&gt; where P is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles, R is a constant, and T is the temperature.

''a)'' What are the units of R in terms of the base unit types (length, time, mass, and temperature)?

''b)'' Show how these two values of R are equivalent: &lt;math&gt; R=0.0821\frac{L*atm}{mol*K} = 8.31\frac{J}{mol*K} &lt;/math&gt;

''c)'' If an ideal gas exists in a closed container with a molar density of &lt;math&gt; 0.03 \frac{mol}{L} &lt;/math&gt; at a pressure of &lt;math&gt; 0.96*10^5\mbox{ Pa} &lt;/math&gt;, what temperature is the container held at?

''d)'' What is the molar concentration of an ideal gas with a partial pressure of &lt;math&gt; 4.5*10^5\mbox{ Pa} &lt;/math&gt; if the total pressure in the container is &lt;math&gt; 6\mbox{ atm} &lt;/math&gt;?

''e)'' At what temperatures and pressures is a gas most and least likely to be ideal? (hint: you can't use it when you have a liquid)

''f)'' Suppose you want to mix ideal gasses in two separate tanks together. The first tank is held at a pressure of 500 Torr and contains 50 moles of water vapor and 30 moles of water at 70oC. The second is held at 400 Torr and 70oC. The volume of the second tank is the same as that of the first, and the ratio of moles water vapor to moles of water is the same in both tanks.

You recombine the gasses into a single tank the same size as the first two. Assuming that the temperature remains constant, what is the pressure in the final tank? If the tank can withstand 1 atm pressure, will it blow up?}}

{{problem|'''4.''' Consider the reaction &lt;math&gt; H_2O_2 &lt;-&gt; H_2O + \frac{1}{2} O_2 &lt;/math&gt;, which is carried out by many organisms as a way to eliminate hydrogen peroxide.

''a)''. What is the standard enthalpy of this reaction? Under what conditions does it hold?

''b)''. What is the standard Gibbs energy change of this reaction? Under what conditions does it hold? In what direction is the reaction spontaneous at standard conditions?

''c)''. What is the Gibbs energy change at biological conditions (1 atm and 37oC) if the initial hydrogen peroxide concentration is 0.01M? Assume oxygen is the only gas present in the cell.

''d)''. What is the equilibrium constant under the conditions in part c? Under the conditions in part b)? What is the constant independent of?

''e)''. Repeat parts a through d for the alternative reaction &lt;math&gt; H_2O_2 \rightarrow H_2 + O_2 &lt;/math&gt;. Why isn't this reaction used instead? }}

{{problem|'''5.''' Two ideal gasses A and B combine to form a third ideal gas, C, in the reaction &lt;math&gt; A + B \rightarrow C &lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that the reaction is irreversible and occurs at a constant temperature of 25oC in a 5L container. If you start with 0.2 moles of A and 0.5 moles of B at a total pressure of 1.04 atm, what will the pressure be when the reaction is completed? }}

{{problem|'''6.''' How much heat is released when 45 grams of methane are burned in excess air under standard conditions? How about when the same mass of glucose is burned? What is one possible reason why most heterotrophic organisms use glucose instead of methane as a fuel? Assume that the combustion is complete, i.e. no carbon monoxide is formed.}}

{{problem|'''7.''' Suppose that you have carbon monoxide and water in a tank in a 1.5:1 ratio.

''a)'' In the literature, find the reaction that these two compounds undergo (hint: look for the ''water gas shift'' reaction). Why is it an important reaction?

''b)'' Using a table of Gibbs energies of formation, calculate the equilibrium constant for the reaction.

''c)'' How much hydrogen can be produced from this initial mixture?

''d)'' What are some ways in which the yield of hydrogen can be increased? (hint: recall Le Chatlier's principle for equilibrium).

''e)'' What factors do you think may influence how long it takes for the reaction to reach equilibrium? }}

Problem 8. A bio-fuel plant converts the sugars (glucose) in corn into ethanol and carbon dioxide in a process called fermentation. The plant produces 100 gpm (gallons per minute) of ethanol and can produce of 2.5 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn. Jimmy farms a total of 2000 acres, 75% of which are corn. He sells 80% of his corn supply to the bio-fuel plant for $4.00/bushel. (Hint: 120 bushels = 1 acre)

a) How long can the plant run with the supply of corn from Jimmy? (hours)

b) How much money did Jimmy make for his corn?

=== Schematics ===

If you have a certain Linux distro or Mac OS X, I found a GNU General Public licensed schematic editor at http://www.geda.seul.org/download.html . (Check out [[w:Schematic]], [[w:Circuit diagram]] and the &quot;see also&quot; and &quot;external links&quot; sections.) I unfortunately do not have access to a Linux or Mac machine with install permissions. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 22:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
:Thanks, that's excellent! Downloading now - it should make the job easier than doing it in either Visio or Inkscape. But it ''really'' means a determined effort to avoid paid work, because I'll need to reboot - so it probably won't happen until later in the week. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:56, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Freeware%2FCreation&amp;diff=701339&amp;oldid=661375 Twenty or so edits spanning more than a month. While it would be relatively easy (though tedious) to replace them all, and while these images may not even be appropriate (arguments for fair use would be weak IMO), think of every other page that has been removed. I'm beginning to think that the only we can restore all these images is by setting up an off-wiki Wikibooks clone and doing some massive SQL query to try to find diffs matching certain criteria. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 05:04, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

'''Addendum''': what's worse is this glaringly obvious replacement at Wikimedia Commons: [[:Commons:Image:Audacity.png]]. I'm going through that and restoring '''all''' the images. Who knows what else could have been easily replaced. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 05:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
:Yeah, I saw that when I was doing some diffs back in December. I wasn't calm enough at the time to do anything about it, though - except whine in the staff lounge. The glaringly obvious replacement thing is the bit that ''really'' gets me - how bloody hard is it to ''check'' on Commons before ripping out all links to an image? Adminocracy gone mad.
:I too thought about the off-site SQL query. How hard would it be to set that up? It would mean having access to quite a lot of data, including the diffs and the deletion logs. This is why I was whinging so hard about it in the staff lounge - the more damage that is done, the harder the job of fixing it. And you can bet that the culprits will shy away from helping fix it, claiming that it is the job of the original uploaders to sort out the file licensing. Argh! I need more cider. Or mead. Fsck, maybe some of both. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:14, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== Charlemagne ==

G'day down under. Many congrats on your cricket team. Ours was cr1p !!

Anyway, you made some constructive comments on my Beef recipe recently which I am pleased got some plaudits from others for it's handling.

If you want a good laugh (or cry!) on the discussion and handling of a WIkipedia article take a look here.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Charlemagne

Will there ever come a time when Wikipedia heirarchy decide maybe a subtle change in direction is needed ? This sort of thing cannot be good for the overall image!! An interminable rant from people, the content of which is longer than the original, and very excellent, article !

All the best

Peter

:Crikey! Looks like there's a few people who really need to [[w:WP:TEA]]!!! But I do think that, on the whole, Wikipedia and its associated projects do rather well, considering the inability of most people to collaborate properly and with civility. I think the one main thing wrong with its model is the ability of anonymous users (not logged in) to edit pages; there should be a mandatory login requirement, with a moderation period, as this would stop a lot of the vandalism that goes on. Otherwise, I'm quite impressed with the system, just not the throngs that come to it often ;-) cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:08, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

== Copyvio ==

Not at full strength but looked at this today [[Cookbook:Pad Kaprow Kai]] and got a 404 on the link?  Happy to deal with it but could you check it out - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:07, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
:G'day mate, the page had been renamed. I've just updated the link. The reason I tagged it {{tl|copyvio}} was that there is a statement at the bottom of the Wikibooks recipe claiming that permission has been granted to copy this recipe from the website listed. Where is the proof of this permission? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:34, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

== So ==

You are a big fan of JET then!  I learnt something, didn't realise it was the base of Access (I used to do a bit with Paradox many years ago!) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:55, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
:No, I hate the thing! I frequently tell clients that I know nothing about it, and suggest other people who might. I've had to cross swords with JET many a time, though, and every time I have to hunt for some documentation on it, so I figured it was time that I collated all the info I could find in one place. Maybe it'll help some other poor bugger too! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:05, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

== .js &amp; redirects ==

Info only - just added a bit of .js (my monobook) which checks links on a page and highlights redirects.  Might be useful in cleaning/checking? (think you use FF?).

:Ta, will check it out. Problem is that many of the links in Cookbook are redirects, and often legitimately so - like the redirects to [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Cookbook:Coconut|Cookbook:Coconut]], which might one day break out into separate pages.

== Image-related news ==

♫ Oh Webaware, I have news for you... I talked to Whiteknight on IRC about adopting [[w:Template:GFDL-presumed]] for untagged images uploaded before 20060101. He was symphathetic to the idea. I have not yet imported the template to Wikibooks, but I will sometime this weekend. I wish we had a tag-a-bot (maybe we do, I'll have to find out). Then we could have significantly less work (i.e. all the FHSST and Japanese images). Granted, I'd like to replace them all at some point, but making derivative works of some of them does not absolve us of possible legal issues (particularly the FHSST images) (nor does the template I suppose :(). Anyways, thought I'd let to know ♫ [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:52, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
:G'day mate, that would indeed help out a great deal! There is a bunch of images that explicitly state, or just obviously are, self-made. Like these bloody little circuit diagrams I'm currently toying with. I agree about the derivative images not absolving us of legal problems, ''if'' the images were non-trivial anyway (unlike these bloody little circuit diagrams). Anyway, that's great news, and I hope it gets through. 
:I've always maintained that the problem with most of these images is one of appropriate licensing, not that they're illegal copies or otherwise bad. It would be nice to be able to tag old, self-made or trivial images uploaded in good faith so that they don't have to be ripped out, just because the administrative stuff wasn't being properly dealt with back then.

'''Building a better (procedural) eyeball!'''&lt;br/&gt;
Originally created by Jon McKay (Ammusionist) and posted on blenderartists.org/forum&lt;br/&gt; [http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=85722&amp;highlight=eyeball]
The end result of this tutorial is an eyeball that fulfills the following requirements:
# Single mesh
#* I wanted to be able to append a single object into any project.
# Procedural Textures
#* I didn't want to have to rely on image maps that could get lost.
# Versatile
#* One single model to be used for any type of character, be it human, alien or whatever.
# Easy
#* Any effects needed to be quickly accessible. I don't want to be wasting time faffing around with colour-band settings at the texture level
# Impressive
#* This sucker needs to look good any way it goes.
# One other thing I really wanted was the iris musculature to follow the pupil dilation!

[Total Noob] I found this tutorial both informative and useful. It's best to download the PDF version with the screen shots if you want to get as much info out of it as I did, and in fact, understand all that's going on in the Tute

New Link (08th Nov '11): [http://www.aurellem.com/aurellem/Eyeball_Tutorial.pdf Here] is the full tutorial as a pdf file. 9 pages of screenshots and extremely detailed instructions. (1.2mb)

(Noob note: In my blender 2.49, I had to unclick the 'Traceable' setting on the cornea of my eye when following the PDF tutorial, else I ended up with a giant black 'olive', this does not appear to affect ray mirroring, and corrects my problem.)


==Creating the Mesh==


[noob note1] Maybe worth to look at this link instead...
[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212212623/http://web.pdx.edu/~wlf/tut.html http://web.pdx.edu/~wlf/tut.html]



Note: You might want to check out this video first: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKmHUZroaBA&lt;br&gt;
The objective here is to make a great looking eyeball.  That means it may not be anatomically perfect, but there are some things we need to take into account:
The eye should consist of a white (white bit with veins); an iris (coloured bit); a pupil (black but in the centre of the iris) and a cornea (clear bit surrounding the whole eye).  These may not be absolutely correct, but these are how I'm referring to the pieces of the eye.
* Start with a ball: Go to a front view (Keypad-1) and create a UV sphere.  24 Rings and segments should be sufficient.  It'll give us plenty of smoothness and enough verts to work with when we create shapes. 
  NOOB NOTE: If you want the eye to point toward you, you may have to rotate it 90 degrees. Go to side view [num3], click Rkey and rotate while pressing the control key. Return to front view.
 (Noob Note #2: If you, like most people, want the eyeball's iris and pupil to point towards the front, but don't want to change views, press the RKEY, then XKEY to   restrict rotation to the X-AXIS, then, while holding CTRLKEY, rotate the sphere by 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.)
* This sphere will become the coloured parts of the eye, but we also need a second sphere for the cornea.  Use the Z key to switch to a wireframe view (if you're not already there). Hit the A key a couple of times to ensure all points are selected then Shift-D to duplicate the sphere.
 (Mast3rlinkx's addition: I started the other tutorial, Realistic Eyes in Blender, but it's incomplete. I thought I could use the base mesh of that tutorial here for a more realistic look, and a less confusing mesh. I used this shape for the cornea.)
* Press S-Key to scale and scale the second sphere to slightly larger than the first. (Hint: Hold shift while scaling for fine adjustment) or you could also enter a value, 1.01. 
* Now that we have a nice confusing mesh, we're going to make our life easier.  We're going to hide the outer bit for the moment.  Hit the &quot;H&quot; key.
* Don't panic like I did the first time I accidentally hit H, you can bring it all back with Alt-H. (Note: In blender Alt + some key often reverses the effect of pressing the key in the first place!)
* OK Now to create the basic mesh for the inner part.  Basically, we need to make a concave iris/pupil section.
* Switch to a side view and use the Border Select (B-Key) to select the first four rings and the tip.  Now we're going to flatten these. Press &quot;S&quot; for scale &quot;Y&quot; for Y axis only and &quot;number 0&quot; for scale-to zero. (Mast3rlinkx says: If you do this, your poor eyeball will have a pinched appearance where the pupil and iris should be. What you ''should'' do is hit S, then Z, then 0. Then drag along the Z-Axis so the flattened area is flush with the curve of the sphere.) (Noob Note: The axis you need to use will change depending on the way you aligned your eye. If you want the front to point along the Y-axis, scale Y to 0; otherwise, scale Z to 0.)
* Now grab the flattened verts with the &quot;G&quot; key and press Y so that it goes the right way, and drag it a little into the eyeball. [noob note: you can also select two opposite vertices in the fourth ring before scaling along the Z axis, and press CTRL + S to snap the 3D cursor to the center of the fourth ring. Then set the pivot point to 3D cursor.]
* Now for the cornea.  It's not perfectly spherical; it bulges slightly at the front. We're going to use the Proportional Editing tool.
* First, we need to un-hide the cornea. Hit Alt-H
* Usually you would use the O-Key, but this little menu item allows you to activate proportional editing for Connected vertices.
* Once activated, you can select the type of falloff from the 3D header bar.  Select “Root Falloff” (Mast3rlinkx's Second Addition: Instead of root falloff, which looked less realistic than it could have, I used Sphere Falloff and got a more realistic look. That's just my opinion, being someone who points out the anatomically incorrect portions of a cartoon character's appearance.)
* Press A-Key a couple of times again to make sure no points are selected, switch to a side view (Keypad-3) and right click just to the left of the front-most point.  We just want to select that one vertex.
* Now comes some fun.  We want to drag that point away from the eye in the y axis, so press “G” for grab and “Y” for Y axis.  As you move the vertex, you'll see a circle that defines the influence of the proportional editing. Adjust it so it is about ¼ the height of the whole eye and drag it out until it looks right. 
* To clean the model up, we're going to apply a subsurface and apply some smoothing.  Go to the editing buttons and find the modifier panel.
* Add a subsurface modifier and set both level and render level to 2.
* Now hit Tab to switch to Object mode and hit the &quot;Set Smooth&quot; button in the Link and Materials panel.
* Now would be a good time to save your work before we go on to textures.

==Adding the Textures==
&lt;!--The next few sections were empty can someone fill them back in please?--&gt;
You're going to need multiple materials on this mesh. It's possible to apply materials to selected faces.

* First, switch to editing mode and change the select mode to Face select. (Oh, and switch off proportional editing if it's still on from the last section)

* Press A a couple of times to ensure nothing is selected.

* Press Z to switch off wireframe; this will be easier without it.

* Place the mouse pointer in the centre of one of the faces on the outside layer of the eye and press “L” to select linked faces. If you get a message saying “Nothing Indicated” try positioning the pointer on a different face and try again.

* Once the cornea section is selected, in the “Links and Materials” panel of the editing buttons, click “New”. The counter above it will change to “1 Mat 1” best read as material 1 of 1. Click “Assign” to assign the cornea faces to material 1.

* Hide the cornea faces (H-Key). We'll assign the rest from the outside in. If a face is already assigned to a material and it is assigned to another, it just switches place. Therefore, it's easiest next to assign all the visible faces.

* Press A to select all and, as above, click “New” then click “Assign”.

* Now for the iris and pupil. Hit A to deselect all.

* Switch to a front view and zoom in. Hit “B” twice to enable paint select and select the central faces plus one ring out. You can control the size of the selector by rotating your mouse wheel.

* Again, create a “New” material index and “Assign” the pupil faces to it.

* Finally, click A to deselect all and use paint select again to select the remaining faces on the iris. Assign them to a new material.

* Now we're ready to make the materials. Switch to object mode (Tab). Change to the object editing buttons and in the Draw panel, locate the “Transp” control. Set this on. This means as we go we'll be able to see through the cornea.

===Cornea Material===

We'll start with the simplest texture first. The cornea is basically just colourless and transparent. Note that we're using Z-Transparency instead of Ray Trans. This is because some lighting conditions make the eye under the cornea difficult to see. (NOTE: Until I get the images uploaded, you should refer to the pdf version for the settings. Meanwhile, here is how I see them:

Go to the shading buttons (F5)

Under the Links and Pipeline tab, ZTransp is clicked along with Radio and Tracable.

Under the Material tab, col is white and alpha is 0.1 .
 
Under the Shaders tab, CookTor Spec is 1.674 and Hardness is 333.  ('''Noob Note''':  I could be wrong, but in Blender 2.63 it appears you need to set the Shading-&gt;Emit to 1.67 and Specular-&gt;Hardness to 333.)

Under the Mirror Transp tab, Ray Mirror is clicked, RayMir is 0.4, Depth is 3 --[[User:Bonapon|Bonapon]] ([[User talk:Bonapon|talk]]) 14:31, 6 October 2009 (UTC))

(Noob note: In my blender 2.49, I had to unclick the 'Traceable' setting on the cornea of my eye when following the PDF tutorial, else I ended up with a giant black 'olive', this does not appear to affect ray mirroring, and corrects my problem.)

===White Material===

The white of the eye's a little trickier. The material here includes some red veins that can be seen at the side of the eye, but not from the front. This can be done with two textures, but there's a cheat we can use.

First, the veins:

Switch to Material Index 2 (In the Links and Materials panel, click the right arrow so it reads “4 Mat 2” or Material 2 of 4).

Click the cross or X next to the material name and add a new material.

Go to the texture buttons:

Using a marble texture, copy these settings. 

(Here are the settings that I see 

Under the Colors tab:

Cur: 0: Pos=0; R=1, G=0.617, B=0.629; A=1; 

Cur: 1: Pos=0.340; R=1, G=1, B=1; A=0; 

Under the Marble tab:

Sharper, Soft noise and Sin are clicked;

NoiseSize=0.634; NoiseDepth=5; Turbulence=26.04;

--[[User:Bonapon|Bonapon]] ([[User talk:Bonapon|talk]]) 15:25, 6 October 2009 (UTC))

The two colour band items are shown here separately. This makes a nice marble texture that will evenly cover the eyeball. So how to hide it from the front of the ball? Another colour band trick, but this time in the material itself.

Here they are in all their glory. 

(As I see them:

Under the material tab, Col is white and alpha is 1;

Under the Ramps tab: 

Cur: 0: Pos=0.690; R=1, G=1, B=1; A=0; Input is Shader; (These settings are not shown in the pdf so I have extrapolated. Please correct if wrong.)

Cur: 1: Pos=0..690; R=1, G=1, B=1; A=1; Input is Normal;

--[[User:Bonapon|Bonapon]] ([[User talk:Bonapon|talk]]) 15:43, 6 October 2009 (UTC))

The colour band items are both white with one alpha 0.0 and one alpha 1.0. As you can see they are very close together to give a fairly clear line that the veins will stop at. The input setting for the band is set to “Normal” this means the left hand side of the band refers to faces that are parallel to the camera view and the right is faces that are facing directly towards the camera.

I've also added a bit of mirroring so that we get a little scenery reflected!

There's also some colour band fun to be had with the pupil material.

===Pupil Material===
I wanted a nice black texture, but I also wanted to get a red-eye effect if a light is shone directly at it from behind the camera. Why? I guess just because I can, and now so can you!

As before move to the next material index and create a new material.

There's no textures in this one. It's basically black and a little reflective with a nice hard specular.

(In the materials button (F5):

Under the Links and Pipeline tab, Ztransp, Radio, Tracable and Shadbuff are clicked;

Under the Material tab, Col is Black, presumably with an alpha of 1, while Spe is white with an alpha of 0.6;

Under the Shaders tab, CookTor spec is 0.594, Hard is 294;

Under the Mirror Transp tab, Ray Mirror is clicked, RayMir is 0.3;

--[[User:Bonapon|Bonapon]] ([[User talk:Bonapon|talk]]) 18:14, 6 October 2009 (UTC))

Have a good look at the colour band settings though!

Position 1 is black with an alpha of 0 and positioned at 0.97. Trust me on this setting, it took a while to get it right!

(Under the Ramps tab:

Cur=0; Pos=0.970; R=0, G=0, B=0, A=0; --[[User:Bonapon|Bonapon]] ([[User talk:Bonapon|talk]]) 18:22, 6 October 2009 (UTC))

The second is all the way across at position 1 and is fully red (with no blue or green) and alpha 1. We want the red-eye to respond to light not angle like the white of the eye, so set the colour band input to “Shader”.

(Cur=1; Pos=1; R=1, G=0, B=0, A=1 (The alpha of the second position is not shown in the pdf) ; --[[User:Bonapon|Bonapon]] ([[User talk:Bonapon|talk]]) 18:22, 6 October 2009 (UTC))

Now the bit you've all been waiting for – the iris!

===Iris UV Map===
Save your work and grab a cup of coffee for this part. It's a little involved.

We need the texture to stay glued to the mesh irrespective of the shape of the mesh. This gives the effect of the muscles in the iris expanding and contracting. In a nutshell, we're going to UV map a procedural texture to a single part of the mesh.

OK, here we go. Switch to a material editing window. You'll need to be able to see both a 3D window and an image window. It wouldn't hurt to see a buttons panel as well. My material screen kind of looks like this.

('''Noob Note:''' ''To clarify: an &quot;Image Editor&quot; window option is in the '''''Select Window Type''''' drop down button situated at the very left of the header next to the '''''View''''' drop down.  Select ''''UV/Image Editor'''''. To achieve the screen the author describes, first split your view.  Then select a front ortho view with '''''NUM1''''' in the right window.  In the left select '''''UV/Image Editor''''' from the '''''Select Window Type''''' button as described.'')--[[User:WithAlligators|WithAlligators]] ([[User talk:WithAlligators|talk]]) 05:59, 24 February 2010 (UTC) (Blender 2.49b) 

Make sure the window is displaying a front view (Keypad-1) this will be important when we unwrap the bit we're going to use.

Change the 3D window to mesh editing / face select and use the brush select (B-Key twice) to select the iris faces.

Now change to UV Face Select mode. The faces should remain selected. (As of Blender 2.46 the UV Face Select mode no longer exists. It's been merged with Edit mode. All you have to do is select all the vertices/faces/edges in Edit mode and press the U-key.)

With the cursor in the 3D window, press “U-Key” for unwrap and select “Project from View”. The image window should now contain a nice even circle of dots. Put the cursor in the image window and press “A” to select all the points. Scale and move them until they fit nicely in the
outer square of the image grid. Now select each ring in turn using brush select, starting from the innermost, and scale them until they cover from the
centre to the outside of the image grid as shown.

Now we've got a map, lets get a texture. Switch back to a modelling screen and change to object mode for the next part.

===Iris Material===

Firstly, a texture to control the colour blend across the iris. Generally it starts on the outer edge dark and gets lighter as it moves to the centre. Sounds like a job for the blend texture.

The texture itself is fairly straight forward, but again, the colour band is where the magic happens.

I've pictured all three stops in the colour band. Note the alpha values. This blend texture is meant to tint the iris texture so it's lighter in the centre and darker in the outside. ('''Note''': I will have to create my own screen prints as I don't know if the original author has uploaded images or if they are copyrighted. For this to happen, I will first have to complete the tutorial myself.--[[User:Bonapon|Bonapon]] ([[User talk:Bonapon|talk]]) 20:34, 8 October 2009 (UTC))

Now for that iris texture:

I stumbled over this texture almost by accident when I was working on a different project. Copy the settings as they appear here.

Note: the colour band points are black with alpha 0 and white with alpha 1. This allows the material colour to come through the texture, so we can set the main eye colour in the material buttons.

The main colour is blue which sets the colour of the iris. The centre colour comes from the texture settings:

The blend texture is applied to the UV map input. The green colour is used as a lighten mix to tint the iris near the centre. Using the Stencil option allows the other texture to show through.

The iris texture is applied to UV again and some normal as well as colour is applied. This makes some small shadows in the iris when the light is from the side. Add some lights and have a look at your eyeball so far.

==Pupil Dialation==

We're going to use shape keys to create the pupil effects.

We're going to create a normal eye and a cat's eye. Fortunately, the fully dilated eye is the same in both cases so that's going to be our shape key basis.

Go to the edit buttons and select the Shape Key panel.

Make sure “Relative” is selected and click “Add Shape Key” to create the base shape.

Switch to edit mode, point selection. Select just the first loop in of the iris. To select an edge loop in point mode, place the cursor on a line between two points that's on the loop and Alt-Right Click. Shift + Alt-RClick will add the selected loop to what's already selected.

Now scale this to just inside the width of the loop that the iris shares with the white..

Now do the same with each of the other two loops. This should produce a nice dilated
pupil.

Hint: If you scale the inner loop out, but the edge of the colour doesn't follow it exactly, drop it and hit Shift-E, then move the pointer to the right. This causes the subsurfaced mesh to closer follow the selected edge.

Now to create the normal (human) pupil shape. Switch to object mode (Tab) and add a new shape key. Name it “Normal Pupil Contract”

Now grab the edge loop between the pupil and the iris. Scale is down so it's just a little bigger than the loop in the pupil. Select all the points in the pupil as well now and scale them all very small.

Now select the next loop out and scale it down, followed by the final edge loop. It should look like this.

Now switch back to object mode and try the shape key slider out. Pretty neat huh?

Let's make a cat's eye now. Switch shape keys back to “Basis” and add a new shape key called ”Cat Pupil”.

Use the same method as before to scale the edge loops. As you scale, restrict your scaling to the X axis (That is “S” then “X”). You should end up with a shape key like this:

That's pretty much it. Try some other things like rotating iris edge loops in the shape keys for spiral eyes, or weird shapes for the contracted pupil.

Don't forget to save – and enjoy!

(noob note: when switching between sliders, the previous one must be reset, or their effects will combine in weird and unfathomable ways)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Why Use Flash?''' This is a question that seems to be of some debate. In the old days (meaning a few years ago) Flash intros were large and seemed to take a lifetime to load. However because of Flash's continued development and drive to get better, we can now see many facets of the internet that would benefit from the use of Flash.

== Browser compatibility ==
Flash allows many viewers to span the incompatibility of browsers across the net. This means that as a web developer we don’t have to be as worried about what our designs are going to look like on another machine. This is a huge advantage. Flash also has a very friendly layout that allows a novice to easily create an animated cartoon or flash intro. While the most effective and cool things you can do with flash aren’t unlocked until you can write some Action Script, a basic user can still make great projects.

== File size ==
As with previous versions of Flash, a web developer can take advantage of the small file size of a Flash program. Flash really allows a lot of information to be packed down into a very tiny file size. This is important because most users are still on dial up connections.

== ActionScript ==
When a web developer learns or uses ActionScript to unlock all the secrets of Flash, a website really grows into an interactive experience. For example with Action Script the programmer can activate a menu that changes dynamically when certain criteria is selected, they can load a new animation because a hidden link was pressed, one could even have content loaded into a window that’s size changed dynamically based on its content. &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://www.sketch.uk.com/ Check this out to see what I mean]&lt;/span&gt;. Another great use of Flash is for portfolio sites, with Flash a company can get more information across to the viewer than they would be able to if they were use another web format. &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://www.wddg.com/ Follow this link to see an example of what I am taking about]&lt;/span&gt;.

== Layout ==
Another thing that makes Flash great for the web is that you are not restricted to a grid system that is fairly confining, you are free to make animated splash pages as well as free flowing documents that break the grid system without a whole lot of tinkering around to make it look like you have broken the grid.  

== Animation ==
Animation in Flash is a beautiful thing when done properly, you have the usage of key frames and in betweens that can easily move objects from one point to another, with action scripting you can create cameras to zoom in and out.  With the usage of symbols you can create complex characters with a wide range of movements and either with tweens or key frames move the symbol from one point to another in a very fluid and lifelike way.  The usage of Flash is cutting the costs of animation in studios; Flash on the average costs about 1/10th the price of traditional animation to produce thanks to the libraries that can be set up.  All you have to do is create the characters and objects once and then anyone can use them, with minimal need to redraw the actual characters.

== Animation TV shows ==
Animation studios are starting to realize this and there are many cartoons being produced today that are making use of Flash.  More than just web toons are being created; many cartoons on TV are using Flash to create their episodes.  Shows such as [[w:Harvey Birdman|Harvey Birdman]], [[w:Frisky Dingo|Frisky Dingo]], [[w:Chaotic|Chaotic]], [[w:Shuriken School|Shuriken School]], [[w:Yin Yang Yo|Yin Yang Yo]], [[w:El Tigre|El Tigre]], [[w:Mucha Lucha|Mucha Lucha]], and [[w:Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi|Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi]], are all created using Flash.

== Teaching Ideas ==

Games For Teacher to play with students to teach counting.

Counting is a fundamental skill everyone must know to survive.  Counting will help at market, in farming, and much more.  Counting can be fun also.  For small children one can amass beads, buttons, pebbles, sticks, card board pieces, etc...  and use them as game pieces.  Try to get twenty at least of the same kind.  As you play with the child count up the pebbles (let's say) and add one each time you count.  After you add one, start all over.  Then have the child do the same.  Make it fun and pleasant by talking nicely and not getting angry or frustrated.  They will catch on if shown enough.

If one has enough supplies the pebbles could be painted, the card board pieces drawn on, the buttons strung on a string, the beads strung as well...this will use the kinetic learning (doing) that young children love.

Another possibility is the &quot;Which one is more game?&quot;  Using the same counters, divide them amongst two or three children unevenly.  The children will notice one has more.  Encourage the children to count the pieces and discuss who has more, how much they have, how much more is that than them...  Children can notice much this way and will learn quickly.

For children to practice, they could write the numbers on slates.  Slates are inexpensive and fun.  Plus if a child messes up, no erasers used, or paper to replace.  The workbook pages could be used as &quot;tests&quot; to show mom and dad how well the child is progressing.  I don't recommend dry-erase boards, which are so popular in American Schools, as the chemicals can irritate little ones lungs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To create a viewable flash movie for viewers see, it's best to first go into the '''Publish Settings''' option under '''File&gt;Publish Settings''' to check and ensure the options checked are the ones you want.  Here are options to rename the SWF and HTML files that are going to be created, as well as other options that will enable the author to customize the settings further.

As options are checked on the Formats tab, new tabs are added alongside it. For example, if the Flash (.swf) option has been checked, a tab that reads '''Flash''' will appear.  This tab when enabled then allows for alterations to the publish settings. Whether to allow the SWF to be viewable for older versions of flash player or whether to add a password for access, these options are listed here.

Bobotie is a bit like a [[Cookbook:Shepherd's Pie|shepherd's pie]].

==Procedure==

# Slow cook [[Cookbook:Ground Beef|minced beef]] with curry powder and lots of spices, such as turmeric, coriander, cloves, cumin and [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay]]. 
# Dried fruit (for example apricots and sultanas) and almonds are optional extras and give the bobotie a wonderful sweet and sour flavour. 
# The mince mixture is placed in a bowl, topped with an egg [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]] and baked in the oven until the custard browns. 

Bobotie is almost always served with yellow rice (rice cooked with turmeric, raisins and cloves) and accompanied with a fruit chutney.</text>

Biltong, is derived from the Dutch settlers tassal meat. Strips of meat are rubbed with salt, pepper and coriander seeds, covered with vinegar and hung up to dry. The Voortrekkers considered this a delicacy and used venison, beef and ostrich meat. Now days you can get it in many varieties and flavours, chilli being a favourite amongst South Africans.</text>

Konfyt  - refers to Malay-style fruit preserves. The fruit is soaked in slaked lime water overnight to tenderise the inside of the fruit and retain the firmness of the skin. After gentle steaming, the fruit is boiled in a syrup of water, sugar and lemon juice; then transferred to a sterilized glass jar which is topped up with the remaining syrup. Green fig preserve, with a hint of cinnamon, is outstanding and a perfect accompaniment to cheeses.</text>

Frikadelle, are the South African version of meatballs.
Made of ground beef, ostrich, lamb, fish, pork, or veal, onions, eggs, salt and pepper, these are formed into balls and flattened somewhat. They are then pan-fried in butter, margarine or even vegetable oil.</text>

'''Snoek''' are elongated, somewhat compressed [[cookbook:fish|fish]] that has a predominantly silver body colour. Snoek is related to the [[cookbook:barracuda|barracuda]] family. They reach a maximum length of 1.5m and approximately 9kg in weight. They have large jaws and ferocious teeth. The body is covered in small scales. Snoek, a local delicacy, is enjoyed fresh, [[cookbook:smoking|smoked]] or dried.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Heart==

[[Image:Heart-and-lungs.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The heart and lungs, from an older edition of '' Gray's Anatomy''.]]

The '''heart''' is a  pear shaped, muscular organ in vertebrates, responsible for pumping blood through the blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kmle.com/search.php?Search=heart | title = ''KMLE Medical Dictionary Definition of heart'' | author = [http://www.kmle.com The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''cardiac'' (as in cardiology) means &quot;related to the heart&quot; and comes from the Greek. The heart is composed of cardiac muscle, an involuntary muscle tissue which is found only within this organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kmle.com/search.php?Search=cardiac | title = ''KMLE Medical Dictionary Definition of cardiac'' | author = [http://www.kmle.com The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===  	 


In the human body, the heart is normally situated to the left of the middle of the thorax, underneath the breastbone (see [http://www.easyrashi.com/TEFILLIN/Position_of_heart.htm diagrams]). The heart is usually felt to be on the left side because the left heart (left ventricle) is stronger (it pumps to all body parts). The left lung is smaller than the right lung because the heart occupies more of the left hemithorax. The heart is enclosed by a sac known as the pericardium and is surrounded by the lungs. The pericardium is a double membrane structure containing a serous fluid to reduce friction during heart contractions. The mediastinum, a subdivision of the thoracic cavity, is the name of the heart cavity. 

The ''apex'' is the blunt point situated in an inferior (pointing down and left) direction. A stethoscope can be placed directly over the apex so that the beats can be counted. This physical location is between the sixth and seventh rib, just to the left of the sternum [http://www.easyrashi.com/TEFILLIN/sternum.htm]. In normal adults, the mass of the heart is 250-350 g (9-12 oz), or about three fourths the size of a clenched fist, but extremely diseased hearts can be up to 1000 g (2 lb) in mass due to hypertrophy. It consists of four chambers, the two upper ''atria'' (singular: atrium
) and the two lower ''ventricles''.  On the left is a picture of a fresh human heart which was removed from a 64-year-old British male.  

[[Image:Humhrt2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Human heart]]

The function of the right side of the heart (see right heart) is to collect deoxygenated blood, in the right atrium, from the body and pump it, via the right ventricle, into the lungs (pulmonary circulation) so that carbon dioxide can be dropped off and oxygen picked up (gas exchange). This happens through a passive process called diffusion. The left side (see left heart) collects oxygenated blood from the lungs into the left atrium.  From the left atrium the blood moves to the left ventricle which pumps it out to the body.  On both sides, the lower ventricles are thicker and stronger than the upper atria.
The muscle wall surrounding the left ventricle is thicker than the wall surrounding the right ventricle due to the higher force needed to pump the blood through the systemic circulation.

The electrical signals pass through the heart from the SAN, through the atria, to the AVN and then to the vetricales via the Purkinje fibres.

The electrical signals can be monitored using electrodes on the skin of the chest. The electrocardiogram is an important tool for diagnosing heart problems:

In '''normal sinus rhythm''':
*each P wave is followed by a QRS
*P wave rate 60 - 100 bpm with &lt;10% variation

If the SAN is diseased or inherits a malfunction then the heart may develop rapid (tachycardia), slow (bradycardia), or both rapid and slow rhythms (arrhythmia). Treatment may involve drugs and/or a cardiac pacemaker. &lt;ref&gt;P228 Black’s Medical Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

*If rate &lt;60 = '''sinus bradycardia''' 
*If rate &gt;100 = '''sinus tachycardia''' 
*If variation &gt;10% = '''sinus arrhythmia''' 

'''Ventricular fibrillation''': Dangerous and rapid arrhythmia of the ventricle. The ECG shows a &quot;bizarre, irregular, random waveform; no clearly identifiable QRS complexes or P waves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecglibrary.com/] ECG Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EKG VF.jpg|450 px]] ECG showing ventricular fibrillation.

==Heart rate==

'''Heart rate''' is a term used to describe the frequency of the cardiac cycle. It is considered one of the four vital signs. Usually it is calculated as the number of contractions ('''heart beats''') of the heart in one minute and expressed as &quot;beats per minute&quot; (bpm). 

When resting, the adult human heart beats at about 70&amp;nbsp;bpm (males) and 75&amp;nbsp;bpm (females), but this rate varies among people. However, the reference range is normally between 60&amp;nbsp;bpm (if less termed bradycardia) and 100&amp;nbsp;bpm (if greater, termed tachycardia). Resting heart rates can be significantly lower in athletes.

The pulse is the most straightforward way of measuring the heart rate, but it can be deceptive when some heart beats do not have much cardiac output. In these cases (as happens in some arrhythmias), the heart rate may be considerably higher than the pulse rate.

Auscultation is also a method of heart rate measurement.

===Control of heart rate===

The heart is controlled by the autonomic nervous system and circulating adrenaline. The autonomic nervous system has two divisions: The sympathetic nervous system ('fight or flight' response) stimulates cardiac ouptut by acting on the SAN, the cardiac muscle and the AVN. The parasympathetic nervous system ('rest and digest' response) has the opposite effect.

Blood pressure is detected by baroreceptors in the carotid arteries. Chemoreceptors in the medulla oblongata detect changes in pH and carbon dioxide levels. Decreased blood pressure, pH or increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels cause stimulation of the heart via the sympathetic nervous system. 

Although chemoreceptors in the aorta and carotid arteries detect oxygen levels, the response is counterintuitive. Low oxygen levels cause the heart rate to decrease, which protects the heart muscle from the effects of anaerobic respiration.

See [[w:Baroreflex]], [[w:Chemosensor]], [[w:Peripheral chemoreceptors]], [[w:Central chemoreceptors]]

===Heart rate abnormalities===
====Tachycardia====

'''Tachycardia''' refers to a rapid beating of the heart. By convention the term refers to heart rates greater than 100 beats per minute in the adult patient. Tachycardia may be a perfectly normal physiological response to stress. However, depending on the mechanism of the tachycardia and the health status of the patient, tachycardia may be harmful, and require medical treatment. In extreme cases, tachycardia can be life threatening.

Tachycardia can be harmful in two ways. First, when the heart beats too rapidly, it may perform inefficiently. Second, the faster the heart beats, the more [[oxygen]] and nutrients the heart requires. This may leave patients feeling out of breath. This can be especially problematic for patients suffering from [[ischemic heart disease]].

====Haemodynamic responses====
The body contains several feedback mechanisms to maintain adequate blood flow and blood pressure. If blood pressure decreases, the heart beats faster in an attempt to raise it. This is called reflex tachycardia.

This can happen in response to a decrease in blood volume (through dehydration or bleeding), or an unexpected change in blood flow. The most common cause of the latter is orthostatic hypotension (also called postural hypotension), a sudden drop of blood pressure that occurs with a change in body position (e.g., going from lying down to standing up).

Fever and infection leading to sepsis are also common causes of tachycardia, primarily due to increase in metabolic demands and compensatory increase in heart rate.

====Autonomic and endocrine causes====
An increase in sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes the heart rate to increase, both by the direct action of sympathetic nerve fibres on the heart and by causing the endocrine system to release hormones such as epinephrine (adrenaline), which have a similar effect. Increased sympathetic stimulation is usually due to physical or psychological stress (the so-called &quot;fight or flight&quot; response), but can also be induced by stimulant]s such as amphetamines.

Endocrine disorders such as pheochromocytoma can cause epinephrine release and tachycardia independent of the nervous system. Hyperthyroidism is also known to cause tachycardia.

=====Sinus tachycardia=====
The most common type of tachycardia is sinus tachycardia, which is the body's normal reaction to stress, including fever, dehydration, or blood loss (shock). In the absence of heart disease, it tends to have a narrow QRS complex on the ECG. Treatment is generally directed at identifying the underlying cause.

====Bradycardia====

Bradycardia is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute although it is seldom symptomatic until below 50&amp;nbsp;bpm.  Trained [[athlete]]s tend to have slow resting heart rates, and resting bradycardia in athletes should not be considered abnormal  if the individual has no symptoms associated with it. Again, this number can vary as smaller people and children have faster heart rates than adults.

==Pulse==

A person's '''pulse''' is the throbbing of their arteries as an effect of the heartbeat. It can be felt at the [neck, at the wrist and other places.

Pressure waves move through the blood vessels, which are pliable; these waves are not caused by the forward movement of the blood. When the heart contracts, blood is ejected into the aorta and the aorta stretches. At this point the wave of distention ('''pulse wave''') is pronounced but relatively slow-moving (3 to 6 m/s). As it travels towards the peripheral blood vessels, it gradually diminishes and becomes faster. In the large arterial branches, its velocity is 7 to 10 m/s; in the small arteries, it is 15 to 35 m/s. The pressure pulse is transmitted 15 or more times more rapidly than the blood flow.

The term ''pulse'' is also used, although incorrectly, to denote the frequency of the heart beat, usually measured in beats per minute. In most people, the pulse is an accurate measure of heart rate. Under certain circumstances, including arrhythmias,  some of the heart beats are ineffective and the aorta is not stretched enough to create a palpable pressure wave. The pulse is irregular and the heart rate can be (much) higher than the pulse rate. In this case, the heart rate should be determined by auscultation of the heart apex, in which case it is not the pulse. The '''pulse deficit''' (difference between heart beats and pulsations at the periphery) should be determined by simultaneous palpation at the radial artery and auscultation at the heart apex. 

A normal pulse rate for a healthy adult, while resting, can range from 60 to 100 '''beats per minute''' ('''BPM''').  During sleep, this can drop to as low as 40 BPM; during strenuous exercise, it can rise as high as 200&amp;ndash;220 BPM.  Generally, pulse rates are higher in younger persons.  A resting heart rate for an infant is as high as or higher than an adult's pulse rate during strenuous exercise. 

Pulses are manually palpated with fingers or thumb. When palpating the carotid artery, the femoral artery or the brachial artery, the thumb may be used. However, the thumb has its own pulse which can interfere with detecting the patient's pulse at other points, where two or three fingers should be used. Fingers or thumb must be placed near an artery and pressed gently against a firm structure, usually a bone, in order to feel the pulse. 

An alternative way of finding the pulse rate is by palpating or listening to the heartbeat. This is most commonly done with the examiner's palm or a through a stethoscope. Before the invention of the stethoscope examiners would press their ear directly to the chest.

[[Image:Radial pulse.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Checking the radial pulse.]]

===Common pulse points===
*'''radial pulse''' - located on the thumb side of the wrist
*'''ulnar pulse''' - located on the little finger side of the wrist (ulnar artery)
*'''carotid pulse''' - located in the neck (carotid artery). The carotid artery should be palpated gently. Stimulating its baroreceptors with vigorous palpitation can provoke severe bradycardia or even stop the heart in some sensitive persons. Also, a person's two carotid arteries should not be palpated at the same time, to avoid a risk of fainting or brain ischaemia.
*'''brachial pulse''' - located between the biceps and triceps, on the medial side of the elbow cavity; frequently used in place of carotid pulse in infants (brachial artery)
*'''femoral pulse''' - located in the thigh (femoral artery)
*'''popliteal pulse''' - located behind the knee in the popliteal fossa, found by holding the bent knee. The patient bends the knee at approximately 120°, and the physician holds it in both hands to find the popliteal artery in the pit behind the knee.
*'''dorsalis pedis pulse''' - located on top of the foot (dorsalis pedis artery)
*'''tibialis posterior pulse''' - located in the back of the ankle behind the medial malleolus (posterior tibial artery).
*'''temporal pulse''' - located on the temple directly in front of the ear (temporal artery)

The ease of palpability of a pulse is dictated by the patient's blood pressure.  If his or her systolic blood pressure is below 90 mmHg, the radial pulse will not be palpable.  Below 80 mmHg, the brachial pulse will not be palpable.  Below 60 mmHg, the carotid pulse will not be palpable.  Since systolic blood pressure rarely drops that low, the lack of a carotid pulse usually indicates death.  It is not unheard of, however, for patients with certain injuries, illnesses or other medical problems to be conscious and aware with no palpable pulse.

==Lungs==


[[Image:heart-and-lungs.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The '''lungs''' flank the heart and great vessels in the chest cavity. &lt;small&gt;(Source: ''Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body'', 20th ed. 1918.)&lt;/small&gt;
[[Image:Lungs.gif|thumb|right|230px|Air enters and leaves the lungs via a conduit of cartilaginuous passageways — the bronchi and bronchioles. In this image, lung tissue has been dissected away to reveal the bronchioles]]'', 20th ed. 1918.)&lt;/small&gt;]]

The '''lung''' is the essential respiration organ in air-breathing vertebrates. Its principal function is to transport oxygen from the atmosphere into the bloodstream, and to excrete carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere. This exchange of gases is accomplished in the mosaic of specialised cells that form millions of tiny, exceptionally thin-walled air sacs called alveoli. The lungs also have nonrespiratory functions.

Medical terms related to the lung often begin with '''''pulmo-''''', from the Latin ''pulmonarius'' (&quot;of the lungs&quot;), or with '''''pneumo-''''' (from Greek πνεύμω &quot;lung&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kmle.com/search.php?Search=pneumo-| title = ''KMLE Medical Dictionary Definition of pneumo-'' | author = [http://www.kmle.com The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kmle.com/search.php?Search=pulmo| title = ''KMLE Medical Dictionary Definition of pulmo-'' | author = [http://www.kmle.com The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiratory function===
Energy production from aerobic respiration requires oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a by-product, creating a need for an efficient means of oxygen delivery ''to'' cells and excretion of carbon dioxide ''from'' cells. 

In air-breathing vertebrates, respiration occurs in a series of steps. Air is brought into the animal via the airways — this consists of the nose; the pharynx; the larynx; the trachea (also called the windpipe); the bronchi and bronchioles; and the terminal branches of the respiratory tree. The lungs are a rich lattice of alveoli, which provide an enormous surface area for gas exchange. A network of fine capillaries allows transport of blood over the surface of alveoli. Oxygen from the air inside the alveoli diffuses into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood to the alveoli, both across thin alveolar membranes. 

The drawing and expulsion of air is driven by muscular action; a complicated musculoskeletal system is used. A large muscle, the diaphragm (in addition to the internal intercostal muscles), drive ventilation by periodically altering the intra-thoracic volume and pressure; by increasing volume and thus decreasing pressure, air flows into the airways down a pressure gradient, and by reducing volume and increasing pressure, the reverse occurs. During normal breathing, expiration is passive and no muscles are contracted (the diaphragm relaxes). 

Another name for this inspiration and expulsion of air is ventilation.

The lungs of mammals have a spongy texture and are honeycombed with epithelium having a much larger surface area in total than the outer surface area of the lung itself.

Breathing is largely driven by the muscular diaphragm at the bottom of the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm pulls the bottom of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed downward. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx and into the trachea, which branches out into bronchi. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing.  During exercise, the diaphragm contracts, forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself is also able to expand and contract to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a '''bellows lung''' as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows.

===Anatomy===
In humans, it is the two main bronchi (produced by the bifurcation of the trachea) that enter the roots of the lungs. The bronchi continue to divide within the lung, and after multiple divisions, give rise to bronchioles.  The bronchial tree continues branching until it reaches the level of terminal bronchioles, which lead to alveolar sacks.  Alveolar sacs are made up of clusters of alveoli, like individual grapes within a bunch.  The individual alveoli are tightly wrapped in blood vessels, and it is here that gas exchange actually occurs.  Deoxygenated blood from the heart is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where oxygen diffuses into blood and is exchanged for carbon dioxide in the haemoglobin of the erythrocytes (red blood cells).  The oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins to be pumped back into systemic circulation.    

[[Image:Illu_bronchi_lungs.jpg|thumb|Bronchi, bronchial tree, and lungs. (Cardiac notch labeled at bottom left.)|350px]]
Human lungs are located in two cavities on either side of the heart.  Though similar in appearance, the two are not identical.  Both are separated into lobes, with three lobes on the right and two on the left.  The lobes are further divided into lobules, hexagonal divisions of the lungs that are the smallest subdivision visible to the naked eye.  The connective tissue that divides lobules is often blackened in smokers and city dwellers.  The medial border of the right lung is nearly vertical, while the left lung contains a cardiac notch.  The cardiac notch is a concave impression molded to accommodate the shape of the heart. 
 
Lungs are to a certain extent 'overbuilt' and have a tremendous reserve volume as compared to the oxygen exchange requirements when at rest.  This is the reason that individuals can smoke for years without having a noticeable decrease in lung function while still or moving slowly; in situations like these only a small portion of the lungs are actually perfused with blood for gas exchange.  As oxygen requirements increase due to exercise, a greater volume of the lungs is perfused, allowing the body to match its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exchange requirements.

The environment of the lung is very moist, which makes it hospitable for bacteria. Many respiratory illnesses are the result of bacterial or viral infection of the lungs.

===Vital capacity===

'''Vital capacity''' is the maximum volume of air that a person can exhale after maximum inhalation. 

A person's vital capacity can be measured by a spirometer which can be a wet or regular spirometer.([[spirometry]]). In combination with other physiological measurements, the vital capacity can help make a diagnosis of underlying lung disease.

Vital capacity is the maximum amount of air a person can expel from the lungs after first filling the lungs to their maximum extent and then expiring to the maximum extent (about 4600 milliters). It equals the inspiratory reserve volume plus the tidal volume plus the expiratory reserve volume.

==Breathing==

'''Breathing''' transports oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide out of the body. Aerobic organisms require oxygen to create energy via respiration, in the form of energy-rich molecules such as glucose. The medical term for normal relaxed breathing is eupnoea.

===Mechanics===
Breathing in, or inhaling, is usually an active movement, with the contraction of the diaphragm muscles needed. At rest, breathing out, or exhaling, is normally a passive process powered by the elastic recoil of the chest, similar to a deflating balloon.

===Gas exchange===
Breathing is only part of the process of delivering oxygen to where it is needed in the body. The process of gas exchange occurs in the alveoli by passive diffusion of gasses between the alveolar gas and the blood passing by in the lung capillaries. Once in the blood, the heart powers the flow dissolved gasses around the body in the circulation. 

As well as carbon dioxide, breathing also results in loss of water from the body. Exhaled air has a relative humidity of 100% because of water diffusing across the moist surface of breathing passages and alveoli.

===Control of breathing===
Breathing is one of the few bodily functions which, within limits, can be controlled both consciously and unconsciously.

Unconsciously, breathing is controlled by specialised centres in the brainstem, which automatically regulate the rate and depth of breathing depending on the body’s needs at any time.

When carbon dioxide levels increase in the blood, it reacts with the water in blood, producing carbonic acid.  The drop in the blood's pH will then cause the medulla oblongata signalling centre in brain to send nerve impulses to the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles, increasing the rate of breathing.

While exercising, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood increases due to increased cellular respiration by the muscles, and so breathing rate increases.  During rest, the level of carbon dioxide is lower, so breathing rate is lower. This ensures an appropriate amount of oxygen is delivered to the muscles and other organs.  It is important to reiterate that it is the buildup of carbon dioxide making the blood acidic that elicits the desperation for a breath much more than lack of oxygen. Rarely, individuals with chronic lung disease may adapt to high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in their blood by regulating their breathing according to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels.

Hyperventilating causes a drop in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; below normal levels, lowering blood acidity to trick the brain into thinking it has more oxygen than is actually present.

===Respiratory rate===
Humans typically breathe between 12 and 20 times per minute.

===Composition of air===
The air we inhale is roughly 21% oxygen (% by volume).

Not all of the oxygen breathed in is converted into carbon dioxide; around 13% of what we breathe out is still oxygen. This is what makes resuscitation possible. Also our reliance on this relatively small amount of oxygen can cause overactivity or euphoria in pure or oxygen rich environments.

===Gas exchange===
The process of gas exchange occurs in the alveoli by passive diffusion of gasses between the alveolar gas and the blood passing by in the lung capillaries. Once in the blood, the heart powers the flow dissolved gasses around the body in the circulation.

Flash designates video files by giving it a '''.flv''' extension, which stands for Flash Video. Flash Video is quickly becoming one of the premiere video formats due to its ease of use and small file size. 

There are a number of ways you can display video content. 
* Load a Flash Video File at Runtime, which involves creating a separate .flv file and uploading it to your server, then loading it from another Flash movie.
* Embedding the video directly into the .swf file. This method is good for compatibility as it only requires Flash Player 6 or later, but can also result in large file size for the SWF file.  
* Import a video into a flash document and then exporting it as a .flv file. 
* Simply encoding a video using the Flash Video Encoder. 
* Using a third party application such as Quicktime or Sorensen Squeeze to create the flash video file. Flash 8 will also allow you to link video content in Quicktime format without embedding them directly into your .swf file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When choosing to convert regular video to Flash Video, there are two basic [[Movie Making Manual/Post-production/Video_codecs|codecs]] to keep in mind - each have different uses and strengths.

==Keep Codec Dynamics in Mind==

Codecs stand for '''Co'''mpression/'''Dec'''ompression - it is important to remember that neither of the primary Flash codecs are ''lossless'' - which means you will lose some data whenever you encode your source video into Flash. In order to shrink the file size of video to allow for transmission over the internet, some data is thrown out, regardless of whatever method you use. This is why you should avoid double compression - in other words trying to compress a previously compressed video file - when creating Flash Video. If you try to double compress a video, you will end up losing more data than you would have if you used high quality video, without necessarily decreasing the file size significantly.

'''Sorensen Spark''' was the primary codec for Flash Video for Flash versions 6-7. Because it's been around longer, several more years in fact, it has a wider area of compatibility than the VP6 codec does. If your video is intended to be watched by the general public over the internet, it might not be a bad idea to use the Sorensen codec to encode your video. Because video encoded with the Sorenses codec will play on Flash Player versions 6 and later, it is ideal for reaching the broadest audience. 

'''The On2 VP6 Vodec'''

With the advent of Flash 8, a new codec has been created that greatly improved encoding and playback of Flash Video. That codec is On2 VP6, and features much better compression and image quality than the Sorensen codec. 

There is a drawback to using the new codec however, because users will only be able to watch video encoded with VP6 in Flash Player ''8'' or newer, and playback requires more processing power than previous codecs. Adobe even has specific size limits and bits per second limitations it recommends to avoid taxing the computers that are displaying your Flash video. 

In the end, it is a matter of balancing availability versus file size and quality, so use whichever codec fits your desired project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Compressing Video==
Whenever you begin to create FLV files, you should always select the highest quality source video to avoid double compression. Choose video that has the highest playback rate so that the Flash Encoder has the highest quality video to compress.

==Getting Started==

To import video in Flash, you should begin by selecting the ''Import Video'' option from the File &gt; Import menu in Flash 8. Upon doing this, you will see the ''Select Video'' screen, which allows you to browse to a video clip. Once you've picked the clip you'd like to convert, you can proceed to the next step, Deployment. Deployment is simply choosing the manner that you will include the video into your flash movie. 
*''Embed Video'' is the selection that is chosen when you first come onto the Deployment screen. This will place your movie directly into the Library of your Flash document. It is important to remember that this will significantly increase the size of your SWF file. 
''Link Quicktime Video'' allow you to import a video clip for a video track in a Quicktime Flash movie. After this, the Quicktime video is placed on the timeline and the import session is finished. 
** Upon choosing Embed Video, you are given several choices as to how you would like your video content to be stored in Flash, and also gives you options of how to process the audio portion of your imported video. 
* The ''Editing the Video'' portion allows you to specify clips that you will edit by dragging markers to the video timeline. Upon doing so you can rename the clips, whereupon they show up on the left side in a field that allows you to select different ones and will eventually show up as individual symbols in your Library. 
* ''Encoding''  is the next step of importing video. The profiles are split into two sections, Flash 7 and Flash 8. The Flash 7 option features different presets that are encoded with the Sorensen Spark Codec, the Flash 8 presets are encoded with the VP6 codec. It also features several advanced options that will be detailed here: 
** Frame Rate: Frame rate is the speed at which your movie displays. The faster the frame rate, the smoother the transition of movement between frames. It is important to remember that in order to create the best synchronization between the imported video and your existing flash movie, the framerates between your imported video and host FLA file should be the same. The next two options give you a choice:  the ''Same as FLA'' option encodes the Flash video at the rate of the host FLA file, while the ''Same As Source'' reverses this and encodes at the frame rate of the imported video. There are also additional specific frame rates you can choose if you so desire. Remember, a higher framerate is better for animation, but larger in file size.
** ''Keyframes'' are used in video to determine the difference between one clip and another. There are two options here, Automatic, in which Flash decides how often a keyframe is created, and Custom, where you can choose your own options. If you don't know what this means, keep the setting to Automatic. 
**The ''Quality'' option allows you to set the data rate of your Flash movie. The higher the bps (bits per second) setting, the higher quality the video will be, but also the larger the file size will be. Deciding on how your audience will see your movie clip is important in determining your Quality - if they are downloading the movie over a modem, a lower Quality may be in order. If they are watching it via CD-ROM or broadband internet connection, a higher setting would be prudent.
** ''Resize Video'' allows you to change the dimensions of your Flash Video. It is important to remember to keep the ratio of your video the same to avoid unwanted distortion. There are also several presets to help you here if you don't quite know what you are doing. 
*''Encode Audio'' - here is where you decide the data rate of the audio portion of your imported video will be. Like video, the higher the setting the better the quality of the audio, and larger proportionate file size.
*''Crop and Trim'' allows you to change the borders of your video clip.
*At this point, you've determined pretty much everything you would need to know to import your video. Move on to the ''Finish Video'' screen and hit the Finish Button at the bottom to begin importing your video.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first thing that needs to be established before making a FLV video is the target audience. The size of a video will be largely dependent on a users available bandwidth. Use the following guide to determine about what video dimension is appropriate for a certain internet connection:

* Playback from a hard drive or CD: 640 x 480
* High-speed Internet: 320 x 240, or 240 x 180
* Dial-up: 120 x 90

If you are unsure of the video size of your source video, do the following: In Windows Media Player, choose File &gt; Properties. In Quicktime, choose Window &gt; Show Movie Info. Figure 1 below is a dialogue box for Quicktime. Windows Media will have a similar one.

[[Image:Flv_qt.jpg]]

Figure 1: Quicktime movie info.

Take note of the dimension and framerate of the movie. '''Do ''not'' resize to a bigger dimension than its original one, otherwise the movie will incur a serious loss of quality, much like resizing an image in Adobe Photoshop to a bigger size.''' Resizing a video improperly -- whether it is down or up -- may also have its repercussions. Make sure that the aspect ratio stays the same, otherwise the video will become distorted.

Do not ignore the framerate. A general rule to consider is that if your video has a lot of fast motion, such as a sports video, then it is better to have a higher framerate. ''Be careful.'' The higher the framerate, the more resource intensive the video becomes, and that can lead to slow downs and a choppy video. For a movie encoded at or near 30FPS, such as NTSC video, it is recommended to keep the movie at 15FPS. A movie with a smaller framerate, such as PAL video which is recorded at 25FPS, should be encoded at 12FPS.

After establishing the size, framerate, and target audience of the video, it is time to encode it. If you are targeting Flash 8 or 9 users, then use the On2 VP6 codec. If you are target Flash 6 or 7 users, then use the Sorensen Spark codec.

After opening up Flash Video Encoder and adding the movie file to be encoded, click on the &quot;Settings&quot; tab. Here you will be greeted with several preset options. Ignore them. Chances are, the presets will do more damage and provide an undesired result. Click the &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; tab. Refer to Figure 2.

[[Image:Flv 8ve.jpg]]

Figure 2: Flash 8 Video Encoder

The important part is to know whether you want to use On2 VP6 or the Sorensen Spark codec. As stated earlier, it depends largely on your target audience, but only On2 VP6 allows for the use of custom UI with FLVPlayback and skins in Flash Professional 8. If your movie has an alpha channel (transparency), then use On2 VP6, as the earlier codec does not support it. Select either 15FPS or 12FPS. Remember, if your video has a lot of motion, go with the higher framerate if you must.

One of the most overlooked aspects of FLV encoding is the keyframe setting. A movie with a lower keyframe setting will usually result in a larger filesize. If your video has to be as small in size as possible, a good bet is to use a keyframe setting of 5 seconds -- that is, multiply your video's framerate times 5 to get the desired keyframe interval. If your movie is encoded at 12FPS, then the keyframe interval should be 60. If you are not satisfied with the quality of the video, then reduce the keyframe interval by a second.

In regards to quality, there are a few things to keep in mind. Note, the data rate is a combination of both audio and video:

* Do not exceed 350kbps in the Data Rate field for broadband situations.
* Do not exceed 100kbps for dial-up.
* Oftentimes, a mono soundtrack is all that is required for audio. A mono soundtrack also requires less bandwidth. Generally, 48kbps or 64kbps is sufficient for audio.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The FLVPlayback component is designed to let you play FLV video over the internet. The following types of servers and video playback is supported:
* Progressive download over HTTP
* Streaming video over a Flash Communication Server (FCS)
* Streaming video from a Flash Video Streaming Service (FVSS)

The FLVPlayback Component has several features and it can be easily dragged onto a stage and set up to play FLV files.

[[Image:Flv_pbc.jpg]]

Figure 1: FLVPlayback Component on a stage.

After the FLVPlayback Component has been dragged to the stage, there are a few parameters to be set-up. Select the FLVPlayback Component player and open up the parameters. To open the parameters, choose Window &gt; Properties &gt; Parameters. A dialogue box will appear where the properties area is. See Figure 2. Here you can change the size of the video, the path to the video, and so on.

[[Image:flv_pbc_param.jpg]]

Figure 2: FLVPlayback Component Parameters.

The most important part of the parameters is the contentPath. Double click on &quot;contentPath&quot; and a new dialogue box will appear.

[[Image:flv_pbc_cpath.jpg]]

Figure 3: contentPath dialog box.

Input either the URL to the FLV, or the relative path of it. If the main SWF is in your &quot;home&quot; folder, and the FLV file is in your &quot;flvideo&quot; folder, then the relative path to said video is /home/flvideo/videoname.flv.

The remaining parameters do the following:

* autoPlay: Setting this to &quot;true&quot; will automatically play the video once the page is loaded.
* autoRewind: Setting this to &quot;true&quot; will rewind the movie to the beginning after it is done playing.
* autoSize: Setting this to &quot;true&quot; will set the dimensions of the movie to the source FLV file.
* bufferTime: Time in seconds to buffer a movie in memory before it begins playing it. It is very useful when streaming FLV files, but it has little bearing on progressive download FLVs, unless they are of a very high quality.
* contentPath: A URL to an FLV file or XML file that determines how to play one or more FLV files.
* cuePoints: This is used to synchronize points in the FLV file with other Flash animations, graphics, text, etc.
* isLive: Setting this to &quot;true&quot; determines if the FLV file is streaming from a FCS server.
* maintainAspectRatio: Setting this to &quot;true&quot; will keep the aspect ratio of the FLV file if it is rescaled.
* skin: Allows you to choose a custom made UI for your FLVPlayback Component player.
* skinAutoHide: If the mouse is not hovered over the video, the skin is hidden.
* totalTime: The number of seconds a FLV file has.
* volume: A percentage representing the volume of a FLV file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Dealing with Waste &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As the population grows in any given location, the strain on resources and the environment increases. This strain is due in part to the way we deal with the waste that our lives create.

==Definitions==

Waste can be grouped into three main types, Biodegrable, Inert or Toxic waste.

==Biodegradable Waste==

Biodegradable waste normally originates from plant or animal sources, and it may be broken down by other living organisms. 

This waste should not be mixed with general waste, because it can be composted and used for agricultural purposes.

==Inert Waste==

Inert non-biodegradable waste can be recycled, reused or dumped in a location where the contamination of the area is minimal. The most important point is not to let any liquid components of the waste get into the water ways or the water table.

==Toxic Waste==

Toxic waste is any waste that can harm living organisms, this sort of waste either gives of gases or liquids which contaminate the air, water or earth that they come in contact with.

==Identifying Waste==

===Household waste===

===Farm Waste===

===Liquid Waste===

==Solutions==
The sequence normally followed when approaching waste management is:
* Reduce - what can be done to reduce the volume of waste
* Re-use - can packaging or the waste be re-used (returnable bottles returned for cleaning and filling)
* Re-cycle - this means the waste is re-processed (glass is melted to make more bottles)
* Discard - the waste is sent to the correct landfill site or incinerator

===Reduce===


===Reusing===
Returnable beer bottles have a life expectancy of at least 25 trips, and at the end of the lifespan the brewer crushes the glass and recycles it to the glass supplier.


===Recycling===
'''Glass recycling''' 
To yield the best value glass waste it is important to keep the different glass colours separate.

Contaminants of recycled glass include high temperature glass such as borosilicate glass and &quot;Pyrex&quot; or porcelain. These should be re-cycled separately.

===Correct disposal===

== Need Database Abstraction Class ==

Please complete the wikibook &quot;PHP Programming/User login systems&quot;.  It ranks very high in search engines, but it does not contain enough information to let a competent newcomer actually make a user login system.

The database abstraction class is not explained at all.  It's one thing to understand the concept of &quot;abstraction&quot;, quite another to understand whatever it might be you want from such a class.  No examples of a database class are given.  Could you include an example for PostGRE and one for MySQL?  It's one thing to be database agnostic, but the book should still tell someone at least one concrete way in which this can be done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Saving Presets and Combining Filters ==

If you combine multiple filters to an item, they are rendered in the order they appear in the list. This means that when you change the order of the filters, you change the way the finished product will appear. You can always go back to the settings for each filter if you want to change it later.

The Presets option is useful if you have found a specific combination or filters or a custom filter that you like and would like to use again in the future.

'''Here are a few steps you can use to save a filter combination, or filter setting.'''

1. Select an item with filters applied to it that you would like to save.

2. Click on the plus icon in the Filters panel to bring up the filter menu. From the Presets menu, select &quot;Save As&quot;.

3. Enter the name you wish your preset to have and click OK.

4. The new preset will be added to the Presets menu, with any other saved Presets you might have. You can now apply the preset filter or filters to anything else you wish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A great deal of good can come of a home workshop.  The craftsperson may build many useful and long-lasting artifacts for the house, and these are most certainly good; the real gains, however, come from the work itself:  the process of working wood transforms the woodworker as much as it does the wood, and it is through the work that we come to know both ourselves, and the wood.  But for this to be true, we must approach our task in the right way.

== On Doing Things Properly ==
It is best not to set out thinking ''I will make a coffee table today,'' because this is probably not what you will do: more likely, you will be planing sticks of timber, trying to get them square and true, and then cutting joints and boring holes.  So reduce your day's tasks to what you are actually going to do: ''I am going to make this board flat today,'' or, ''I will sharpen this plane blade now,'' for then you are focused on what you are ''doing''.  This is important.  So much frustration and anguish comes from running down to the hardware shop, buying new tools and wood, and then feeling a fool when you can't produce the lovely smooth things you see in the woodworking magazines.  So stop.  It's not a new piece of wood you need, nor a new tool, but simply an awareness of what you're ''actually doing''.
After all, most woodworking tools have very sharp edges. A finished product does not look very good if it is being held with hands that are missing fingers! Pay attention to what you are doing, from all angles.

== The Space ==
The space for your workshop is probably pre-determined by the design of your house; there may be no options.  A garage is commonly turned to the purpose (as well as those of cars and storage and everything else!), a basement may be available, or even an attic.  But wherever you fit your workshop, aim for a space that is dry, not to hot or cold, and in which you can make a bit of noise without annoying anyone.  Size is important, but perhaps not as greatly so as you might think: in a small space, you will simply adapt your practice to fit the space.

If you can, it will help if you can have a space ''dedicated'' to your workshop.  Although the home workshop is (by definition) not used full-time, by having a full-time workshop space you will be able to keep your tools and materials always ready and generally in better condition.  Not sharing a woodworking workbench with the bicycle mechanic of your household, for instance, means that the cross-purposes of these tasks will not come into conflict.  Equally, when it is time—those precious couple of hours on a Saturday morning, perhaps—to get to work on your current project, it can be a great deterrent if you first have to disengage the workshop from its other roles.

Organization is key to using those spare hours you have to work your craft. One of the hardest things to do, is straighten and clean up your area when you are short on time. Take the few minutes and do it anyway, your next session will start on the right foot!

== The Workbench ==
A good strong workbench is essential, and probably the most troubling part of a new workshop.  It is almost Catch-22: skills and cost aside (for it is not hard to build a cheap workbench), one finds that it is a great deal harder to build a workbench ''without'' a workbench on which to work!  The answers to this are many, but for the home woodworker probably the best ones are: to purchase a complete bench (new or second-hand); or to progressively work up (from first principles as it were) to a bench by making other items first, such as saw-horses or saw-stools.

Saw-horses are the handyman's workbench out in the field.(someone else's house!) But when at home, he uses them as an extension of his workbench. Having your saw-horses at the same or slightly under the height of your workbench has benefits in your workshop, giving you the ability to build projects that are bigger than your workbench.

Jimmyatic, I am still active, and, yes, I would be pleased to work on this book.
[[User:K428|K428]] 17:30, 4 September 2007 (UTC)
: I left a message on [[Talk:TI-Basic Programming]], but I figured that having the orange bar at the top of your screen would get a bit more attention than something that may or may not be in your watchlist. Anyway, if you would just take a look at that page and give me a reply here, there, or on my talk page, I'd greatly appreciate it ^_^ --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:33, 3 October 2007 (UTC)

== TI-Basic Book(s) ==

Hey, could we talk about the organization of the Basic books? I notice you created a separate one for 89s, is that really necessary? Could we keep this all in one book? Also, I'd like to make sure you have everything you need to move all the old book content into the new one. Once that gets taken care of, please say something to an admin such as myself so that we can clean up all the references to the old book and delete any unnecessary pages (there's no point in having a book full of all redirects). If you also need help with anything like menu creation or other organization tips (like how to use our slash convention most efficiently), please leave a message on the appropriate [[Wikibooks:Reading room]] page and we'll help you out. If you have anything to say to me personally, please reply on my talk page. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 15:31, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

:I actually did a lot of TI programming when I was in high school although I never tried on the 89, so if it's C++-like then I agree that it should be a separate book. The distinction should be made clear in the opening pages of the books I feel. Your use of slash convention is fine. I personally prefer deeper than one level, but it depends on the content and you might not need it. I designed and heavily edit the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] which uses deeper naming and so that's why I mention it. Check out [[WB:SLT#BOOKNAME and CHAPTERNAME|this bit]] which might help you as well. When you're needing navigation between pages, also check out the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TopNav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template which for example is used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|here]]. It's also just fine for the books to co-exist. I've marked them with a merge template which will keep people informed that the two books are coming together. Great work so far. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:49, 13 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

Original research is not allowed per [[WB:WIW]] ''Wikibooks is not a place to publish original works''. As a corollary, please avoid use of first person in Wikibooks. If the text must include original research, you might ask about having it hosted on [http://www.wikiversity.org Wikiversity] instead. If that's what is decided, an admin can transwiki it for you so you don't loose authorship information. I hope this helps. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:37, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

Hi this book has survived it's VfD however you may be interested in looking at the comments (constructive ones!) made on the VfD page for your book.  Certainly there are some issues there that you should be aware of and maybe they will help to improve the book and the grades [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Ethnomedicine]] - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:27, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

As a further clarification of my comment above, the sections on frozen spoon, zits, and cranberry juice all include first-person observations (what we call 'original research'). You might also consider breaking this page into [[WB:MODULE|modules]]. I notice that the same text about jow occurring twice on the page. If the book were written as a series of modules then your various contents and index pages could link to the individual module e.g. [[Ethnomedicine/Jow]], [[Ethnomedicine/Ginger]]. Hope this helps. If you have any questions or need anything else, feel free to ping me on my talk page. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:03, 6 March 2007 (UTC)


== Similar names ==
Whats with all these people with the numbers after their names? --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 22:58, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

== Pedialyte ==
My section on Pedialyte as an anti-hangover keeps getting deleted.  It's a perfectly valid home remedy so if you insist on screwing with it please post something in the discussion about it.  Thanks.
--[[User:Horn, Alex|Horn, Alex]]

== Ecinacea ==

I made some minor changes to the information in the section on Ecinacea. Mostly I just added extra information where it was pertinent, such as the warning for allergies and slight clarification on when it began to gain popularity and where. Also, I added some information on doses, frequency of doses, and duration, which was mildly conflicting with what was already there. I believe the information as it is can show two valid points, but if anyone wants to discuss this change or disagrees with what I wrote, please let me know.

== IMPORTANT: Notice to project participants ==

You probably noticed that [[Ethnomedicine]] is now a very large document and the software has started faulting when saving the latest revision. In order to alleviate the problem, please start doing the following:

* Create a new section only in a sub page. For example, if you were creating a sub page detailing &quot;Athlete's foot&quot; (which I know has already been created), you would include all the text in [[Ethnomedicine/Sections/Athlete's foot]].
* When including the text in the main page of Ethnomedicine, you would then type &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Ethnomedicine/Sections/Athlete's foot}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;!--IF YOU ARE READING THIS!!! TAKE NOTICE: do not include the text &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; when you intend to include it in the page--&gt;

Then the text can be used the other &quot;by Culture Group&quot; and &quot;by Illness&quot; modules by using the same code as above, and then the main document doesn't become more bogged down than it already is. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 19:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

== Has this module been abandoned? Not yet!==

I'm wondering if this module has been abandoned by the class that created it at this point. Either way, it still really needs cleanup. Is anyone in contact with this group? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:20, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

I think it will be cleaned up in the coming weeks. Hopefully transformed into something more wikibookish. --[[User:Paul James|Paul James]] 07:31, 28 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__While they're not often a favorite topic of study for the horticulture student or enthusiast, knowing and understanding weeds is one of the most important keys to becoming a successful gardener. Aside from being a maintenance issue (in the sense of always needing control), weeds also play a key role in the ecosystem which the gardener seeks to manage.

What is a weed? This can be hard to define, but a good general definition is that a weed is any plant growing in a place where it is not wanted. Using this definition, the same plant can be both a weed and a crop at the same time, to the same gardener, on two different areas of the ground. For example, clover may be planted on a pasture and considered a forage crop, but at the same time it may appear in the vegetable garden and considered a weed. This also means that the gardener can change his mind about what constitutes a weed over time: that self-seeding basil that escapes to invade the neighboring dill becomes a weed as soon as it crosses the border.

==What to know for control==
===Life cycle===
Like any plants, each particular weed has a distinct life cycle. First and foremost, it's important to know whether or not the weed is perennial, since perennial weeds require complete removal or destruction, while annuals and biennials can be controlled using preventative techniques such as pre-emergents or mulches. 

===Propagation, persistence, and tolerance=== 
Knowing how a weed spreads is also important. Many perennials spread by stolon or rhizome, while other plants (including all annuals and biennials) spread primarily by seed. 

How persistent a weed is depends on its ability to grow back from small fragments and the life span of its seed. Certain perennial weeds can grow back from even the smallest root fragment, and the seeds of some weeds can survive dormant in the soil for decades.

A weeds tolerance of abuse such as regular mowing can also provide clues to the easiest possible control techniques.

===What to know when deciding whether to control===
*Are they serving as a placeholder on what would otherwise be bare soil (and thus perhaps could be colonized by an even worse weed)?
*Are they likely to colonize other areas if left unchecked?
*Are they serving as nectar sources for pollinators and beneficial insects?
*Are they serving as alternate hosts for pests and diseases?
*Are they serving as trap crops, attracting pests that would normally eat your crops?
*Are they providing home for predatory insects?
*Are they going to seed soon?

===Garden uses===
Some plants which are usually treated as weeds are intentionally grown in some gardens, so it is important for professional gardeners to be aware of this so that they can ask the client whether they should be removed. Conversely, it's important to know that a plant can be weedy when considering using it in the garden.

===Native range===
When working in &quot;native plant gardens&quot;, it is important to know whether a &quot;weed&quot; is native to the region, since weeds can in those situations be treated as &quot;volunteers&quot;.

===Pests and diseases===
While it's tempting not to worry about pests and diseases that are affecting garden weeds, many weeds serve as alternate hosts for pests and diseases that affect garden plants. In order to provide lasting control for pests and diseases, it may be necessary to either eradicate these alternate hosts, or in the case of pest controls it might be necessary to control the pest on the weed hosts as well as the garden plant hosts, to prevent them from just migrating back to the garden plants after treatment.  

On the other side of the spectrum is the use of &quot;trap crops&quot;, popular in organic gardening, to draw pests away from garden plants.  If a type of weed is getting eaten up by insects, it is likely serving this role.  Note that this is only effective if the garden contains sufficient predator populations.  Some weeds can serve as both traps and hosts.  Lamb's Quarters, a common garden weed across the United States, is a trap for leaf miners but a host to beet leafhoppers.

===Nectar value===
Weeds in uncultivated areas can be useful in attracting beneficial insects. 

===Toxicity and edibility===
Some weeds contain toxins, ranging from those that cause discomfort to those which are lethal even in small doses, so it is important to be aware of these in gardens where children and pets play. 

Many weeds are also edible, and while they tend not to be choice ingredients (if they were, they'd be cultivated), they can be of interest.  Some weeds, such as Purslane, are renowned for their nutritional value.

===Tools===

Many tools are available for weed control. There are hand or powered hoes, flame weeders, hand or powered cultivators, scythes and similar hand cutting tools, mowers, all the way up to tractor-mounted flail mowers for knocking down weedy brush at the edges of meadows or pastures.

==Indication==
===Soil types===
Some weeds can serve as indicators for the soil type where they are growing, and can be &quot;read&quot; to provide a preliminary description of the soil type when a [[../Soil Testing|soil test]] has not yet been performed.

==Disposal==
whether it is safe for cold compost piles, hot compost piles, etc.

==Linked Web==
*[[Special:Wantedpages]] - as pages are created, redlinks are also created. 
**For example, each page about a genus of plants has links to the pests and diseases affecting plants in that genera. As several genera which share some of the same pests and diseases are created, the &quot;wanted&quot; pest and disease pages move up in the Wantedpages list. 
**When the pest or disease page is created, it will conversely have a list of links to the genera it affects, thus moving the genera pages up in the wantedpages list.

==User Participation==
*&quot;My Garden&quot; pages (helps steer wantedpages)
**For example, contributors could make lists of the plants or other features found in their own gardens (should be done in userspace). 
*Userboxes
**On wikibooks, for fun
**Possibly on wikipedia/wikiversity as well, to attract outside contributors.
*Wikiprojects on Wikipedia and elsewhere
*Web forums
*Universities and vocational schools
*Agricultural extension services

The genus '''''Ipomoea''''', with over 500 species, is the largest genus in the family [[../Convolvulaceae/]]. The genus occurs throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants, viness, shrubs and small trees; most of the species are twining climbing plants. Many species are known as morning glory, a name shared with some other related genera.

The genus includes important food crops (sweet potato and water spinach) and ''[[../Ipomoea violacea/]]'', source of the Mexican psychedelic drug, ''tlitliltzin''. Species and cultivars of ''Ipomoea'' grown as morning glory are popular in gardens for their often stunning flowers. 

==Description==
Flowers are regular and bisexual, with 5 sepals and a funnelform corolla with 5 lobes and stripes. The 5 stamens sit low in the tube, 1 style. The flower buds are &quot;pleated&quot;, and open by untwisting. The fruit is a dry 4-6 valved capsule, containing as many seeds. Foliage is alternate, simple or compound. Most if not all temperate species are twining vines, with the stems containing a milky juice.

==Growing Conditions==
Most species require full sun.

===Baklava===

==Ingredients==
'''Syrup'''
* 4 cups sugar
* 2 cups water
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] sticks – 3 inches long
* ¾ cups [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* 1 tbsp lemon juice

'''Note:''' You can add more honey and reduce the amount of sugar.

'''Nut mixture'''
* 1½ lbs [[Cookbook:Pistachio|pistachio]] nuts
* 2 tsp cinnamon powder

'''Pastry'''
* 1 lb [[Cookbook:Phyllo dough|Phyllo dough]] – thawed
* 1¼ lbs unsalted butter – melted

'''Equipment'''
* Tall large pot for making syrup
* Candy thermometer
* Baking pan about the size of the Phyllo sheets
* 2-3 inch paintbrush for applying melted butter

==Directions==
* Thaw the Phyllo inside its plastic package. Don’t open it until you’re ready to use it. If you’re in a hurry you can thaw it in its sealed plastic package in warm water.

* Chop the nuts with the powdered cinnamon in a food processor. '''You want a fine chop, not powder.'''

* Combine the sugar, honey, water, cinnamon sticks, and lemon juice in a large pot. Stir well and boil until the mixture reaches 220°F (100°C) on a candy thermometer (soft ball). Remove it from heat, skim the top, and let cool. Remove the cinnamon sticks. '''The lemon is an important ingredient in the syrup as it keeps it from crystallizing while cooling.'''

* Melt the butter in a saucepan while the syrup is boiling. You can clarify the butter but it’s not necessary.

* Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).

* Open the Phyllo and unfold it. Brush the inside of the baking pan with melted butter. While your assembling, cover the unused Phyllo with a damp towel. Make sure your butter is very liquid when you start. Put six (6) sheets of Phyllo in the pan, brushing each sheet with melted butter. Set aside another six (6) sheets which will be used for the top layers. After the first six sheets, sprinkle a handful of the nut mixture over the last sheet. Add another sheet and repeat the process until you get to the last six sheets. Place the last six sheets on top of the rest brushing each with butter. With a very sharp knife, cut the pastry into diamond shapes, all the way through. Sprinkle the top with water.

* Put the pastry into the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour or until the tops of the pastry are medium golden brown. When done, remove from the oven and ladle the cool syrup over the hot pastry.

* Let it sit for about 5-15 minutes, then drain off the excess syrup by tilting the pan as much as 45 degrees. Let it cool to near room temperature before eating.

'''''Phytophthora''''' (from Greek phytón, “plant” and phthorá, “destruction”, “plant-destroyer”) is a genus of plant-damaging Protists of the ''Oomycetes'' (water moulds). Heinrich Anton de Bary described it for the first time in 1875. 

''Phytophthora'' is sometimes referred to as a fungus-like organism but it is classified under a different kingdom altogether: Stramenopila (previously named Chromista).  In contrast to Fungi, stramenopiles are more closely related to plants than animals. Whereas Fungal cell walls are made primarily of chitin, stramenopile cell walls are constructed mostly of cellulose.

''Phytophthoras'' reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sporangia, zoospores, and chlamydospores are asexual. Oospores are sexual.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Infection by ''Phytophthora'' leads to root rots, cankers, foliar blights, and usually results in the death of the host plant. Symptoms vary according to both the pathogen species and the host species.

==Life Cycle==
Phytophthora can live for long periods in the soil without the presence of a host. During wet contitions, the zoospores swim towards host plants following chemical traces. Once a plant is infected, it cannot be &quot;cured&quot;, but may be sustained through foliar feeding for a time, depending on the host's natural resistance. 

[[Image:Phytophthora_life_cycle.png|360px|The life cycle of ''Phytophthora'']]
Phytophthora is easily spread by infected tools, and is often introduced through infected nursery stock. Spores and vegetative tissues can also be spread by animals or wind.

==Host Range==
''Phytophthoras'' are mostly pathogens of dicotyledons, and are relatively host specific parasites. Many species of ''Phytophthora'' are plant pathogens of considerable economic importance. ''Phytophthora infestans'' was the infective agent of the potato blight that caused the Irish potato famine.  Research beginning in the 1990s has placed some of the responsibility for European forest die-back on the activity of imported Asian ''Phytophthoras''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,tt4m2/panorama/artikel/951/52899/ &quot;Phytophthora: Asiatischer Pilz lässt die Bäume sterben&quot; ''Süddeutschen Zeitung'' 11 May 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Controls==
Plant diseases caused by this genus are difficult to control chemically, thus resistant cultivars are grown as a management strategy. 
{{Phytopathcontrol|
| Exclusion = 
| Cultivation = Some bacteria and fungi associated with composts can suppress the activity of soil-borne phytophthora.
| Cultural Controls = Raised beds and other techniques to improve drainage
| Physical Removal = 
| Chemical Controls (organic) = 
| Chemical Controls (synthetic) = 
| Biocontrols = 
| Disposal = Infected materials should not be composted

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Parts of Speech'''

Most grammar textbooks will consider eight basic parts of speech. These are summarized below:

*'''Nouns'''--naming words for a person, place, thing, or idea. These are declined into singular or plural forms and/or modified by prepositions.

*'''Pronouns'''--words which may replace a proper noun. All pronouns (other than &quot;I&quot;) require an antecedent. Antecedents may be added, as an apposition to a pronoun (e.g. You, Dennis Nedry; He, Johnny Appleseed; We, the jury; They, the developers; etc.). There are four kinds of pronoun--personal, demonstrative, reflexive, and relative. Personal pronouns replace the proper nouns by which something is called: &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;y'all&quot; (informally), and &quot;they&quot; are such pronouns. Demonstrative pronouns replace something to which someone or something has been referring: &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; are such pronouns. Reflexive pronouns allow a noun to be the direct object of the sentence in which it is already the subject. Reflexive pronouns are also placed alongside a pronoun to form the emphatic form of a pronoun. &quot;Myself&quot;, &quot;yourself&quot;, &quot;himself&quot;, &quot;herself&quot;, &quot;itself&quot;, &quot;ourselves&quot;, &quot;yourselves&quot;, and &quot;themselves&quot; are reflexive pronouns. (Emphatic pronouns are &quot;I myself&quot;, &quot;you yourself&quot;, &quot;he himself&quot;, &quot;she herself&quot;, &quot;it itself&quot;, &quot;we ourselves&quot;, &quot;you yourselves&quot;, and &quot;they themselves&quot;.). Relative pronouns are used to further describe a noun without the use of adjectives, participles, or a separate sentence: &quot;who&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, and &quot;which&quot; are relative pronouns.

*'''Adjectives'''--words which specify or further describe the nouns which they modify. Since English is a left-branching language, adjectives generally precede the nouns which they modify. However, appositions may be used to place adjectives after the nouns which they modify. Many participles are adjectives.

*'''Verbs'''--words which, in the active voice, describe an action performed by the grammatical subject of the sentence and which, in the passive voice, describe an action which is imposed upon the grammatical subject. Verbs are frequently combined with other verbs--especially the copulative verb BE--or with participles in the creation of certain tenses.

*'''Adverbs'''-- indeclinable words which primarily modify verbs but which may modify adjectives, other adverbs, or substantives (but only when it modifies an entire prepositional phrase or when it is an adverbial phrase). Adverbs describe the manner in which an action was done.

*'''Conjunctions'''--indeclinable words which link certain words to other words. Conjunctions may be coordinating (in which the words involved are of equal grammatical rank) or subordinating (in which the words involved in the prepositional phrase may not necessarily be of equal grammatical rank). Common conjunctions: and, or, but, nor, both...and, not only...but also, either...or, neither...nor, whether, whether or no, whether...or not, than, etc.]

*'''Prepositions'''--words which describe the location at which or in which an action is performed or takes place. Prepositions may be used to create adverbial phrases. Common prepositions: in, on, onto, into, unto, within, without, by, through, throughout, than (when combined with a relative pronoun; otherwise, this is an informal usage.), etc.

*'''Interjections'''--indeclinable words which primarily act independently of sentences. These words are used to express the feeling of something at a point in time. Depending upon the emphasis delegated by the speaker to the interjection, these may feature an exclamation point or a period; however, when acting within a sentence (such as responsive structure [&quot;No, I did not work today.&quot;]), it may feature a comma unless exceptional stress is delegated to it by the speaker (No! I did not work today, in which the first word of the succeeding sentence need not be capitalized. Common interjections: oh, ah, well, ahem, ha, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{HornNavGeneral}}
The horn's earliest known ancestor is a Norse battle horn, which was used as early as the 13th century has a shape more like a tuba. Sometime in the 16th century, this instrument migrated into France, and a modified version shaped more like the horn we know of today (with tubing that runs in a circle and a flared bell) appeared, and was used for signalling during hunting. This horn had a high, clear pitch that could carry for long distances, but its sound was harsh and not fit for a concert hall. In the late 17th century, Count Anton von Sprock, an eccentric German noble, heard the horn played during a hunt, and paid for a couple of people to be trained in the instrument. This began the horn's transition to a concert instrument.

The horn gradually was modified, through introduction tubing that got wider the farther it got from the mouthpiece and through modification of the metals that were used to make the horn, and transitioned into the Natural Horn. The Natural Horn was originally just used for as a special addition to the orchestra, but during the early 1700s composers began to include horn parts in most pieces, and the Horn became a part of the standard orchestra. The main difference between the Natural Horn and the modern Horn was lack of valves.

Since the Horn's partials are so close together, it is possible to get many different notes without modification of the instrument's lenght through valves. However, the Natural Horn could only be played in one key, and to avoid having to switch instruments in the middle of a concert, players began using ''crooks'', which were pieces of tubing that the hornist would attatch to the lead pipe, changing the length and modifying the key. The valves were invented in the early 19th century, and as early as the 1820s valves were integrated into Horns.

However, at this point the only valve that was used was the Piston Valve, similar to the valves of the Modern trumpet. On the horn, these valves were very awkward, and did not gain very many supporters. In the 1860s, though, the rotary valve was invented. These proved to be a much better match for the Horn, and they are still used today. Using valves produces a slightly different sound, though, so for older pieces many players still use Natural Horns.

Horn players switched to the valve very slowly. Even halfway into the 20th century, some schools mandated study of Natural Horn, and refused to accept valved horn players. However, at this point all Conservatories will train students to use the valved horn, although some still require students to learn Natural Horn along with the Valved Horn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">English features a loose conjugation and declension pattern. For this reason, subject-verb agreement is of paramount importance.

Subject-Verb agreement is a rule which states that the number present in a noun must agree with the number shown in the conjugated form of the verb that is being used, and that the person of the noun must agree with the person of the conjugated form of the verb that you are using.

Proper Subject-Verb agreement:
*'''TO BE''': I am - you are - he is - we are - you are - they are

*'''TO WORK''': I work - you work - he works - we work - you work - they work

Where the subject is a pronoun or complex or modified as part of an adjectival phrase, or modified by parenthetic expressions, or clarified in meaning by common knowledge or something that occurs later in the sentence, then subject-verb agreement can become a little more complicated. Some grammar rules say that the complex part of the subject closest to verb in the sentence should determine the verbal agreement. However, many examples can be found that make this sound funny. A better rule is to consider the entire complex subject phrase as one subject, and then think about what kind of thing it represents. 

The basic idea in idiomatic English is to make the verb agree with the idea that the subject REPRESENTS, which could have different plurality than the actual subject as a word. This is actually helpful in understanding meaning since it gives subject-verb agreement a role that is not simply redundant (in echoing the pluarity of the subject). Whatever the subject represents can be considered singular or plural, and that is what the verb should agree with.  

*The president and the children (plural) are at the party.
*Neither the president nor the children (plural) are at the party.
*Either the president or the children (plural) are at the party.
*Neither the children nor the president (plural) are at the party.
*Somebody (singular) is at the party.
*Nobody (singular) is at the party.
*We (plural 1st person) are at the party.
*I (singular 1st person) am at the party.
*The Three Musketeers (singular-book) is a good book.
*Ten dollars (singular) is enough to buy the book.
*Ten dollars (plural) are in my pocket.
*Economics (singular subject of study) is an interesting subject.
*Bryans and Hastings (singular supermarket) is a great place to shop.
*The idea of serving frankfurters (singular idea) is a good one.
*My sister is (singular) with my friend, Roberta, at the party.
*My sister and my friend are (both) at the party.

In many cases, the author decides whether the subject represents something singular or plural, depending upon which idea is desired to be expressed. For example, a group can act as a whole (singular) or as a group of individuals (plural), and despite many attempts at making rules for this, there is no simple rule that covers all cases:

*All of my family is going camping.
*Most of my family is at the party.
*All of my family are fans.
*Some of my family are fans.
*Most of my family is at the party.
*Most of my family are at the party.
*Some of my family are in their homes.
*The sounds the car makes, the ways they irritate (singular idea stated with 2 phrases)--it is all the same idea no matter how you say it.

Another needed example is one in which the noun that is clearly singular until the entire sentence is read, and something near the end changes the meaning of the noun so that it clearly represents a plural thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sound is a very important component to multimedia presentations.  It deserves as much attention and planning in its design as visual aspects do.  In Flash, sound can be used as effects for buttons or commands to enhance the navigational experience of the presentation, and it can also be used as music or narration enhancing the background feel.  In this chapter we will discuss the basics of importing sound into Flash, understanding sound on the timeline, and creating events and streaming audio.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For a cello player, basic left hand technique is the basic foundation of all playing. Correct left hand technique will facilitate intonation, and will allow you to play notes over the whole range of the cello.

The purpose of the fingers of the left hand is to hold down the string, changing the note you are playing by changing the length of the string that can vibrate. Therefore, when you press your finger down to play a note, make sure you are pressing the string down enough to prevent vibration. However, you do not need to press too hard; only enough to hold the string against the surface of the fingerboard.

When holding down a note, you should also try to keep as little of the finger in contact with the string as possible. This will create a sharper, less muddy tone. One way to accomplish this goal is to curve the fingers, and playing on the ends of finger instead of the pads, where there is less flesh between the surface and the bone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Systems with Recycle: a Cleaning Process ==

=== Problem Statement ===

{{example|Consider a process in which freshly-mined ore is to be cleaned so that later processing units do not get contaminated with dirt. 3000 kg/hr of dirty ore is dumped into a large washer, in which water is allowed to soak the ore on its way to a drain on the bottom of the unit. The amount of dirt remaining on the ore after this process is negligible, but water remains absorbed on the ore surface such that the net mass flow rate of the cleaned ore is 3100 kg/hr.

The dirty water is cleaned in a settler, which is able to remove 90% of the dirt in the stream without removing a significant amount of water. The cleaned stream then is combined with a fresh water stream before re-entering the washer.

The wet, clean ore enters a dryer, in which all of the water is removed. Dry ore is removed from the dryer at 2900 kg/hr.

The design schematic for this process was as follows:

[[Image:OreSchematic.PNG]]

''a)'' Calculate the necessary mass flow rate of fresh water to achieve this removal at steady state.

''b)'' Suppose that the solubility of dirt in water is &lt;math&gt; 0.4 \frac{g \mbox{ dirt}}{cm^3 \mbox{ H}_2O } &lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that the water leaving the washer is saturated with dirt, calculate the mass fraction of dirt in the stream that enters the washer (after it has been mixed with the fresh-water stream). }}

=== First Step: Draw a Flowchart ===

A schematic is given in the problem statement but it is very incomplete, since it does not contain any of the design specifications (the efficiency of the settler, the solubility of soil in water, and the mass flow rates). Therefore, ''it is highly recommended that you draw your own picture even when one is provided for you''. Make sure you label all of the streams, and the unknown concentrations.

=== Second Step: Degree of Freedom Analysis ===

*'''Around the washer''': 6 independent unknowns (&lt;math&gt;x_{O1}, \dot{m}_2, x_{D2}, \dot{m}_3, x_{D3}, x_{O4}&lt;/math&gt;), three independent mass balances (ore, dirt, and water), and one solubility. The washer has '''2 DOF'''.
*'''Around the dryer''': 2 independent unknowns (&lt;math&gt;x_{O4}, \dot{m}_5&lt;/math&gt;) and two independent equations = '''0 DOF'''.

{{NOTE|Since the dryer has no degrees of freedom already, we can say that ''the system variables behave as if the stream going into the dryer was not going anywhere'', and therefore this stream should not be included in the &quot;in-between variables&quot; calculation.}}

*'''Around the Settler''':5 independent unknowns (&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_3, x_{D3}, \dot{m}_7, \dot{m}_8, x_{D8}&lt;/math&gt;), two mass balances (dirt and water), the solubility of saturated dirt, and one additional information (90% removal of dirt), leaving us with '''1 DOF'''.
*'''At the mixing point''': We need to include this in order to calculate the total degrees of freedom for the process, since otherwise we're not counting m9 anywhere. 5 unknowns (&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_2, x_{D2}, \dot{m}_8, x_{D8}, \dot{m}_9&lt;/math&gt;) and 2 mass balances leaves us with '''3 DOF'''.

Therefore, Overall = 3+2+1 - 6 intermediate variables (not including xO4 since that's going to the dryer) = 0

The problem is well-defined.

=== Devising a Plan ===

Recall that the idea is to look for a unit operation or some combination of them with 0 Degrees of Freedom, calculate those variables, and then recalculate the degrees of freedom until everything is accounted for.

From our initial analysis, the dryer had 0 DOF so we can calculate the two unknowns xO4 and m5. Now we can consider xO4 and m5 known and redo the degree of freedom analysis on the unit operations.

*'''Around the washer''': We only have 5 unknowns now (&lt;math&gt;x_{O1}, \dot{m}_2, x_{D2}, \dot{m}_3, x_{D3} &lt;/math&gt;), but still only three equations and the solubility. '''1 DOF'''.
*'''Around the settler''': Nothing has changed here since xO4 and m5 aren't connected to this operation.
*'''Overall System''': We have three unknowns (&lt;math&gt;x_{O1}, \dot{m}_7, \dot{m}_9&lt;/math&gt;) since &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_5&lt;/math&gt; is already determined, and we have three mass balances (ore, dirt, and water). Hence we have '''0 DOF''' for the overall system.

Now we can say we know &lt;math&gt; x_{O1}, \dot{m}_7, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_9 &lt;/math&gt;.

*'''Around the settler again''': since we know m7 the settler now has '''0 DOF''' and we can solve for &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3, x_{D3}, \dot{m}_8, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_{D8} &lt;/math&gt;.

*'''Around the washer again''': Now we know m8 and xD8. How many balances can we write? 

{{NOTE|If we try to write a balance on the ore, we will find that ''the ore is already balanced because of the other balances we've done''. If you try to write an ore balance, you'll see you already know the values of all the unknowns in the equations. Hence we can't count that balance as an equation we can use (I'll show you this when we work out the actual calculation).}}

The washer therefore has 2 unknowns (m2, xD2) and ''2 equations'' (the dirt and water balances) = '''0 DOF'''

This final step can also be done by balances on the recombination point (as shown below). Once we have m2 and xD2 the system is completely determined.

=== Converting Units ===

The only given information in inconsistent units is the solubility, which is given as &lt;math&gt; 0.4 \frac{g \mbox{ dirt}}{cm^3 \mbox{ H}_2O } &lt;/math&gt;. However, since we know the density of water (or can look it up), we can convert this to &lt;math&gt; \frac{kg \mbox{ dirt}}{kg \mbox{ H}_2O } &lt;/math&gt; as follows:

&lt;math&gt; 0.4 \frac{g \mbox{ dirt}}{cm^3 \mbox{ H}_2O} * 1 \frac{ cm^3 \mbox{ H}_2O}{g \mbox{ H}_2O} 
= 0.4 \frac{ g \mbox{ dirt}}{g \mbox{ H}_2O} 
= 0.4 \frac{ kg \mbox{ dirt}}{kg \mbox{ H}_2O} &lt;/math&gt;

Now that this information is in the same units as the mass flow rates we can proceed to the next step.

=== Carrying Out the Plan ===

First, do any two mass balances on the dryer. I choose total and ore balances. Remember that the third balance is not independent of the first two!

* '''Overall Balance''': &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_4 = \dot{m}_5 + \dot{m}_6 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''Ore Balance''': &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_4*x_{O4} = \dot{m}_5*x_{O5} + \dot{m}_6*x_{O6} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the known values:

* Overall: &lt;math&gt; 3100 = \dot{m}_5 + 2900 &lt;/math&gt;
* Ore: &lt;math&gt; x_{O4}*3100 = 1*2900 &lt;/math&gt;

Solving gives:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_5 = 200 \frac{kg}{hr} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_{O4} = 0.935 \frac{kg}{hr} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Now that we have finished the dryer we do the next step in our plan, which was the overall system balance:

* '''Water Balance''': &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_9 = \dot{m}_5 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''Ore Balance''': &lt;math&gt; x_{O1}*\dot{m}_1 = \dot{m}_6 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''Dirt Balance''': &lt;math&gt; (1-x_{O1})*\dot{m}_1 = \dot{m}_7 &lt;/math&gt;

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_9 = 200\frac{kg}{hr} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x_{O1} = 0.967 &lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_7 = 100 \frac{kg}{hr} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Next we move to the settler as planned, this one's a bit trickier since the solutions aren't immediately obvious but a system must be solved.

* '''Overall Balance''': &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3 = \dot{m}_7 + \dot{m}_8 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''Dirt Balance''': &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3*x_{D3} = \dot{m}_7*x_{D7} + \dot{m}_8*x_{D8} &lt;/math&gt;
* '''Efficiency of Removal''': &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_7 = 0.9*\dot{m}_3*x_{D3} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the solubility is slightly tricky. You use it by noticing that ''the mass of dirt in stream 3 is proportional to the mass of water'', and hence you can write that:

* mass dirt in stream 3 = 0.4 * mass water in stream 3
* '''Solubility''': &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3*x_{D3} = 0.4*\dot{m}_3 * (1-x_{D3}) &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in known values, the following system of equations is obtained:

* &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3 = 100 + \dot{m}_8 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3*x_{D3} = 100 + \dot{m}_8*x_{D8} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3*x_{D3} = 111.11 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3*x_{D3} = 0.4*\dot{m}_3*(1-x_{D3}) &lt;/math&gt;

Solving these equations for the 4 unknowns, the solutions are:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3 = 388.89\frac{kg}{hr}, \dot{m}_8 = 288.89\frac{kg}{hr}, &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_{D3} = 0.286, x_{D8} = 0.0385 &lt;/math&gt;}}

Finally, we can go to the mixing point, and say:

* '''Overall''': &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_8 + \dot{m}_9 = \dot{m}_2 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''Dirt''': &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_8*x_{D8} = \dot{m}_2*x_{D2} &lt;/math&gt;

From which the final unknowns are obtained:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_2 = 488.89 \frac{kg}{hr}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_{D2} = 0.0229 &lt;/math&gt;}}

Since the problem was asking for &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_2 &lt;/math&gt;, we are now finished.

=== Check your work ===

These values should be checked by making a new flowchart with the numerical values, and ensuring that the balances on the washer are satisfied. This is left as an exercise for the reader.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first step to adding sound to Flash is importing a sound file.  Flash can import many different sound file types including MP3, WAV, AIF, and QuickTime.  Once imported these files will be compressed to .fla format in Flash before eventually becoming part of the final movie .swf file.  Although Flash can import and convert these file formats, its often better to convert your sound to MP3 before importing it into Flash.

In Flash, the simplest way to import a sound file into your library is to access the file menu and choose import, then import to library.  At this point the sound file is not a part of the timeline or the active layer of your presentation.  It remains in the library until you assign it to a keyframe, as an instance of that sound or if it is used in ActionScript.  Another method of importing sound files into Flash is by simply clicking and dragging the file from your desktop or file folder and placing it in the library or on the stage.

If you select the audio file in the library, you can click the play button located at the top of the window to sample the sound of the file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Adding Sound to a Button ==
One of the most common ways to incorporate sounds into an interactive movie or website is to attach a sound to a button.  Typically sounds are applied to either rolling over or pressing down on a button.  This can be done by adding a new layer to a button’s timeline.  Then you would add the keyframes for the beginning and ending of the sound.  After selecting the beginning keyframe, just drag the sound file from the library to the stage, and it will automatically appear in the timeline.  You will have several editing capabilities available to you in the Property inspector, such as; Sync, Repeat, Effect, and Edit.  These options will help you choose how you want your file to sound.
 
One of the newest functions found in Flash 8 for managing sound files in your presentation is the '''Behaviors menu'''.  This menu offers increased editing capabilities for loading and controlling sound files.  

Under the sound option there are five different menu tools.

''Load Sound from Library''

''Load streaming MP3 file''

''Play Sound''

''Stop all Sounds''

''Stop Sound''

== Event Sound Stop ==
If you need to stop an event sound you can do this a couple of different ways.  The first method is done by creating a Stop sound on a keyframe in the main timeline of the presentation.  Another option is creating a button, giving it an instance name, and then attaching a stop sound to its down state.

== Streaming MP3 ==
When you load a streaming MP3 the file will run directly from the Flash Player.  
When this occurs, MP3 files are accessed from a public web server rather than from the movie’s library.  The file begins playback as soon as there is enough information buffered into the Flash Player.  Another term for this kind of streaming is ''progressive download''.

Since streaming MP3s begin to playback automatically you will need to utilize ActionScript in order to play and/or stop the

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background Sound==
Another widely used option for adding sound to a Flash presentation is by adding continuous background music or narration.  This sound file would be placed on its own layer in the timeline.  You would just need to decide when you want the music to start and then place the file at that point on the timeline.

Another option is choosing Event from the Sync menu.  This will play the sound in its entirety at the first frame of the timeline.
Once added, your sound will be visible on the timeline in waveform. (see figure)

If you need to stop an event sound you can do this by placing an instance of the sound at the specific keyframe in which the sound should stop and select the Stop Sync option for the keyframe.  This will also stop all instances of that particular sound.

In a Flash movie, several sound layers can be played by the Flash Player at one time.  Flash acts like a sound mixer by mixing the sound layers as separate channels.  It is important to keep this in mind when adding multiple sound layers, as this may greatly increase your file’s size and slow down the performance of your computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using the oval tool creates perfectly smooth oval shapes that can be used in a variety of ways to produce and build on effects within the stage. To use the oval tool, you click and drag diagonally, moving the cursor around to test out the vertical and horizontal options of the shape. Creating a perfect circle is attained by holding down the shift key while moving the cursor to the desired size. The only unique effects used with the oval tool are fill and stroke effects.
The rectangle tool automatically creates perfectly parallel rectangles using the same method as clicking and dragging cursor to desired size while having the rectangle tool selected. The shift key in this instance creates a perfect square. The same fill and stroke effects are also applied to the rectangle tool.

Straightening allows many automatic shape, size, and form recognition, smoothing applies to rounded lines and the option of automatically joining end points, and drawing in ink allows the lines you draw no special effects, just appearing exactly how you draw them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One limitation of the new Drop shadow filter is that it does not have a built-in skew setting. 
The workaround for creating a drop-shadow with more depth illustrates how you can use the 
Hide object option and the Transform panel to enhance shadows created with the Drop 
shadow filter. Here are the steps: 

1. Place a Text fjeld, Movie Clip, or Button instance on the Stage. 

2. Create a new layer below the original content layer: Click the Insert Layer icon in the 
Timeline (or choose Insert ~ Timeline ~ Layer from the application menu). Drag the 
new layer to reorder it below the original layer in the layer stack. 

3. Copy the item from Step 1 to the new layer: Select the keyframe where the item exists 
and hold the Option key while dragging the keyframe content to the new layer, or select 
the item and use the copy command (Ctrl+C or W+Con Mac), then activate the new 
layer and use the Paste in Place command (Shift+Ctrl+V or Shift+W+Von Mac). 

4. Lock the original content layer. 

5. Select the duplicate item on the lower layer and use the Transform panel to apply a 
Horizontal stretch and skew. 

6. Open the Filters panel or activate the Filters tab in the Property inspector. 

7. Click the plus symbol and select Drop shadow from the filters list. In the Drop shadow 
settings, select the Hide object check box. Otherwise, the default settings are a good 
place to start. 

8. The default settings can be modified to create a softer shadow. 
As an example, the shadow Color can be changed to medium gray (#666666), the Strength 
can be set to 50 percent, and the Quality can be set to Medium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Applying Filters in Flash ==
Filters are a quick way to add some visual polish to your Flash designs. Instead of spending time editing shapes to make drop shadows of adjusting gradient fills to create bevels, you can apply live filters and use the pre-made settings to adjust the filter effect.
These filters are rendered “on the fly” and do not create new symbols and add them to your Library. You can also always edit your content, even with the filter effect applied. You can also edit and control your filters with Actionscript, but there are some quick and easy ways to apply filters in the authoring environment without any code. Filters are rendered in real time as you create them, so what you see is what you will get in the final movie.

== Blend Modes ==
Blend modes are a feature new to Flash 8. You may already be familiar with blend modes from using Photoshop or other image editing software. These blends are tools that render an image that is a mix of two overlapping images. With different types of blends, different pixel values will be generated. Blend modes can be applied to both Movie Clips and Button symbols using the Blend mode menu. This menu is located in the Properties panel. The blend image will affect any image underneath it, even if the images are on different layers.

==Combining Filters==
You can add multiple filters to one item and they will be rendered in the order they appear in 
the live list, from top to bottom. Changing the order of filters by dragging a filter name up or 
down in the live list will change the final result of the combined effect, but the settings for 
each filter will be preserved and editable. 

If you have created a special combination of filters or found a custom filter setting that you 
would like to reuse, the Presets option makes it easy to save and access your own list of 
filter effects.

To save a filter setting or filter combo to the presets menu, follow these steps: 

1. Select the item that has the filters and settings applied that you would like to save. 

All filters in the live list for the selected item will be saved with the preset - including any filters that are toggled off. When the custom filter is applied from the Presets menu to another item, the settings will be identical. 

2. In the Filters panel, click the plus icon (+) to invoke the filter menu , and from the Presets submenu, select Save As. 

3. Enter a name for your custom filter settings or filter combo and click OK. 

4. The named preset will be added to the bottom of the Presets submenu, along with any other saved Presets, and can be applied to other items.

After a Preset is applied to an item, the settings can be modified on that item without corrupting the saved Preset. Unfortunately, the Presets list doesn't have a centralized edit option, but you can select the Rename or Delete option from the Preset submenu to load your list of currently 
saved presets into dialog boxes that enable you to rename an item or remove an item from the list. If you'd like to share your filter presets with someone else, all you have to do is provide them with the XML file that is saved for each preset in theflashConfigurationfolder. The standard file paths saved filter presets are as follows: 

;Windows
:C: \Documents and Settings\username\Local Setti ngs\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash 8\language\Configuration\Filters\filtername.xml 

;Macintosh
:Macintosh HD/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Macromedia/Flash 8/language/Configuration/Filters/filtername.xml

Once the XML files are copied into the same location on someone else's computer, the presets will appear in her Presets menu when she starts flash 8. filter swapping is an easy way to share creative resources and to keep effects consistent for projects that rely on filters for a specific look. 

Although you may occasionally find it helpful to combine filters, it is best to try and achieve the result you want by first adjusting the settings of a single filter and/or modifying the symbol instance using the Color Effect settings in the Properties panel or the Transform tools. As with 
any intensive effect rendered at run time, multiple filters will have a negative impact on the performance of the published flash movie.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adobe has done a great deal of engineering to make it as easy as possible to combine 
filters with motion tweens for animated effects. The result is a very intuitive system that 
works behind the scenes to support tweens while preserving editable filter settings. 

Filters are not necessarily incompatible with shape tweens, but because filters can only be 
applied to symbols or text fields and shape tweens can only be applied to primitive shapes, 
filters and shape tweens never get a chance to work together. The only workaround for this 
rule is to create a shape tween inside of a Movie Clip and then apply a filter to the Movie 
Clip. In this case, the final visual result is a combination of a shape tween and a filter, but 
they remain on separate timelines. 
 
You can apply a filter to an item and then tween it, or you can select an item that has been 
tweened and add a filter to enhance the motion - in most cases, you'll get exactly the animated 
effect you were hoping for. The only time you'll need to know what is going on behind the 
scenes is when you don't get the result you want on the first try. 

Here are some notes that should help you troubleshoot if things go wrong when you try to 
combine filters and Motion tweens: 

+ Filters &quot;stick&quot; to symbol instances, so if you insert a keyframe (with the same content 
as the initial keyframe), and set up a Motion tween, the settings and the stacking order 
in the live list will automatically match in the first keyframe and the last keyframe of 
the tween. 

+ If you add a filter to a symbol in one keyframe of a tween, Flash automatically adds a 
matching filter with all the settings adjusted to create &quot;no effect&quot; to the symbol in the 
other keyframe. This is also called a &quot;dummy filter&quot; because it will have no visible 
effect on the symbol, but it is required to support the tween.

+ If you remove a filter from a symbol in one keyframe of a tween, Flash automatically 
clears the matching filter from the other keyframe. 

+ If you apply different filters (or different combinations of filters) on two different 
keyframes and then apply a tween, Flash will analyze the symbol with the most filters 
and apply dummy filters to the symbol in the other keyframe to support the tween. The 
visual difference between the two symbols will be interpolated in the span of the 
tween. 

+ You can modify filter settings to create a visual change from the first keyframe to the 
last keyframe in a Motion tween. The differences will be tweened evenly across the 
span unless you use easing to adjust the interpolation. 

+ The knockout and type of gradient (such as inner, outer, or full) filter settings will not 
interpolate properly as part of a tween if they are set differently on the beginning and 
end keyframes. If the filter options in the first keyframe and the end keyframe of a 
tween are inconsistent and cannot be interpolated properly, Flash will apply the 
options set in the first keyframe to the frames in the span of the tween.

      <text xml:space="preserve">By default, the interpolation of any differences in filter settings from the first keyframe to the 
last keyframe will match the interpolation of the motion tween - that is, the filters will 
change at the same rate as any other characteristics of the item that have been modified to 
create animation in the tween. General Easing settings (adjusted in the Property inspector) 
will be applied equally to all changes in the characteristics of an item. As we described in the 
previous chapter, if you need more precise control over the interpolation of different aspects 
of a tween, you can use Custom Easing to set unique curves for Position, Rotation, Scale, 
Color, and/or Filters. To access Custom Easing controls, select the first keyframe in the 
motion tween, then click the Edit button to the right of the Easing controls in the Property 
inspector. The easing Property menu at the top of the dialog box 
enables you to load a unique interpolation curve for each of the various properties that can. 
be animated in a tween. You can set a unique curve to apply to all properties, or set unique 
curves for selected properties, leaving the default curve for others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Adjust Color filter included in the Flash Filter panel loads a new set of controls for making 
color adjustment to Movie Clips, Button symbols, and text fields. The best way to explain these 
new controls is to compare them to standard Flash color settings. Some of these controls are 
unique and some replicate settings available in the Color Mixer panel (for primitive shapes and 
Drawing Objects) and/or in the Properties panel Color menu.

The controls enable various workflows for setting and adjusting color 
in the Flash authoring environment. In most cases, you will start with the Color Mixer panel 
(or Swatches panel) to choose and/or modify fill and stroke colors for initial primitive shapes 
or Drawing Objects. After the raw graphics are converted into reusable symbols, the Color 
controls available in the Property inspector and/or the Adjust Color filter can be applied to 
modify symbol instances without changing the original fill and stroke colors. The sliders and 
value fields for adjusting color with either of these options are easy to use and you will most 
likely achieve the result you want with just a little experimentation. However, there are important differences between the Color Properties settings and the new Adjust Color filter set- 
tings, and the interaction of,the different settings can become quite complex, To clarify the 
functions (and the advantages or limitations) of the various settings available with these two 
options, we have included a brief section for each.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most broadly useful tool introduced to Flash with the new filters feature is the Adjust 
Color filter. 

Finally, you can make subtle adjustments (on an instance level) to Movie Clips, Button symbols, 
and text fields, without having to go back to the Color Mixer panel and change the stroke and 
fill colors of the original symbol. Unlike the Color control options in the Properties panel, the 
Adjust Color option in the Filters panel makes it easy to combine different types of color trans- 
formation without manually adjusting individual RGBvalues. By default, all settings are loaded 
as &quot;neutral&quot; - sliders are set to 0 so that no color transformation is visible on the selected item 
when the filter is first applied. Color transformations are applied for instant visual feedback as 
the slider controls or text values are adjusted. Filters apply on an instance level, and settings 
can be modified at any time by selecting an instance and choosing Adjust Color from the live 
filter list in the Filters panel. The following values can be applied individually or in combination 
to Movie Clips, Button symbols, and text fields: 

Brightness: Alters the RGBvalues for the original color to make it appear lighter or 
darker without changing the hue. The range for filter Brightness is -100 to + 100. The 
default or no change value is O.The numeric value that appears in the Brightness field is 
added to the RGBvalues of the original color to create a new shade, within the minimum 
and maximum values of 0 and 255, respectively. For example, a red fill (255, 0, 0) set to 
+50 brightness will be transformed into light red (255, 50, 50). The same red fill (255, 0, 
0) set to -50 brightness will be transformed into dark red (205, 0, 0). The results of adjusting 
Brightness in the Filters panel are different than the results of adjusting Brightness in the Properties panel. 

Contrast: At the minimum contrast setting of -100, all RGBvalues are forced to 64,64, 
64, making everything medium gray. The RGBvalues at the maximum contrast setting 
of 100 will vary depending on the original colors, but they will be forced closer to 0 or 
255. The default or no change value is O.The greater the numeric difference between 
RGBvalues, the greater the amount of contrast. In visual terms, light colors get lighter 
and dark colors get darker as contrast is increased, whereas all colors are brought 
closer to medium gray as contrast is decreased. 

Saturation: Saturation can also be thought of as the intensity or purity of color. At the 
minimum saturation setting of -100, the image will be rendered in grayscale with no 
color intensity-similar to the hues found closer to the bottom of the color selection 
field in the Color Mixer. At the maximum saturation setting of 100, the colors will be as 
intense or as close to pure color as possible-similar to the hues found closer to the 
top of the color selection field in the Color Mixer panel. 

Hue: The Hue slider has a different range than the other Adjust Color filter sliders. To 
span the full range of the 360-degree color wheel, the slider values are from -180 to 
180. The default or no change value is O. If you were looking at a real color wheel, 
reducing the hue value would be equivalent to moving counterclockwise around the
wheel, while increasing the hue value would be equivalent to moving clockwise around 
the wheel. At either extreme ( - 180 or 180), the resulting color would be directly opposite the original color on the color wheel. The relationship of colors directly opposite 
on the color wheel is known as complementary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Color menu in the 
Property inspector provides some options for modifying the appearance of symbol instances 
without changing the original symbol stored in the Library. After a Color adjustment type is 
selected from the Color drop-down menu, the controls needed to apply the color adjustment 
appear in the Property inspector. By default, &quot;neutral&quot; settings (O-percent change) are loaded 
as a starting point. After the values for a property are modified, they will be stored and 
loaded as the default when you select another instance. The settings loaded in the Property 
inspector for the items in the Color menu are simple and intuitive and enable you to make 
basic color adjustments using familiar controls: 

Brightness: The Brightness Color property has the same range as the Brightness slider 
in the Adjust Color filter (-100 to 100); however, as we described previously, the 
Brightness property creates more drastic color transformations because it is applied as 
a relative or percentage-based value. At the minimum Brightness setting (-100), all RGB 
values are forced to black (0,0,0), and at the maximum Brightness setting (100), all RGB 
values are forced to white (255,255,255). 

Tint: The color theory definition of a tint is a color produced by adding white to a pure 
color. The Tint property in flash enables you to select any color (not just white) to 
&quot;mix&quot; with the original color. You can also select how much of the new color you want 
to mix with your original colors-from the lowest setting of 0 percent to the maximum 
setting of 100 percent. At the minimum setting, the original colors will be unchanged. 
At the maximum setting, the new tint color will completely replace all of the original 
colors. At the default setting of 50 percent, the rendered color values will be an even 
mix of the original colors and the selected tint color. 

Alpha: This setting controls how opaque the selected instance will be. The values that 
control alpha are counter-intuitive (as they are in the Color Mixer). At the minimum 
alpha level of 0 percent, the item will be transparent. At the maximum alpha level of 100 
percent, the item will be fully opaque or &quot;solid.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you use Photoshop or other image editing applications, you may be familiar with using blend modes, although for many 
people this remains a somewhat mysterious tool. Blends are rendering tools that analyze the 
pixel values of overlapping images (the blend image and the underlying base images) to create 
a rendered image that is a mix of the two. The type of blend applied will determine the formula 
used to generate the pixel values in the combined image. Blend modes can be applied to 
Movie Clip and Button symbol instances in the authoring environment using the Blend mode 
menu in the Properties panel . The blend image will interact with any 
underlying images that it overlaps - even if they are not on the same layer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alpha and Erase blends are a great complement to Flash's standard masking tools-which 
can be counter-intuitive at times. If you want to create a cutout in a shape using a traditional 
mask, you actually have to create a shape on a mask layer that covers all the areas except the 
area you wish to cut out. If you have been working in Flash for a while, this workflow is proba- 
bly second nature, but when it comes to more subtle mask effects, like gradients or irregular 
shapes, it can be a headache to have to reverse-engineer a mask graphic. With Alpha blends, 
what you see is what you get - or rather, what you don't see is what you won't get! The steps 
for creating a compound blend are as follows: 

1. Create a Movie Clip with content that will function as the base image (or convert an 
existing graphic that you want to mask into a Movie Clip). 

2. Open the Movie Clip in Edit mode to access the Movie Clip timeline: Double-click an 
instance on the Stage or the symbol name in the Library list. 

3. Create a new layer on the Movie Clip timeline above the existing content that will be 
the base image for the Alpha or Erase blend. To protect the base image(s), you may 
want to lock all layers but the new layer. 

4. In the new layer, create a graphic that will act as a mask- blend masks are the oppo- 
site of normal Flash layer masks in that the content in the Alpha or Erase blend symbol 
instance will define an area to make invisible in the base image rather than define an 
area to make visible.

5. Convert the content on the blend layer into a Movie Clip or Button symbol. 

6. Select the symbol instance and position it on the Stage (still on the base image Movie 
Clip timeline) to overlap the base image so that it defines the area you want to Erase or 
Alpha out, then use the Blend menu in the Properties panel to apply an Alpha or Erase 
blend mode. The content of the blend image will disappear, but don't panic-continue 
to the next step to complete the compound blend. 

7. Return to the Main Timeline: Double-click an empty area of the Stage or use the Scene 
button above the Timeline. 

8. Select the parent symbol instance (that contains your base image and the currently 
invisible blend image), and use the Blend menu to apply a Layer blend. (If you opened 
the base symbol from the Library in Step 2, make sure you have an instance dragged 
onto the Stage on the Main Timeline so you can apply the Layer blend mode to the 
instance.) 

9. Voila!You should see the content of your blend image punched out (Erase blend) or 
rubbed out (Alpha blend) of the base image-either the background color of the Flash 
movie or any underlying images on the Stage will be visible through the empty areas 
created in the base image. 

In addition to supporting a more intuitive workflow for creating masks and enabling Alpha- 
based masks, compound blends can be used to create animated transition effects. Continue 
to the next section if you would like to try using an Alpha blend to create an animated color 
fade effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following example uses an animated Alpha blend to selectively fade out a black and white 
image to reveal a color image. The trick for this effect is to use two instances of the same 
color image, with the Adjust Color filter applied to make one instance a grayscale version. 
There are a lot of steps, but the final file structure is straightforward and the effect is pretty 
cool, so let's get started: 

1. Open a new Flash document. 

2. Import a color bitmap and convert it to a Movie Clip (or place an existing Movie Clip 
instance on the Stage - preferably one with bright colors). 

3. Place two instances of the Movie Clip on the Stage so that they are layered and aligned- 
select both instances and use the Vertical Center and Horizontal Center align commands.

4. Select the topmost Movie Clip instance and use the Adjust Color filter to set the 
Saturation of the image to -IOO-this will drain the color out so that it looks grayscale. 

5. With the grayscale Movie Clip instance still selected, use the Blend menu in the 
Properties panel to apply Layer blend mode. You won't see any visible change yet. 

6. Double-click the grayscale Movie Clip instance to access the Movie Clip timeline in Edit 
mode. 

7. Create a new layer at the top of the layer stack in the Movie Clip Timeline. Lock the 
other layer(s) with the bitmap or graphics you plan to use as a base image. 

8. Select the Oval tool (0) in the Tools panel and set the Fill color to use a default radial 
gradient. Use the Color Mixer panel to apply 0 percent Alpha to the right color anchor. 
This should create a circular gradient fill that has a transparent center that fades out to 
black. Set the stroke color to None. 

9. Click and drag on the Stage to create a circle that covers only a small area in the center 
of the original image-in our file, the circle image was 100 x 100 pixels. 

10. Select the new circle and convert it into a Movie Clip named alpha circle. 

11. Use the Blend menu in the Properties panel to apply Alpha blend mode to the alp ha 
c i r c 1e Movie Clip instance. The circle Movie Clip will disappear, but don't panic. As 
you can see by the filled keyframe on the layer, the content is still there and you can 
select it to see the selection outline for the invisible instance.

12. Double-click the alp hac i r c 1e instance to access the Movie Clip timeline and insert 
frames (F5) to extend the span of the circle graphic to frame 20. Convert frame 20 into a 
keyframe (F6). 

13. Select the circle graphic in keyframe 20 and use the Transform panel to increase the 
size of the circle so that it is larger than the bitmap base image. We scaled the circle up 
to 400 x 400 pixels. 

14. Select keyframe 1 (still in the alpha circle timeline), and apply a Motion tween to ani- 
mate the small circle scaling up to the size of the larger circle in frame 20. 

15. In order to see the Alpha blend applied as a mask, you have to return to the Main 
Timeline (click the Scene button). 

16. The grayscale bitmap image should now have an area in the center that is &quot;erased&quot; in a 
soft, gradient circle that allows some of the color image to show through. 

17. The animated effect will only be visible in the published .swf file or the Test movie environment. 
Use Ctrl + Return or 3C + Return to test the file and preview the animation. 

You can always go back inside the nested symbols to modify the level of alpha in the blend 
image or change the style of fill from a radial gradient to a linear gradient or even a solid fill 
(with alpha set to less than 100 percent). The level of masking will match the level of alpha in 
the contents of the Alpha blend symbol instance. Alpha blends can be used to mask any type
of image-even bitmaps or primitive shapes. The only requirement is that the Alpha blend 
must be applied to a symbol instance and that symbol instance must be nested inside a Movie 
Clip with a Layer blend applied. This is just one way of using a blend mode to create an inter- 
esting visual effect. There are many other possibilities, and once you understand the workflow 
for applying basic and compound blends, the rest is just a matter of experimentation!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just a comment or two:

The Formula Practice problem 1 is badly worded.  The wording says &quot;... is the formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa. What would the temperature in Fahrenheit if it was 25 Celsius Degrees?&quot;   Of course, the specific formula really only converts one way.. it needs to be rearranged to go vice versa.  The wording of the example question is also a bit clumsy and is, I think, missing a &quot;be&quot;.

I'd suggest: &quot;.. is the formula to convert a temperature from degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit.  Using the formula, what would be the Fahrenheit equivalent of 25 degrees Celsius?&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Habermas's Writing Style ==

What philosophical theories have in common is &quot;the intention of thinking being or the unity of the world by way of explicating reason's experience of itself.&quot;

The premise that reason can have experiences is not intuitively obvious.  Nor is the premise that reason would be able to directly experience itself -- as distinct from, say, its interpretation of itself.

We set the tone, here, for a hard slog.

'''Figgie 'obbin''', also '''Figgie Hobbin''', is an old Cornish recipe.

==Ingredients==

* 2 parts [[Cookbook:Flour|self raising flour]] (or plain flour &amp; baking powder)
* 2 parts [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] (and/or [[Cookbook:Sultanas|sultanas]] if desired)
* 1 part 50/50 mix of [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] &amp; [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]], i.e. half the weight of the flour in total.
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] or [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==

# Rub the [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]], fat and flour together.
# Mix in the raisins, and add enough water or milk to make a stiff dough.
# Roll out to about an inch thick. Press gently into a prepared shallow baking tin or dish.
# Bake in a [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|hot oven]] for about 35-45 minutes.
(Good served hot with [[Cookbook:Clotted Cream|clotted cream]], burnt cream or [[Cookbook:Custard|baked custard]], or cold with tea or coffee or cocoa.)

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* Currants and/or sultanas may be mixed with, or substituted for, raisins. 
* Vegetable-suet and vegetable-lard, or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], can be used instead of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]] [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] and [[Cookbook:Dripping|dripping]], this will give a lighter cake.

== Notes ==
* Figgie/Fig/Figs are Cornish dialect words pertaining to raisins
* ''from'' Perranporth W.I. ''in'' Cornish Recipes, Ancient &amp; Modern, 22nd Edition, The Cornwall Federation of Women's Institutes 1965.
''First collected &amp; published by'' Edith Martin, Tregavethan, Truro, 1929, for The Cornwall F. of W. I.

The '''Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model''' (''OSI Reference Model'' or ''OSI Model'' for short) is a layered, abstract description for communications and computer network protocol design, developed as part of the Open Systems Interconnection initiative. It is also called the '''OSI seven layer model'''.

==History==
In 1977, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), began to develop its Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) networking suite. OSI has two major components: an abstract model of networking (the Basic Reference Model, or seven-layer model), and a set of concrete protocols. The standard documents that describe OSI are for sale and not currently available online.

Parts of OSI have influenced Internet protocol development, but none more than the abstract model itself, documented in ISO 7498 and its various addenda. In this model, a networking system is divided into layers. Within each layer, one or more entities implement its functionality. Each entity interacts directly only with the layer immediately beneath it, and provides facilities for use by the layer above it. Protocols enable an entity in one host to interact with a corresponding entity at the same layer in a remote host.

===Layer 7: Application layer===

The '''Application layer''' is the seventh level of the seven-layer OSI model. It interfaces directly to and performs common application services for the application processes; it also issues requests to the presentation layer.

The common application layer services provide semantic conversion between associated application processes. Note: Examples of common application services of general interest include the virtual file, virtual terminal, and job transfer and manipulation protocols.

The application layer of the TCP/IP models corresponds to a mixing of the application, presentation, and session layers in the OSI models.

The user always interacts with application layer. This layer provides protocol and services for user.

===Layer 6: Presentation layer===
The '''Presentation layer''' transforms data to provide a standard interface for the Application layer. [ MIME] encoding, data encryption and similar manipulation of the presentation is done at this layer to present the data as a service or protocol developer sees fit. Examples of this layer are converting an EBCDIC- text file to an ASCII-coded file, or serializing object and other data structures into and out of XML.
http protocol works in presentation layer.

===Layer 5: Session layer=== 
The '''Session layer''' controls the dialogues/connections (sessions) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. It provides for either full-duplex or half-duplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. The OSI model made this layer responsible for &quot;graceful close&quot; of sessions, and also for session checkpointing and recovery. 

In the TCP/IP model, &quot;graceful close&quot;, and other connection related parts, are part of the Transport layer.

===Layer 4: Transport layer===
The '''Transport layer''' provides transparent transfer of data between end users, thus relieving the upper layers from any concern while providing reliable data transfer. The transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state and connection oriented. This means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and retransmit those that fail. 

The best known example of a layer 4 protocol is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The transport layer is the layer that converts messages into TCP segments or User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), etc. Perhaps an easy way to visualize the Transport Layer is to compare it with a Post Office, which deals with the dispatching and classification of mail and parcels sent.

===Layer 3: Network layer===
The '''Network layer''' provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source to a destination via one or more networks while maintaining the quality of service requested by the Transport layer. The Network layer performs network routing functions, and might also perform segmentation/desegmentation, and report delivery errors.  Routers operate at this layer—sending data throughout the extended network and making the Internet possible. This is a logical addressing scheme – values are chosen by the network engineer. The addressing scheme is hierarchical.

The best known example of a layer 3 protocol is the Internet Protocol (IP). Perhaps it's easier to visualize this layer as the actual Air Mail or Consolidated Carrier that transfers the mail from Point A to Point B.
 
The network layer is responsible for getting the packets to the remote host.

===Layer 2: Data Link layer===
The '''Data Link layer''' provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the Physical layer.  The best known example of this is Ethernet. Other examples of data link protocols are HDLC and ADCCP for point-to-point or packet-switched networks and Aloha for local area networks. On IEEE 802 local area networks, and some non-IEEE 802 networks such as FDDI, this layer may be split into a Media Access Control (MAC) layer and the IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) layer. It arranges bits from physical layer into logical chunks of data, known as frames. The Data Link Layer's job is to move the data to the next hop.

This is the layer at which the bridges and switches operate.  Connectivity is provided only among locally attached network nodes forming layer 2 domains for unicast or broadcast forwarding.

===Layer 1: Physical layer===
The '''Physical layer''' defines all the electrical and physical specifications for devices. This includes the layout of pins, voltages, and cable specifications. Ethernet hubs, repeaters, network adapters and Host Bus Adapters.  The major functions and services performed by the physical layer are:

*Establishment and termination of a connection to a communications medium.
*Participation in the process whereby the communication resources are effectively shared among multiple users. For example, contention resolution and flow control.
*Modulation, or conversion between the representation of digital data in user equipment and the corresponding signals transmitted over a communications channel. These are signals operating over the physical cabling (such as copper and optical fiber) or over a radio link.

Parallel SCSI buses operate in this layer.  Various physical-layer Ethernet standards are also in this layer; Ethernet incorporates both this layer and the data-link layer.  The same applies to other local-area networks, such as Token ring, Fiber distributed data interface (FDDI), and IEEE 802.11, as well as personal area networks such as Bluetooth and IEEE 802.15.4.

== Interfaces ==

In addition to standards for individual protocols in transmission, there are also interface standards for different layers to talk to the ones above or below (usually operating-system–specific). For example, Microsoft Windows' Winsock, and Unix's Berkeley sockets and System V Transport Layer Interface, are interfaces between applications (layers 5 and above) and the transport (layer 4). Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) and Open Data-Link Interface (ODI) are interfaces between the media (layer 2) and the network protocol (layer 3).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Outline of Habermas’s ''Theory of Communicative Action,''
based upon an interpretation of A. Brand (1990), ''The Force of Reason: An Introduction to Habermas’ Theory of Communicative Action''. Sydney: Allen &amp; Unwin.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
== Introduction ==

Habermas believes that reason operates in history.  As Hegel put it, “Reason rules the world.”  But for Habermas, this does not mean that humans are determined by Absolute Spirit.  Rather, it means people have a capacity for rationality.  Rationality is inherent in language, and language is how “communicative” action takes places.

People begin by using sacred symbols in ritual ways.  But social integration eventually becomes less a matter of sacred symbolism, and more a matter of communicative action.  Passive subjugation to religious tradition becomes replaced with shared, rationally motivated understanding.  This is the process of “rationalization.”  Language is a key part of the process.  Language pushes in the direction of shared understanding.

There is a collective learning process.  Communicative rationality advances through that process.  Ethical progress results.  Law is the best example of that progress.

The Frankfurt School shared Weber’s pessimism about progress.  Those thinkers erred in neglecting certain important aspects of rationality.  This happened because they were too preoccupied with consciousness.

Progress is not inevitable.  Communicative rationality is not guaranteed.  It depends on historical chance.  There is a difference between what could have happened (according to logic) and what actually happens (because of events).

Our world has experienced a loss of freedom and meaning.  This is because western society has been experiencing two distinct rationalization processes.  First is the Lifeworld process.  A Lifeworld has social, cultural, and personal dimensions.  The social dimension is the one we are talking about here.  On the social level, the Lifeworld process refers to the complete set of human relations in society, which are organized by communicative action.

Society perpetuates itself in two ways.  One is symbolic.  Through language, society reproduces its symbols.  This is what happens in the Lifeworld.

The other way in which society perpetuates itself is material.  By setting up certain action-oriented subsystems – especially government and the capitalist market – society arranges for physical preservation.  These subsystems are part of a larger System.  The System is the second of the two rationalization processes mentioned above.

The rationalization that occurs in the System is rationalization of the Lifeworld.  This occurs especially through law. 

The capitalist market generates crises and social tensions.  The System expands to counteract these crises and tensions.  When it expands, the System damages the Lifeworld.  It “colonizes” it.

At the point of damage, shared understanding is no longer occurring through language (particularly the language of law).  Instead, it is happening through the action-oriented systems just mentioned, i.e., government and the market.  The complexity of these systems frustrates the attempt to rely on language for shared understanding.

In government and the market, people and actions are held together, not by the quest for shared understanding through language, but rather through power and money.  Capitalist markets expand in order to counteract the problems caused by capitalist exploitation.

The market expands into the Lifeworld’s sphere of symbolic (i.e., non-material) reproduction.  This damages the Lifeworld by crippling its ability to maintain its integration through communicative action.  Social pathology (e.g., loss of meaning) results.

This is not the only possible outcome.  The System is not necessarily evil.  It becomes dangerously bloated only when the Lifeworld ceases to control it.  The Lifeworld fails to exercise that control when it loses its perspective on what is happening in the big picture.  That loss of perspective occurs because society’s accumulated knowledge is not being effectively shared.  That happens because knowledge becomes buried among the experts and is not broadly available.  The result is fragmented consciousness.

People should take the position of participants – they should use communicative rationality – when trying to understand the Lifeworld.  But they should take the position of outside observers – they should use functional rationality – when trying to understand the System.  Critical theory seeks to reconstruct basic communication.

== Transition from Previous Views == 

Horkheimer and Weber agreed that rationalization led to a loss of meaning and freedom.  They said the decline in religion meant a decline in religion’s ability to hold society together.  Science was not the answer:  it could not explain the world’s existence, or how humanity fits into the grand scheme of things.

Lukács pointed out that, in capitalist production, social relations became more like the relations among things.  People began to take mechanical, calculating attitudes toward themselves and one another.  They used “identifying” thought; that is, they approached things from an instrumental perspective.  Science was their guide in this; it was their ideology.

Positivism held that knowledge is a relation between an objectively known object and a knowing subject.  The solitary, knowing subject’s relation to objects was to know them and to manipulate them.  This was a philosophy of consciousness, in which the important relationship was the subject-object relationship, i.e., a focus upon the conscious manipulation of things.  

Early critical theory failed because it adopted a basically positivist perspective.  For example, Weber focused on the isolated actor.  This approach is “goal-rational” rather than “communication-rational.”  It reflects a flawed epistemology:  that is, it has a mistaken idea about what knowledge is and where it comes from.

Positivism ran into the problem that there are no theory-free observational statements.  Even basic statements about objects rest upon assumptions and hypotheses.  Basic statements make sense, not because they are foundational, but because the consensus of scientists is that they make sense.  

Thus, philosophical reason leads us to see that these questions of truth arise from historical and sociological developments.  In other words, reason is a result of sociohistorical processes; and yet, in saying so, philosophical reason is once again trying to pretend that it occupies an observational position above history and sociology.

Instead, Habermas suggests, reason is found in subject-subject relations, in which people achieve shared understanding of the meaning behind subject-object cognition and manipulation.  This calls for an entirely different perspective.

A positivist might say that a focus on subject-subject relations would allow arbitrary issues, involving norms and values, to enter into the objective world of science.  Habermas says there is no objective world of science as the positivist conceives it.  Instead, what is happening is that norms and values (and inner states and feelings) are now seen to be within the realm of science too.  The zone of rationality is far larger than we previously thought.

Animals have the ability to communicate and to convey facts.  The human use of language goes beyond that.  As soon as a person uses language, s/he implies that s/he is participating in a common human effort to achieve consensus.  (Of course, consensus requires freedom to express one’s views.)

In the ideal speech situation, communication shows its full potential for rationality.  An ideal speech situation can occur if everyone has a fair and equal chance to participate in discussion.  Language contains a built-in orientation toward achieving ideal speech situations.  This is ahistorical; it is there for people of all eras.

== Action and Communicative Rationality == 

Shared understanding is achieved intersubjectively, i.e., among subjects.  Upon achieving shared understanding, people can undertake coordinated action.

Action that focuses on achieving shared understanding is “communicative action.”  By contrast, action that focuses on achieving success is “strategic” if it is oriented toward subjects, and “instrumental” if oriented toward objects.  In communicative action, people exchange language (or nonverbal forms of expression) to persuade one another and reach understanding.

In the market and the government, action is coordinated strategically to achieve individuals’ complementary but egocentric goals.  People might also pursue personal goals when they participate in communicative action; but those goals are pursued within the context of consensus.

Communication-rationality, on the large scale, entails the belief that everyone is getting a fair outcome.  The market is not structured toward equality, however, but rather toward goal-rational activity that benefits oneself privately.  The action decision rests upon material (i.e., empirical) influences – not on validity claims, expressed in language, that are capable of being critiqued.

There are three kinds of criticizable validity claims.  Each refers to a separate world.  Thus, in addition to its flawed epistemology (above), goal-rationality also has a flawed ontology (i.e., a mistaken understanding of reality).

Communication-rationality and goal-rationality agree that there are (1) truth claims, which refer to an objective world.  But communication-rationality also says there are (2) normative claims, which refer to the social world, where interpersonal relationships are regulated, and (3) subjective claims, which refer to the individual’s personal experiences.

These three kinds of validity claims occupy separate ontological worlds, in the sense that they supply three different perspectives on the attempt to reach shared understanding regarding a situation.  These three perspectives correspond to the grammatical third person (i.e., “he,” “she”, or “it” or, in the plural, “they”), second person (i.e., “you,” whether singular or plural), and first person (i.e., “I” or “we”).  In other words, when we talk about “it,” we are speaking objectively, in a third-person perspective.  When we talk about “you,” we are speaking normatively (e.g., “you should do that”).  And when we talk about ourselves (“I”), we are speaking subjectively.

Chomsky invented a concept of “linguistic competence.”  Linguistic competence means you have a limited number of words in a language, an ability to arrange those words in an unlimited number of ways, and an ability to decide whether each of those infinitely many sentences conforms to the rules of the language.  Habermas invents “communicative competence” for a similar purpose:  you have the ability to apply rules regarding the use of sentences in communication.  We rely on those rules to figure out which world a statement is referring to.

There are two levels of communication:  discourse (i.e., verbal discussion) and communicative action.  Discourse is communication that tries to convert everything to verbal terms.  Validity claims (regarding e.g., your subjective perspective) can be put forth on the level of action; but in theory those actions can also be explored verbally, and vice versa.

There is a difference between true consensus and forced or pretended consensus.  Discourse can lead to true consensus.  Getting there requires the availability of an ideal speech situation (above) that allows discussion as needed.  These speech situations combine, over centuries, to create a situation where the structure of speech contains human rationality.

So we can describe communicative competence (above) as the ability to achieve rationality via language.  It includes the ability to choose the right kind of discourse for a situation.  We use theoretical discourse to discuss the objective world; we use practical discourse to discuss the normative, social world; and we use _____ discourse to discuss the subjective world.

In theoretical discourse, we talk about what is true.  In practical discourse, we talk about what is right.  In subjective discourse, we talk about ____.

Austin originated the idea of the speech act.  You utter something.  If your utterance states a meaningful proposition, then it is “locutionary.”  But your utterance also typically performs an action:  it makes a promise, or expresses a feeling.  Austin described this speech act, this performative aspect, as being “illocutionary.”

So language does a lot more than just make statements about the objective world as imagined by the positivist and the “philosophy of consciousness.”  The speech act (i.e., the illocutionary part) provides the valuable service of indicating what kind of validity claim is being made.  How should we interpret a statement?  The speech act tells us whether the proposition pertains to the objective, normative, or subjective world.

Austin distinguished locutions and illocutions from perlocutions.  You could say, “I will not go there.”  That is a locution.  You could rephrase it as, “I promise that I will not go there.”  This is an illocution.  But suppose you are lying.  You will actually go there, despite your promise.  You cannot say, “I am now deceiving you by promising I will not go there.”  Doing so would defeat your purpose.

Unlike the locution and the illocution, this perlocution (i.e., saying you will not go there, when you plan to do so) consists, not of the actual verbal content of the statement, but rather of the effect that you intend to bring about (i.e., deception).  In the perlocution, you have concealed your actual goal.  To achieve shared understanding, you need illocutions.  The existence of perlocutions shows that the speech acts belong to strategic, not communicative, action.

In genuine communicative action, illocutionary goals are the subject of open discussion, and they can change as participants keep reorienting themselves with respect to the validity claims that the other participants are making.  But perlocutionary goals do not necessarily change as reason would dictate.  The pursuit of concealed strategic goals depends – is parasitic – upon others’ use of language in communi¬cative action toward shared understanding.

In addition to communicative and strategic action, which are oriented socially (i.e., toward subjects), there is instrumental action, which is oriented toward objects.  It can be assessed in terms of the efficiency of its intervention in the physical world.  Thus communicative action is the only form, of the three, that is oriented toward shared understanding rather than toward achieving predetermined results.

== Interpretive Understanding and the Lifeworld == 

Society is not just a large discussion.  For one thing, many communications are nonverbal.  More importantly, communication has the effect of coordinating action; it has implications for action.  People understand the meaning of a claim presented in a speech act.  They affirm or dissent.  If they affirm, they act in response to socially imposed obligations.  If they dissent, they may end the interaction, or may proceed with discussion that may result in one or more parties changing their positions.

We understand the claim presented in a speech act when we believe the speaker could present convincing reasons for that claim.  Through this understanding, an illocution coordinates action.  One kind of convincing reason is logical; another kind has official authorization (e.g., police).  The thing that you understand may be the logic; or, in the latter case, you have a regulative speech act, and you are persuaded to do what the man says despite your lack of any knowledge that would explain his command.

“Constative” speech acts refer to the objective world.  “Regulative” speech acts refer to the normative world.  “Expressive” speech acts refer to the subjective world.  If I say I hate chicken, I am expressing an internal, subjective state.  Its truth can be tested by my behavior (e.g., I do not eat chicken).

An imperative (i.e., a command) is a matter of strategic, not communicative, action.  To be communicative, there must be a presentation of a claim that could be defended with reasons, so that agreement may result.

Shared understanding is achieved through communicative action when all three worlds are involved in an interpersonal relation.  On the objective level, there is a sharing of what is believed to be true knowledge about the world.  On the normative level, the speaker has tried to perform a speech act that is appropriate for the situation.  On the subjective level, the speaker generates trust by appearing to have stated his/her true belief or feeling.  In this way, speech acts enhance interpersonal relations.  They can also be challenged when one of these three aspects seems to be missing.

Communicative action that is oriented toward shared understanding tends to involve all three worlds.  But it is possible to have relatively pure types of communicative action that consist primarily of speech acts oriented toward just one of the three worlds.  Conversation consists primarily of constative speech acts; norm-regulated action consists primarily of regulative speech acts; and dramaturgical action consists primarily of expressive speech acts.

Each of these three kinds of action can be judged or challenged against the corresponding standard.  The same is true of the fourth type of action, namely, teleological or goal-oriented (i.e., strategic or instrumental) action (i.e., goal-rationality).  The standard for each is:  teleological speech acts should be effective; constative speech acts should present valid claims to objective truth; norm-regulated acts should represent what is right; and dramaturgical acts should be sincere.

''Verstehen'' (German for “understanding”) means, in this context, the social scientist’s achievement of interpretive understanding.  Weber thought this precluded the making of judgments about what the scientist is observing.  Habermas says the scientist cannot behave like a dispassionate external observer:  s/he must adopt the viewpoint of participants and make the judgments they would make.  This is the “performative” stance, or attitude.  

The test of interpretive understanding is being able to anticipate the kinds of reasons a person would present, in support of a certain speech act.  Reasons make sense only because of some standard of rationality, by which a reason is seen to be persuasive.  To understand someone’s reasons, you have to evaluate them.  If you want to evaluate them by their own standards, you have to adjust your sense of how their concept of rationality relates to yours.  But in any case, the social scientist has to make judgments about what s/he is observing.  This is the only way to determine how, or whether, the subject’s behavior was rational.

Rationality has a universal structure; it is not culture-bound – assuming, of course, that we are talking about rationality in connection with the four different kinds of action listed above, and are not limiting it solely to goal-rationality.  Every culture has its objective, normative, and subjective claims to truth.  Like the social scientist, the participant in a situation can theoretically switch to another (e.g., objective) level of discourse, though in practice the scientist may experience fewer constraints that would prevent him/her from doing so.

The Lifeworld is the huge collection of unstated, assumed ideas that everyone has.  People in a culture share the same Lifeworld.  This facilitates shared understanding about things in the objective, social, or subjective worlds.  Communicative action occurs in, renews, and changes the Lifeworld.  

You cannot become aware of your Lifeworld as a whole.  Beyond the horizon you see is always another horizon.  But you can become aware of parts of it when, for example, you are dealing with someone from another culture, who doesn’t have the same shared understanding.

The Lifeworld has three structural components:  social, cultural, and personality.  Thus, the Lifeworld concept is not just a theory of knowledge.  It is a place where people develop and renew their social group memberships and personal identities.  In the Lifeworld, communicative action facilitates mutual understanding, coordinated action, and socialization.

The relationship between the Lifeworld and the three formal (i.e., objective, social, or subjective) worlds is this:  communicators achieve an understanding about something in their objective, social, or subjective worlds on the basis of their common Lifeworld.  Hence, the Lifeworld is not the same as those three formal concepts.

The Lifeworld becomes rationalized.  The result of the rationalization is that the elements of the Lifeworld become more sharply differentiated.  As that occurs, interaction becomes more dependent on formation of consensus through rational argument.

There are three aspects of this rationalization.  Structural differentiation is one.  Structural differentiation means (1) institutional systems become increasingly disconnected from cultural worldviews; (2) inter¬personal relations become prominent in the relation between personality and society; and (3) individual activity becomes increasingly important to the renewal of tradition, in the relationship between culture and personality.

A second aspect of rationalization is differentiation between form and content in each element of the Lifeworld (i.e., culture, society, and personality).  On the cultural level, direct involvement with the contents of traditions is replaced by abstract concepts.  Much the same happens on the social level, as moral and legal principles become less concrete and more abstract.  On the level of personality, cognitive structures become separated from concrete experience (e.g., a person learns math and can use it in many different jobs, in place of occupation-specific knowledge).

The third aspect of rationalization of the Lifeworld occurs in increased functional specification of processes by which culture, society, and personality are reproduced.  Education of children becomes more refined and specialized; specific institutions and kinds of discourse are developed for dealing with various intellectual pursuits; specialized political institutions evolve.

Rationalization of the Lifeworld results in the conversion of its implicit worldviews into explicit terms.  Everything becomes clarified and more subject to formulation and criticism.  This results in what Weber described as loss of meaning and freedom.  Weber said this results because goal-rationality becomes unduly prominent.  Habermas replies that this explanation neglects the entirely distinct role that the System plays in the process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">HTML, or [[HyperText Markup Language]] is the basis for most web pages on the internet now.  Comprised of standard English as well as computer commands, it is commonly integrated with other elements for a more interactive experience for viewers, from Java to C++ and Flash components.

HTML is written in the form of labels (known as tags), created by greater-than signs (&gt;) and less-than signs (&lt;). HTML can also describe, to some degree, the appearance and semantics of a document, and can include embedded scripting language code which can affect the behavior of web browsers and other HTML processors.

HTML is also often used to refer to content of the MIME type text/html or even more broadly as a generic term for HTML whether in its XML-descended form (such as XHTML 1.0 and later) or its form descended directly from SGML (such as HTML 4.01 and earlier).

''Markup'' is the term used to take ordinary text and adding extra symbols in in order to tell a browser how to display the text being viewed.

==Overview of RIP==

Routing Information Protocol is a distance vector routing protocol.  It transfers the complete routing table to all interfaces periodically and only uses hop count to determine the best path to a remote network.

==Configuring RIP==

RIP is relatively simple to configure. The following is an example of how to configure RIP on a router.

Enter router configuration mode. 

''router#conf t''

Turn on the RIP protocol

''router(config)#router rip''

Assign which networks RIP will advertise (this also has the effect of selecting which 
interfaces RIP will be active on)

''router(config)#network x.x.x.x''


When using the ''network x.x.x.x'' expression ''x.x.x.x'' will be the subnet to advertise. As RIP is a classful routing protocol this will need to take the form of a standard Class A,B, or C address e.g. 10.0.0.0, 172.16.0.0 or 192.168.1.0. 

==Example==
Configure RIP to advertise the subnets 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.5.0

''router#conf t''

''router(config)#router rip''

''router(config)#network 192.168.1.0''

''router(config)#network 192.168.5.0''


To turn off RIP

''router#conf t''

''router(config)#no router rip''

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''projector''' in terms of Flash is an standalone executable file format that Flash can save a movie into in order to allow someone to view the movie without having a flash player or a Shockwave plugin previously installed.

The standalone Projector for PC comes with the normal .exe extension, while the Mac Projector published on PC comes with .hqx extension. HQX is not an executable file, it is a compressed file format (kind of like Mac's Zip file) which packs together the two file forks Mac files have: the Data fork and the Resource fork. The .hqx file will not open on a PC if you double-click on it (because it has to be decoded), and it will not work if you burn it like that on CD with PC.

=Introduction=

CCNA certification is a cornerstone of many IT careers. This book is a comprehensive study guide for the CCNA Intro, CCNA ICND and CCNA Certification exams.  Its target audience is a high school student, a first year community college or any adult wanting to understand networking better.  

==About This Book==

This book is a free, living book on CCNA Certification that keeps up with the changes in the technology and certification.  As a result, it's written as an in-progress WikiBooks collaboration. Anyone is free to add material or fix mistakes. To edit a page simply click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top.  If you find that any of the material is unclear, please click the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top of the page and leave a note on that page indicating what is unclear. 

You should be aware that, while [[../Acknowledgements/|this book's contributors]] will attempt to ensure the accuracy of all facts, there may be mistakes present.

==About the Material==
The CCNA certification test can be taken in one of two ways:
* You can take the CCNA INTRO Exam (640-822) and the CCNA ICND (640-816)
* You can take the combined CCNA Exam (640-801)
* The new combined CCNA Exam is the 640-802 and reduces WAN topics in favor of wireless technology.

The CCNA INTRO Exam tests for a shallow understanding of a broad range of basic networking concepts. The CCNA ICND Exam tests for a deeper knowledge of particular areas of networking. The combined CCNA tests all the material covered in the INTRO and ICND Exams. (For information about the exam and your options, see Appendix A.)

The contents of this book are split into two sections (INTRO and ICND) so those who are taking the individual tests can study for them separately. For those who are taking the combined CCNA Exam, study both sections fully.

=CCNA Exam Topics=

The posted exam topics for all of CCNA certification exams are guidelines. Cisco makes the
effort to keep the exam questions within the confines of the stated exam objectives.

ICND1 Exam Topics

Below isted is the exam topics for the ICND1 exam,Although Cisco’s posted exam topics are not numbered, Cisco Press numbers
the exam topics for easier reference. The exam topics are as listed on the Cisco website
(www.cisco.com/go/ccna). If Cisco does happen to add exam topics at a later date, go to
www.ciscopress.com and download additional information about those newly added topics.

==Perspectives on Networking==

Ethernet networks use cards inside each computers. These cards have unique numeric addresses. Ethernet cables connect PCs to ethernet hubs,Hubs on the other hand repeats every signal received out on all its available ports. Cabling is typically run in a star configuration.

The following are Basic Terminology in the Networking world

* Client/Server Networking: The term client/server refers to a model utilizing networked client and server computers and application software. Web, FTP, email, DNS and many other database applications are client-server systems.

* Peer-to-Peer Networking: Peer to peer networks share responsibility for processing data among all of the connected devices. Peer-to-peer networking (also known simply as peer networking) differs from client-server networking in several respects.

* Network Name: A network name is a string that computing devices use to identify a specific computer network. Network names are typically different from names of individual computers or the addresses computers use to identify each other.

* Network Performance Measured: The performance or &quot;speed&quot; of a computer network is normally measured in units of bits per second (bps). This quantity can represent either an actual data rate or a theoretical limit to available network bandwidth. The related units of Kbps, Mbps, Gbps represent increasingly larger multiples of bps.

* WWW: The term &quot;WWW&quot; refers to the open development phase of the Internet in the 1990s. The WWW comprises a global network of Web sites accessible on the Internet.

* URL: URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) identify by name Web servers and individual Web pages stored on those servers, anywhere on the Internet.

* URI: A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) names both local and remote Internet resources similar to URLs.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objective Judgment ==

On page 9, Habermas says, &quot;A judgment can be objective if it is undertaken on the basis of a transsubjective validity claim that has the same meaning for observers and nonparticipants as it has for the acting subject himself.&quot;

This sentence explains a part of the preceding sentence, which states, &quot;An expression satisfies the precondition for rationality if and insofar as it embodies fallible knowledge and therewith has a relation to the objective world (that is, a relation to the facts) and is open to objective judgment.&quot; Habermas is defining the &quot;objective judgment&quot; term that appears in that preceding sentence. In that sense, the sentence under investigation indicates that, in order to be rational, an expression must be open to objective judgment -- must, in other words, be at least undertaken on the basis of a transsubjective validity claim that has the same meaning for observer and subject alike.

In that formulation, Habermas presents what seems to be a naïve assumption that a validity claim can typically have the same meaning for two people.  Also, it is not yet clear what counts as a meaning.  The sentence would seem to be stronger if it eliminated the reference to meaning -- if, for example, it said, &quot;A judgment can be objective if it is undertaken on the basis of a validity claim advanced by observer and subject alike.&quot; This would resolve the second of my two objections.

As for what constitutes a &quot;validity claim&quot; within this viewpoint, Habermas provides the examples of truth (regarding his hypothetical person A, who expresses a belief) and efficiency (regarding his hypothetical person B, who takes an action).  Validity in these regards is seen as a matter of degree:  the more strongly one can defend the claim of truth or efficiency, the more rational the belief or action from which such claim arises.

The meaning of &quot;transsubjective&quot; appears to be provided by the reference to a validity claim that has the same meaning for multiple persons.  In this interpretation, the adjective appears superfluous: a validity claim that has such shared meaning is ipso facto transsubjective.  Or if there is a desire to retain the word, the sentence might be recast as:  &quot;A judgment can be objective if it is undertaken on the basis of a validity claim that is transsubjective -- that, in other words, is held by observer and subject alike.&quot;

&quot;Undertaken&quot; appears to lean toward the action taken by person B, rather than the statement made by person A.  To accommodate both, the term might be altered to &quot;held or undertaken.&quot; This phrasing would make clear that the focus of objectivity is upon the judgment, not upon the verb to which the judgment gives rise.  Then again, trans-subjectivity is not possible until one does take an action that brings the matter to the attention of the observer or nonparticipant.  In this light, the meaning of &quot;judgment&quot; appears to be bound up with the action in which it is manifested.  For the speaker or actor, the belief or other action orientation was such as to prompt an actual expressive (or other) behavior; but by definition, this was not the case for the observer.  This interpretation seems to underscore the difficulty of the idea expressed in the quoted sentence. I wonder, however, whether that expression is a mere straw man.

On p. 10, Habermas seems to emphasize that his problem with the sentence under examination is not so much the concepts of objectivity, meaning, and so forth that I have questioned, above. Rather, his primary concern seems to lie in the immediately preceding sentence (also quoted above), in which there is a reference not only to objective judgment, but also to &quot;fallible knowledge.&quot;

That reference to &quot;fallible&quot; knowledge apparently invokes a falsificationist epistemology.  In my impression, that sort of epistemology is dubious in at least the senses that (a) one cannot be certain what, exactly, has shown a given statement to be false and (b) it is not clear how this formulation would exclude, say, the position of a Christian fundamentalist who bases his/her actions upon his/her interpretation of revealed truth but readily admits that his interpretation of God&quot;s intention is prone to error.  These, however, do not appear to be Habermas&quot;s criticisms of the &quot;proposal to base the rationality of an expression on its criticizability&quot; (p. 10). His view seems, rather, to be that rationality does include the concept provided in the initial quote (above), but it includes other things as well, to be explored in subsequent pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">At-a-glance, interface and setup of Flash seems to be somewhat intuitive and direct. The main interface is broken up into these major areas: at the top of the screen is the main menu where &quot;File,&quot; &quot;Edit,&quot; and other options are available. Right below that is the timeline window where frames and animations are worked out in. The left side is taken up by the toolbar. At the bottom is the property inspector, and to the right are the color and instance panels,and finally the &quot;stage&quot; panel is in the center, where all of the work takes place.

== Overview ==

A '''''Hinkypunk''''' is a small, one legged creature that appears to be made out of smoke. It carries a lantern that is used to lure unsuspecting travelers into bogs.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The term is first introduced in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 9|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] substitutes for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] in Defense Against the Dark Arts, he instructs the class to turn to the section on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolves]]; Hermione protests &quot;We're due to start hinkypunks.&quot;

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 16|Later in the year]] Professor Lupin sets up an obstacle course for the third years' final exam.  One of the obstacles is to &quot;squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk.&quot;

      <comment>/* How Many Works Should I Write About? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">''Return to [[IB English]]''

==Introduction==
Paper 2 is the second part of the written examination for candidates taking the IB English A1 course. Using the Part 3 works the candidates have studied throughout the year, the candidates are required to write an essay based on a selection of prompts.

The time given to write the essay is 2 hours for Higher Level candidates and 1 hour, 30 minutes for Standard Level candidates.

The test itself is split into five categories: 
:*Drama
:*Poetry
:*Prose: The Novel and Short Story
:*Prose: Other than the Novel and Short Story
:*General Questions on Literature

Each heading contains two questions, with the exception of the General Questions section which has four. For the most part, each prompt elicits a general response. However, the broad question base is deceiving, as writing a general response will not garner you that esteemed 7. Your best bet is to focus on providing as detailed a response as possible. The following are suggestions only:

:* Acquaint yourself with the key motifs, themes, symbols, and literary elements of the works you study
:*Utilize direct quotations from the text. (While you are not required to do so, it will show your dedication and complete understanding of the text, especially if the quotes are used as pillars for your arguments.)
:*Obtain viewpoints from professional sources during the school year, and refer to their research in your own paper. (Ex. Look up Dr. Mark Breitenberg, who writes on Macbeth)

====How Many Works Should I Write About?====
The paper requires the candidate to write on at least two works of literature (from two different authors) that have been studied, but it is not recommended to write about more than three, as the scope is too broad to incorporate a detailed discussion.

Also, the questions are intended to ensure that no &quot;canned essay&quot; can be used, that is, an essay a candidate has memorized before hand to fit the themes of essay. So, if you were planning on using this, you're out of luck.

===Duration of Exam===
The IB English Paper 2, (more formally known as English Language A1 Paper 2), is written in a 2 hour timeframe for HL (Higher Level) and in 90 minutes for SL (Standard Level). The questions on the test are broad and generalized (see above), and require you to use the novelists you have studied in your IB English course, or the texts in your &quot;Prescribed Titles&quot;, that your school has selected. The questions often employ a generalized quotation, and then ask that you analyze your texts based on the themes presented in the quotation.

===Length of Essay===

Remember: Quality over Quantity. A short, concise and to-the-point essay will score higher than a long, rambling one which repeats itself.

The length of the essay should probably be around 1000 words by the end of the examination, and for a question such as the one below, it is recommended to juxtapose at least 2 novels against each other, and examine this claim.

==Examples of Typical Questions on The Paper==

:*“Often enough the novelist favors certain characters, even waxing sentimental about them, and becomes annoyed with others, even feeling contemptuous of them: one way or another, the reader detects bias in the portrayal of the society. How far have you found your chosen novelists to be biased or unbiased in their presentation of their characters and what has been the resulting effect in each novel?&quot;

:* &quot;Authors favor certain characters, often portraying them in positive light, wherein others are portrayed contemptuously. How far have you found this to be true with your chosen novelists?&quot;  

:*Compare and contrast the authors' use of dreams, hopes or aspirations in ''two or three'' novels and/or short stories you have studied.

How would you answer the above? If you have time, try a mock final on your own, if your school doesn't already have them set up for you.

===Marking===
The examination is externally moderated, and is timed.

Results typically come out 2-3 months after your exams, often the date falls near July 5th for May testing and around January 5th for the November session.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Return to [[IB English]]''

=Introduction=
World Literature is a part of the IB English final grade, as the external assessment. Higher Level candidates must submit a World Literature 1 and a World Literature 2, whilst Standard Level candidates are only required to submit World Literature 1. IBO candidates have colloquially dubbed World Literature &quot;World Lit&quot; or &quot;WL&quot;.

To begin though, the IBO presents an updated list of novels deemed &quot;World Literature&quot; to its splinter schools each year, and it is up to your individual school IB coordinator, in conjunction with your IB English Dept., to select which novels will be studied.

It is of use to note that authors/novels used for Paper 1 ''cannot'' be used for your Paper 2.

===Length===
The word count is limited from 1200-1500 words.

==World Literature Authors==
The IBO aims to vary its literature globally, thus the name &quot;World Literature&quot;. Basically, the idea behind World Lit is to become culturally aware, and immerse yourself in writing of a different social /cultural/geopolitical background. One splinter school studied the following works, indicating the breadth of culture candidates were immersed in:

:*Erich Maria Remarque (German)
:*Albert Camus (French)
:*Henrik Ibsen (Norwegian Playwright)
:*Federico Garcia Lorca (Spanish)
:*Sophocles (Greek)
:*Leslie Marmon Silko (Native American)

Below are some of the more &quot;renowned&quot; texts approved by the IBO, with the author name first, that can be studied by A1 English classes (either SL or HL). Note that, as previously stated, texts studied are usually determined by department heads (i.e. teachers).

=World Literature Paper 2=
The second option, &quot;Paper 2&quot;, can be either the analysis of a portion of an overall work, or of a complete work. (For example, Paper 2 could be implicitly focused on Antigone's final speech, or it could explicitly look at the work as a whole.) One can also write a creative piece, in which they adapt a certain aspect of the novel or play and make it into something abstract; such as a diary entry, a letter, etc. It has to suit the piece of literature. 

If a portion of work is being analysed, an appendix or note is generally a good idea, wherein the section is added in. This may garner favor with the IBO markers, as they won't have to dig through the play to find your selection.

=Finishing Tips=
Some tips for Paper 1 and Paper 2:

:*For Paper 1, introduce both authors and their respective works in your introduction.
:*Clearly outline your thesis, and what you're going to talk about (make sure to talk about [[Wikipedia:Literary_element|literary elements]]).
:*Don't go over the word limit; the IBO marker will stop reading at 1500, not 1650.
:*Word count consists of quotes, but not quote references.
:*Reinforce any claims you make with '''direct quotations'''. Your teacher should have taught you some sort of standard citing style (MLA, APA, Chicago) so make sure you cite properly.
:*Don't forget a Works Cited Page.
:*Make sure to get a competent English teacher to give you feedback on your final copies. Remember, your teacher won't be marking it!
:*Make the changes, and hand it in.

==Some common errors==
:*Many candidates use impressive diction (replacing words using a thesaurus), often without knowing what it means. Doing so may convey the wrong meaning and result in a loss of marks.
:*Doing the essay the night before is not recommended, of course. It is much more difficult to write a solid essay at 3am. It shows lack of being a serious English Literature student. 
:*Proper formatting: double space it, insert a header with your name, the page number, and most importantly, your IB number (this is how the IB evaluators will identify you). You should also format your essay structure correctly (quotations especially). 
:*Forgetting to add a properly-formatted cover page will look unimpressive to evaluators and may indirectly cost marks.
:* The font '''MUST''' be standard fonts like Times New Roman or Arial. While using standard fonts is not factor of criteria in evaluation, it may indirectly lower marks as it suggests a lack of quality care put into the essay. (This should be noted with all papers, essays, presentations, etc., and not just IB.)

It seems like there is very little here, and a much better book exists on the same topic (but with actual information) at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]]. Maybe an unattended fork?[[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 18:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

* '''Delete'''. Agree, unintended fork. While I would not vote delete on all forks, this has too little information to justify keep. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 00:27, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - looks like abandoned, and a better book exists as stated above. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:39, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. I would suggest merging this book to the larger one, but I would be surprised if the information in this book wasn't covered better in the other book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:40, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''-The outline of this proposed book certainly has some merit but this is an older stub that has another Wikibook that certainly does a better job of accomplishing this same task.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:43, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

This is a game guide that probably should be transwikied. Came across it through [[Special:Wantedpages]], as it uses a template TOC with several redlinks. 52+ pages. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:35, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
:Note: it's been mostly transwikied already [http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Special:Allpages/StarCraft to strategywiki], there is also a not on the talk page about this move. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. I'm in favor of the wholesale deletion of videogame guides anyway. This is not the first time the starcraft book has been up for deletion, the transwiki request is old, and if it hasn't been handled by now, it shouldnt be our concern. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:53, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Yea, that was me.  I was merging it into the existing guide as I was going, so taking a little while to do.  I'm still working on it (got the most important pages since someone was working on it at the time).  I'll try to finish it off in the next day or two though.  My progress is listed [[strategywiki:User:Prod/to do|here]]. -- [[User:Prod|Prod-You]] 17:27, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. As much as it pains me to see these go (I wrote a couple guides for gamefaqs myself back in the day), it does go against what WMF has explicitly said about the focus of this project, which I understand, we need to keep to our goals... and people looking for guides can look on strategy wiki, as mentioned before; that seems to be the best alternative to keeping them here. We do need to work on getting some version of [[wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] that deals with this more explicitly accepted though, so that things like this are more official. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 17:21, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Strategy guides don't exactly follow Wikibook's goals, this guide is better off else (such as the above mentioned Strategywiki). --[[User:Bhensley|BHensley]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Bhensley|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:48, February 22, 2007
* '''Delete'''. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 10:38, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
* Finally, some one brought this to VFD. I'd been wanting to nominate it, but didn't feel up to (what I considered to be) the challenge. '''Delete'''. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 20:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Just like we've been doing with the rest of them. Keeping guides here was &quot;forbidden&quot; some time ago and there are better homes for them elsewhere like StrategyWiki. Please remember to set up a page like [[Second Life]] as the redirect including the page protection and deleting the talk page. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 06:42, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

* '''Delete''': Though this one might eventually find a use in a C++ book, unlike the other one this one has no explaination whatsoever, and may even be a copyvio. (The other one may be as well but with all the annotations we could possibly claim that it is fair use; after all we have agreed that annotated texts are to be allowed here, so why not annotated source code?) If someone could expand it/explain what its purpose is on the page I would change the vote on this to move. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 13:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - appears to be an orphan from its book, in addition to the comments above. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:17, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

| [[Cookbook:Poultry|Poultry recipes]] 

==Ingredients==

* 10 - 18 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Gallon|gallons]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|peanut oil]]

==Equipment==

* Dedicated turkey frying set: cooking pot, propane burner, 550°F 16 inch thermometer with clip, turkey stand, and triangular handled hook
* At least 10 pounds of propane
* Fire extinguisher, check it is ready to use and charged

==Procedure==

# If frozen, thaw turkey in a safe manner. Remove giblets bag from cavity.
# Place turkey on its stand and set it in the dedicated turkey-frying pot.
# Pour water into pot until turkey is covered completely and water level is two inches above the turkey.
# Remove turkey from water, and mark level of water in pot.
# Pour out water (discard). Dry the pot thoroughly and fill to line with peanut oil.
# Heat oil in pot over propane burner to 400°F, by thermometer, in area at least TWENTY FEET FROM ANY BUILDING.
# Slowly lower completely thawed, completely drained turkey (on its stand) into oil using the hook with an oven mitt.
# The temperature of the oil will decrease to 350°F.  Maintain that temperature closely!
# Monitor temperature constantly until heat is turned off. Don't let it drop below 345°F or go over 355°F
# [[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] turkey 3 minutes per pound.  Be careful not to over-cook it!  If it floats, it's over-done!
# Remove turkey using hook with oven mitt.
# Check temperature using meat thermometer in deep part of meat, to be at least 160°F.
# Turn off fire and allow to cool completely before even considering moving.
# Rest turkey on tray, breasts down, 20-30 minutes before carving.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* '''If you are not willing to perform step #1 of directions, you are not safe to cook using this method.'''
* '''If you cannot understand steps #3 through #6, do not use this method.'''
* The safest way to thaw a turkey is in the refrigerator. Any other way invites salmonella.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The lifeworld is a &quot;commonly shared world&quot;; it is &quot;bounded by the totality of interpretations presupposed by the members [of a community of speaking and acting subjects] as background knowledge&quot; (TCA1 p. 13). On the basis of the lifeworld as expressed in these terms, the members of a community have grounds for examining discrepancies in the accounts rendered by two of its members and determining that one account is accurate while the other is impaired.

For example, if two people who appear to be looking at the same object claim to see something radically different from one another, investigation may reveal that one of them is experiencing a problem in eyesight, cognition, perception, accuracy of measurement, bias, or inattentiveness. It seems, however, that limits of time, interest, awareness, and other resources render it impossible, in principle, for a community even to identify, much less to sort out, all instances of discrepant impression held by its members.  Moreover, as I understand the Duhem-Quine thesis (and as experience suggests), there may often be no standard by which discrepancies can be identified and resolved; the proposition-based sense of resolution neglects the possibility that beliefs tend to be part of a web that is capable of indefinite amounts of adjustment rather than any simple, Darwinian survival of the strongest idea or view. That sort of conflict of ideas might seem to augur the division into two communities; but the number of such potential divisions is such as to make each man an island rather than the community that Habermas envisions.

Communities could be construed as extending only to those who share a particular view; but within each view are more views -- yielding, again, an archipelago rather than a continent. In short, the concept of a commonly shared community seems to arise, not from an actual sorting-out of differences, but from the assumption that the members could theoretically sort out some such differences, if forced to do so for some reason.

The lifeworld is said to be non-falsifiable because it is not &quot;a descriptive assertion&quot; (TCA1 p. 13). In seeming agreement with the atomistic prospect anticipated in the preceding paragraph (above), it is &quot;the unthematically given horizon within which participants in communication move in common when they refer thematically to some [single] thing in the world&quot; (TCA1 p. 82). As a given, it is not possible for someone living within it to step outside it and render objective judgment on it.  Doing so would seemingly amount to an affirmation that the observer is not within it -- that it is not, for him/her, a given.

Habermas seems to think that it is possible, however, to adopt an internal position with respect to another culture, so as to understand it from the perspective of those who are within it (Carspecken, p. 7). Unlike Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology, however, Habermas’s reconstructive analysis employs not only reflection but also empirical analysis. This seems to be a quintessentially modernist perspective. Certainly one can compare cultures -- can even become immersed in them, can &quot;go native.&quot; But that one researcher could be immersed in two separate cultures so completely as to have bracketed out the preconceptions from his/her own membership in a third one seems unlikely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intersubjective Understanding ==

It seems that &quot;transsubjective&quot; means &quot;across subjectivities&quot; in the sense of not necessarily being restricted to any specific individual(s) (e.g., may include nonparticipants), while &quot;intersubjective&quot; means &quot;between individuals&quot; and also entails the ability to take the other person’s position.  In that case, the reference to “intersubjective understanding about things and events” posits that persons actually involved in a situation have a capacity to reach mutually insightful and empathic understandings among themselves.

That capacity is contrasted, here, against a &quot;capacity for decentered perception and manipulation of things and events.&quot;  If my understanding of Piaget is correct, the concepts of decentering and internality, which were borrowed from him (p. 14), refer, respectively, to the ability to take the perspective of another person and the transition, in the developing child, from external (physical) to internal (mental, symbolic) representations. Here, however, Habermas evidently wants to construe decentering, not as evoking anything resembling an increased capacity for empathy or interpersonal insight, but rather as enhancing one’s ability to take an objectivist, impersonal view from nowhere.

Internality, in this context, seems to mean, not Piaget’s concept of developing ability to engage in mental manipulation of symbols, but rather that which is seen through the eyes of the participant as distinct from an outsider’s perspective.  Alternately, the reference to &quot;internal relations&quot; may mean to emphasize &quot;relations,&quot; not &quot;internal&quot;; that is, the point may be that decentering and manipulation are related to a capacity for intersubjective understanding -- that, in other words, development of an objectivist perspective toward the world results, not merely from highly individualistic interactions with things, but also as a result of a social or community context.

== About Me ==

Hello there.  Very nice to meet you.  I'm Cade.  I started editing here a few months ago and still do so when time is allotted in my schedule.  In the process of submitting to Wikipedia and its sister projects we must adhere to the words of W.C. Bennett: &quot;Blessed is he who expects no gratitude, for he shall not be disappointed.&quot;  That being said, I'm pretty open-minded to all walks of life but I live by the conviction that those who ''deserve'' respect will also ''offer'' respect.  -[[User:Sweet_Pinkette|&lt;font face=&quot;Vivaldi&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Sweet Pinkette&lt;/font&gt;]] (March 06, 2007; 3:48 am)

Thanks for uploading images on Wikibooks. However, the images may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=upload&amp;user={{urlencode:{{PAGENAME}}}} all images you have uploaded] or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator.

'''Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Doc window.jpg]].''' The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Doc window.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|rationale]] for a fair use claim is provided.

In order to upload fair use material, specific rationale must be provided as to why fair use media is necessary, and how there are no free alternatives. Images or other media that do not have such rationale will likely be deleted as a copyright violation. If the information of a fair use media component could be duplicated by a free alternative, that media may not be uploaded. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add {{tlx|fair use rationale}}; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or [[WB:HELP|ask another Wikibookian]].

See {{UserImages2}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. [[User:MonoBot|MonoBot]] ([[User talk:MonoBot|talk]]) 00:42, 10 March 2008 (UTC)}}</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Communicative Rationality Within a Communication Community ==

Re:  the reference (at {{H:title|Page 15, paragraph 1, line 3 | 15.1.3}}) to &quot;A greater degree of communicative rationality . . . within a communication-community” and &quot;unconstrained coordination of actions and consensual resolution of conflicts ....&quot;

Habermas says it is typical, in empiricism, to separate cognitive-instrumental rationality from communicative rationality (p. 14).  His point, there, seems to be that the latter adds to (i.e., does not simply contrast against) the former.  Persons proceeding in a cognitive-instrumental perspective are directed toward controlling some conditions, so as to achieve their goals, in a self-assertive manner.  That constitutes rational behavior in that perspective.  But in the perspective of communicative rationality, goals are rational only if, in addition, they proceed in light of intersubjectively recognized validity claims.  Community is postulated to provide an environment within which actions can proceed toward common goals with a minimum of contraints upon coordination of action.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Warranted and Unwarranted Consensually Achieved Decisions ==

The consensus in question arises from the community that produces it.  The communities that interest Toulmin are those at which he aims his &quot;critique of collective reason&quot; pertaining to &quot;science or law or art&quot; (TCA1, p. 34).  In this enterprise, Toulmin seeks to avoid an a priori definition of what constitutes a valid argument or, for that matter, of what constitutes a given field. He apparently does this by accepting the fields’ own concepts of rationality and impartiality:  what he wants to understand about the denizens of such intellectual communities is what they are trying to achieve, basing his insight upon their stated goals, their cultivation of their respective enterprises, and their degrees of success (id.).

Habermas contends that this leaves out &quot;the general pragmatic presuppositions and procedures of the cooperative search for truth&quot; (id.).  Impartiality, he says, can be explained only by examining the conditions in which validity claims can be discursively redeemed (p. 35) -- which term seems to imply (see TCA1 p. 19) that a field’s validity claims are not necessarily to be taken as objective without further enhancement.  In law, for example, he points out that negotiation of compromises does not at all redeem validity claims discursively.  From the standpoint of a philosopher, the latter is superior (though judges, attorneys, and many litigants may not think so) by dint of its appeal to &quot;the force of the better argument&quot; (which, in this sense, is apparently construed as excluding pragmatic considerations pertaining to the preferability of negotiated compromises).

While Habermas himself does not appear to develop Burleson’s &quot;warrant&quot; terminology,  Habermas’s central distinction thus appears to be that between &quot;forms of argumentation&quot; and &quot;the institutional differentiation of various rational enterprises&quot; -- which is apparently construed as tantamount to the separation of &quot;conventional claims, which are context-dependent, from universal validity claims&quot; (TCA1 p. 36).  As I understand this, context (e.g., the courtroom) provides a setting within which a conventional claim might be asserted, consistent with the institutional differentiation of the relevant rational enterprise (e.g., the legal system); while, by contrast, a discourse (of so far unspecified nature) pertaining to universal validity claims would attend inter alia to the forms of argumentation, as Habermas has been doing in these pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Heuristic Value of Lower-Level Validity Claims == 

The &quot;levels&quot; referred to (TCA p. 40.bot.-5) are the &quot;higher-level validity claims, which are attached not to individual communicative utterances but to cultural objectivations -- to works of art, to moral and legal norms, to theories,&quot; where &quot;[I]t is at this [higher level] of culturally stored and objectivated knowledge that we also find technologies and strategies in which theoretical or professional knowledge is organized with a view to specific practical contexts&quot; (p. 40). The &quot;individual communicative utterances&quot; referenced in that quote include a handful of examples from actual practice (e.g., &quot;You ought to make more efforts to recruit woman executives&quot;).

The concept, in the first quoted excerpt, is that such individual communicative utterances do contain validity claims -- that, indeed, the set of all possible &quot;higher-level&quot; validity claims is contained in the set of all possible lower-level validity claims.  The heuristic value of the latter is, at the least, that examples derived from everyday experience may tend to provide more visceral and/or easily grasped versions of the claims as they would reappear at the higher level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Popper's Third World ==

This is the world of the “objective contents of thought” and is, in that sense, the world of formal being.  It is the realm of theory, of objective mentality, of discourse, and of the growth of knowledge.  Its traits are rationality and objectivity, infinity of theories and their consequences, and possibility.  Criticism, hence rationality, is contingent on our being able to distinguish thought process from thought, and asserting from assertion, and realizing the latter (e.g., assertion) are objective while the former are subjective.  In this world, we have finite knowledge but infinite ignorance.  It is always possible for us to improve on our knowledge, to come closer to truth.  Yet we can never attain truth:  the number of possibly true theories remains infinite.  We are thus caught within an ever-changing horizon of possibilities.  The formal world contains many hidden possibilities, including technological possibilities, new aims and values, and even possibilities that can never be materialized or actualized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Critique of Wittgenstein's Rules, as Used by Habermas == 

==== Introduction ====

For Wittgenstein, as Habermas understands him (especially on pp. 16-17), a rule is a social phenomenon, in two regards:  it has both &quot;identical meaning and intersubjective validity.&quot;  Looking at the first of those two, &quot;identical meaning&quot; means that two people go beyond a mere ''concurrence'' of interpretation (if &quot;interpretation&quot; is suitable, here, to avoid a question-begging use of &quot;meaning&quot; to explain &quot;meaning&quot;):  they have the ''same'' interpretation of a &quot;stimulus.&quot;

The reference to stimuli suggests that, to understand a rule, one must adopt (using the distinctions offered in TCA chapter 1) an objective (rather than normative or subjective) stance toward its constituent elements.  We are not merely foregrounding a claim about an indetermin¬ate world:  we cannot proceed without the shared realist assertion, by two individuals, that there is a stimulus whose empirical characteristics seem precisely the same to both of them.  As stated in TCA I, this objective world &quot;can be understood as the correlate of the totality of true proposi¬tions&quot; and thus &quot;retains the strictly ontological significance of a totality of entities&quot; (p. 84).

It is not clear, on this account, how people can know that they have exactly the ''same '' interpretation of a stimulus.  Typically, it would be infeasible, and does not actually happen, that they compare notes on all (or even manifold) aspects of a stimulus.  Experience suggests that, if they were to do so, they would often discover that their interpretations differ in many ways.  To avoid that, &quot;stimulus&quot; should presumably be interpreted in a minimalist fashion, to refer only to the single, smallest sensory datum necessarily implicated in the situation at hand.

In my understanding of this proposal, people are believed to assume, based upon some combination of present and/or previous communication (as interpreted with inconsistent fidelity to what was said or intended) that they are discussing the same stimulus, and that the things they are saying to the other person and receiving from that other person are identical with respect to that stimulus.  There may be, in fact, no such identity in a particular case, either in the stimulus or in what they are trying to say to one another, but such facts would normally be concealed by unwillingness or inability to plumb the depths of reflection and communication that may be imaginable in each instance of putatively shared interpretation.

The question of how people can know that they have the same interpretation of a stimulus is based upon the impression that Habermas means to be talking about actual rather than theo¬reti¬cal communication events.  In other words, I infer that he cares what actually happens between two persons in communication, as distinct from what might hypothetically be observed by a third party, almost universally non¬existent, who could empirically clarify the extent to which the participants do indeed share meaning – as when, say, they agree that a shirt is blue, though one's concept of true blue tends toward the grey while the other's tends toward the green, as could be demonstrated through comparison of their evaluations of selected color samples.  This is, anyway, my understanding of the concept that the interpreter takes a performative rather than third-person stance toward the communication events in question (see TCA1, p. 103).

==== On Rules, in Particular ====

Wittgenstein, as reported by Habermas, has a puzzling concept of rules.  Consider:  &quot;A subject ''S'' can follow a rule only by following the same rule under changing conditions of appli¬cation – otherwise he is not following a rule&quot; (TCA II, p. 17).  The first time someone applies a rule, s/he is not following any &quot;same&quot; rule; there was no previous instance in which a rule was involved.  The description of rule-following seems to require amendment to accommodate this.

The second time one applies a rule, conditions may or may not have changed.  Suppose that ''S'' begins a game of chess – chess being an example Habermas offers – by moving a certain pawn.  Suppose ''S'' then quits.  Later, she starts a new game, and moves the same pawn in the same way.  Again, the quotation says that the only way in which ''S'' can follow a rule is to follow it under ''changing'' conditions; and since conditions (construed, narrowly, as the conditions of the pieces on the board) have not changed, ''S'' &quot;is not following a rule.&quot;  The better statement of the concept is presumably that ''S'' can follow a rule with or without changed circumstances.

A more significant problem, within this concept of rules, arises from this statement:  &quot;One understands the meaning of a particular symbolic action – a move in a chess game, say – when one has mastered the rules governing the use of the chess pieces&quot; (pp. 16-17).  This is not the case.  I, a chess beginner, may have mastered the fact that a bishop moves diagonally across the board.  That relatively trivial concept says nothing for the meaning of a move in which I position the bishop near my adversary's queen.  I may not have noticed that I did so; I (or my adversary) may not realize the danger in which I have placed the queen or the bishop; I certainly may not be aware that my adversary, if s/he is an accomplished player, may consider the move audacious or absurd.  And if we happen to be playing in some medieval contest, I may have no clue that I have just won the kingdom or placed myself in line for beheading.

In short, the bulk of the &quot;meaning&quot; of the chess move (which I can talk about, in the first place, only by ignoring that this discussion seems to involve another potential use of &quot;meaning&quot; to define &quot;meaning&quot;) consists of something far beyond mastery of &quot;the rules governing the use of the chess pieces.&quot;  In many instances, neither humans nor computers have mastered the meaning of a move in a chess game, even if &quot;meaning&quot; in this context is construed solely as a question of the move's impact upon subsequent moves (in which case computers are becoming steadily more adept than humans at &quot;understanding meaning&quot;).  There are just too many possibilities.

According to Habermas, rules &quot;lay down how someone produces . . . symbolic formations such as numbers, figures, and words&quot; (p. 16).  This is plainly not the case.  Within a particular context, the rules may tell me that I can move my bishop diagonally, from its present position, for a total of one, two, or three spaces.  But (except for the rare instances when I have no other options) the rules do not tell me which number of spaces to move, nor whether to move the bishop at all.  Likewise, referring to Habermas's other example, the fact that someone ''could'' continue to recite the numbers in a geometric progression may say nothing about why that particular progression was chosen, instead of another that may have been more boring or difficult; nor does it necessarily dictate the decision of when to stop reciting and do something else instead.  The rules are givens, like my age and gender, within which symbolic formations occur; but they generally do not &quot;lay down&quot; those formations.

While granting that these examples, chess and geometry, may reflect Wittgenstein's tastes more than those of Habermas, it nonetheless seems reasonable to ask whether such examples say something about the nature of the enterprise for which they are cited.  Chess does, or at least can, communicate information; but that is not its primary purpose.  It is a game.  Likewise, the recitation of a geometric progression is communicative, but communication is not the primary purpose for which people learn how to use such progressions.  They want to solve problems whose geometric aspects may well be communicated to no one else.

Of course, Habermas cites these examples in service of a larger point.  But the pursuit of cerebral abstractions, in a detour from the central point, brings the risk that one may encounter further difficulties en route.  In this instance, the talk about rules exposes the dubious belief that a rule can &quot;serve to explain the meaning of examples&quot; (p. 16).  If facts are &quot;theory-laden&quot; (Hanson, 1958, p. 19) – if, that is, what one observes is affected by what one thinks – then it would seem that the meaning of an example may be determined by a rule through which it is construed.  In that case, an indefinite number of rules could &quot;explain&quot; the divergent meanings of the same examples.  This appears to be the case in, for instance, scriptural exegesis – where, over the centuries, the same passages have &quot;supported&quot; an impressive variety of interpretations.

It is not immediately obvious that abstruse examples (e.g., chess, geometry) portray the nature of rules very well.  When the goal is to reach conclusions about people, communication, and society, it would seem that real-world illustrations would be better suited.  To that end, in the social world within which interesting communication takes place, there is perhaps no better example of devotion to rules than that which one finds in law.  Everything in law is oriented toward detection and explication of the rules governing conduct in situations of daily life.

That orientation of law, however, has results that seem worlds apart from Habermas's discussion.  One such result is the generation of millions of pages of judicial opinions, briefs, congressional bills, legal periodicals, and the like.  Another is the creation of a privileged caste of specially trained and highly remunerated individuals who advocate and adjudicate differing perspectives on what the rule might be in a specific case.  A third result, following from the first two, is that people and situations that cry out most desper¬ately for competent advocacy and adjudication may be exactly the people and situations to which such outcomes are most commonly denied.  The model of &quot;rule&quot; that emerges from this sort of context could easily lead to an awareness, nascent in the preceding paragraph, that a rule can be indeterminate in concept and arbitrary in application – that, in the example, the &quot;rule of law&quot; may be mere shorthand for the understandings and institutions of a culture that proves far harder to transplant, as a whole, than the paltry term that pretends to name it.

Rules of law do not patently support Habermas's generalizations about the functions and behavior of rules.  The discussion of rules of law raises another difficulty with the statement, quoted above, in which Habermas says, &quot;A subject ''S'' can follow a rule only by following the same rule under changing conditions of appli¬cation – otherwise he is not following a rule.&quot;  If law rather than chess is chosen as the basis for illustration, one will observe that what happens in practice is sometimes the opposite of what Habermas says.  Sometimes, that is, people follow what they thought was the rule, and they are affirmed in doing so by the local judge.  Then, however, someone decides to appeal, and the higher court reverses.  In such cases, it turns out that &quot;following the same rule under changing conditions&quot; is exactly ''not'' what was called for.  A similar question arises in scientific inquiry – where, sometimes, the rule we thought we understood is not as we thought we understood it.

Within the so-called rule of law, the real rule governing a situation might not be, &quot;Follow what the law books [or appellate courts] say.&quot;  Instead, as practicing attorneys know, and as some judges admit (e.g., Posner, 1990), factors governing the specification of a rule may include a collection of pragmatic adages, such as the one by which &quot;lawful&quot; is defined as &quot;Compatible with the will of a judge having jurisdiction&quot; (Bierce, 1911).  Which adage, within that collection of adages, should the attorney follow, when preparing for trial before Judge Smith?  The attorney needs a rule about rules, one that indicates when s/he has reached the bottom of the rule barrel and need not search further for the rule that governs a particular situation.

Far from having prospective utility, as Habermas seems to want, an orientation toward rules may serve a primarily historical function:  as a rule-obeyer, you may actually be only as good as your last gig.

Examples from chess and geometry can conceal such complexities precisely because they are simplistic; their functioning is largely unrelated to the operation (and limitations) of rules in human experience.  The chess player, the lawyer, the boxer, and the conversa¬tionalist all operate within a rich milieu that includes rules, constraints (e.g., the skill of the opponent), and priorities (e.g., win; or win gracefully; or draw the greatest amount of advertising revenue).  These various influences combine in myriad ways to suggest the variant courses of action that people do choose.  To speak as if one were facing a simple rule, and were challenged to demonstrate comprehension of that rule by behaving in conformity with it, is to impose upon reality a narrowminded monotony of analysis that could easily overlook the most interesting aspects of relevant phenomena.

Again, in the interests of brevity, this analysis does not continue on to Habermas's distinction between identity of meaning and intersubjective validity, where the former consists of rule-following while the latter entails judgment upon rule violations (TCA2, p. 16).  It would be possible, again, to question various assertions within his review of intersubjective validity (e.g., his counterintuitive legislation (p. 18) that people cannot have rules strictly for themselves).  For present purposes, it may suffice to note that judging rule violations entails having some sense of what a rule is – and that, by the analysis provided here, appears to be an open question.

==== Conclusion ====

This paper has focused upon one or two aspects of the reasoning found in just one subsection of Habermas's magnum opus.  I have selected that subsection because its subject matter is of interest to me, particularly due to its potential relevance to my ongoing inquiry into contemporary views on knowledge.

In undertaking this scrutiny of a few lines, I hope to have provoked responses that will help me to sharpen my understanding of this section of TCA.  I may also have incidentally illustrated the nature of my experience in reading TCA, during which process I am constantly reminded of Benjamin Stolberg's remark (citation unavailable):  &quot;An expert is a person who avoids small error as he sweeps on to the grand fallacy.&quot;  Not that I know how to apply that remark, exactly, to my study of TCA.  I am not sure that Habermas avoids small error; I am not sure he commits a grand fallacy.  Perhaps, in his case, it is just the opposite, on both counts.

What I do know is that I find his work difficult to read, in good measure because (as demonstrated in this paper) it seems that almost every page raises a number of questions.  It is enough to provoke a preference for aphorisms, poems, even e-mails – anything but the intellectual ''coup d'état'', the single, overwhelming, ostensible masterstroke ''qua'' magnum opus.  Such a coup, like its political counterpart, disempowers those who would question it; it engenders a sense that readers ought to admire the quest for the supreme vantage, deferring their small questions and barely tolerable uncertainties while the genius presses on.

Notwithstanding accepted conventions within the world of book-publishing, such a monologue seems curiously incompatible with the vision of dialogic communication that TCA evokes.  This paper illustrates that a single individual page of that lengthy work can raise so many questions as to justify skepticism about the grand enterprise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Examples with time module ==

I used the Wikibook as material for a beginner's programming course. The use of the ''time'' module in this chapter actually caused more confusion than knowledge. To handle time with a computer is not straight-forward at all, and even less for beginners. The exercise turned out to be really hard for them: Taming the &lt;tt&gt;time.strftime()&lt;/tt&gt; beast and its documentation is too much here.

I would therefore like to replace the use of ''time'' in the ''last two digits random'' exercise with a proper random number (from the ''XXXXXX'' module). The ''XXXXXX''-documentation is quite readable for beginners, the naming (and therefore finding) of the function needed is clearer - and the result is &quot;better&quot; (real random). It is actually not hard to find the appropriate function even without knowing in which module to search.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Addressing=
Each IP host or node on a network is identified by an IP address. The IP address is a network layer address and has relationship to data link layer address (such as a MAC address of a network interface card).  An IP address is a 32 bit binary number.  Usually this number is represented by 4 decimal values in the range 0 to 255 (known as octets) separated by decimal points. This is known as &quot;dotted decimal&quot; notation.

Example: 216.109.112.135

Here is the IP address in its binary form:
&lt;br&gt;
216     .109     .112     .135&lt;br&gt;
11011000.01101101.01110000.10000111&lt;br&gt;

So for example The number 216 can be expressed as:&lt;br&gt;
128 + 64 + 16 + 8 &lt;br&gt;

==Classful routing==
Every IP address consists of two parts, one identifying the network (Network Number) and one identifying the node (Node Number).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0791.txt
  |title=RFC 791 - Internet Protocol Specification
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Class of the address and the subnet mask determine which part belongs to the network address and which part belongs to the node address. 

In classful routing, the remainder of the IP address is the Host ID.  There are two special values: all zeros = network id
all ones = broadcast id

===Class A Network===
In a '''Class A Network''', binary address start with 0, therefore the decimal number can be anywhere from 1 to 126.  The first 8 bits identify the network and the remaining 24 bits indicate the host within the network.

1       .X       .X       .X&lt;br&gt;
00000001.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX&lt;br&gt;
to &lt;br&gt;
126     .X       .X       .X&lt;br&gt;
01111110.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX&lt;br&gt;

127.X.X.X - is reserved for loopback&lt;br&gt;
01111111.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX&lt;br&gt;

===Class B Network===
In a '''Class B Network''', binary addresses start with 10, therefore the decimal number can be anywhere from 128 to 191.  The first 16 bits (the first two octets) identify the network and the remaining 16 bits indicate the host within the network.

128.0.X.X&lt;br&gt;
10000000.00000000.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX&lt;br&gt;
to &lt;br&gt;
191.255.X.X&lt;br&gt;
10111111.11111111.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX&lt;br&gt;

===Class C Network===
In a '''Class C Network''', binary addresses start with 110, therefore the decimal number can be anywhere from 192 to 223.  The first 24 bits (the first three octets) identify the network and the remaining 8 bits indicate the host within the network.

192.0.0.X&lt;br&gt;
11000000.00000000.00000000.XXXXXXXX&lt;br&gt;
to&lt;br&gt;
223.255.255.X&lt;br&gt;
11011111.11111111.11111111.XXXXXXXX&lt;br&gt;

===Class D Network===
In a '''Class D Network''', binary addresses start with 1110, therefore the decimal number can be anywhere from 224 to 239. Class D networks are used to support multicasting.

224.0.0.X&lt;br&gt;
11100000.00000000.00000000.XXXXXXXX&lt;br&gt;
to&lt;br&gt;
239.255.255.X&lt;br&gt;
11101111.11111111.11111111.XXXXXXXX&lt;br&gt;

===Class E Network===
In a '''Class E Network''', binary addresses start with 1111, therefore the decimal number can be anywhere from 240 to 255. Class E networks are reserved. 

240.0.0.X&lt;br&gt;
11110000.00000000.00000000.XXXXXXXX&lt;br&gt;
to&lt;br&gt;

|}

The number of valid networks and hosts available is always 2&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; - 2 (where N is the number of bits used, and the 2 adjusts for the invalidity of the first and last addresses).  Thus, for a class C address with 8 bits available for hosts, the number of hosts is 254.

The larger ''network number'' field allowed a larger number of networks, thereby accommodating the continued growth of the Internet.

The IP address netmask (which is so commonly associated with an IP address today) was not required because the mask length was part of the IP address itself. Any network device could inspect the first few bits of a 32-bit IP address to see which class the address belonged to.

The method of comparing two IP address's physical networks did not change, however (see subnetwork). For each address, the ''network number'' field size and its subsequent value were determined (the ''rest'' field was ignored). The network numbers were then compared.  If they matched, then the two addresses were on the same network.

==Classless Routing==
'''Classless Inter-Domain Routing''' ('''CIDR''', pronounced &quot;cider&quot;) was  introduced in 1993 and is the latest refinement to the way [[w:IP address|IP addresses]] are interpreted. It replaced the previous generation of IP address syntax, [[w:classful network|classful networks]]. Specifically, rather than allocating address blocks on eight-bit (i.e., octet) boundaries forcing 8, 16, or 24-bit prefixes, it used the technique of '''variable-length subnet masking''' (VLSM) to allow allocation on arbitrary-length prefixes. CIDR encompasses:
* The VLSM technique of specifying arbitrary length prefix boundaries. A CIDR-compliant address is written with a suffix indicating the number of bits in the prefix length, such as 192.168.0.0/16. This permits more efficient use of increasingly scarce [[w:IPv4|IPv4]] addresses.
* The '''aggregation''' of multiple contiguous prefixes into '''[[w:Supernet|supernets]]''', and, wherever possible in the Internet, advertising aggregates, thus reducing the number of entries in the global routing table. Aggregation hides multiple levels of subnetting from the Internet routing table, and reverses the process of &quot;subnetting a subnet&quot; with VLSM.
* The administrative process of allocating address blocks to organizations based on their actual and short-term projected need, rather than the very large or very small blocks required by classful addressing schemes.

==Subnetting==
In computer networks, a '''subnetwork''' or '''subnet''' is a range of logical addresses within the address space that is assigned to an organization. 
'''Subnetting''' is a hierarchical partitioning of the network address space of an organization (and of the network nodes of an autonomous system into several subnets.  Routers constitute borders between subnets. Communication to and from a subnet is mediated by one specific port of one specific router, at least momentarily.
 
A typical subnet is a physical network served by one router, for instance an Ethernet network (consisting of one or several Ethernet segments or local area networks, interconnected by switches and bridges) or a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN). However, subnetting allows the network to be logically divided regardless of the physical layout of a network, since it is possible to divide a physical network into several subnets by configuring different host computers to use different routers.  

The address to all nodes in a subnet starts with the same binary sequence, which is its network id and '''subnet id'''. In IPv4, the subnet may be identified by its base address and subnet mask.  
 
Subnetting simplifies routing, since each subnet typically is represented by one row in the routing tables in each connected router.

Subnetting was originally introduced before the introduction of classful network addresses in IPv4, to allow a single larger network to have a number of smaller networks within it, controlled by several routers. Subnetting made Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) possible.

In order for computers to communicate on one network, they will all need their own IP address. However, if you have two or more networks, instead of purchasing different numbers for each network, subnetting provides the ability to easily divide one IP address range amongst all the hosts in your network.  Subnetting is used in IP networks to break up larger networks into a smaller network.  Subnetting involves manually calculating the bits of an IP address and taking them from the host side of bits and adding them to the network side.

== Network address and logical address==
The term '''network address''' sometimes refers to [[w:logical address|logical address]], i.e. [[w:network layer|network layer]] address such as the [[w:IP address|IP address]], and sometimes to the first address (the base address) of a [[w:classful address|classful address]] range to an organization. 

Computers and devices that are part of internetworking network such as the Internet all have a logical address. The network address is unique to that device and can either be [[w:Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|dynamically]] or statically configured. This address allows the device to communicate with other devices connected to the network. The most common network addressing scheme is IPv4. The IPv4 network address consists of a 32 bit address divided into 4 [[w:Octet (computing)|octets]] and a subnet mask of like size. In order to facilitate the [[w:routing|routing]] process the address is divided into two pieces, the network address and the host address. This works much like a postal address where the network address would represent the city and the host address would represent the street address. The subnet mask is used in conjunction with the network address to determine which part of the address is the network address and which part is the host address.

== Binary subnet masks ==

While subnet masks are often represented in [[w:Dot-decimal notation|dot-decimal]] form their use becomes clearer in [[w:Binary numeral system|binary]].  Looking at a network address and a subnet mask in binary a device can determine which part of the address is the network address and which part is the host address. To do this, it performs a bitwise &quot;[[w:Binary and|AND]]&quot; operation.

|}

Subnet masks consist of a series of 1s in binary followed by 0s. The 1s designate that part of the address as being part of the network portion and the 0s designate that part as being part of the host address. Subnet masks do not have to fill a given octet. This allows a classful network to be broken down into subnets.  A classful network is a network that has a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0 or 255.255.255.0. Subnet masks can also be expressed in a shorter form, known as Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, which gives the network number followed by a slash (&quot;/&quot;) and the number of 'one' bits in the binary notation of the netmask (i.e. the number of relevant bits in the network number). For example, 192.0.2.96/24 indicates an IP address where the first 24 bits are used as network address (same as 255.255.255.0).

=== IPv4 classes ===
IPv4 addresses are broken down into three parts: the network part, the subnet part, and the host part. There are three classful network classes of IP address which determine how much is which

Subnetting is the process of allocating bits from the host portion as a network portion. The above example shows the bitwise &quot;AND&quot; process being performed on a classful network. The following example shows bits being borrowed to turn a classful network into a subnet.

'''Example'''

In this example two bits were borrowed from the original host portion. This is beneficial because it allows a single network portion to be split into several smaller network portions. By design IPv4 address are limited in number and each classful network portion is capable of supporting a finite number of hosts. A classful C address for example has space for 254 hosts. If a network were to be split into four parts using classful address four different class C addresses would have to be used to serve those networks. Using the subnetting example above if each subnetwork were to have 62 hosts or less  (see below for math) a single class C address could be split up to service the entire network while wasting the fewest host addresses.

== Subnets and host count ==

It is possible to determine the number of hosts and subnetworks available for any subnet mask. In the above example two bits were borrowed to create subnetworks. Each bit can take the value 1 or 0, giving 4 possible subnets ('''&lt;math&gt;2^{2} = 4&lt;/math&gt;''')

According to the RFC 950 standard the subnet values consisting of all zeros and all ones are reserved, reducing the number of available subnets by 2. However due to the inefficiencies introduced by this convention it is generally no longer used and is only relevant when dealing with some legacy equipment.

The remaining bits after the subnet are used for addressing hosts within the subnet. In the above example the subnet mask consists of 26 bits, leaving 6 bits for the address ('''&lt;math&gt;32 - 26&lt;/math&gt;'''). This allows for 64 possible combinations ('''&lt;math&gt;2^{6}&lt;/math&gt;'''), however the all zeros value and all ones value are reserved for the network ID and broadcast address respectively, leaving 62 addresses.

In general the number of available hosts on a subnet can be calculated using the formula '''&lt;math&gt;2^{n}-2&lt;/math&gt;''', where n is the number of bits used for the host portion of the address.

RFC 3021 specifies an exception to this rule when dealing with 31 bit subnet masks (i.e. 1 host bit). According to the above rule a 31 bit mask would allow for '''&lt;math&gt;2^{1}-2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;''' hosts. The RFC makes allowances in this case for certain types of networks ([[point-to-point]]) to disregard the network and broadcast address, allowing two host addresses to be allocated.

== Private subnets ==
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ([[IANA]]) has reserved the following three blocks of the IP address space for [[private network]]s:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Network address range
! CIDR notation
|-
| 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
| /8
|-
| 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
| /12
|-
| 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
| /16
|}
For example, let's say you have a Class C address and you wish to subnet it to contain 6 different internal networks.  Let’s say you have the network ID of 192.168.1.0. This specific ID is only one network and you will have to borrow bits in order to make more networks.  The subnet mask for this IP is 255.255.255.0, but this is only for one network.  In order for it to have any impact you have to borrow at least 2 bits from the left turning the subnet mask into 255.255.255.192 (its 192 because the two bits to the far left are 128 and 64).  Looking closer at the bits it would give us these networks
       
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| 192.168.1.0
|-
| 192.168.1.64
|-
| 192.168.1.128
|-
| 192.168.1.192
|-
| 192.168.1.255
|}
	Now as you can see we have a total of 5 networks, but as stated earlier you can not use the networks that have either all the bits off or on (without special commands).  So that takes away the .0 (The .0 network pertaining to our original IP address of 192.168.1.0) and the 255 networks leaving us with the networks 64 and 128 and (192?).  The main rule of thumb for networks is when you calculate how many networks you have subtract 2 so you will be left with the actual amount of usable networks.
	If we turn on the first 3 bits (turning our subnet mask into 255.255.255.224 because 128+64+32) we would get 8 networks but by subtracting 2 you're left with 6

	Now that we have our networks you must look at the remaining bits to determine how many hosts you want to configure on each network.  The same rules apply that you can not have all the bits turned off or on so 8-3=5 (Total bits – The bits we used for the networks = Bits usable for the hosts) so 2^5 is 32, minus the 2 for the network ID and the broadcast ID equals 30 usable hosts for each network.  So an example of one network would look like--
IP address			Subnet mask
192.168.1.32			255.255.255.224
Now the usable IP addresses are
192.168.1.33 to 192.168.1.62
	You should consider subnetting when you want to gain more networks from one IP address.  This is extremely helpful in dividing connectivity between multiple hosts.  Additionally, by breaking up networks into smaller chunks you alleviate some of the bandwidth on the Ethernet cable allowing for faster transfers.  Isolating problems on a network will also be easier because they will be contained in each different network.

=Data Link Layer=
The '''data link layer''' is layer two of the seven-layer [[OSI model]] as well as of the five-layer [[TCP/IP reference model]]. It responds to service requests from the [[network layer]] and issues service requests to the [[physical layer]].

This is the layer which transfers data between adjacent network nodes in a [[wide area network]] or between nodes on the same [[local area network]] [[network segment|segment]]. The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to [[transfer]] data between network entities and might provide the means to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the Physical layer. Examples of data link protocols are [[Ethernet]] for local area networks and [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]], [[HDLC]] and [[ADCCP]] for point-to-point connections.

The data link is all about getting information from one place to a selection of other places. At this layer one does not need to be able to go everywhere, just able to go somewhere else. It is analogous to social interaction in that one needs to be able to talk to Bob to get a message to Fred or James.

The data link provides data transfer across the physical link.  That transfer might or might not be reliable; many data link protocols do not have acknowledgments of successful frame reception and acceptance, and some data link protocols might not even have any form of checksum to check for transmission errors.  In those cases, higher-level protocols must provide [[flow control]], error checking, and acknowledgments and retransmission.

In some networks, such as [[IEEE 802]] local area networks, the data link layer is split into MAC and LLC sublayers; this means that the [[IEEE 802.2]] LLC protocol can be used with all of the IEEE 802 MAC layers, such as Ethernet, [[token ring]], [[IEEE 802.11]], etc., as well as with some non-802 MAC layers such as [[FDDI]].  Other data link layer protocols, such as HDLC, are specified to include both sublayers, although some other protocols, such as [[Cisco HDLC]], use HDLC's low-level framing as a MAC layer in combination with a different LLC layer

===Logical Link Control Sublayer===
The uppermost sublayer is ''[[Logical Link Control]]'' (LLC).  This sublayer [[multiplexes]] protocols running atop the data link layer, and optionally provides flow control, acknowledgment, and error recovery.

PPP and HDLC protocols works in Logical Link Control Sub Layer.

===Media Access Control Sublayer===
The sublayer below it is ''[[Media Access Control]]'' (MAC). Sometimes this refers to the sublayer that determines who is allowed to access the media at any one time (usually [[CSMA/CD]]). Other times it refers to a frame structure with MAC addresses inside. There are generally two forms of media access control: distributed and centralized. Both of these may be compared to communication between people:

* In a network made up of people speaking, i.e. a conversation, we look for clues from our fellow talkers to see if any of them appear to be about to speak. If two people speak at the same time, they will back off and begin a long and elaborate game of saying &quot;no, you first&quot;. 

The Media Access Control sublayer also determines where one frame of data ends and the next one starts. In a snail-mail network, each letter is one frame of data, and one can tell where it begins and ends because it is inside an envelope. One might also specify that a letter will begin with a phrase like &quot;Dear Sir&quot;, and ends with a phrase like &quot;Yours Sincerely&quot;.

==Examples==
* [[ARCnet]]
* [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]]
* [[Cisco Discovery Protocol]] (CDP)
* [[Controller Area Network]] (CAN)
* [[Econet]]
* [[Ethernet]]
* [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI)
* [[Frame Relay]]
* [[High-Level Data Link Control]] (HDLC)
* [[IEEE 802.2]] (provides LLC functions to IEEE 802 MAC layers)
* [[IEEE 802.11]] [[wireless LAN]]
* [[LocalTalk]]
* [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] (MPLS)
* [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP)
* Serial Line Internet Protocol ([[SLIP]]) (obsolete)
* [[StarLan]]
* [[Token ring]]
* and most forms of [[serial communication]].

==Interfaces==
The data link layer is often implemented in software as a &quot;network card driver&quot;.  The operating system will have a defined software interface between the data link and the network transport stack above.  This interface is not a layer itself, but rather a definition for interfacing between layers.   Examples include:

* [[Open Data-Link Interface|ODI]]
* [[Network Driver Interface Specification|NDIS]]
* [[SANA II]] - Standard [[Amiga]] Networking Architecture, version 2

==MAC==
The '''Media Access Control''' (MAC) [[data communication protocol]] sub-layer is a part of the [[data link layer]] specified in the [[seven-layer OSI model]]  (layer 2). It provides addressing and [[channel access]] control mechanisms that makes it possible for several [[terminal (telecommunication)|terminals]] or network nodes to communicate within a multipoint network, typically a [[local area network]] (LAN) or [[metropolitan area network]] (MAN). A MAC protocol is not required in full-duplex [[point-to-point]] communication. In single channel point-to-point communications [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Emulation_of_full_duplex_in_shared_physical_media|full-duplex can be emulated]]. This emulation can be considered a MAC layer.

The MAC sub-layer acts as an interface between the [[Logical Link Control]] sublayer and the network's [[physical layer]].

The MAC layer provides an addressing mechanism called physical address or [[MAC address]]. This is a unique serial number assigned to each [[network adapter]], making it possible to deliver data packets to a destination within a [[subnetwork]], i.e. a physical network without [[router]]s, for example an Ethernet network. 

'''Media access control''' is often used as a synonym to [[multiple access]] protocol, since the MAC sublayer provides the protocol and control mechanisms that are required for a certain [[channel access method]]. This makes it possible for several stations connected to the same [[physical medium]] to share it. Examples of shared physical media are [[bus network]]s, [[ring network]]s, [[hub network]]s, [[wireless networks]] and [[half-duplex]] point-to-point links. 

Examples of [[packet mode]] multiple access protocols for wired multi-drop networks are:
* [[CSMA/CD]] (used in [[Ethernet]] and [[IEEE 802.3]]), 
* [[Token bus]] ([[IEEE 802.4]])
* [[Token ring]] ([[IBM token ring|IEEE 802.5]])
* [[Token passing]] (used in [[FDDI]]). 

Examples of multiple access protocols that may be used in packet radio wireless networks are:
* [[CSMA/CA]] 
* [[Slotted ALOHA]] 
* [[Dynamic TDMA]] 
* [[Reservation ALOHA]] (R-ALOHA). 
* [[CDMA]]
* [[OFDMA]]

==LLC==
According to the [[IEEE 802]] family of standards, '''Logical Link Control''' ('''LLC''') is the upper sublayer of the [[OSI reference model|OSI]] [[data link layer]]. The LLC is the same for the various physical media (such as [[Ethernet]], [[token ring]], and [[WLAN]]).

The LLC sublayer is primarily concerned with: 
* [[Multiplexing]] protocols transmitted over the [[Media Access Control|MAC]] layer (when transmitting) and demultiplexing them (when receiving).
* Optionally providing [[flow control]] and detection and retransmission of dropped packets, if requested.

The protocol used in IEEE 802 networks and in some non-IEEE 802 networks such as [[Fiber distributed data interface|FDDI]] for LLC is specified by the [[IEEE 802.2]] standard.

Some non-IEEE 802 protocols can be thought of as being split into MAC and LLC layers.  For example, while [[High-Level Data Link Control|HDLC]] specifies both MAC functions (framing of packets) and LLC functions (protocol multiplexing, flow control, and detection and retransmission of dropped packets), some protocols such as [[Cisco HDLC]] can use HDLC-like packet framing and their own LLC protocol.

An LLC header tells the Data Link layer what to do with a packet once a frame is received. It works like this: A host will receive a frame and look in the LLC header to find out where the packet is destined for - say, the IP protocol at the Network layer or IPX.

==LAN switching concepts==

===Bridge===
A layer 2 device used to connect different networks types or networks of the same type. It maps the Ethernet addresses of the nodes residing on each segment and allows only the necessary traffic to pass through the bridge. Packet destined to the same segment is dropped. This &quot;store-and-forward&quot; mechanism inspects the whole Ethernet packet before making a decision. Unfortunately, it cannot filter out broadcast traffic. Also, it introduces a 20 to 30 percent latency when processing the frame. Only 2 networks can be linked with a bridge. bridge is necessary device used in 
switching.

===Switch===
Switches are layer 2 devices (''it can be of layer3 and above'') that can link up four, six, eight or even more networks. Switches are the only devices that allow for micro segmentation. Cut-through switches run faster because when a packet comes in, it forwards it right after looking at the destination address only. A store-and-forward switch inspects the entire packet before forwarding. Most switches cannot stop broadcast traffic. Switches are considered dedicated data link device because they are close to a 100 % of the bandwidth. While bridging does most of its work by software, switches use ASICS hardware to handle most of its work. A Switch can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.

===Store-and-forward===
The entire frame is received before any forwarding takes place. The destination and/or the source addresses are read and filters are applied before the frame is forwarded. Latency occurs while the frame is being received; the latency is greater with larger frames because the entire frame takes longer to read. Error detection is high because of the time available to the switch to check for errors while waiting for the entire frame to be received. This method discards frames smaller than 64 bytes (runts) and frames larger than 1518 bytes (giants).

===Cut-Through===
The switch reads the destination address before receiving the entire frame. The frame is then forwarded before the entire frame arrives. This mode decreases the latency of the transmission and has poor error detection. This method has two forms, Fast-forward and fragment-free.

====Fast-forward switching====
Fast-forward switching offers the lowest level of latency by immediately forwarding a packet after receiving the destination address. Because fast-forward switching does not check for errors, there may be times when frames are relayed with errors. Although this occurs infrequently and the destination network adapter discards the fault frame upon receipt. In networks with high collision rates, this can negatively affect available bandwidth.
====Fragment Free Switching====
Use the fragment-free option to reduce the number of collisions in frames forwarded with errors. In fast-forward mode, latency is measured from the first bit received to the first bit transmitted, or first in, first out (FIFO). Fragment-free switching filters out collision fragments, which are the majority of packets errors, before forwarding begins. In a properly functioning network, collision fragments must be smaller than 64 bytes. Anything greater than 64 bytes is a valid packet and is usually received without error. Fragment-free switching waits until the received packet has been determined not to be a collision fragment before forwarding the packet. In fragment-free, latency is measured as FIFO.

==VLANs and trunking==
A '''virtual LAN''', commonly known as a '''vLAN''' or as a '''VLAN''', is a method of creating independent logical networks within a physical network. Several VLANs can co-exist within such a network. This helps in reducing the broadcast domain and aids in network administration by separating logical segments of a  LAN (like company departments) that should not exchange data using a LAN (they still can exchange data by Inter-VLAN routing).

A VLAN consists of a network of computers that behave as if connected to the same wire - even though they may actually be physically connected to different segments of a LAN. Network administrators configure VLANs through software rather than hardware, which makes them extremely flexible. One of the biggest advantages of VLANs emerges when physically moving a computer to another location: it can stay on the same VLAN without the need for any hardware reconfiguration.

==Advantages of VLANs==
* Increase the number of '''broadcast domains''' but reduce the size of each '''broadcast domain''', which in turn reduces network traffic and increases network security (both of which are hampered in cases of single large broadcast domains).
* Reduce management effort to create subnetworks.
* Reduce hardware requirement, as networks can be logically instead of physically separated.
* Increase control over multiple traffic types.

== Protocols and design ==
The primary protocol currently used in configuring virtual LANs is IEEE 802.1Q, which describes how traffic on a single physical network can be partitioned into virtual LANs by tagging each frame or packet with extra bytes to denote which virtual network the packet belongs to.  

Prior to the introduction of the 802.1Q standard, several proprietary protocols existed, such as Cisco's ISL (Inter-Switch Link, a variant of IEEE 802.10) and 3Com's VLT (Virtual LAN Trunk). ISL is no longer supported by Cisco.

Early network designers often configured VLANs with the aim of reducing the size of the collision domain in a large single Ethernet segment and thus improving performance. When Ethernet switches made this a non-issue (because they have no collision domain), attention turned to reducing the size of the broadcast domain at the MAC layer.  Virtual networks can also serve to restrict access to network resources without regard to physical topology of the network, although the strength of this method remains debatable as VLAN Hopping is a common means of bypassing such security measures.

Virtual LANs operate at Layer 2 (the data link layer) of the OSI model. However, administrators often configure a VLAN to map directly to an IP network, or subnet, which gives the appearance of involving Layer 3 (the network layer).

In the context of VLANs, the term &quot;trunk&quot; denotes a network link carrying multiple VLANs, which are identified by labels (or &quot;tags&quot;) inserted into their packets. Such trunks must run between &quot;tagged ports&quot; of VLAN-aware devices, so they are often switch-to-switch or switch-to-router links rather than links to hosts. (Confusingly, the term 'trunk' is also used for what Cisco calls &quot;channels&quot; : Link Aggregation or Port Trunking). A router (Layer 3 switch) serves as the backbone for network traffic going across different VLANs.

On Cisco devices, VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) allows for VLAN domains, which can aid in administrative tasks. VTP also allows &quot;pruning&quot;, which involves directing specific VLAN traffic only to switches which have ports on the target VLAN.

== Assigning VLAN Memberships ==
The four methods of assigning VLAN memberships that are in use are:
* Port-based: A switch port is manually configured to be a member of a VLAN. In order to connect a port to several VLANs (for example, a link with VLANs spanning over several switches) the port has to be member of a trunk. Only one VLAN on a port can be set ''untagged''; the switch will add this VLAN's tags to untagged received frames and remove this VLAN's tag from transmitted frames.
* MAC-based: VLAN membership is based on the MAC address of the workstation. The switch has a table listing the MAC address of each machine, along with the VLAN to which it belongs.
* Protocol-based: Layer 3 data within the frame is used to determine VLAN membership. For example, IP machines can be classified as the first VLAN, and AppleTalk machines as the second. The major disadvantage of this method is that it violates the independence of the layers, so an upgrade from IPv4 to IPv6, for example, will cause the switch to fail.
* Authentication based: Devices can be automatically placed into VLANs based on the authentication credentials of a user or device using the 802.1x protocol.

=== Port Based VLANs ===
A port based VLAN switch determines the membership of a data frame
by examining the configuration of the port that received the transmission
or reading a portion of the data frame’s tag header. A four-byte field in the
header is used to identify the VLAN. This VLAN identification indicates
what VLAN the frame belongs to. If the frame has no tag header, the
switch checks the VLAN setting of the port that received the frame. If the
switch has been configured for port based VLAN support, it assigns the

==Spanning Tree==
The '''spanning tree''' network protocol provides a loop free topology for any bridged LAN. The Spanning Tree Protocol, which is also referred to as '''STP''', is defined in the IEEE Standard 802.1D. Spanning tree is based on an algorithm invented by Radia Perlman while working for Digital Equipment Corporation. STP is used in switched networks to prevent loops, and has been standardized by IEEE 802.1D. As the name suggests, it finds a spanning tree within the mesh network formed by the installer, whether purposefully created or not, and disables the links not part of that tree. There are two different standards of STP: IEEE and DEC. IEEE is the most common, and is recommended to be the one used in a network. Problems can be caused in networks where both standards of STP are implemented. It is likely that both standards will elect their own root bridge and cause loops in the topology. The way in which both standards handle Bridge Protocol Data Units (see below) also differs.

If more than one open path ''were'' to be active at once then there would be several problems. First, a broadcast storm caused by broadcast packets looping between switches would reduce available CPU resources and bandwidth (many modern bridges can detect and limit the effects of this, although it usually still causes a breakdown in connectivity). Second, the traditional source-based location system (filtering database) used by switches would fail to operate correctly. However, a good network design should include spare (redundant) links to provide an alternate path if one fails. Hence the need for spanning tree in a switched network.

== Protocol operation ==
* Elect a root bridge.
* Find paths to root bridge.
* Determine least cost (measured as sum of all traversed port costs) path to root bridge.
* Disable all other root paths.

=== Electing a root bridge ===
Each switch has a unique identifier (ID) and a configurable priority number; both of these numbers make up the Bridge Identification or BID. The BID is used to elect a root bridge based upon the lowest priority number; if this is a tie then the numerically lowest ID wins. Because it is next to impossible that two IDs will be the same (they are uniquely assigned), one switch should always be successfully elected as the root bridge with the switch that has the next lowest priority/cost acting as a secondary (backup) root bridge. Other switches in the network that use spanning tree will use the same algorithmic process to calculate the shortest path to the root bridge and so produce a loop free tree topology where multiple paths to the root bridge exist. The priority number is normally left at its default value but can be reconfigured to a lower number if the network administrator wishes a particular switch to be elected; otherwise the whole process is fully automated. The Bridge ID is the concatenation of bridge priority number and MAC address of the switch.
The bridge priority number varies from 0 to 65535. The Switch with least administrative cost is selected as a 
Root Bridge.

=== Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) ===
BIDs and other Spanning Tree Protocol information are carried in special data frames called bridge protocol data units (BPDUs). BPDUs are exchanged regularly (every 2 seconds by default) and enable switches to keep track of network changes and activate or disable ports as required. When a device is first attached to a switch port, it will not immediately start to forward data. It will instead go through a number of states while it processes BPDUs and determines the topology of the network. When a host is attached such as a computer, printer or server the port will always go into the forwarding state, albeit after a delay of about 30 seconds while it goes through the listening and learning states (see below). The time spent in the listening and learning states is determined by a value known as the forward delay (default 15 seconds and set by the root bridge). However, if instead another ''switch'' is connected, the port may remain in blocking mode if it is determined that it would cause a loop in the network. Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDUs are used to inform other switches of port changes. TCNs are injected into the network by a non-root switch and propagated to the root. Upon receipt of the TCN, the root switch will set a Topology Change flag in its normal BPDUs. This flag is propagated to all other switches to instruct them to rapidly age out their forwarding table entries.

'''STP switch port states:'''

*'''Listening''' - The switch processes BPDUs and awaits possible new information that would cause it to return to the blocking state.
*'''Learning''' - While the port does not yet forward frames (packets) it does learn source addresses from frames received and adds them to the filtering database (switching database)
*'''Blocking''' - A port that would cause a switching loop, no user data is sent or received but it may go into forwarding mode if the other links in use were to fail and the spanning tree algorithm determines the port may transition to the forwarding state. BPDU data is still received in blocking state.
*'''Forwarding''' - A port receiving and sending data, normal operation. STP still monitors incoming BPDUs that would indicate it should return to the blocking state to prevent a loop.
*'''Disabled''' - Not strictly part of STP, a network administrator can manually disable a port

To prevent the delay when connecting hosts to a switch and during some topology changes, Rapid STP was developed and standardized by IEEE 802.1w which allows a switch port to rapidly transition into the forwarding state during these situations.

==Evolutions and extensions==
===Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST)===
In Ethernet switched environments where multiple Virtual LANs exist, spanning tree can be deployed per Virtual LAN. 
Cisco's name for this is ''per VLAN spanning tree'' (PVST and PVST+ which is the default protocol used by Cisco switches).
Both PVST and PVST+ protocols are Cisco proprietary protocols and they cannot be used on 3rd party switches.
PVST only works with ISL due to its embedded Spanning tree ID.
Due to high penetration of the IEEE 802.1Q] trunking standard and PVST's incompatibility with 802.1Q, Cisco redefined its PVST standard and called it PVST+.

===Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)===
In 1998, the IEEE introduced an evolution of the Spanning Tree Protocol: Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) or 802.1w. In the 2004 edition of 802.1D, STP is superseded by the RSTP.

RSTP is an evolution of the Spanning Tree Protocol; it was introduced in the extension IEEE 802.1w, and provides for faster spanning tree convergence after a topology change. Standard IEEE 802.1D-2004 now incorporates RSTP and obsoletes STP.

'''RSTP bridge port roles:'''

*'''Root''' - A forwarding port that has been elected for the spanning-tree topology
*'''Designated''' - A forwarding port for every LAN segment
*'''Alternate''' - An alternate path to the root bridge. This path is different than using the root port.
*'''Backup''' - A backup/redundant path to a segment where another bridge port already connects.
*'''Disabled''' - Not strictly part of STP, a network administrator can manually disable a port

RSTP is a refinement of STP and therefore shares most of its basic operation characteristics. However there are some notable differences as summarized below:

* Detection of root switch failure is done in 3 hello times, which is 6 seconds if default hello times have not been changed.
* Ports may be configured as edge ports if they are attached to a LAN which has no other bridges attached. These edge ports transition directly to the forwarding state. RSTP still continues to monitor the port for BPDUs in case a bridge is connected. RSTP can also be configured to automatically detect edge ports. As soon as the bridge detects a BPDU coming to an edge port, the port becomes a non-edge port.
* Unlike in STP, RSTP will respond to BPDUs sent from the direction of the root bridge. An RSTP bridge will &quot;propose&quot; to its designated ports its spanning tree information. If another RSTP bridge receives this information, determines this is the superior root information, and sets all its other ports to discarding. The bridge may send an &quot;agreement&quot; to the first bridge confirming its superior spanning tree information. The first bridge, upon receiving this agreement, knows it can rapidly transition that port to the forwarding state bypassing the traditional listening/learning state transition. This essentially creates a cascading effect away from the root bridge where each designated bridge proposes to its neighbors to determine if it can make a rapid transition. This is one of the major elements which allows RSTP to achieve faster convergence times than STP.
* As discussed in the port role details above, RSTP maintains backup details regarding the discarding status of ports. This avoids timeouts if the current forwarding ports were to fail or BPDUs were not received on the root port in a certain interval.

===Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP)===
The ''Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol'' (MSTP), originally defined in IEEE 802.1s and later merged into IEEE 802.1Q-2003, defines an extension to the RSTP protocol to further develop the usefulness of virtual LANs (VLANs). This &quot;Per-VLAN&quot; Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol configures a separate Spanning Tree for each VLAN group and blocks the links that are redundant within each Spanning Tree.

If there is only one Virtual LAN(VLAN) in the network, single (traditional) STP works appropriately. If the network contains more than one VLAN, the logical network configured by single STP would work, but it is possible to make better use of the redundant links available by using an alternate spanning tree for different (groups of) VLANs.

MSTP allows formation of MST regions which can run multiple MST instances (MSTI). Multiple regions and other STP bridges are interconnected using one single common spanning tree (CST).

MSTP was inspired by Cisco Systems' '''Multiple Instances Spanning Tree Protocol''' (MISTP), and is an evolution of the Spanning Tree Protocol and the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol. It was introduced in IEEE 802.1s as amendment to 802.1Q, 1998 edition. Standard IEEE 802.1Q-2003 now includes MSTP.

Unlike some proprietary per-VLAN spanning tree implementations, MSTP includes all of its spanning tree information in a single BPDU format. Not only does this reduce the number of BPDUs required on a LAN to communicate spanning tree information for each VLAN, but it also ensures backward compatibility with RSTP (and in effect classical STP too). MSTP does this by encoding additional region information after the standard RSTP BPDU as well as a number of MSTI messages (from 0 to 64 instances, although in practice many bridges support less). Each of these MSTI configuration messages conveys the spanning tree information for each instance. Each instance can be assigned a number of configured VLANs and frames (packets) assigned to these VLANs operate in this spanning tree instance whenever they are inside the MST region. In order to avoid conveying their entire VLAN to spanning tree mapping in each BPDU, bridges encode an MD5 digest of their VLAN to instance table in the MSTP BPDU. This digest is then used by other MSTP bridges, along with other administratively configured values, to determine if the neighboring bridge is in the same MST region as itself.

MSTP is fully compatible with RSTP bridges, in that an MSTP BPDU can be interpreted by an RSTP bridge as an RSTP BPDU. This not only allows compatibility with RSTP bridges without configuration changes, but also causes any RSTP bridges outside of an MSTP region to see the region as a single RSTP bridge, regardless of the number of MSTP bridges inside the region itself. In order to further facilitate this view of an MST region as a single RSTP bridge, the MSTP protocol uses a variable known as remaining hops as a time to live counter instead of the message age timer used by RSTP. The message age time is only incremented once when spanning tree information enters an MST region, and therefore RSTP bridges will see a region as only one &quot;hop&quot; in the spanning tree. Ports at the edge of an MST region connected to either a RSTP or STP bridge or an endpoint are known as boundary ports. As in RSTP, these ports can be configured as edge ports to facilitate rapid changes to the forwarding state when connected to endpoints.

=Physical Layer=
The '''physical layer''' is level one in the seven level [[OSI model]] of [[computer network|computer networking]] as well as in the five layer [[TCP/IP reference model]]. It performs services requested by the [[data link layer]]. 

The physical layer is the most basic network layer, providing only the means of transmitting raw bits rather than packets over a physical [[data link]] connecting [[network node]]s. No packet headers nor trailers are consequently added to the data by the physical layer. The [[bit stream]] may be grouped into code words or symbols, and converted to a physical [[signal]], which is transmitted over a physical [[transmission medium]]. The physical layer provides an electrical, mechanical, and procedural interface to the transmission medium. The shapes of the [[electrical connector]]s, which frequencies to broadcast on, what [[modulation]] scheme to use and similar low-level parameters are specified here. An analogy of this layer in a physical mail network would be the roads along which the vans carrying the mail drive.

The physical layer determines the [[bit rate]] in bit/s, also known as [[channel capacity]], digital [[bandwidth]], [[maximum throughput]] or [[connection speed]]. 

The major functions and services performed by the physical layer are: 
* Bit-by-bit node-to-node delivery
* Providing a standardized interface to physical [[transmission media]], including 
** Mechanical specification of [[electrical connector]]s and [[cable]]s, for example maximum cable length
** Electrical specification of [[transmission line]] [[signal level]] and [[electrical impedance|impedance]] 
** Radio interface, including [[electromagnetic spectrum]] [[frequency allocation]] and specification of [[signal strength]], analog [[bandwidth]], etc.
** Specifications for [[Infrared radiation|IR]] over [[optical fiber]] or a wireless IR communication link

== Physical signaling sublayer ==
In a [[local area network]] (LAN) or a [[metropolitan area network]] (MAN) using [[open systems interconnection]] (OSI) architecture, the ''physical signaling sublayer'' is the portion of the physical layer that:
* interfaces with the [[medium access control sublayer]] (MAC)which is a part of Data Link Layer
* performs [[character (computing)|character]] encoding, [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], [[reception (telecommunications)|reception]] and decoding
* performs mandatory isolation functions.

'''Frame Relay'''

Frame Relay is a high-performance WAN protocol that operates at the physical and data link layers of the OSI reference model. Frame Relay originally was designed for use across Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) interfaces. Today, it is used over a variety of other network interfaces as well. This chapter focuses on Frame Relay's specifications and applications in the context of WAN services.

Frame Relay is an example of a packet-switched technology. Packet-switched networks enable end stations to dynamically share the network medium and the available bandwidth. The following two techniques are used in packet-switching technology:

•Variable-length packets

•Statistical multiplexing

Variable-length packets are used for more efficient and flexible data transfers. These packets are switched between the various segments in the network until the destination is reached.

Statistical multiplexing techniques control network access in a packet-switched network. The advantage of this technique is that it accommodates more flexibility and more efficient use of bandwidth. Most of today's popular LANs, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, are packet-switched networks.

Frame Relay often is described as a streamlined version of X.25, offering fewer of the robust capabilities, such as windowing and retransmission of last data that are offered in X.25. This is because Frame Relay typically operates over WAN facilities that offer more reliable connection services and a higher degree of reliability than the facilities available during the late 1970s and early 1980s that served as the common platforms for X.25 WANs. As mentioned earlier, Frame Relay is strictly a Layer 2 protocol suite, whereas X.25 provides services at Layer 3 (the network layer) as well. This enables Frame Relay to offer higher performance and greater transmission efficiency than X.25, and makes Frame Relay suitable for current WAN applications, such as LAN interconnection.

=Router Operation=


==Operating and Configuring IOS Devices==
One can think of Cisco networking devices as specialized computer devices designed to perform the task of handling data packets. As with other computers, the Cisco device has an operating system. Most Cisco networtking equipment executes the ''Cisco Internetworking Operating System'' which is usually just known as Cisco IOS.

Cisco IOS has a command line interface (CLI) and using this is similar in style to using the command line environment in Windows, or alternatively a Unix shell such as Bash. It is important to realize that the set of commands that one
uses in Cisco CLI is completely different from those available on the CLIs for Windows or Unix. Cisco CLI is designed for the purposes of configuring, and therefore also for inspecting the configuration of, a networking device. Obviously it is not designed for general purpose computing in the way in which the Bash shell is.

===Telnet and Console Access===
Generally, there are two ways to get access to the Cisco CLI. On the one hand, one can always connect to the
''console'' port on the device and this is the way that devices, e.g. routers or switches, are configured when they are taken out of the box to be installed and commissioned. On the other hand, once the device has been commissioned and placed on a network, one can launch a telnet session from a computer on the network and connect to the telnet server on the Cisco device. What distinguishes these two access mechanisms is whether or not one needs to be physically beside the device. Obviously with console access one needs to be close to the device whereas with telnet access one could, in principle, be anywhere on the IP network on which the device is installed. Of course there may be, and usually there are, security mechanisms installed on the network to restrict the client which can access any networking device such as a Cisco router or switch.

Regardless of the mechanism by which one establishes a connection to the CLI, the activity is known in Cisco terminology as establishing an '''EXEC session'''.

===Privilege Levels within an EXEC Session===
Most command line environments provide some type of restriction on which commands a user can execute. 
In Unix for example, this is achieved through a combination of the user id and group id. In Cisco CLI, it is
achieved by having two levels of privilege. Normally, when any user logs in, they are automatically 
in '''user mode'''. In this mode, the configuration of the device can be viewed but not modified. This means
that the commands which can be actioned in user mode are not critical to the operation of the device.

If the device has been configured to have the name ''MyDevice'', then the CLI prompt in user mode 
will be 

    MyDevice&gt;

One example of a command is ''show version'', which prints out details of various aspects of the
hardware and IOS software running on the device. Executing 

    MyDevice&gt;show version

on a Cisco Catalyst 2960G 24 port Ethernet switch, which has been configured to have the hostname ''MyDevice'', 
yielded the following output

   Configuration register is 0xF


If one types the command '''enable''' when in user mode, then IOS will attempt to enter ''privileged mode''.
Generally, a password is set for privileged mode, clearly a good security practice, when the device is 
commissioned but this is not always the case. If a password has been set, then the user will be required to
enter it successfully in order for IOS to transition to privileged mode. 

Once in privileged mode, all of the commands that were available in user mode remain available but in addition 
the user now has access to commands which can configure, restart or debug the networking device. In that sense,
these are deemed to be critical commands. For example, one can switch off an Ethernet port thereby stopping
all layer 2 data packets to/from computers connected, whether directly or indirectly, to that port. If this were
not the action which one intended, then the consequences for users of the connected computers could be 
catastrophic.   

To exit from privileged mode and return to user mode, the CLI command is 

        disable

==Internet Protocol==

Internet Protocol(IP) is basically the Internet layer. The other protocols in this layer exist to support the IP. IP uses the packet address and looks up the address in its routing table and decides where to send the packet by selecting the best possible path. IP receives segments from the Host-to-Host layer and fragments them into datagrams (packets) if necessary.IP then reassembles datagrams back into segments on the receiving side. Each datagram is assigned the IP of the sender and of the recipient. Each router (layer-3 device) that receives a datagram makes routing decisions based on the packets destination I address.

An IP header is made up of the following fields.
*Version: IP version number.
*Header length: Header length (HLEN) in 32-bit words.
*Priority and Type of Service: Type of Service tells how the datagram should be handled. The first 3 bits are the priority bits which is now called the differentiated service bits.
*Total Length:- Length of the packet including header and data.
*Flags: Specifies whether fragmentation and reassembly if the packet is too large to put in a frame. It allows different maximum transmission units (MTUs) on the internet.
*Time To Live: The time to live is set into a packet when it is originally generated. If it doesn't get to where it wants to go before the before the TTl expires, the packet is dropped from the network. This stops IP packets from continuously circling the network looking for a home.
*Protocol: Port of upper-layer protocol (TCP is port 6 or UDP is port 17). Also supports Network layer protocols, Like ARP and ICMP (this can be called Type Field in some analyzers).

'''IP source guard without DHCP'''
When DHCP snooping is enabled, a switch maintains a database of the DHCP addresses assigned to the hosts connected to each access port. IP source guard references this database when a packet is received on any of these interfaces and compares the source address to the assigned address listed in the database. If the source address differs from the &quot;allowed&quot; address, the packet is assumed to spoofed and is discarded.
Assuming DHCP isn't available or in use on a subnet, static IP bindings can be manually configured per access port to achieve the same effect.

Configuration

when you try to ping from sw4 it will generate arp error in sw1 but there will be no issue in case of sw2 and sw3 as the ip address to mac-address mapping is done by using arp-acl.

WAN = Wide Area Network

WANs function at the physical and datalink layer of the OSI model. What differentiates a WAN from a LAN is the physical distance that a WAN can traverse while LANs are limited to buildings, WANs cover extensive geographical areas.

WAN interconnects physically distance LAN
 
WAN usually operate at the lower two layers of the OSI model, which is physical and datalink. Packet switching, circuit switching and leased lines are the valid WAN connectivity methods.

In a WAN the layer two address differs from the layer two address of the LAN.  Since in a WAN the data is not traveling through the Ethernet, the valid encapsulations are DLCI for frame relay and HDLC (high level data link connection identifier).</text>

== Getting started with Cisco ==

 The basic router prompt, called user exec mode, - If it's not properly configured means,
 '''Router &gt;'''

 If it's configured properly means,
 '''Hostname of router &gt;'''

&lt;big&gt;Modes&lt;/big&gt;
 Router&gt;? or  Router&gt;show ?
 Router# - privileged exec mode

&lt;big&gt;Configuring your Cisco Router&lt;/big&gt;
 Router#show interfaces
 Router#show ip protocols
 Router#show ip route
 Router#show ip arp

Then go to the global configuration mode...
 Router#config
 Router(config)#

&lt;big&gt;Configuring Hostname&lt;/big&gt;

 Router(config)#hostname ExampleName
 ExampleName(config)#

&lt;big&gt;Designate the DNS server&lt;/big&gt;
 ExampleName(config)#ip name-server aa.bb.cc.dd
 ExampleName(config)#ctrl-Z
 ExampleName#
Then save configuration using CTRL+Z

&lt;big&gt;Configure Serial and Ethernet Interfaces&lt;/big&gt;
 ExampleName#config terminal
 ExampleName(config)#interface ethernet 0/1
 ExampleName(config-if)#ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 ExampleName(config-if)#[Ctrl-Z]

 ExampleName#config
 ExampleName(config)#interface serial 1/1
 ExampleName(config-if)#ip address 192.168.155.2 255.255.255.0
 ExampleName(config-if)#no shutdown
 ExampleName(config-if)#ctrl-Z
 ExampleName#

Note the no shutdown command. An interface may be correctly configured and physically connected, yet be &quot;administratively down&quot;. In this state it will not function. The command for causing an interface to be administratively down is shutdown.

&lt;big&gt;Configuring Cisco Routing&lt;/big&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Temperature 18-20)
The body generates heat as a result of chemical reactions taking place in it. Energy is constantly lost from the surface of the body through the skin as heat. A small amount of heat is also lost with expired air, urine and faeces.

The rate at which heat (energy) is lost from the body depends on conditions such as the temperature of the surroundings, how much skin is exposed and the level of activity of the body.

Normally, body temperature is regulated by homeostatic mechanisms and maintained at a more or less constant value. Variation from this value may indicate a failure of these mechanisms and a probable health problem. However, the body can produce a physiological response to conditions such as fever and will raise the body temperature to aid recovery.

The range of body temperatures measured in the mouth:
normal 36.8°C ; range 36.5.37.2°C
death below 25°C
hypothermia 32°C
fever above 37.2°C
heat exhaustion or heat stroke likely if above 38°C in absence of infection
high temperatures that would lead to death above 43°C

19•  how temperature is controlled and regulated by the nervous system, the circulatory system and the skin. You should be able to describe the temperature control mechanisms of sweating, vasodilation, vasoconstriction and shivering;
20•  the circumstances in which particular individuals may be at risk of hypothermia, heat exhaustion or heat stroke.

==Thermoregulation==

'''Thermoregulation''' is the ability of an organism to keep its body temperature within certain boundaries, even when temperature surrounding is very different. This process is one aspect of homeostasis: a dynamic state of stability between an animal's internal environment and its ''external'' environment.

If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia.

Heat production and heat loss vary considerably in different parts of the body, although the circulation of the blood tends to bring about a mean temperature of the internal parts. Hence it is important to determine the temperature of those parts which most nearly approaches to that of the internal organs. Also for such results to be comparable they must be made in the same situation. The rectum gives most accurately the temperature of internal parts. Occasionally that of the urine as it leaves the urethra may be of use. More usually the temperature is taken in the mouth, axilla or groin.

===Temperature regulation===

# conduction - heat escapes from or enters into your body  e.g.when lying on a cold or hot surface. 
# convection - cooler air currents remove heat from the surface of your skin, warmer air currents make the skin hotter. 
# evaporation - evaporative cooling occurs when water (from perspiration or swimming) leaves the skin surface as a vapour, lowering the body temperature by taking the heat from the body.
# radiation - e.g. acquisition of heat from solar radiation or losing heat from the skin. 


===Types of thermoregulation===
There are two types of thermoregulation that are used by animals:

#'''physiological regulation''':  '''Endothermy''' - This is when an organism changes its physiology to regulate body temperature.  For example, many mammals tend to sweat in order to lower temperature.  Another example is when humans get cold, muscles may shiver in order to produce heat.
#'''behavioral regulation''': '''Ectothermy''' - This is when an organism changes its behaviour to change its body temperature.  For example, when animals warm up in direct sunlight, they may wish to find shade to cool down.

===Thermoregulation in vertebrates===
[[Image:thermoregulation_simplified.png|thumb|250px|Human thermoregulation (simplified)]]
Almost all birds and mammals have a high temperature almost constant and independent of that of the surrounding air. This is called '''homeothermy'''.


To regulate body temperature, an organism may need to prevent heat gains in arid environments. Evaporation of water, either across respiratory surfaces or across the skin in those animals possessing sweat glands (mammals) helps in cooling body temperature to within the organism's tolerance range.

Skin often has a continuous layer of insulating fat beneath the dermis &amp;mdash; in marine mammals like whales this is referred to as blubber. Organisms when presented with the problem of regulating body temperature not only have behavioural, physiological and structural adaptations, but also a feedback system to trigger these adaptations to regulate temperature accordingly. The main features of this system are; Stimulus, Receptor, Modulator, Effector and then the feedback of the now adjusted temperature to the Stimulus. This cyclical process aids in homeostasis.

In cold environments, mammals employ the following adaptations and strategies to minimize heat loss: 
# using small smooth muscles (arrector pili) which are attached to hair shafts; this shivering thermogenesis distorts the surface of the skin as the hair shaft is made more erect (called goose bumps or pimples) 

In warm environments, birds and mammals employ the following adaptations and strategies to maximize heat loss: 
# behavioral adaptations 
# evaporative cooling by perspiration 

=== Variations in the temperature of human beings and some animals===
[[Image:1911 Animal heat.png|thumb|Chart showing diurnal variation in body temperature, ranging from about 37.5 °C from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and falling to about 36.3 °C from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.]]

===Variations from thermometer placement===
As stated above, the temperature of warm-blooded animals is maintained with but slight variation. In health under normal conditions the temperature of humans varies between 36.5 °C and 37.5 °C, or if the thermometer be placed in the axilla, between 36.25 °C and 37.5 °C. In the mouth the reading would be from 0.25 °C to 1.5 °C higher than this; and in the rectum some 0.9 °C higher still. The temperature of infants and young children has a much greater range than this, and is susceptible of wide divergencies from comparatively slight causes.

===Variations associated with development===

The average temperature falls slightly from infancy to puberty and again from puberty to middle age, but after that stage is passed the temperature begins to rise again, and by about the eightieth year is as high as in infancy.

===Variations due to circadian rhythms===
In humans, a diurnal variation has been observed dependent on the periods of rest and activity, the maximum ranging from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., the minimum from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. These observations indicate that body temperature is partially regulated by circadian rhythms.
===Variations due to women's menstrual cycles===
During the follicular phase (which lasts from the first day of menstruation until the day of ovulation), the average basal body temperature in women ranges from 36.45 - 36.7 °C. Within 24 hours of ovulation, women experience an elevation of 0.15 - 0.45 °C due to the increased metabolic rate caused by sharply elevated levels of progesterone. The basal body temperature ranges between 36.7 - 37.3°C throughout the luteal phase, and drops down to pre-ovulatory levels within a few days of menstruation. Women can chart this phenomenon to determine whether and when they are ovulating, or to aid conception or contraception. 

===Variations due to fever===
Fever is a regulated elevation of the set point of core temperature in the hypothalamus, caused by circulating pyrogens produced by the immune system. To the subject, a rise in core temperature due to fever may result in feeling cold in an environment that people without fever do not.

=== Limits compatible with life ===

There are limits both of heat and cold that a warm-blooded animal can bear.

The effect of too extreme a cold is to lessen metabolism, and hence to lessen the production of heat. Both catabolic and anabolic changes share in the depression, and though less energy is used up, still less energy is generated. This diminished metabolism tells first on the central nervous system, especially the brain and those parts concerned in consciousness. Both heart rate and respiration rate become diminished, drowsiness supervenes, becoming steadily deeper until it passes into the sleep of death. Occasionally, however, convulsions may set in towards the end, and a death somewhat similar to that of asphyxia takes place. 

On the other hand, too high a temperature hurries on the metabolism of the various tissues at such a rate that their capital is soon exhausted. Blood that is too warm produces dyspnea and soon exhausts the metabolic capital of the respiratory centre. Heart rate is increased, the beats then become arrhythmic and finally cease. The central nervous system is also profoundly affected, consciousness may be lost, and the patient falls into a comatose condition, or delirium and convulsions may set in. All these changes can be watched in any patient suffering from an acute fever. The lower limit of temperature that man can endure depends on many things, but no one can survive a temperature of 45°C or above for very long. Mammalian muscle becomes rigid with heat rigor at about 50°C, and obviously should this temperature be reached the sudden rigidity of the whole body would render life impossible. 

== Human temperature variation effects ==
===Hot===

Fevers are not to be confused with heat stroke.  In fever the person can feel cold at high body temperatures since the body is fooled into thinking it is cold by the infectant microbe affecting the point that the body thermostat is set at.  It is literally set higher than usual.

*'''37°C (98.6°F)''' - Normal body temperature (which varies between about 36.12-37.5°C (96.8-99.5°F)

==Hypothermia==

'''Hypothermia''' refers to any condition in which the temperature of a body drops below the level required for normal metabolism and/or bodily function to take place.  In warm-blooded animals, core body temperature is maintained at or near a constant level through biologic homeostasis.  When the body is exposed to colder temperatures, however, its internal mechanisms may be unable to replenish the heat that is being lost to the body's surroundings.

Hypothermia is the opposite of hyperthermia. Because the words sound alike, they are easily confused. 

===Stages of Hypothermia in Humans ===
;Stage 1: Body temperature drops by 1°C - 2°C below normal temperature. Mild to strong shivering occurs. Unable to perform complex tasks with the hands; the hands become numb. Blood vessels in the outer extremities contract, lessening heat loss to the outside air.  Breathing becomes quick and shallow.  Goose bumps form, raising body hair on end in an  attempt to create an insulating layer of air around the body (a vestigial response, but useful in other species).  
;Stage 2: Body temperature drops by 2°C - 4°C. Shivering becomes more violent. Muscle miscoordination becomes apparent. Movements are slow and laboured, accompanied by a stumbling pace and mild confusion, although the victim may appear alert. Surface blood vessels contract further as the body focuses its remaining resources on keeping the vital organs warm.  Victim becomes pale.  Lips, ears, fingers and toes may become blue.
;Stage 3: Body temperature drops below approximately 32°C (normal is 37°C). Shivering usually stops below 32°C; difficulty speaking, sluggish thinking, and amnesia start to appear; inability to use hands and stumbling are also usually present. Cellular metabolic processes shut down. Below 30°C the exposed skin becomes blue and puffy, muscle coordination very poor, walking nearly impossible, and the victim exhibits incoherent/irrational behavior including terminal burrowing behaviour or even a stupor. Pulse and respiration rates decrease significantly but fast heart rates (ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation) can occur. Major organs fail.  Clinical death occurs. Because of decreased cellular activity in stage 3 hypothermia, the body will actually take longer to undergo brain death.

==Hyperthermia==

'''Hyperthermia''' (hyperpyrexia), in its advanced state referred to as '''heat stroke''' or '''sunstroke''', is an acute condition which occurs when the body produces or absorbs more [[heat]] than it can dissipate. It is usually due to excessive exposure to heat. The heat-regulating mechanisms of the body eventually become overwhelmed and unable to effectively deal with the heat, and body temperature climbs uncontrollably. This is a serious medical emergency that requires immediate attention.

Hyperthermia is the opposite of hypothermia. Because the words sound alike, they are easily confused.

===Progression===
Body temperatures above 40 °C are life-threatening. At 41 °C, brain death begins, and at 45 °C death is nearly certain. Internal temperatures above 50 °C will cause rigidity in the muscles and certain, immediate death. 

Heat stroke may come on suddenly, but usually follows a less-threatening condition commonly referred to as ''heat exhaustion'' or ''heat prostration''.

===Signs and symptoms===

''Heat prostration'', or ''heat exhaustion'', is  characterized by mental confusion, muscle cramps, and often nausea or vomiting. At this stage the victim will likely NOT be sweating. With continued exposure to ambient heat, which sometimes is facilitated by the mental confusion, temperature may rise into the 39 to 40 °C range, and lead to full-blown ''heat stroke''.

One of the body's most important methods of temperature regulation is sweating. This process draws heat from inside, allowing it to be carried off by radiation and/or convection. Evaporation of the sweat furthers the cooling process, since this is an endothermic process that draws yet more heat from the body. When the body becomes dehydrated enough to prevent the production of sweat, this method of heat reduction is stopped. When the body is no longer capable of sweating, core temperature begins to rise quickly. 

Victims may become confused, hostile, often experience headaches, and may seem drunk. Due to dehydration, blood pressure may drop significantly, leading to possible fainting or dizziness], especially if the victim stands suddenly. As blood pressure drops, heart rate and respiration rate will increase (tachycardia and tachypnea) as the heart attempts to supply enough oxygen to the body. The skin will become red as blood vessels dilate in an attempt to increase heat dissipation. As heat stroke progresses, the decrease in blood pressure will cause blood vessels to contract, resulting in a pale or bluish skin colour. Complaints of feeling hot may be followed by chills and trembling, as is the case in fever. Some victims, especially young children, may suffer convulsions. Acute dehydration such as that accompanying heat stroke can produce nausea and vomiting; temporary blindness may also be observed. Eventually, as body organs begin to fail, unconsciousness and coma will result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to Wikibooks! Not that you probably need a welcome because you certainly don't seem like a stranger to wiki.

The current TOC represents a basic outline that I worked on to help give structure to the algrebra book. Prior to that outline, the book had no structure, and was a mishmash of all sorts of unrelated subjects. I went through the book and removed all the nonsense, and tried to reorder the good material, but as you can plainly see the &quot;good material&quot; is a pathetically small quantity of text. 

Since the book is so absolutely pathetic, and since no other editors are particularly active in contributing to it, you essentially have free-reign over it, if you want. Wikibooks is a little different from Wikipedia in that authors tend to focus on one book at a time (instead of editing several articles) and books here tend to only have one author at a time. Some of the more popular books, of course, draw larger crowds of people.  

My point being that if you intend to serve as an author to this book, you will be the only one, and &quot;consensus decision making&quot; involves you doing whatever you want to do. You can delete the current text, or you can keep it and expand on it, you can change the TOC and the templates and whatever else you want to change. The entire world could benefit from a good, free algebra text, and if you have a vision, run with it.

I would be willing to lend my help and support to you in any aspect that you need. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:58, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Restatement of Paragraph 2 ==

Durkheim saw a trend toward the [[Habermas Commentary/Topics/Linguistification | linguistification of the sacred]].  That trend is visible in several ways:  in rationalization of worldviews, in universalization of law and morality, and in progressive individuation.  

Durkheim's view predicts that the concept of ego-identity

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Predictive Self-Identification as a Presupposition of Generic and Numerical Identification (p. 102.1.bot) ==

In this sentence, Habermas refers to three forms of identification:  generic identification, numerical identification, and predictive self-identification, all of which have been discussed on [[Habermas Commentary/Books/TCA2/p101|p. 101]].  He argues this point over the next three pages, concluding in virtually identical language at 105.2.bot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Henrich's Distinction Between Identity and Numerical Identification ({{H:title|Page 100, next to bottom paragraph, 3d line from bottom|p. 100.bot-1.bot-3}}) ==

Henrich distinguishes philosophical from social-psychological concepts of identity.  In the philosophical concept, you have identity as soon as you have a single thing.  For example, there is a person.  You can identify it as a person.  Therefore, it has a philosophical identity -- what Habermas is soon ([[Habermas Commentary/Books/TCA2/p102|p. 102.1.5]]) calling &quot;numerical&quot; identification.  You don’t need additional knowledge about its unique characteristics to say that it has philosophical identity.  You wouldn’t say it has &quot;a&quot; philosophical identity; it just has philosophical identity.  It is identifiable as a person.  It doesn’t acquire or lose this sort of identity if, say, it goes through some changes while still remaining a person.

In the social psychological sense, by contrast, people can acquire unique identities, but they don’t necessarily do so.  Acquiring an identity makes you independent.  With an individual identity, you can avoid the influence of others; you can be autonomous -- although the concept of autonomy may entail no more than being &quot;a speaking and acting subject in general&quot; (p. 102.1.6).  This is your social psychological identity.  If multiple individuals have the same kind of social psychological independence, then you can say they have ''philosophical'' identity as autonomous individuals, and again (on the philosophical level) you can say they are indistinguishable for philosophical purposes.

Notwithstanding Henrich's distinction between philosophy and social psychology, this really sounds like nothing more than a distinction between levels of analysis.  If you're philosophizing on a grand scale, you are apt to talk about autonomous individuals, but not about any particular autonomous individual (except perhaps using a hypothetical one to illustrate a point).  If, on the other hand, you are philosophizing on the micro level, you notice distinctions between individuals.  It seems simplistic to say that you &quot;acquire&quot; identity ([[Habermas Commentary/Books/TCA2/p101|{{H:title | p. 101, first partial paragraph, middle of the paragraph |p. 101.1.mid}}]]).  More likely, people acquire various levels of independence, and you would notice the distinctions among their levels of independence if you were looking at it on the micro level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Verses 1-21 ==
Jesus begins the Chapter with a parable.  His imagery begins with a description of a sheep pen.  Jesus then describes the duties of the shepherd, and the gate over the sheep.  The text then breaks because those who are listening to Jesus' parable do not understand.  Jesus then clarifies further that he represents the gate and that &quot;whoever enters through [him] will be saved&quot; (Verse 9).  Jesus testifies that he is also the kalos   shepherd. Kalos means beautiful or faithful. Good is a bad translation.  Upon hearing this, those listening to Jesus begin to argue amongst themselves.  Though they have yet to take in the bulk of Jesus' teaching (thus far hinting that he is close if not one with God), his listeners ponder whether or not he is demon possessed.  Nevertheless, Jesus' testimony is heavily laced with language that suggests foreknowledge of his crucifixion.

Through his use of words and phrases, Jesus makes the assertion that he is God's agent, His faithful shepherd as opposed to all the unfaithful leaders of Israel at that time. God is the shepherd of Israel and only God is good. So Jesus in making himself the gatekeeper to God is clearly showing that his position is inferior to God. He is the one who opens the door, but God is the owner of the sheep who calls them forth and they hear his voice and follow him.



'''The good shepherd'''  John uses the word &quot;kalos&quot; and the normal Greek word for good Agathos is not included in verses 11 and 14.  It might be preferable to translate &quot;good&quot; as the &quot;model&quot; or &quot;noble&quot; shepherd.  The &quot;noble&quot; shepherd could be defined as the &quot;genuine&quot; shepherd.  Here in vv 11-13, the noble relates to the readiness of the shepherd to lay down his life for the sheep.  Verses 15-17 reveal that the shepherd, laying down his life for sheep, is doing this in obedience to the command of the Father.

A faithful shepherd will fight to his last breath to save the sheep. One must not get the idea that Jesus just laid down and died. No shepherd prostrates before the wolf but fights the wolf with every ounce of strength. Jesus fought sin and temptation to his last breath. By winning the victory over sin he saves his flock from the Land and Power of death.
 
The shepherd incident (10:1-10:18) begins negatively.  The first question to answer is &quot;who is the thief and bandit?&quot;  Every prophet who came before Jesus teaching that salvation came through obeying the old Torah.   Jesus suggests, however, that the thief who comes into the pen is concerned only with stealing and killing; in essence, the thief is only concerned with things pertaining to himself. Jesus, the faithful Shepherd, is interested only in his sheep and their well being. 

Chapter 10 also seems to have a foretelling of Jesus as being the way to eternal life. In the first verse it states: &quot;Truly, Truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way he is a thief and a robber.&quot; Then again in verse 9 Jesus says: &quot;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.&quot; (NAS) He was simply saying that Jesus is the only way to the Father and to eternal life. Pasture might even refer to life, since sheep graze on it for nutrients. Then in verse 10 &quot;The thief comes only to steal, and kill, and destroy; I came that they might have life, and might have it abundantly.&quot; (NAS) The word “abundantly” was referring to eternal life not to the earth life. With that said, these are all predictions of the more direct words in John 14:6. &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through me.&quot; (NAS) With this verse and these meanings behind the verses in 10, we can now better understand why the Jews, who did not believe Jesus to be the messiah, are dueling. (See &quot;The Controversy&quot; below) There is also other cross references to take into consideration with this theory that this was a foretelling of Jesus being the only way to eternal life. They are: John 10:15, 17, 18, Romans 5:2, Ephesians 2:8 etc. 

Jesus says that the only true way to heaven is through him, and anyone who says otherwise is false. He also foreshadows his own death by saying that a faithful Shepherd would lay down his life for his flock, and that he is, in fact, a faithful Shepherd.  Only some of the people listening to him, however, believed his words. Everyone else still claimed that he was possessed by the devil and mad. 

'''God's Saving Grace'''  In another reference to the good shepherd/thief theme, in verse 8 there is talk of another type of thief that is trying to steal the flock from Jesus, and they come in the form of false prophets. Jesus was the last prophet and he warns us that many false ones would come after him. These false prophets, through their &quot;smooth&quot; talking would try and convince the flock to follow them instead of the ways of God.  However because God is sheltering and protecting his flock they are not deterred by false prophets and what they say.  Instead they are kept safe by God and remain His followers.


'''The Controversy''' The issue of Jesus' relationship to God is once again controversial in Chapter 10.  Jesus claims in Verses 25-30 &quot;The works that I do in my Father's name testify to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep...What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it out of the Father's hand.  The Father and I are one.&quot;    There are definitely some different interpretations of this situation.  Some scholars and religions use this section as evidence of the Trinity, and the claim that God and Jesus are one in the same.  However, there is so much language stating Jesus' obedience to his Father in other chapters of John (for example John 9:28: &quot;...I do nothing on my own, but I speak these things as the Father instructed me.&quot;).  Considering the emphasis on Jesus' obedience throughout the Gospel of John, it is possible that the narrator of John believed the Jews were misinterpreting Jesus' claims: While the Jews possibly believed Jesus was saying he is the ''same'' as God, Jesus was actually saying he is equal to God in terms of having the same mission and heart. He prays that God will make the disciples one with himself the same way that he and Jesus are one.

Also, it is interesting here to take a look at the response that Jesus gives to the Jews who accuse him of blasphemy.  John 10:32-34, &quot;Jesus replied, 'I have shown you many good works from the Father.  For which of these are you going to stone me?'  The Jews answered, 'It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you, but for blasphemy, because you, though only a human being, are making yourself God.&quot; Jesus answered, 'Is it not written in your law, 'I said, you are gods' (elohim)?&quot;    Smith postulates that what is actually meant here is something along the lines of, &quot;Your law says that the ones to whom God gave His word are gods&quot;

Angels are Elohim and God's agents like Moses and the Judges are elohim. What Jeus is saying is &gt; If Moes and the judges can bear the title of elohim God, then you cannot stone men who might say &quot;I am elohim.&quot;., but I have never claimed to be elohim. I have told you repeatedly God is greater than me. I am his agen I am the son of Elohim. You yourselves claim God for your father. In fact David wrote that everyone in Israel was supposed to be God's agents to the gentiles. Ye are God's all of you.&quot;

'''The Lack of Faith in John Chapter 10''' The Jewish people were tired of being kept in the dark about the nature of Christ's person, so in Verse 24, they ask him directly: &quot;The Jews gathered around him, saying, 'How long will you keep us in suspense?  If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.'&quot;  This kind of demand calls into question the strength of the Jews' faith, which at this point seems weak.  They are demanding to know whether or not Christ was the Messiah, which, if He answered, would negate the necessity of faith. He only revealed himself as the Messiah to the Samaritan woman at the well. He even mentions the miracles that He performed in God's name, but it is as though the people around Him have forgotten that these things have occurred.  They begin to pick up stones with which to kill Christ, but He rebukes them: &quot;I have shown you many great miracles from the Father.  For which of these do you stone me?&quot;  It is disarming speech, designed to make the people aware of the severity of their reaction, but it does not work.  The people simply choose to make another claim (that Christ is a blasphemer), and once again they have put off acknowledging the necessity of faith in Christ. 

This chapter is another example of the so-called &quot;unforgivable sin.&quot;  Jesus has told the people that God will forgive all sin through belief in Jesus except for one.  The one that is unforgivable is ascribing  the work of God's spirit to the devil..  The Jews seemingly commit this sin by saying that Jesus is demon-possessed and raving-mad.  Another time when Jewish leaders made this claim about Jesus, Jesus told his disciples that they were sinning against the Holy Spirit and this sin was the &quot;unforgivable sin.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tugendhat and Qualitative Identification ({{H:title|Middle of the second full or partial paragraph on p. 101|p. 101.2.mid}}) ==

Apparently Tugendhat divides Henrich's concept of social psychological identity ([[Habermas Commentary/Books/TCA2/p100|p. 100]]) into two parts.  First, there is the generic identification of a person who is capable of autonomous action, as Henrich noted; but second, there is the qualitative identification of an individual who has a life history.  As in the commentary on p. 100, this too seems to be a simple matter of stating the unit of analysis.

Tugendhat evidently goes beyond that, however, to introduce &quot;the question of who one wants to be&quot; (101.2.mid).  Habermas presents it as a matter of when the person &quot;gets clear about who he wants to be.&quot;  Suddenly the perspective is not that of the third-party observer who is choosing among numerical, generic, or qualitative identification of individuals as a category or as discrete items.  

Instead, we are now inside the person's head, and there seems to be a whole new agenda.  When the person &quot;gets clear,&quot; s/he distinguishes him/herself from others -- not as a matter of observation, but rather &quot;through his life project.&quot;  This life project is defined as &quot;the organization of a life history that he has responsibly taken on.&quot;  So getting clear about yourself apparently entails taking on the project of organizing a life history.  

History being a backward-looking thing, maybe the idea is that you are constructing something or other that you will present (to someone) as who you are.  But it's not clear why this has to be a responsible effort.  It seems like an irresponsible approach would also produce a life history, and maybe one that would more accurately portray who one really is.  Indeed, it is not clear whether responsibility has anything to do with the question of whether one finds oneself thrown into a life in which constructing a life history is an inextricable part of being human.

Qualitative identification, which is thus defined as a matter of self-identification, also appears to go by the name of &quot;predicative self-identification&quot; (p. 101.2.bot-7).  It is not clear what the word &quot;predicative&quot; adds.

== Separation of Ego-Identity from Identification of the Individual ({{H:title|bottom paragraph on p. 101|p. 101.bot}}) ==

Henrich has a generic concept of ego-identity:  the person is able to act autonomously.  Tugendhat has a qualitative concept of ego-identity:  it is &quot;the ability of a person to identify himself, on the basis of a reflective self-understanding, as the person who he wants to be&quot; ([[Habermas Commentary/Books/TCA2/p102|p. 102.1.4]]).  It sounds like Tugendhat would say that you don't have ego-identity if you can't honestly say that you are the person you would like to be.  Of course, some pretty awful people are also pretty sure that they have the right idea about life, so it's not entirely clear that ego-identity would be something that an honest, humble, self-deprecating individual would ever have, or want to have -- unless, of course, we define &quot;reflective self-understanding&quot; so as to bar the riffraff.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How Long Did It Take You to Paint That?

A couple stops to admire a painting.  Watch their expressions. They smile, they nod, they speak in low tones to each other.  Sometimes they point to certain parts of the painting, their hands moving as though they are creating the composition themselves, as if they have a brush in their hands, making the strokes that create the elements in the painting.

	They glance at you.  You smile; they smile.  One of them nods his head toward the painting and says &quot;How long did it take you to paint that?&quot;

	You've heard it countless times.  It's usually the first question people ask.  Even other artists will ask that question, but for professional reasons.  It's also a very hard question to answer frankly.  After all, you wonder, shall I make an estimate of the actual number of hours I manipulated the paint onto that canvas--or shall I detail the real time it took to get that painting done?  The difference may be between eight hours or thousands of hours.  It's your call.

	You can impress the dickens out of the couple by saying the work took eight hours (or three, or twenty--whatever).  They will respond with admiration.  They will ask the price and mentally figure out how many dollars an hour you are getting (although they won't consider the cost of the materials) and decide if they want to pay what you are asking for those hours of creation.  They consider what it is worth to them. But what if you tell them what really went into making that work of art?  	

	Contemplate this.  When you work for a company you are paid a salary or by the hour.  If you have a degree or certification for the job you do, or several years' experience in that type of work, your wages are set accordingly.  Included in the paid hours of work are the time you spend figuring out how to best do the job, gaining experience with the equipment you use, making purchase orders for needed supplies, traveling to other work sites, learning from trade magazine articles, attending meetings or conventions regarding your work, such trivial things as cleaning and rearranging your desk, etc.  Ideally you are paid for all work-related activities.  In addition, you'll have health and perhaps life insurance, and even paid time off.  You may receive other perks such as bonuses and business discounts.

	Now regard the real time you spend making your art.  You may have additional activities to add to the following list.

	Years of study and experience

	Ongoing education attending seminars, classes, meetings with other artists to learn from their experience

	Purchase and independent study of art books and magazines

	Through trial and error, learning which materials work best for you

	Time spent earning the dollars to buy these materials

	Time spent shopping for these products--when and where to get them, hopefully when they are on sale

	Putting on mileage to take photos if you are interested in landscapes, or taking photos of other subjects

	Maintaining a physical photo file or organizing a computer file, and perhaps taking the time and expense to learn photo editing on your computer

	Making mental notes about compositions and then creating sketches and full studies of works of art before you ever make the actual artwork

Arranging all the brushes, paints, canvas, or other materials you use; you must also maintain them to keep them in working order

Building or renting a studio or creating and maintaining a space in your home

	The time spent doing the actual work of art

	Framing

	Besides all this and more, you don't receive paid time off, insurance, or the other perks of working with a company.  Consider that if you worked for a company, you would be paid for all these activities in addition to the actual eight hours, or three, or twenty, that you put into the piece of art itself. Thus, that hourly &quot;wage&quot; you charge for your objet d'art is usually far underestimated. In fact, all the above activities except doing the artwork itself are more or less &quot;in kind.&quot;  And this is as it should be for all non-professional artists, creating art because they love to do it and because it gives them the greatest satisfaction.  They don't consider these things as if they were employees or artists competing in the world of professionals. They don't even consider them in the pursuit of the personal gratification resulting from creating something beautiful from their own efforts. These activities enhance artists' joy in creation.

	So the next time someone asks you &quot;How long did it take you to paint that?&quot; you have a choice.  You can go through the above extensive list, or, with your smile of complete contentment, you can give them the honest and succinct tally of the hours you indulged yourself with the materials of your bliss.

      <text xml:space="preserve">People will always crave media that that allow them to experience an environment that is more like the world as God made it.  In other words, the more media becomes like the &quot;real&quot; world, the more it will be accepted and embraced by human beings.  We are made in God's own image and this is why we can look at the beauty of the earth and say &quot;it is good&quot;, just like God said in the book of Genesis.

This is also why television overtook radio, color television overtook black and white and why high definition television is overtaking standard definition TV.  Interactive, immersive, multisensoral, mutlimedia will eventually be widely accepted and even demanded because it is more like God's real world - never as good as his world, but &quot;like&quot; his real world.  When it's not possible to actually stand in a rain forest, virtual experiences will offer the next best thing until you can get there.

Is interactive media something that is completely attainable though? I view it as an immersive element of our world that few will actually indugle in when the media becomes available. I am not doubting that the media will be attainable (technology and creativity are at an all-time high), I am merely asking whether or not those ordinary people in everyday life will be excited about the medium that is starting to get a huge buzz in this field. 

Then my second question - is it healthy to have such interactive media in today's lifestyles? According to www.healthgood.com One in three people in this world are obese. &quot;According to the National Institutes of Health, obesity and overweight together are the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, close behind tobacco use. An estimated 300,000 deaths per year are due to the obesity epidemic.&quot;[http://www.wvdhhr.org/bph/oehp/obesity/mortality.htm] My question then, is it going to be a problem as more and more interactive types of media are surfacing, is it going to take away fom user physical interactivity or will it add to it. 

In my personal opinion I believe that it is our job as the initiators and developers of this medium to make it add to the amount of physical activity. I believe Nintendo hit the mark when they released the Wii to the consumer. It is completely interactive and it makes the user become physically involved in the interactive pursuit. If our media, which up until now has been engaged in by sitting back and watching or by clicking a mouse here or there, can physically involve it's user in the process, I think that we can help better our future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Media that engulfs people with interactive experiences has invaded education, entertainment, business and just about every other aspect of life.  Blockbuster video games lead the way in interactive development and some theaters are engaging viewers by stimulating all of their senses - This is all a reflection of the evolution of immersive media.  

Sub woofers placed under chairs vibrate viewers in order to influence the way they react to sound.  Experiments with the sense of smell are also becoming possible as an actor/baker performs within an expanded movie-environment that can now generate the aroma of warm apple pie to the viewers; thus pulling them further into the story through their sense of smell.  These kinds of ideas are revolutionizing how people react to media as a new generation of producers begin to realize that nothing is preventing them from impacting all of the human senses.
[[Image:Eland007.jpg|right|400px]]
&lt;br&gt;
Here are a  few great examples of interactive media that were showcased at the Siggraph conference in San Diego, CA.

==A Paradigm Shift==

The stage is being set for a whole new level of interactive media. Television shows are involving audiences, and it's not uncommon to let viewers decide who wins on a show.  Telling audiences what they want is a thing of the past and precedents are being set for immersive media in the immediate future. The success of reality shows is based on the fact that audiences want to take part in the plot.  On the web, Flash is gaining more and more popularity; it enables users to merge more into the media scene and have more interactivty.
 
Society is capturing new thought patterns, realizing that they are in control and can dictate what they want to consume. As a result, people are no longer willing to sit around and wait to be spoon fed. Instead they prefer to pick and chose when, where and how they want to ''experience'' information.

How is this mindset infiltrating society? Consider the options: There are many sources of entertainment and information; people have options that were not previously available. Back in the day, if the news started at 6:00 one had to watch it at 6:00 or miss it altogether.  Now, the consumer can see what they want, when they want and have numerous alternatives as to how. Consider the choices available: Today, one can listen on the radio, watch on the internet, keep up to day via 3G cellphone media, or possibly wait until a rerun. A new way of thinking is circulating through society, and it is becoming noticeable.  Reading has already been in the backseat, and now ordinary television is starting to be pushed to the side by a new era of interactivity. 



== New Media ==
An independent research company has discovered that 57% of all American teenagers create content for the internet. Paul Saffo, director at the Institute for the Future in California, says that people no longer &quot;consume&quot; media; they participate in it. Using personal creativity and allowing people to write their own newspaper will definitely revolutionize the participation in media. According to The Economist website, the days of media moguls and huge coorporate media giants have begun to come to an end. The days of individual person-to-person media are quickly approaching. It will be a revolution of interactivity across the world one person at a time.

'''AxiomTV'''

There is a vibe going around in the media world that the Internet is soon going to take over the TV.  Meaning, instead of watching programming from the viewer's satellite or cable, the viewer will download programming from Internet sources and play it on their TV.  Making a head start into this new way of watching media is AxiomTV.   AxiomTV is a Detroit based company that is taking family-friendly movies and DVD’s and making them available for people to download and play on their TV.  The website is www.Axiom.tv and is currently in beta-testing.  Not only does AxiomTV provide movies to watch, they are also selling channels to major networks where they can provide their own programming to AxiomTV and people can watch it all day long.  For example, Will Rogers films playing all day long on a Will Rogers channel, or MTV streaming all day long off of AxiomTV.  AxiomTV is created by Christians, so they are having a feature called Mother, which watches everything that is downloaded on the viewer’s computer and protects children from seeing inappropriate content.  AxiomTV wants to be a family-safe website and Mother is making that possible.  AxiomTV is a great new technology that allows a person, sitting at their home computer, access to just about anything they want to see whenever and wherever they want to see it. &lt;br/&gt;

'''IPTV- Internet Protocol Television''''''

In case you haven’t noticed, telecommunications companies like AT&amp;T, Verizon, and others have been aggressively creating miles of fiber-optic networks that can deliver digital media into the end users home through their TV. Telcos have poured hundreds of billions of dollars and several years of R&amp;D into implementing small broadcast units (set-top boxes) that can stream media into user televisions. Telcos are making a bid to dominate how television and all media (data, voice, ect,) is delivered to you home in the future. They will do this through a service called IPTV or Internet Protocol Television. 

In 2007 AT&amp;T made a $400 million deal to purchase Microsoft's IPTV Edition software, and a US$1.7 billion deal with hardware maker Alcate. The question is, “Why are they investing all this time and money to do something the cable providers are already doing?” It is because they want to be the sole communications link for you’re your home, increase revenue through selling blocks of airtime to broadcast networks and advertisers, and basically corner the television market by being your home’s sole pipeline. IPTV is how they plan to do this.
'''
What is IPTV?
'''
Internet Protocol Television delivers TV programming over a DSL connection from phone lines to homes through TV set-top boxes and is typically bundled with Video-On Demand, VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol- see Skype), digital-telephone and Internet typically called a “Triple Play.”	 Video pulled from satellites enters the Telco’s main IP servers. It is encoded into any necessary format (WMV MPEG H.264), then streamed to its core IP network which handles data, voice, and video. The media is then broken into small containers of info and streamed to the users home, where it is efficiently reassembled and decoded for viewing. 

'''Advantages'''

IPTV is much more efficient than cable. there is none of the annoying “pause” that cable users typically get when they change a channel.  Multiple users can record multiple programs from several TVs at the same time to a single DVR without a significant price hike on the unit IPTV users will have full DVR functionality and be able to remotely program their DVR to record programs with a personal phone while they are away! .

User customized view guides will make it easier for users to find their favorite programming. Picture-in-picture viewing will be done multiple tuners. You will watch one show, and channel surf with the PIP!

All traditional cable services (such as Video-on Demand) will be featured

Viewers won’t be far from their information as well.  They will receive webmail and text messaging along with Caller ID on-screen. All this will be done at a vastly lower price for the end user compared to traditional cable.

IPTV’s killer app is will be interactive television. Similar to the scene in Fahrenheit 451, users will be able to participate in real time with hosts and contestants on the television shows, and see live programs in multiple camera angles

And since the Telco owns the entire network, total quality is assured. The Telcos believe that this technology, its reliability, and low cost will allow them to defeat the cable companies and corner the market.




'''iPhone'''

Apple Inc released the Apple iPhone in the summer of 2007. This new device merges interactive media, music and phone services together in one complete package. The iPhone is akin to a small personal laptop. It can take notes on the go and then send them as an email. It has a full calendar, and access to email from the most notable websites including Yahoo, Google and AOL. The phone also has YouTube built into the phone so users can access almost all the videos offered at YouTube.com. Its biggest selling point is the touchscreen. It is also the only phone running a software copy of Mac OSX.
&lt;br/&gt;

Although this phone is not the greatest piece of equipment, it does allow the consumer many portable freedoms and connectivity. Future phones are attempting to copy and add their own specal feature to the phone market. This type of phone is inspiring other companies to allow users to do more with their phones. It is also forcing websites to function with standard computer users and mobile phone users. Now websites like Yahoo and Google have their classic website and a mobile website mode.

With the summer 2008 release of the iPhone 2.0 software update, the iPhone is beginning to differentiate itself from most, if not all, current phones on the market. The iPhone now has to capability to download, and run various games and applications built on Apple's iPhone Software Development Kit. While allowing users to run or develop any conceivable application for the iPhone, Apple also assures their legendary penchant for control of its platform is upheld by approving all applications that are placed within Apple's Application Store; Which can be accessed on an iPhone, or iPod touch running the 2.0 software, or through the Application navigation option which was built into iTunes beginning in version 7.7. The application store also allows for Apple to provide the seamless connection experience that they build into much of their software that is not currently available, or executed as well by other companies. Importantly,  this is considered by many to be Apple's first foray into the extremely competitive market of video gaming, and is one of the few current examples of interactive media that is multi-platform, and executed without the use of conventional storage media. (i.e. DVDs, CDs, etc.)

At the 2006 Boston SIGGRAPH symposium (http://www.siggraph.org/s2006/main.php?f=boston), it was possible to experience paintings that responded to touch, movies that could be taste and nasal canons that triggered precise aromas at the instant they were required to enhance a video clip.  Participants sat in a virtual kayaks and paddled through a virtual version of the west coast of Alaska while feeling the pressure of salt water on a paddle.

Research proves that smell is, by far, the most effective physical sense for triggering vivid memories, so why couldn't  nasal cannons be used to help students use smell to recall important information during an exam?

&lt;br&gt;

And why don’t more media experiences take advantage of all human senses, rather than just sign and sound?

In the world of Theme parks, 4D entertainment is becoming more and more popular. For example Disney's California Adventure offers Soarin' Over California which is an experience where you literally feel like you're flying over California. The ride triggers wind, water, and even the scent of oranges as you fly over orange fields. 

In Las Vegas, at the Luxor, there is a virtual reality ride which is 4D. Not only do things come at you from the screen, but also from the floor, chair, and even from above.

The world is so close to reality that I believe we should be afraid of what is next. In my mind, I believe the next or future of multisensory media is to be able to affect our emotions by somehow connecting us with the characters in the story. We would feel what the character is feeling, If he is angry, our emotions will imitate that, if he was scared, we would be able to feel the depth of the fear. This would make a lot of movies better than just viewing because we will be placed in the character shoes, making us one with character and can understand why he did things in the movie. The Dark Knight, the recent Batman movie, created a dark and cynical atmosphere once Joker enters the scene. The sound is gripping, making you pay attention to the seriousness of what is being shown on screen. Joker's voice had the psycho-deranged touch to it, that many knew he wasn't playing around or just want money-he wanted to destroy Gotham. You can tell by his voice, He didn't have any sympathy, no care in the world, he didn't care about dying, He wanted to see Gotham burn, destroyed. All this was made just from sound. Sound affects the body in an amazing way and if movie producers, game designers, commercials even, find a way to control their onlookers, then effectiveness is boosted from a normal commercial to something memorable. Sound move us in such a way, where we can find sleep music that puts our body at ease, or music that can have our adrenaline pumping at the thump of rock. This is just a hair of what I believe is to come.  

In Orlando Florida, at the amusement park Sea World; the ride Wild Arctic, gives adventure seekers a ride like none other. People are placed in what look like a space ship that has a big screen in front of everybody on the inside. The screen comes on and it appears that you are looking out the main window of an aircraft. The air craft takes off and all the seats turn right and left, and lift forward and back to give the feeling of flying. This feeling is increased do to the intense visual experience a person gets fro the screen in front of them. As the aircraft moves around the screen begins to show pictures of Polar Bears and at one point it gets to close and the bears attack the aircraft. The pilot of the aircraft looses control of the ship and it crashes. The door on the other side of the ride (directly across for the one you entered) opens and allows you to walk off the aircraft. As you walk off it becomes obvious that this is not the end of the ride. You are in a real life setting of the Arctic. As you follow the crowed, You are viewing real, living Polar Bears and penguins in artificial settings that mimic their natural habitat. By adding this to the end of the ride Sea World really took Interactive, Multisensory Media to the next level. You were not just seeing the world through a screen and feeling the effects of the aircraft through the seats, but you were feeling the cold of the Arctic as you got off the aircraft and walked into the artificial setting. This gives you the most real feeling of being there without actually being there. I think more things like this are expected. Rides and media that will actually be able to fuel a persons mind into believing they are really there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first attempt to create an interactive multimedia product can be overwhelming without the benefit of previous experience.  Paralysis sets in early when developers start to wonder if they're collecting the right kind of media to be accessed by interactive users.  

Interactive content development is confusing because it is so similar to and yet not the same as conventional, traditional, linear media (i.e. a video documentary).  All of the skills required for conventional media are required, but additional skills and different thought processes are also required.

Interactive multimedia story telling can typically require a link from still photos, to a web site, to a six second video clip and then to a PDF document.  Just visualizing this mix of disparate media types can be disorienting.

== AMD CHIPS ==

This website showed how AMD demonstrated and taught about their new chips that are coming out. They also compared their chips to Intel's. Showing exactly why AMD is better. Its a &quot;virtual tradeshow.&quot; I found it really interesting that they used a virtual experience in order for the crowd to interact with software. It was pretty cool. Check out the link.

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to some books now on the best seller list (The World is Flat, A New Kind of Thinking, The Tipping Point, Freakanomics), the rules for career success have changed.  Jobs that require systematic, repetitious, detailed instruction sets or, that is to say, skills largely dictated by the analytical side of the human brain, have been, or soon will be, outsourced to another country or a computer.

If these authors are forecasting trends to be reckoned with in the immediate future, then it seems that well established and accepted rules for success have changed.  The information age, as we knew it, rewarded systematic thinkers who could program computer code, analyze business trends or understand complex processes.  According to these authors, the future belongs to those who have developed social skills and a creative approach to problem solving.

[[Image:IMG_00152.jpg|right|400px]]
&lt;br&gt;

People entering the job market or new to the job market need to be aware of the current trends. It is very important to develop social skills and make connections with people that you meet in the market. Connections are key to your future success. If you lose your job in the future, the connections you made in the past could bring about your new job. You never know who you're sitting next to in a meeting, in a seminar, or even at a bookstore.  So, develop the social skills early and be friendly with people; it could set up your future.

Another key to success in the job market is being flexible and wanting to learn new technologies.  Because the market is changing so rapidly, you may be asked to make something with a program you have never used before. So, be open to teaching yourself new programs with online tutorials or books. If an employer asks you to make a flash website and you never have before, say yes, and try as hard as you can to teach yourself the program and create an excellent website. Even if you are not in the job market right now, it is wise to start learning different technologies other than just the one that you specialize in.  Be open, be flexible, and most of all be dependable.

'''Change in Motion'''

Film is on its way out the door and video will soon take its place. Film style shooting will never change, the rules will still apply to the film medium, the technology of shooting will change. With advances in video like the RED camera, studios should be changing gears and adopting high-end video equipment over film. The RED camera is not as good as film, but the differences are so small that the average person will not know the difference. The beauty of video equipment in the film business is the cost. The RED camera is a fraction of the cost of a film camera, plus the RED does not require any type of film stock. With hard drive and VTR decks, studios can shoot straight from their camera to a deck or hard drive and then edit from the deck or drive, no more waiting to process the film. This will make productions take less time to finalize and less money will be spent to pay crews. The best of the film and video worlds will collide in the future. When that date is, no one really knows but it is coming. George Lucas ordered some RED cameras for his next production, and with more and more high-end video cameras and equipment coming online, the faster and less expensive movies will cost.

==[[Transportation Economics]]==

This is a graduate level Transportation Economics class text. I am the primary author. [[User:DavidLevinson|dml]] ([[User talk:DavidLevinson|talk]]) 04:06, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
:A quick look at the book (it's impossible for me to understand a word of it given my age), I believe that the book could benefit from a navigational device such as {{tl|navigate}}. This will make the book easier to navigate when it is read online. Also, I think the reference format is a little inconsistent. Otherwise, it looks fine. Good luck with the book!

::Not so sure about this. The book looks like it contains some [[WB:OR|original research]]. see [[Transportation Economics/Revenue/The Choice Between Taxes and Tolls]]. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 18:48, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
::: REFLIST was added, it is citing research, not original research, thanks for noting it. [[User:DavidLevinson|dml]] ([[User talk:DavidLevinson|talk]]) 18:16, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
:::: I guess that's OK then, as the research is already published in reputable journals. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:13, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
::{{Support}} Generally the book looks to have a high quality and level of completeness, and to be suitable for featured status. Personally, I like to see a [[Help:Print_versions|print version]] of the whole book too, and perhaps the text in some of the economic charts could be bigger, but these need not be a bar to featured status I think. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:13, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
:::{{support}}. I believe the book is good to go, except I think the book would still benefit from a navigational device. I also support making a print version as well as a PDF version.

::I am new and just finding my way here.  Is this process all that exists so far, for reviewing a book?  I am looking for something like the copyediting-upon-request and peer-review-upon-request services offered in Wikipedia.  Are there equivalents here?  About this transportation book, I notice some copyediting needed, e.g. in the [[Transportation Economics/Revenue/The Choice Between Taxes and Tolls]] section mentioned above. There is mention both of &quot;this section&quot; and &quot;this paper&quot;, perhaps reflecting incomplete adaption of the chapter from the author's article that is the source. --[[User:Doncram|Doncram]] ([[User talk:Doncram|talk]]) 15:14, 17 August 2010 (UTC)
:::{{comment}} As far as I know, those kind of procedures aren't used here, though pages can be labelled as needing attention from an expert with {{tlx|attention}} or requests for help can be made on the [[WB:Reading room/Projects]] page. Probably the best option is to fix any obvious issues yourself or leave a message on the book's talk pages. It is quite common for books to be featured while they are still under construction, anyway. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:08, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

{{comment}} One difficulty I find is the that the navigation breaks down.  Starting with the transition from [[Transportation Economics/Agents]] to the next page on Planning, several of the pages are shared with the [[Fundamentals of Transportation]], which is also of high quality worked on by some of the same authors, etc.  But it would be nice to find a way to repair this. Two possibilities that exist that I can think of
#Fork (that is directly copying) the pages from [[Fundamentals of Transportation]] into [[Transportation Economics]] and continue adding navigation templates of the style already added. 
#Try the generally discouraged practice of placing the core material (excluding category templates, etc.) that is the same for both books into a template page that then get's transcluded into both books, with appropriate navigation &amp; category templates included after the transclusion.  One problem with this idea is that if someone decides to take that page of the book in a new direction they may be inadvertently changing the other book in some less than appropriate way.
Maybe someone else has a more clever idea then these two. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 17:50, 12 October 2010 (UTC)

In the past 4 years, my students of Structural Biochemistry at UC San Diego have been writing the wikibook. Without being perfect, it has reached a point in coverage, depth and quality that I feel confident that a student taking the course can do as well in the class consulting the wikibook, instead of purchasing an expensive book. We'll continue working on it. I believe that people interested in the field might find it useful too. Thank you, Hector Viadiu.

:{{support}}  What a monumental book!  It could use some navigation, but it sure appears to cover the subject in depth. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 03:09, 7 December 2011 (UTC)
:{{support}} I agree.

:{{comment}} Not quite ready yet. Needs all pages checked and flagged and the typos and formating errors removed. I looked at just two pages at random. The first had several spelling mistakes and the second had a messed up piece of Wiki format that meant the section heading was displaying incorrectly. I'm fine with the content, but it needs to be tidier to be truly featured quality. [[Structural_Biochemistry/Organic_Chemistry]] is a good example page - some of the images are too big, there are bare URLs with no explanation pointing to Wikipedia, a reference section right in the middle of the page, etc. Someone basically needs to copyedit it. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:12, 7 December 2011 (UTC)

== [[Wikijunior:Countries A-Z]] ==
{{closed|Not successful}}
I have been working on this book for quite some time, and although it is not finished, I have decided to nominate it for featured status. The book features a page for each country in the world, with a large photograph of the country surrounded by some other basic information. A good page to look at as an example is [[Wikijunior:Countries A-Z/Belgium|Belgium]]. The fact that it is incomplete is not a bad thing. Because I have designed the book specifically so that expanding it is simple, just a matter of filling in parameters for each country and then selecting an image. The simplicity is achieved through preloading and complex templates. To see what I mean try creating a page. Go to the latest page, [[Wikijunior:Countries A-Z/Honduras]] at the time of writing, and click on the red link in the corner that says the name of the next page (Hungary is next after Honduras). If it isn't red the page has already been created. The following will be preloaded on to the page:
&lt;center&gt;{{hidden|header=Click to show/hide|headerstyle= background: #ccccff; width:75%; |content=&lt;pre style=&quot;border:1px solid blue&quot;&gt;&lt;!--Fill out the parameters and then delete the notes when you are done. Press save and then click [Add an image]--&gt;
{{Template:Wikijunior:Countries A-Z/Page layout
 |name=
 |native-lang=&lt;!-- Two letter ISO 369-1 code, for example &quot;es&quot; for Spanish and &quot;de&quot; for German. If you don't know look it up --&gt;
 |language=&lt;!-- Name of the language --&gt;
 |native-name=&lt;!-- Name of country in the native language--&gt;
 |lang-status=Official&lt;!--change as necessary--&gt;
 |map=&lt;!--Should be in the format &quot;&lt;name&gt; on the globe (&lt;continent&gt; centered).svg&quot;--&gt;
 |continent=
 |capital=
 |previous=&lt;!--Previous page in alphabetical order, see [[wikipedia:List of sovereign states]] for an alphabetized list--&gt;
 |next=&lt;!--See above--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;
After the page has been created you will see links that say:&lt;center&gt;
{{hidden|header=Click to show/hide|headerstyle= background: #ccccff; width:75%;|contentstyle=text-align:center; |content=
&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[[{{fullurl:WB:Sandbox|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Wikijunior:Countries_A-Z/Preload/Image}}  Add an image]]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;([[{{fullurl:WB:Sandbox|action=edit&amp;section=new&amp;preload=Template:Wikijunior:Countries_A-Z/Preload/Missing_image}} Can't find a good image? Tag this page as missing an image]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;
Clicking on the &quot;Add an image&quot; link will preload the [[Template:Wikijunior:Countries A-Z/Image]] template on to the page, and all that has to be done is to copy-and-paste the name of the image into the indicated spot.&lt;br /&gt;
I have also devised a reader rating/review system for the images. Try this out by clicking the &quot;Rate this image&quot; link near the bottom of the page on the left side.&lt;br /&gt;
The use of a &quot;Page layout&quot; template allows easy reformatting of all pages at once, which will save trouble in the long run as there will eventually be over a hundred pages.&lt;br /&gt;
Please ask if you have any questions. [[User:Liam987|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;'''Liam987'''&lt;/span&gt;]] 18:32, 23 June 2012 (UTC)

== [[False Friends of the Slavist]] ==

This linguistic book looks at false friends (words which are similar in two languages but with a different meaning) of Slavic languages.  It dates from 2006 and was started earlier elsewhere before arriving on Wikibooks.  It may not be the most visually attractive book but it is pretty much complete - the only red links relate to false friends between languages which have very few speakers (Kashubian being a minor language of Poland, for example).  The book is extremely detailed and uses quite sophisticated templates.  It has also received contributions from a range of editors and anonymous editors.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:10, 14 January 2013 (UTC)

I recommend Skateboard Alphabet Coloring Pages as a Wikijunior featured book.

Preschool, kindergarten and grade school children will have fun learning letters and numbers in coloring pictures of a &quot;skateboarding boy&quot; forming the letters and numbers. Alphabet charts and numbers charts worksheets are also available for kids, parents and teachers to print out.

Using my own interpretation of [[WB:WIW]], I set out to create a simple &quot;textbook&quot; guide that local campaigns could use to (quoting the introduction) &quot;create pragmatic, clear, and useful information to establish a consistent tone, style, and format between all of the messages&quot; they produce. I needed it to be short and easy to read so that short-term volunteers (like those in short municipal races, for example) would not have to invest a lot of their time reading all of this stuff on their own. If people wanted to read more, I wanted to make sure it was available ''vis-à-vis'' references and further information. At the same time, I wanted to make sure I avoided [[WB:SOAP]], so that anyone could use it, regardless of affiliation.

Overall, I think I've done that, hence the reason I'm nominating this for FB status. Although I'm sure I could add to or fiddle with a few sections here and there, I believe it meets the guidelines listed in [[Wikibooks:Good books]]. Your thoughts and constructive criticism is greatly appreciated.

== [[RAC Attack - Oracle Cluster Database at Home]] ==

This is a hands-on lab curriculum for learning about Oracle RAC cluster databases. I am the primary author. Just finished the print/pdf versions this week; finally feel that it's ready to suggest for featuring.

The book differs from most other wikibooks in that it heavily draws on &quot;fair use&quot; images. We discussed this a few years ago when I was first considering if wikibooks would be a good platform for the book. Unfortunately, it's not really possible to do a tutorial on this subject without drawing on fair use images. Not sure how this would impact the decision about whether it should be featured.

==[[Peeragogy Handbook V1.0]]==
This book presents a range of techniques that self-motivated learners can use to connect with each other and develop stronger communities and collaborations. The book is addressed to everyone who is interested in how learning works, whether you’re an educator, a hobbyist, an artist, a home-school student, an employee, a parent, an activist, an archivist, a mathematician, or a tennis player. The book was written by a bunch of people who think learning is cool.

Over the course of working on the book, we practiced peeragogy — another word for “peer learning” — and we learned a lot.

Our experience within this project has been that flattened hierarchies do not necessarily mean decisions go by consensus — people often take the ball and run with it. The handbook includes co-edited pages as well as single-author works: often the lines and voices are blurred. One constant throughout the book is our interest in making something useful. To this end, the book is available under non-restrictive legal terms, which allow you to reuse portions of it however you see fit it. Among other things, we include instructions on how to join us in further developing this resource.

Sincerely,
[http://peeragogy.org The Peeragogy Team]

== [[Coaching Youth Middle Distance Runners]] ==

For this work, I set out to create a review of available and current literature on the subject, hence the large number of references (~200). If people wanted to read more, I wanted to make sure it was available ''vis-à-vis'' references and further information. Although presented in a somewhat different [[Coaching_Youth_Middle_Distance_Runners/Introduction#Style|style]] than is typical on this site, it should be familiar to many in the field, and is consistently applied throughout each chapter.

I'm sure that there are some tweaks can be made here and there, and there's always the possibility of major expansion, but I believe this fits within the context of [[WB:WIW]] and it meets the guidelines listed in [[Wikibooks:Good books]], hence the reason I'm nominating this for FB status.

:I can't review in detail right now; however, the first impression is positive. One issue is the 25% chapter on [[Java Programming/Inheritance|Inheritance]]. As of now, it does not explain what inheritance is, or how does it show up in Java - for instance, there is no mention of superclass, a concept which is used in the following chapters. The best approach, I guess, depends on how much you want to rely in other books (such as [[Object Oriented Programming]], which is mentioned in the foreword) for a deeper coverage of the basic concepts, and also on the intended order of the topics (the current arrangement of the chapters hints at emphasising interfaces over implementation inheritance, which is a perfectly defensible choice). --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 10:24, 26 November 2013 (UTC)

I am unable to comment on the technical content of the work, since i am learning Java by reading it :-) I do find many places where the expressions used, while they are correct English construction, are not what a native speaker would use and will, for many, hamper clarity and may impede understanding. One instance (where i happen to be reading right now) is the last sentence in the first paragraph of the &quot;Methods&quot; section after Example 3.60: &quot;However, as Java is not hundred percent object-oriented and differentiates between [[Primitive Types|primitive] and &quot;complex&quot; types, the result of using final will have different effects.&quot; After puzzling over this for a few minutes, i think i have figured out that the author meant: &quot;However, since Java is not one hundred percent object-oriented and distinguishes between primitive types and complex types, using &quot;final&quot; will have different effects in Java than in those languages.&quot;
:Indeed, [[Java Programming/Methods|this section]] is absolutely messy. Additionally, it is badly formed ([[Primitive Types|primitive]). I have removed this section as it is explained [[Java Programming/Keywords/final|further]]. What the sentence wanted to say is: ''&quot;Java is not fully object-oriented. As a consequence, there are both primitive types and classes. The final keyword can be applied to both but the effect is not exactly the same.&quot;''

Not perhaps _very_ different, but i believe that
Again, the paragraph after Example 3.69 (in the section oddly named &quot;API/java.lang.String&quot; insead of just &quot;Strings&quot;). reads: &quot;As StringBuilder isn't thread safe (see the chapter on Concurrency) you can't use it in more than one thread. Use StringBuffer instead, which does the same and is thread safe. However, as StringBuffer is slower, only use StringBuffer in a multi-thread environment. Moreover, only StringBuffer exists before Java 5.&quot; the use of the present tense will cause many readers to &quot;stumble&quot; and have to re-read the last sentence to get the meaning.
:I have rewritten the text. I hope it's easier to understand.

A little further down in the same section (just after Example 3.76) the author says: &quot;The string returned by substring() would be &quot;port&quot;. Please note that the endIndex is not inclusive. This means that the last character will be of the index endIndex-1. Therefore, in this example, every character from index 3 to index 6, inclusive, was copied into the substring.&quot;. As before, there is nothing technically wrong with this, it is just a somewhat cumbersome way to put it. &quot;Recalling from before that the string index values start with 0, we note that index 3 denotes the (second) 'p' and so forth up to 6, denoting the 't'; the endIndex 7 denotes the 'i', the first character after the extracted partial string.&quot;
:I have added visual explanation. Is it easier to understand now?

There are a number of occurrences of this sort of difficult-to-assimilate expression throughout the text. I would be happy to review all of them in detail, AFTER i have completed my Java language study :-).
:Thank you for your feedback. It contributes to improve the book. The more you warn, the more we can improve the book. Edit the book anyway, we will fix the mistakes.

==What does it look like?==
Dragonflies are jewels among insects. They have shimmering wings, large reflective eyes and a long body. Their wings are very delicate and lace-like, and are usually spread when they rest.

Dragonflies have three main parts to their body: the head, the thorax and the abdomen. The thorax is just behind the head and is the power center. Its strong muscles control the two pairs of wings. Their forewings and hindwings narrow at the base and look like long tear-drops. Dragonfly legs bend, but are not very flexible. They are not made for walking. They have claws on the ends for perching on leaves and twigs. Compound eyes take up most of the head. Each compound eye has up to 28,000 separate lenses (ommatidia). 

There are about 5000 species of dragonflies worldwide. About 450 species live in North America. They are large, slender insects that are up to 5 inches long. Some smaller species are less than 1 inch long. 

Darners are large and fast-flying dragonflies belonging to the family Aeschnidae. They are 2-3/4 to 4-3/4 inches long.  Colors are brilliant blue, green, or brown. They have large, clear wings with a span as wide as 5-7/8 inches. Darner naiads are 2 to 2-1/2 inches long with relatively short legs. Their flat lower lip lacks grasping bristles.
 
Green Darners belong to one of the biggest dragonfly species. They range in size from 2-3/4 inches to 3-1/8 inches. The wingspan can be up to 4-3/8 inches. They are dark greenish-brown with green thorax and blue to purplish-gray abdomen. Their pale wings have pale yellow tips. Green darners have a target-like mark on the face. Naiads can be as long as 1-7/8 inches. 

Brown Darners are 2-3/4 to 3-1/8 inches long with a wingspan from 3-1/8 to 3-7/8 inches. The body is brown with 2 large, pale yellow spots on each side of the thorax. There is a brown spot at the base of each wing and a yellowish spot on the front wing margin. The four powerful wings move independently, so Brown Darners are able to fly both forward and backward. Dragonflies in Order Odonata have wings that extend horizontally to the side. They are unable to fold their wings flat against the body. Their long legs are unsuitable for walking, but are used to capture prey in flight. 

Biddies belong to the Order Odonata in the Family Cordulegastridae. They are 2-3/8 to 3-3/8 inches long. Their color is brownish-black with yellow markings. Most members of this family have a very long abdomen. Their heads are wide with eyes that are slightly separated or meet at a single point. Antennas have 7 segments. Biddies are large and hairy with wings that are clear or smoky. Wings have a black spot (stigma) along the front margin. Naiads are stout and hairy with huge spoon-shaped lower lips.  

Dragonflies in the Gomphidae Family are about 1-7/8 to 3 inches long. They have widely separated compound eyes. Naiads’ heads are wedge-shaped with thick antennas.

Green-eyed skimmers belong to the Family Corduliidae. They are often quite hairy. Many are brownish-black in color with a red, green, or blue metallic sheen. The abdomen is metallic green and may be long and cylindrical or flat. On the head, eyes touch each other. The thorax is hairy and wings have yellow marks. 

“Downy Emerald” dragonflies (''Cordelia aenea'') are named for their hairy bodies and green abdomens. Their wingspan ranges can be up to 2 inches.  

Small Western Gomphids are about 2 inches long and have a 4-inch wingspan. They have a yellowish face and a thorax that is black with yellow markings. The abdomen is black with a yellow tip and base. On the abdomen, there is a thick yellow stripe that narrows to a thin line. The wings are clear. Naiads are dark brown in color and about 1 inch long. 

Club-tailed Dragonflies have brightly colored bodies. The thorax is yellowish with dark markings. The body has various patterns and colors combinations of black, yellow, or green. In males, the end of the abdomen is swollen, giving the appearance of a club. Females sometimes have this feature as well.

Common skimmers or “darters” usually have stout, colorful bodies and a broad, flat abdomen. Wings sometimes have dark, irregular markings with a dark base next to the body. The thorax has pale stripes on either side. Males' abdomens are pale blue and females’ are brownish yellow. Both sexes have yellow marks at the side of the abdomen.

==Where does it live?==

Dragonflies live near water. They inhabit open fields, forests, grasslands and woods. They are also seen in urban areas, as long as these are near water.

Brown Darners are found from Nova Scotia to Florida, west to Texas, and north to Illinois. They live at the edges of free-flowing streams. They are good fliers but do not fly very far from their home stream. Brown Darner naiads are found under stones and debris near woodland streams. Green Darners live near ponds and slow streams throughout North America. They are less common in the west. Walsingham’s Darners live in the Southwest and Heroic Darners are found from Mexico to Quebec.  

Gomphid dragonflies live near streams. They can be found resting on logs, stones, and leaves or darting from one resting place to another. Sometimes they fly along roads or through woods far from the streams. They return for mating and laying eggs. 

Small Western Gomphids are found near rippling streams from Nevada to Baja California and north to British Columbia. 

Biddie naiads live in forest streams and cover themselves with silt. Adults can be seen  flying slowly up and down streams, hovering about a foot above the water.

==What does it eat?==

Dragonflies are specialized hunters with large compound eyes, a freely moving head, and sharp biting mouthparts. They are very fast, catching prey with their front legs while in flight. This is called “hawking.” Hovering over plant life to catch insects is called “gleaning.”

Dragonflies eat a wide variety of insects. Their prey includes flies, midges, mosquitoes, and butterflies. They have even been known to eat hummingbirds!  

Green and Brown Darners and Small Western Gomphids eat small flying insects like caddisflies and mosquitoes. Club-tailed dragonflies eat small flies, midges and mosquitoes. They use their specially-shaped legs to scoop up prey while in flight.

Dragonfly nymphs, live in water and eat worms, fleas, and insect larvae. As they grow, they feed on bigger prey like water beetles, snails, and sometimes small fish.

==How does it defend itself?==

Catching dragonflies is not easy. They seem to fly in 2 different directions at once. Their large mobile head and large compound eyes allow them to see motion and color. They can move swiftly through the air, darting and weaving to avoid predators.  

Dragonfly wings can work independently of each other. There are joints at the base of the wings where they attach to the thorax. This arrangement lets one set of wings thrust downward while the other thrusts upward.  When all four wings move together they can fly forward at up to 35 miles per hour. 

Many species are mottled with different colors that act as camouflage in wooded areas near ponds and streams. Dragonfly naiads have gills and bury themselves in silt, mud, or gravel. Just the head and front legs are left out to grab prey.  


 


[[Image:Dragonfly_nymph.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A dragonfly nymph seen through a microscope.]]

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

Dragonflies mate in flight. Females usually deposit between 500 and 1500 eggs in or near water. Eggs hatch in 5 to 60 days depending on location and temperature. Very few eggs survive to adulthood. Dragonflies undergo simple metamorphosis with 3 stages—egg, nymph, and adult. Naiads crawl out of the water when fully grown in early spring or late summer. Males mate soon after emerging because they only live a short time as adults. Females live longer so they can lay eggs. 

Darners place one egg at a time just beneath the water surface or into stems of submerged plants. Mated pairs of Brown Darners can be seen resting on lily pads while females deposit eggs. Darner naiads turn into adults in May in the north and October in the south. 

Female Gomphids do not have ovipositors. Flying low over the water, they break the surface with the tip of the abdomen. Then they deposit eggs under the water surface while in flight.  

Biddies lay eggs on bottoms of rivers and fast-flowing streams. Nymphs may take up to 5 years to mature, but adults of many species only live a few weeks. 

Green-eyed skimmer females lay more than 2000 eggs at a time. Nymphs usually live at the bottom of stagnant water in marshes or peat bogs. 

Club-tailed dragonflies mate in vegetation. Females use their tail to hit the surface and release eggs. The larval stage lasts from 3 to 5 years. Unlike other species, Club-tailed dragonflies do not have long slender larvae cases. Instead, their larvae cases are short and squat due to their unusual shape.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

Most males are highly territorial. They choose an area that has a good egg laying site. Then they protect the area by dive bombing any nearby males to force them away.
 
Green Darners form a “mating wheel” shape while attached upside-down to each other. After mating, the male tows the female around so she can deposit eggs. This tandem flight behavior is called “contact guarding.” It is a way for males to protect the female from advances by other males. 

Some dragonfly species have a resident population that stays in the same place. Others have a migrating population. They follow the same migration paths as song birds and hawks. They stop to rest about every 3 days. Some individuals can cover 100 miles in one day. Like birds, they are able to make accurate corrections if they go off course. Nymphs of migrating species hatch and develop more quickly than those of resident species so they can begin their journey. 

Dragonflies sometime swarm together on hilltops far from water. This is called “hilltopping” and may have something to do with finding a mate.  



[[Image:Austrolestes_cingulatus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A damselfly holds its wings together above its abdomen.]]

==How does this bug affect people?==

Dragonflies are a source of great beauty and inspiration. They have a place in folklore of many countries. Some believe they sew together fingers of people who are asleep. In the Middle Ages they were called “devil’s needles.” 

In the United States, they are called  darning needles, snake doctors, and snake feeders. In Japan, they are a sign of good luck, courage, and strength. If found inside the home, they are thought to be a visiting spirit. They are found in Native American art and creation myths. 

Dragonflies do not harm people. Naiads and adults are beneficial, destroying huge numbers of mosquitoes. In Thailand, they are used as pest control to keep mosquitoes and other insects from rice paddies. 

Scientists use dragonflies as an “indicator” species to determine if a pond or other body of water is healthy. They play an important role in preserving the balance of nature. In Italy they are called “keepers of the fish.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Attacks ==

There are six standardized attacks in Canne de Combat. They are:

* Brisé
* Croisé téte
* Latéral croisé 
* Latéral extérieur 
* Enlevé
* Croisé bas

=== Brisé ===
=== Croisé téte ===
=== Latéral croisé ===
=== Latéral extérieur ===
=== Enlevé ===
=== Croisé bas ===

=== Requirements for attacks ===

There are some requirements for every attack to be valid. An attack is valid, if it is done with a valid technique (means one of the standardized attacks), and accomplishes the following requirements:

* Every strike must be armed
* The hit is clear
* The hit reached a valid target zone
* The hit is done with the upper 1/4 part of the stick
* The stick is in one line with the hand
* There was no sabring movement

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Defenses ==

After you learned how to attack, it is a necessary to learn how to defend yourself. In canne you can defend yourself two way: first, you can use a parry with the stick, the second you can move out of the way of the strike. This movement is called evadation. An evade can be a single step, a jump, a crouch, or a step over with one leg above the attacking stick.


The parries are the following:

* (1) Upward parry 
* (2) Inverse upward parry
* (3) Parry to the left while the sticks end points upwards (parry against attack to the head and torso)
* (4) Parry to the right while the sticks end points upwards (parry against attack to the head and torso)
* (5) Parry to the left while the sticks end points downwards (parry against attack to the torso)
* (6) Parry to the right while the sticks end points downwards (parry against attack to the torso)
* (7) Parry to the left while the sticks end points downwards and the end reaches the floor (parry against attacks to the leg)
* (8) Parry to the right while the sticks end points downwards and the end reaches the floor  (parry against attacks to the leg)

The parry 5 and 6 is not often used.

=== Defense rules ===

There is no simultan attack, that means, if one of the player started an attack, the other has to parry or evade, and is allowed to counterattack only after the evade. The or is a very important thing we must remember, you can parry or you can evade. You are not allowed to do the same thing in one time. This is a rule, however this rule is not taken into account very heavy. (But it depends from the judges, so please, take care of it!)

As described above, the simultan attack is not allowed. The logic of canne does not accepts the &quot;getting a small hit in order to do a bigger hit&quot;. If player A starts and attack, and if B does not defends himself, but starts an attack, then the following is the rule:

* If nobody hits, nobody gets a point
* If B hits, nobody gets a point
* If both A and B hits, then A gets a point (because he/she attacked first)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hand change ==

In Canne de Combat it is a very good idea to change the hand during the match. There are more reasons of it: first, if you work only with one of your hand, it will very easy get tired and next you are able to attack with the help of the hand changes from unpredictable directions.

=== Simple hand change ===

=== Stick shooting ===

=== Hand change from extérieur ===

=== Hand change from extérieur with rotation ===

=== Hand change from crosié ===

=== The simple hand change ===

=== The Conan the Barbarian ===

=== Hand change under the leg ===

=== Stick under the armpit ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Canne de Combat? ==

'''Canne de combat''' is a French martial art that uses a weapon, the canne,  which looks like a straight walking stick and is approximately 1m in length. 

There is another weapon, that is used during the training, and it's the baton, a kind of quarterstaff. 

The players of Canne de Combat are called ''cannists'' (whom are working with the canne), tireurs (firers) or ''batonists'' (whom are working with the staff). Sometimes we refer to Canne de Combat as Canne. 

Canne is not just a martial art, but a sport, including free sparring with the stick, and competitions. During the sparring a padded suit and a fencing mask are worn for protection. There are rounds, time limits, scoring, and so on, we will talk about it later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Equipments in Canne the Combat ==

In Canne people use the weapons for attack with, and protective equipments for protections.

=== The weapons ===

* The canne (stick) is a chestnut stick that comes in two versions. First (marked with a green line) is heavier and used for training of basic techniques. Canne used in competitions and advanced training is lighter (marked with a black line). Lighter stick are faster and safer to use (you can't seriously injure your opponent because the stick breaks first). The length of a canne is 95 cm, weigth is cca 120g for green and cca 100g for the black canne.

* The baton (staff) is a two handed stick of cca 140 cm and 400g.

Sometimes is hard to get the chestnut sticks. It is a good idea to use some other wood (like bamboo or reed). Reed is very good, has the same weight as a black line stick, but need some additional protection, because it can easily crack. Use sellotape to make it stronger. For a better grip add some tennis grip at the end of the stick.

=== The equipments ===

After you get your sticks, you need some additional equipments for training. For a beginner there is no need to buy all the stuffs described below, but only a pair of shinguards. Later, you can buy a fencing helmet, and after around one year, you should buy (or create) your suit.

* Shinguard: shinguard is used to defend our shin, that is a basic target in Canne de Combat.
* Fencing helmet: the helmet is used for head protection. It is a normal fencing helmet (350N) with additional padding, that defends the stick, and decreases the impact of a hit.
* Suit: the suit has three parts: the jacket, the gloves, and the trousers. It is made from a strong material that contains filling for better protection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Warmup exercises ==

This is very important to warm up, because you can very easily hurt yourself without it. I will describe some exercises, you should do before every training.

You hold the stick with your right hand. The stick is pointing down. You bring the stick behind your
back, then get it with your left hand and brings to front. Then you grab your stick under the left hand, and
take it to the right. As you do this movement fluent, the stick will move around your body.

Take the stick with two hands above your head and do a body turn to the left and to the right.

Take the stick with two and twist your body to the left and to the right.

The stick is before you and is horizontal. Grab it with both hands at the ends. Try to knee the stick with
the left and with the right leg.

Lift up your leg and put the stick under your leg into your other hand.

Hold the stick with one hand. The end of the stick is on the floor. Release the stick, and try to step over the stick
and grab it, before it falls. Do this exercise inwards and outwards too.

Put your stick behind your back with your left hand so, that it will point upwards. Get the stick with your right
hand from up, like a ninja :) You can do it from the other direction, too.

Hold the stick at the ends. Put your stick behind your head horizontally , release it, and try to catch it before it
falls.

- Try to draw an 8 form with your stick from up to down. (Stick twrist)

- Try to draw an 8 form with your stick from down to up. (Stick twrist)

- Throw the stick horizontally into the air, and try to catch it with palms up.

- Throw the stick horizontally into the air, and try to catch it with palms down.

- Throw the stick horizontally into the air, and try to catch it with one palm up and the other down. At every throw change your
hands positions. (from upwards palm will be downwards, and from downwards, it will be upwards)

- Throw the stick horizontally into the air, clap your hands, and try to catch. Increase the number of claps.

Warmup exercises with lots of people

Everybody is running with his/her stick around in random directions.

Case 1:

- We meet with somebody, and hit our stick with her/him.
- We meet with somebody, and change stick.

For a sign, we:

- stop, put the end of the stick to the floor, run around the stick as we are holding it. It can be done forwards and backwards, too.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strenght and stretching exercises ==

It is important to have some strength and stamina for work. It can be developed with free sparring, but without a partner you have to do different exercises. In order to be able to do the lunges, you have to do some stretching exercises. There are people who are lucky, but the rest have problems with the lunges, who have stiff legs and so. The good news is that there are exercises for loosening the legs.

There is a really great problem with the stretching: the first, you cannot be sure that you have any kind of muscle problems, the second, that everybody has different &quot;problems&quot;, so as sportsmen, we have to first identify what OUR problem is, and try to work on it. This is the case; that stretching should be really personal. It is primarily the teacher's (or the doctor's) responsibility to identify the problems (what should be worked on) and to show the exercises. The sportman's main responsibility is to understand her/his own problem, and to do the exercises regularly.  There is lots of informations on the internet about stretching, however there is one book that I really recommend: it is the book from Pavel Tsatsoline: Relax Into Stretching. 

In Canne de Combat we do lots of leg attacks, so, it is a good idea to work on the legs. 

Exercises:

Step into avant. Hold yourself in a position that is comfortable. Try to increase the space between your legs with steps. Do it until you feel uncomfortable. This is the point, what you should have to hold. It must not hurt, you should just feel a little bit uncomfortable.

Contast breathing exercise:

Sit down, put your legs in as a large V form that you feel comfortable in. Take a deep breath, hold the air in for a few seconds, and tighten your body, especially your legs. Pay attention not to decrease your stretched legs. Suddenly let the air out. The breathing out will cause the decrease of the tension. (It is so in every case, this is the reason you should take care of your breath during the matches, too.)  Try to mentally release the tension from your leg. It can help if you touch your leg with your hand, so you will get a much better feedback about your muscle tension. Hold this relaxed position a few seconds, then increase your stretch. Repeat the sequence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== First steps ==

Now you have all the necessary equipments, you can begin the work with your canne. What you have to learn:

* Warm up
* Strength and stretching exercises
* Stances
* Footwork
* Feel the stick
* Attacks
* Defenses
* Lunges
* Hand change tricks
* Voltes
* Jumps
* Combinations
* Double canne
* Baton


== Stances ==

There are two basic stances. The first is a classical fencing like stance. In this case you show only your side to you opponent. Your stance is a kind of L or T stance. This is useful, because you show a smaller target, however in Canne de Combat we move in a circular way, and from this stance is very hard to use both of the hands (the change of hands is a preferred thing in Canne). Because of the reasons described above the classical fencing stance is only partially used (during lunges). What we prefer in Canne de Combat as a default stance is to use a kind of kickboxing stance. Your whole body faces your opponet, you are standing on the toes, having the stick before you, ready to attack and to parry. The distance between your legs is one shoulder length. Make your toes parallel. Now, step forward one step with either your left or the right leg. This is the basic stance. Now you have either your left or the right leg frontal. You hold the stick in that hand, that's leg is frontal. So, if your left leg is the frontal, then you hold the stick in your left hand. It's easy to remember and maintain this stance, if you imagine that you are stading on a rectangle. From this stance you can easily move both to the left or to the right, change to the fencing stance and do the lunges, or make handchanges, or jumps. Try to move from this stance, you will fell it comfortable.

== Footwork ==

The footwork is very important in canne. If you are mobile it is hard to hit you, whilst you can hit you opponet. Assume that your right leg is forward. Where can you move?

* Forwards
* Backwards
* Left
* Right
* some deegre to left
* some deegre to right

The main principle is that if you want to move to one direction, than that leg will step first, what is closer to the point, you want to be there. If you want to step forward, then your frontal leg will step first, and your rear leg next. If you have the right stance, and want to go right, then your right leg will move first, than the left. There is one exception: if you want to play with the distance for example in a case of a lunge, you can step with the other leg, too. But mainly it's preferred to use the principle.

Exercises: here comes some exercises for improvement the footwork

== Feel the stick ==

There is one very important in the weapons art, is the feel of the weapon, in our case the stick. The principle of this feeling is that the stick moves itself, and through this motion, the body will move. The movement of the stick implies the movement of the body, but only then, if it's necessary. If you want to make a twirl with a stick, you have to let the stick to do it's motion based on its weight and the gravity using your hand as a turning point. Really you don't twirl the stick, but it just falls because of the gravity, but you hold it, so it will make a circular movement. You can add additional power to this motion of course, but the base is to let the stick turning. In order to achieve it, it is important to hold the stick loose. Do not grab the stick with a strong grip, but hold it with a gentle wrist. In this case you will not have tension in your wrist and forearm, so you will be able to work more time with the stick, and you will be able to do the tricks much easier.
The secret of stickfighting is to let the stick show it's possibilities, and to be able to change hitting planes easy.

A '''rose''' is a flowering shrub of the genus '''''Rosa''''', and the flower of this shrub. There are more than a hundred species of wild roses, all from the northern hemisphere and mostly from temperate regions. The species form a group of generally thorny shrubs or climbers, and sometimes trailing plants, reaching 2–5 m tall, rarely reaching as high as 20 m by climbing over other plants.

==Description==


==Growing conditions==
Roses thrive in temperate climates, though certain species and cultivars can flourish in sub-tropical and even tropical climates, especially when grafted onto appropriate root-stock.

Many thousands of rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use, mostly double-flowered with many or all of the stamens mutated into additional petals. Twentieth-century rose breeders generally emphasized size and color, producing large, attractive blooms with little or no scent. Many wild and &quot;old-fashioned&quot; roses, by contrast, have a strong sweet scent. A few cultivars, such as the Lady Banks rose have been selected for having no thorns. 

Rose hips are sometimes eaten, mainly for their vitamin C content. They are usually pressed and filtered to make rose-hip syrup, as the fine hairs surrounding the seeds are unpleasant to eat (resembling itching powder). They can also be used to make herbal tea, jam, jelly and marmalade.

There is no single system of classification for garden roses. In general, however, roses are placed in one of three main groups:
*'''Wild Roses''' - The wild roses includes the species listed above and some of their hybrids.
*'''Old Garden Roses''' - Most old garden roses are classified into one of the following (ordered by approximate age - oldest first): 
**'''Alba''' - Literally &quot;white roses&quot;, derived from ''R. arvensis'' and the closely allied ''R. alba''. These are some of the oldest garden roses, probably brought to Britain by the Romans. Once-flowering. Examples: 'Semi-plena', 'White Rose of York'.
**'''Gallica''' - The Gallica roses have been developed from ''R. gallica'' which is a native of central and southern Europe. They flower once in the summer. Examples: 'Cardinal de Richelieu', 'Charles de Mills', 'Rosa Mundi' (''R. gallica versicolor'').
**'''Damask''' - Robert de Brie is given credit for bringing them from Persia to Europe sometime between 1254 and 1276. Summer Damasks (crosses between Gallica roses and ''R. phoenicea'') bloom once in summer. Autumn Damasks (Gallicas crossed with ''R. moschata'') bloom later, in the autumn. Examples: 'Ispahan', 'Madame Hardy'.
**'''Centifolia (or Provence)''' - These roses, raised in the seventeenth century in the Netherlands, are named for their &quot;one hundred&quot; petals. Once-flowering. Examples: 'Centifolia', 'Paul Ricault'.
**'''Moss''' - Closely related to the centifolias, these have a mossy excrescence on the stems and sepals. Once-flowering. Example: 'Comtesse de Murinais', 'Old Pink Moss'.
**'''China''' - The China roses brought with them an amazing ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the summer and into late autumn. Four china roses ('Slater's Crimson China', 1792; 'Parsons' Pink China', 1793; 'Hume's Blush China', 1809; and 'Parks' Yellow Tea Scented China', 1824) were brought to Europe in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries which brought about the creation of the repeat flowering old garden roses and later the modern garden roses. Examples: 'Old Blush China', 'Mutabilis'.
**'''Portland''' - These are named after the Duchess of Portland who received (from Italy in 1800) a rose then known as ''R. paestana'' or 'Scarlet Four Seasons' Rose' (now known simply as 'The Portland Rose'). This group was developed from that rose. Repeat-flowering. Example: 'James Veitch', 'Rose de Rescht', 'The Portland Rose'.
**'''Bourbon''' - They originated on l'Île de Bourbon (now called Réunion). Probably the result of a cross between the Autumn Damask and the 'Old Blush China'. Introduced in France in 1823. Repeat-flowering. Examples: 'Louise Odier', 'Mme. Pierre Oger', 'Zéphirine Drouhin'.
**'''Hybrid Perpetual''' - The dominant class of roses in Victorian England, they were derived to a great extent from the Bourbons. Repeat-flowering. Examples: 'Ferdinand Pichard', 'Reine Des Violettes'.
**'''Tea''' - The result of crossing two of the original China Roses ('Hume's Blush China' and 'Parks' Yellow Tea Scented China') with various Bourbons and Noisette roses. Somewhat more tender than other old garden roses (most likely because of ''R. gigantea'' in the ancestry of the Parks rose), teas are repeat-flowering roses although their fragrance is not always a tea scent. Example: 'Lady Hillingdon'.
**'''Bermuda &quot;Mystery&quot; Roses''' - A group of several dozen &quot;found&quot; roses that have been grown in Bermuda for at least a century. The roses have significant value and interest for those growing roses in tropical and semi-tropical regions, since they are highly resistant to both nematode damage and the fungal diseases that plague rose culture in hot, humid areas, and capable of blooming in hot and humid weather. Most of these roses are likely Old Garden Rose cultivars that have otherwise dropped out of cultivation, or sports thereof. They are &quot;mystery roses&quot; because their &quot;proper&quot; historical names have been lost. Tradition dictates that they are named after the owner of the garden where they were rediscovered.
**'''Miscellaneous''' - There are also a few smaller classes (such as Scots, Sweet Brier) and some climbing classes of old roses (including Ayrshire, Climbing China, Laevigata, Sempervirens, Noisette, Boursault, Climbing Tea, and Climbing Bourbon). Those classes with both climbing and shrub forms are often grouped together. 
*'''Modern Garden Roses''' - Classification of modern roses can be quite confusing because many modern roses have old garden roses in their ancestry and their form varies so much. The classifications tend to be by growth and flowering characteristics, such as &quot;large-flowered shrub&quot;, &quot;recurrent, large-flowered shrub&quot;,  &quot;cluster-flowered&quot;, &quot;rambler recurrent&quot;, or &quot;ground-cover non-recurrent&quot;. Many of the most popular modern cultivars can however be assigned to one of these two groups:
**'''Hybrid Tea''' - The favourite florist's rose, with typically one to at most five or six large flowers per stem, the flower with numerous tightly arranged petals with reflexed tips (see photo, right). They are favoured in small gardens in formal situations, and for buttonhole roses.
**'''Floribunda''' - Flowers often smaller, in large clusters of ten or more (often many more) on each stem. These tend to give a more prominent display from a distance, so are more often used in large bedding schemes in public parks and similar spaces.
*'''Buck Roses''' - Griffith Buck, professor of horticulture at Iowa State University from 1948 to 1985, hybridized nearly 90 rose varieties. Buck roses are known for disease resistance and winter hardiness.

==Uses==
Roses are one of the most popular garden shrubs and are also among the most common flowers sold by florists. Roses are of great economic importance both as a crop for florists' use and for use in perfume. 

Rose perfumes are made from '''attar of roses''' or '''rose oil''', which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam-distilling the crushed petals of roses. The technique originated in Persia (the word Rose itself is from Persian) then spread through Arabia and India, but nowadays about 70% to 80% of production is in the Rose Valley near Kazanluk in Bulgaria, with some production in Qamsar in Iran and Germany. The Kaaba in Mecca is annually washed by the Iranian rose water from Qamsar. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (''Rosa damascena'' 'Trigintipetala') are used. In the French rose oil industry ''Rosa centifolia'' is used. The oil, pale yellow or yellow-grey in color, is sometimes called 'Rose Absolute' oil to distinguish it from diluted versions. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers - for example, about 2,000 flowers are required to produce one gramme of oil.

==Pests and diseases==
Roses are subject to several diseases. The most serious is rose rust(''[[../Phragmidium mucronatum/]]''), a species of rust fungus, which can defoliate the plant. More common, though less debilitating, are rose black spot, caused by the fungus ''[[../Diplocarpon rosae/]]'', which makes circular black spots on the leaves in summer, and rose mildew, caused by ''[[../Sphaerotheca pannosa/]]''. ;

 '''pragma''' Interface (''language_name'', ''subprogram_name'');

== Summary ==

'''Interface''' is an [[Ada Programming/Ada 83|Ada 83]] [[:Category:Ada Programming/Interfacing pragmas|interfacing pragma]] equivalent to pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Import|Import]]. However, it can be used just for subprograms while pragma Import allows also interfacing with global variables.

Some compilers for recent versions of the language still allow this pragma, but treat it just like pragma Import. In older code, pragma Import was usually followed by the implementation-defined pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Interface_Name|Interface_Name]] to specify the external name of the subprogram.

It is worth noting that &quot;[[Ada Programming/Keywords|interface]]&quot; is a new Ada 2005 keyword. However, a special exception is made in the standard to allow it as a pragma identifier for backwards compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ordinary Least Squares''' or '''OLS''' is one of the simplest (if you can call it so) methods of linear regression. The goal of OLS is to closely &quot;fit&quot; a function with the data. It does so by minimizing the sum of squared errors from the data. 

==Why we Square Errors before Summing==

We are not trying to minimize the sum of absolute errors, but rather the sum of ''squared'' errors. Let's take a brief look at our sweater story again.

Notice that the Sum of Model A is &lt;math&gt;5 + 10 - 5 -10 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and that the Sum of Model B is &lt;math&gt; 3 - 3 + 3 - 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Both Models sum to 0 and both are great fits! '''NO!!'''

So to account for the signs, whenever we sum errors, we square the terms first.

== The Model ==
These two models each have an intercept term &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and a slope term &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (some textbooks use &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, this is a much better approach once we move to multivariate formulas). We can represent an arbitrary single variable model with the formula:
&lt;math&gt;y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + u_i&lt;/math&gt;
The y-values are related to the x-values given this formula. We use the subscript ''i'' to denote an observation. So &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; is paired with &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, etc. The &lt;math&gt;u_t&lt;/math&gt; term is the error term, which is the difference between the effect of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and the observed
value of &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Unfortunately, we don't know the values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;u_t&lt;/math&gt;. We have to approximate them. We can do this by using the ordinary least squares method. The term &quot;least squares&quot; means that we are trying to minimize the sum of squares, or more specifically we are trying to minimize the squared error terms. Since there are two variables that we need to minimize with respect to (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;), we have two equations:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f = \Sigma u_i^2 = \Sigma (y_i - \alpha - \beta x_i)^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial \alpha} = -2\Sigma (y_i - \alpha - \beta x_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial \beta} = -2\Sigma (y_i - \alpha - \beta x_i) x_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Call the solutions to these equations &lt;math&gt;\hat \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta&lt;/math&gt;. Solving we get:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\hat \alpha = \bar y - \hat \beta \bar x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\hat \beta = \frac{\Sigma(x_i - \bar x)y_i}{\Sigma(x_i - \bar x)^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;\bar y = \frac{\Sigma y_i}{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar x = \frac{\Sigma x_i}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Computing these results can be left as an exercise.

It is important to know that &lt;math&gt;\hat \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta&lt;/math&gt; are not the same as &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; because they are based on a single sample rather than the entire population. If you took a different sample, you would get different values for &lt;math&gt;\hat \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta&lt;/math&gt;. Let's call &lt;math&gt;\hat \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta&lt;/math&gt; the OLS estimators of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. One of the main goals of econometrics is to analyze the quality of these estimators and see under what conditions these are good estimators and under which conditions they are not.

Once we have &lt;math&gt;\hat \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta&lt;/math&gt;, we can construct two more variables. The first is the fitted values, or estimates of ''y'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\hat y_i = \hat \alpha + \hat \beta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The second is the estimates of the error terms, which we will call the '''residuals''':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\hat u_i = y_i - \hat y_i&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These two variables will be important later on.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

After J2EE, Sun had a vision about the next step of network computing: in a network environment, there would be many independent services and consumers. That is '''JavaSpaces'''.  JavaSpaces would allow these services/consumers to interact dynamically with each other in a robust way.  It can be viewed as an object repository that provides a distributed persistent  object exchange mechanism (persistent can be in memory or disk) for Java objects. It can be used to store the system state and implement distributed algorithms. In a JavaSpace, all communication partners (peers) communicate by sharing state. It is an implementation of the [[w:Tuple spaces|Tuple spaces]] idea.

JavaSpaces is used when someone wants to achieve scalability and availability and at the same time reducing the complexity of the overall system.

Processes perform simple operations to write new objects into a ''JavaSpace'', take objects from a ''JavaSpace'', or read (make a copy of) objects from the ''JavaSpace''.

In conventional applications, objects are assembled from the database before presenting to the end user. In JavaSpace applications, we keep the ready made &quot;end user&quot; objects and store them in the JavaSpace. In JavaSpace applications the services are decoupled from each other; they communicate through objects that they write and read/take from the JavaSpace. Services search for objects that they want to take or read from the Space by using template object.

== JINI ==
JavaSpaces technology is part of the Java [[w:Jini|Jini]] technology.  The basic features of JINI are:
* '''No user intervention''' is needed when services are brought on or offline. (In contrast to EJBs where the client program has to know the server and port number where the EJB is deployed. In JINI the client is ''supposed to find'', discover the service in the network.)
* '''Self healing''' by adapting when services (consumers of services) come and go. Services need to periodically renew a lease to indicate that they are still available.
* Consumers of JINI services do not need prior knowledge of the service's implementation. The '''implementation is downloaded dynamically''' and run on the consumer JVM, without configuration and user intervention. For example, the end user may be presented with slightly different user interface depending which service is being used at the time. The implementation of those user interface code would be provided by the service being used.
:This fact that the implementation is running on the consumer/client's JVM can increase performance, by eliminating the need of remote calls.

A minimal JINI network environment consists of:
* One or more '''services'''
* A '''lookup-service''' keeping a list of registered services
* One or more '''consumers'''

== The JINI Lookup Service ==
The lookup service is described in the : ''Jini Lookup Service Specification (reggie)''.  This service interface defines all operations that are possible on the lookup service.  Clients locate services by requesting with a lookup server that implements a particular interface.  Client asks the lookup server for all services that implement the particular service interface.  The lookup service returns service objects for all registered services that implement the given interface.  The client may invoke methods on that object in order to interact directly with the server.

== Lookup Discovery ==
''Jini Discovery and Join Specification'' describes how does the client find the jini lookup service.  There is a protocol to do that, jini comes with a set of API's that implement that protocol.  The ''Jini Discovery Utility Specification'' defines a set of utility classes that are used to work with the protocol.

== Leasing ==
When a service registers with the lookup service, it receives a lease from the lookup service, described in the ''Jini Distributed Leasing Specification''.

      <comment>/* Basic bivariate model */ Grammar</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Econometrics is all about causality. Economics is full of theory of how one thing causes another: increases in prices cause demand to decrease, better education causes people to become richer, etc. So to be able to test this theory, economists find data (such as price and quantity of a good, or notes on a population's education and wealth levels). However, when this data is placed on a plot, it rarely makes neat lines that are presented in introductory economics text books. [[Image:Oldfaithful3.png|thumb|This plot is of waiting time between eruptions of Old Faithful and duration of eruptions, but it might as well be a plot of the supply line for sweater sales]] Data always comes out looking like a cloud, and without using proper techniques, it is impossible to determine if this cloud gives any useful information. Econometrics is a tool to establish correlation and hopefully later, causality, using collected data points. We do this by creating an '''explanatory function''' from the data. The function is linear model and is estimated by ''minimizing'' the squared distance from the data to the line. The distance is considered an ''error term''. This is the process of '''linear regression.''' 


==The Line==
The point of econometrics is establishing a correlation, and hopefully, causality between two variables. The easiest way to do this is to make a line. The slope of the line will say &quot;if we increase x by so much, then y will increase by this much&quot; and we have an intercept that gives us the value of y when x = 0. 

The equation for a line is y = a + b*x (note:a and b take on different written forms, such as alpha and beta, or beta(0) beta(1) but they always mean &quot;intercept&quot; and &quot;slope&quot;).

The problem is developing a line that fits our data. Because our data is scattered, an non-linear, it is impossible for this simple line to hit every data point. So we set our line up so that it minimizes the errors (and we need to actually minimize the squared errors). We adjust our first line, or ''explanatory function'' to have an error term, so that, given x and the error term, we can correctly come up with the right y. 

y = a + b*x + error

==Basic Example==
After blowing our grant money on a vacation, we are pressured by the University to come up with some answers about movements of the sweater industry in Minnesota. We do not have much time, so we only collect data from two different clothing stores in Minnesota on two separate days. Fortunately for us, we get data from one day in the summer and one day in the winter. We ask both stores to tell us how many sweaters they have sold and they tell us the truth. We are looking to see how weather (temperature -- independent variable) affects how many sweaters are sold (dependent variable). 

We come up with the following scatter plot.

[[Image:Sweater sales1.JPG]]

Now we can add a line (a function) to tell us the relationship of these two variables. We will minimize the sum of errors, and see what we get. The distance to the line from the cold side is +15 and the difference from the hot side to the line is -15. When we add them together, we get 15 - 15 = 0. 0 error, our line must be perfect!

[[Image:Sweater sales2.JPG]]

Notice that our line fits the data well. It the differences between the data and the function are evenly distributed (&lt;math&gt; \sum \epsilon = 0&lt;/math&gt;). So there is a relationship between temperature and sweater sales. &quot;Hot weather increases Sweater Sales&quot; will be the title of our famous paper! But it will be wrong, and we'll probably fired from our job at the University. 

If we had only minimized distances between the line and the data! Well, here is a plot with a estimated line that does just that. To do this, we minimize the sum of ''squared'' errors.

[[Image:Sweater sales3.JPG]]

Once we minimize the distances between the line and the data, we have a better fit and we can declared that &quot;cold weather increases Sweater Sales&quot; (&lt;math&gt; \sum \epsilon^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;)

==Basic bivariate model==
Our basic model is a line that best fits the data. 

&lt;math&gt;Y_=\alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;Y_i \in [1,n] and X_i \in [1,n] &lt;/math&gt;, α and β are unknown parameters that must be estimated. &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_i \in [1,n] &lt;/math&gt; is the unobserved error term. This term is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iid iid] random variable. '''regression coefficient'''.

==Properties of the error term==

The error term, also known as the '''disturbance term''', is the unobserved random component which explains the difference between &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta X_i&lt;/math&gt;. This term is the combination of four different effects.

1. ''Omitted Variables:'' in many cases, it is hard to account for every variability in the system. Although cold weather increases  sweater sales, but also, the price of heating oil may also have an affect. This was not accounted in our original model, but may be explained in our error term. 

2. ''Nonlinearities:'' The actual relationship may not be linear, but all we have is a linear modeling system. At 30 degrees, 10 people buy sweaters. At 20 degrees 40 people by sweaters. At 10 degrees 80 people buy sweaters. In our model, the error term will account the nonlinearity.

3. ''Measurement errors:'' Sometimes data was not collected 100% correctly. The store told us that 10 people bought sweaters that day, but after we talked to them, 4 more people bought sweaters. The relationship still exists, but we have some error collected in the error term.

4. ''Unpredictable effects:'' No matter how well the economic model is specified, there will always be some sort of stochastic that affects it. These effects will be accounted by the error term.


Looking again at our OLS line in our sweater story, we a can have a look at our error terms. The error, is the distance from our data Y and our estimate Ŷ. We get an equation from this: &lt;math&gt; \hat{\epsilon_i} = Y_i - \hat{Y_i} = Y_i - \alpha - \beta X_i&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* New commands */ Revised the \newcommand example with two arguments to be more instructive.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{LaTeX/Top}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Documents produced with the commands you have learned up to this point will look acceptable to a large audience. While they are not fancy-looking, they obey all the established rules of good typesetting, which will make them easy to read and pleasant to look at. However, there are situations where LaTeX does not provide a command or environment that matches your needs, or the output produced by some existing command may not meet your requirements.

In this chapter, we will try to give some hints on how to teach LaTeX new tricks and how to make it produce output that looks different from what is provided by default.

LaTeX is a fairly high-level language compared to Plain TeX and thus is more limited. The next [[LaTeX/Plain TeX|chapter]] will focus on Plain TeX and will explain advanced techniques for programming.

==New commands==

To add your own commands, use the
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcommand{name}[num]{definition}
}}
command. Basically, the command requires two arguments: the ''name'' of the command you want to create, and the ''definition'' of the command. Note that the command ''name'' can but need not be enclosed in braces, as you like. The ''num'' argument in square brackets is optional and specifies the number of arguments the new command takes (up to 9 are possible). If missing it defaults to 0, i.e. no argument allowed.

The following two examples should help you to get the idea. The first example defines a new command called &lt;tt&gt;\wbal&lt;/tt&gt; that will print &quot;The Wikibook about LaTeX&quot;. Such a command could come in handy if you had to write the title of this book over and over again.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\newcommand{\wbal}{The Wikibook about \LaTeX}
This is ‘‘\wbal'' \ldots{} ‘‘\wbal''
|render=
This is “The Wikibook about LaTeX” … “The Wikibook about LaTeX”
}}

The next example illustrates how to define a new command that takes one argument. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=#1&lt;!----&gt;}} tag gets replaced by the argument you specify. If you wanted to use more than one argument, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=#2&lt;!----&gt;}} and so on, these arguments are added in an extra set of brackets.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\newcommand{\wbalsup}[1] {
  This is the Wikibook about LaTeX 
  supported by #1}
\newcommand{\wbalTwo}[2] {
  This is the Wikibook about LaTeX
  supported by #1 and #2}
% in the document body:
\begin{itemize}
\item \wbalsup{Wikimedia}
\item \wbalsup{lots of users!}
\item \wbalTwo{John Doe}{Anthea Smith}
\end{itemize}
|render=
*This is the Wikibook about LaTeX supported by Wikimedia
*This is the Wikibook about LaTeX supported by lots of users!
*This is the Wikibook about LaTeX supported by John Doe and Anthea Smith
}}

Name your new command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\wbalTwo&lt;!----&gt;}} and not {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\wbal2&lt;!----&gt;}} as digits cannot be used to name macros &amp;mdash; invalid characters will error out at compile-time.

LaTeX will not allow you to create a new command that would overwrite an existing one. But there is a special command in case you explicitly want this: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\renewcommand&lt;!----&gt;}}. It uses the same syntax as the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newcommand&lt;!----&gt;}} command.

In certain cases you might also want to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\providecommand&lt;!----&gt;}} command. It works like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newcommand&lt;!----&gt;}}, but if the command is already defined, LaTeX will silently ignore the new command.

With LaTex2e, it is also possible to add a default parameter to a command with the following syntax:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcommand{name}[num][default]{definition}
}}

If the default parameter of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newcommand&lt;!----&gt;}} is present, then the first of the number of arguments specified by {{LaTeX/Parameter|num}} is optional with a default value of {{LaTeX/Parameter|default}}; if absent, then all of the arguments are required.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\newcommand{\wbalTwo}[2][Wikimedia]{
  This is the Wikibook about LaTeX
  supported by {#1} and {#2}!}
% in the document body:
\begin{itemize}
\item \wbalTwo{John Doe}
\item \wbalTwo[lots of users]{John Doe}
\end{itemize}
|render=
*This is the Wikibook about LaTeX supported by Wikimedia and John Doe!
*This is the Wikibook about LaTeX supported by lots of users and John Doe!
}}

;Note: When the command is used with an explicit first parameter it is given enclosed with brackets (here &quot;{{LaTeX/Parameter|[lots of users]}}&quot;).

Here is an common example: if you are writing a book about Mathematics and you have to use vectors, you have to decide how they will look. There are several different standards, used in many books. If ''a'' is a vector, some people like to add an arrow over it (&lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;), other people write it underlined (''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;''); another common version is to write it bold ('''a'''). Let us assume you want to write your vectors with an arrow over them; then add the following line in your &lt;tt&gt;mystyle.sty&lt;/tt&gt;.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcommand{\myvec}[1]{\vec{#1}&lt;!----&gt;}
}}

and write your vectors inside the new {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\myvec{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} command. You can call it as you wish, but you'd better choose a short name because you will probably write it very often. Then, if you change your mind and you want your vectors to look differently you just have to change the definition of your {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\myvec{...}&lt;!----&gt;}}. Use this approach whenever you can: this will save you a lot of time and increase the consistency of your document.

===DeclareRobustCommand===
Some commands are ''fragile'', that is they fail in some environments.  If a macro works in body text but not in (for example) a figure caption, it's worth trying to replace the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newcommand{\MyCommand}...}} declaration with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\DeclareRobustCommand{\MyCommand}...}} in the preamble.  This is especially true for macros which, when expanded, produce text that is written to a &lt;tt&gt;.aux&lt;/tt&gt; file.

==New Environments==

Just as with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newcommand&lt;!----&gt;}} command, there is a command to create your own environments. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newenvironment&lt;!----&gt;}} command uses the following syntax:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newenvironment{name}[num]{before}{after}
}}

Again {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newenvironment&lt;!----&gt;}} can have an optional argument. When the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{name}&lt;!----&gt;}} command (which starts the environment) is encountered, the material specified in the {{LaTeX/Parameter|before}} argument is processed before the text in the environment gets processed. The material in the {{LaTeX/Parameter|after}} argument gets processed when the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end{name}&lt;!----&gt;}} command (which ends the environment) is encountered.

The {{LaTeX/Parameter|num}} argument is used the same way as in the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newcommand&lt;!----&gt;}} command. LaTeX makes sure that you do not define an environment that already exists. If you ever want to change an existing command, you can use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\renewenvironment&lt;!----&gt;}} command. It uses the same syntax as the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newenvironment&lt;!----&gt;}} command.

The example below illustrates the usage of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newenvironment&lt;!----&gt;}} command:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\newenvironment{king}
{ \rule{1ex}{1ex}\hspace{\stretch{1}&lt;!----&gt;} }
{ \hspace{\stretch{1}&lt;!----&gt;}\rule{1ex}{1ex} }

\begin{king}
My humble subjects \ldots
\end{king}
|render=
[[Image:Latex example newenvironment.png|300px]]
}}

===Unmatched braces===

Often, part of the motive behind creating an environment is to surround its body in a grouping of braces.  However, this requires unmatched braces to appear in both the beginning and end portions of the environment declaration, which will prevent the document from compiling.  To solve this issue, use the TeX synonyms {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bgroup}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\egroup}} instead of typing {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=} }} in this case.

===Extra space===

When creating a new environment you may easily get bitten by extra spaces
creeping in, which can potentially have fatal effects. For example when you
want to create a title environment which suppresses its own indentation as well
as the one on the following paragraph. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ignorespaces&lt;!----&gt;}} command in the
begin block of the environment will make it ignore any space after executing
the begin block. The end block is a bit more tricky as special processing
occurs at the end of an environment. With the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ignorespacesafterend&lt;!----&gt;}}
LaTeX will issue an {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ignorespaces&lt;!----&gt;}} after the special ‘end’ processing has
occurred.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\newenvironment{simple}%
{\noindent}%
{\par\noindent}

\begin{simple}
See the space\\to the left.
\end{simple}
Same\\here.
|render=
&lt;pre&gt;
  See the space
to the left.

  Same
here.
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}


{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\newenvironment{correct}%
{\noindent\ignorespaces}%
{\par\noindent%
\ignorespacesafterend}

\begin{correct}
No space\\to the left.
\end{correct}
Same\\here.
|render=
&lt;pre&gt;
No space
to the left.

Same
here.
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

Also, if you're still having problems with extra space being appended at the end of your environment when using the &lt;tt&gt;\input&lt;/tt&gt; for external source, make sure there is no space between the beginning, sourcing, and end of the environment, such as:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{correct}\input{somefile.tex}\end{correct}
}}

or

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{correct}%
\input{somefile.tex}%
\end{correct}
}}

== Extending the number of arguments ==

The {{LaTeX/Package|xkeyval}} packages will let you define key/value options for commands.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\mycommand[key1=value1, key3=value3]{some text}
}}

The package is quite complete and documentation is exhaustive. We recommend that package developers read it. [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/xkeyval]

Let's provide a simple example&lt;ref&gt;[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/13270/a-package-template-using-xkeyval tex.stackexchange.com]&lt;/ref&gt;:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{xkeyval}
% ...

\makeatletter
\def\my@emphstyle#1{\csname my@style@#1\endcsname}
%% Predefined styles
\providecommand\my@style@default{\em}
\providecommand\my@style@bold{\bfseries}

\define@key{myemph}{code}{%
  \def\my@emphstyle{#1}
}
\define@key{myemph}{style}{%
  \def\my@emphstyle{\csname my@style@#1\endcsname}
}
\newcommand\setemph[1]{%
  \setkeys{myemph}{#1}
}

\renewcommand\emph[1]{%
  {\my@emphstyle #1}
}

\makeatother

Something \emph{important}

\setemph{style=bold}
Something \emph{important}

\setemph{code=\Large\sffamily}
Something \emph{important}
}}

==Arithmetic==

{{Expand}}

LaTeX can manipulate numbers.

The {{LaTeX/Package|calc}} package provides the common infix notation.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{calc}
% ...
\newcounter{mine}
\setcounter{mine}{2*17}
\themine
}}

For high-precision computations, you can use the {{LaTeX/Package|fp}} package.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{fp}

% Clip
\[
\FPmul\result{2}{7}
\FPclip\result\result
2*7 = \result
\]

% Infix
\[
\newcommand\result{11}
\sqrt{\sin(2+\result)} \approx
\FPeval\result{round(root(2,sin(result + \FPpi)):2)}
\result
\]

% Postfix
\[
\FPupn\result{17 2.5 + 17.5 - 2 1 + * 2 swap /} 
\FPclip\result\result
(17+2.5 - 17.5) * (2+1) / 2  = \result
\]

% High precision
\[
\FPdiv\result{17}{7}
\frac{17}{7} \approx \FPtrunc\result\result{3}
\result
\]
}}

==Conditionals==

LaTeX can use conditionals thanks to the {{LaTeX/Package|ifthen}} package.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{ifthen}
% ...

\ifthenelse{ \equal{\myvar}{true} }{
  This is true.
}{
  This is false.
}
}}

== Loops ==

The {{LaTeX/Package|PGF/TikZ}} extension provides the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\foreach&lt;!----&gt;}} command.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{tikz}
% ...

\foreach \i/\q in {wheat/50g, water/1L, yeast/2g}{
  \noindent\i\dotfill\q\\
}
}}

Alternatively you can check out the {{LaTeX/Package|multido}} package.

== Strings ==

{{LaTeX/Package|xstring}} provides a lot of features. From CTAN:
* testing a string’s contents
* extracting substrings
* substitution of substrings
* string length
* position of a substring
* number of recurrences of a substring

Examples:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{xstring}
% ...

\newcommand\mystr{Hello World!}

The string ``\mystr'' has \StrLen{\mystr}{} characters.

Predicate ``\mystr{} contains the word Hello'' is \IfSubStr{\mystr}{Hello}{true}{false}.
}}

== LaTeX Hooks ==

LaTeX provide two hooks:
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\AtBeginDocument&lt;!----&gt;}} will let you specify a set of commands that will be executed when {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{document}&lt;!----&gt;}} is met.
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\AtEndDocument&lt;!----&gt;}} does the same for {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end{document}&lt;!----&gt;}}.

This gives you some more flexiblity for macros. It can be useful to override settings that get executed after the preamble. These hooks can be called several times. The commands will be executed in the order they were set.

For instance, let's replace the page numbers with oldstylenums:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{textcomp}

\AtBeginDocument{%
  % Make the page numbers in text figures
  \let\myThePage\thepage
  \renewcommand{\thepage}{ \oldstylenums{\myThePage} }
}
}}

There are also hooks for classes and packages. See [[LaTeX/Creating Packages|Creating Packages]].

==Command-line LaTeX==

If you work on a Unix-like OS, you might be using Makefiles or any kind of script to build your LaTeX projects. In that connection it might be interesting to produce different versions of the same document by calling LaTeX with command-line parameters. If you add the following structure to your document:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{ifthen}
%...

% default value.
\providecommand\blackandwhite{false}
%...

\ifthenelse{ \equal{\blackandwhite}{true} }{
% &quot;black and white&quot; mode; do something..
}{
% &quot;color&quot; mode; do something different..
}
}}

Now you can call LaTeX like this:
 latex '\providecommand{\blackandwhite}{true}\input{test.tex}'

First the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\blackandwhite&lt;!----&gt;}} gets defined and then the actual file is read with input. By setting {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\blackandwhite&lt;!----&gt;}} to false the color version of the document would be produced.

'''Stargazy Pie''' &amp;ndash; a rich fish pie from Cornwall in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. [[File:Stargazy pie prebake.jpg|thumb|Stargazy pie, with sardines looking skywards before it is baked in the oven]] The Wikipedia photo (shown) implies that rather than a two or three inch high&quot;desert&quot; pie tin one should use a pie dish that could be called a casserole dish.

== Ingredients ==
(Dependant on size of pie-dish)
*As many fresh [[Cookbook:Fish|Herrings, Pilchards or Mackerel]] to fill your dish
*Sufficient [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]] to cover your dish
*Fresh chopped [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] &amp; [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*Up to 6 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], or, ½ pint (300 mL) of [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], or top-of-the-milk
*Fine [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|breadcrumbs]]
*Fat [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon rashers]], (green or smoked to your preference)
*2 Tbs. [[Cookbook:Tarragon|Tarragon]] [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*[[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]]

== Procedure ==
#Scale, clean &amp; bone the fish, retaining heads.
#Season inside each with salt, pepper &amp; parsley, roll neatly.
#Butter dish, &amp; sprinkle a thick layer of breadcrumbs on.
#Lay in some of the fish, then alternate breadcrumbs &amp; fish until dish is full. 
#Cover with rashers.
#Beat eggs with vinegar, pour into pie, or use cream.
#Cover with pastry.
#Arrange heads on pastry, so as they are looking up (to the stars).
#Bake in a hot oven.
#Serve with a sprig of parsley in mouth of each fish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some of the first things I heard from students about the process of creating an interactive, immersive, multimedia project were frustrations such as:

1. &quot;I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing to get my part of the project finished.  I know I'm on the ________ team but it's not clear what we're supposed to be doing right now&quot;.
2. &quot;How is this different from other projects we've done in the MultiMedia Institute so far.  Is this going to be like creating one of our video pieces, or light making my own web site?&quot;
3. &quot;I have to wait until the Design Team gets their work done before I can get started&quot; - or &quot;I have to wait until the Project Director gives us the navigation outline before I can do my part&quot; - or &quot;I have to wait until the Interactive Team tells us what software they're going to use before I can get started&quot;.

It makes sense that students who have never created an interactive team project before are unsure what they are to do to help their particular team accomplish their work.  Interactive design is deceiving in that the processes are very similar to those used to make a video documentary or any other piece of conventional, linear media.  It's confusing because rules for conventional media are not enough to finish an interactive product.  

For example, video components must be planned, shot and edited for either presentation format.  Interactive clips must, however, make sense when played out of sequence or all by themselves.  Transitions to and from many other non-linear components must be created and, in most cases, video clips will be very short and numerous.

The sequential order for interactive development usually looks like this:
1. Define the end user, time line and budget in detail.
2. Describe and understand all possible environments where the project might be accessed (at a living room desktop computer, integrated with live actors, from a lap top, in a classroom, etc.)
3. Decide what format of media (pictures, video, PDFs, text, VRs, URL links, etc.) will communicate your story the best.
4. Describe (storyboard) for each type of media.
5. Collect media and translate, compress, reformat it into a form that can be read by the final authoring tool (in this case, Adobe's Director software).
6. Create at least one prototype for each kind of media and test it on an end-user's playback device (computer, DVD player, etc.).
7. Author the project, keeping in mind to give users what they expect as well as something they didn't expect that makes the product memorable (&quot;sticky&quot;) and effective.
8. Test the product.
9. Debug.
10. Duplicate, if necessary, and distribute.

With this much information it is possible for every team member to tackle their part of the project while giving direction to other development teams.

=Application Layer=
The application layer is the seventh level of the seven-layer OSI model. It interfaces directly to and performs common application services for the application processes; it also issues requests to the presentation layer.

The common application layer services provide semantic conversion between associated application processes. Note: Examples of common application services of general interest include the virtual file, virtual terminal, and job transfer and manipulation protocols.

The application layer of the four layer and five layer TCP/IP models corresponds to the application layer, the presentation layer and session layer in the seven layer OSI model.

==Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol==
'''DHCP''' is a protocol used by networked host (''clients'') to obtain IP addresses and other parameters such as the default gateway, subnet mask, and IP address of DNS servers from a DHCP server. It facilitates access to a network because these settings would otherwise have to be made manually for the client to participate in the network.

The DHCP server ensures that all IP addresses are unique, e.g., no IP address is assigned to a second client while the first client's assignment is valid (its ''lease'' has not expired). Thus IP address pool management is done by the server and not by a human network administrator.

DHCP functionally became a successor to the older BOOTP protocol, whose leases were given for infinite time and did not support options. Due to the backward-compatibility of DHCP, very few networks continue to use pure BOOTP.

===IP address allocation===
Depending on implementation, the DHCP server has three methods of allocating IP addresses:
* '''manual allocation''', where the DHCP server performs the allocation based on a table with MAC address - IP address pairs manually filled by the server administrator. Only requesting clients with a MAC address listed in this table get the IP address according to the table.
* '''automatic allocation''', where the DHCP server permanently assigns to a requesting client a free IP address from a range given by the administrator.
* '''dynamic allocation''', the only method which provides dynamic re-use of IP addresses. A network administrator assigns a range of IP addresses to DHCP, and each client computer on the LAN has its TCP/IP software configured to request an IP address from the DHCP server when that client computer's network interface card starts up. The request-and-grant process uses a lease concept with a controllable time period. This eases the network installation procedure on the client computer side considerably.

This decision is generally unapparent to clients.

Some DHCP server implementations can update the DNS name associated with the client hosts to reflect the new IP address. They make use of the DNS update protocol established with RFC 2136.

===Configuring the IOS DHCP Server===
* Setup a DHCP Database Agent
Using the IP DHCP database command, configure a DHCP database store. Alternately, use the no IP DHCP conflict logging command to disable logging of DHCP conflicts.
* Setup Excluded IP addresses
Use the ip dhcp excluded-address command to configure any IP addresses which fall within the DHCP pool address range but which should not be allocated to clients.
* Configure the address pool
Firstly, create a DHCP Poll with the IP DHCP pool name command. Next, when in the DHCP pool mode, use the network command to add network ranges to the DHCP pool.
* Configure the default DNS server
Use the dns-server command to set the IP addresses of the default DNS servers.
* Configure the default route
Use the default-router command to set the default route of DHCP clients.
* Enable the DHCP Server
Use the service DHCP command to enable the DHCP Server.

===DHCP and firewalls===
Firewalls usually have to permit DHCP traffic explicitly. Specification of the DHCP client-server protocol describes several cases when packets must have the source address of &lt;tt&gt;0x00000000&lt;/tt&gt; or the destination address of &lt;tt&gt;0xffffffff&lt;/tt&gt;. Anti-spoofing policy rules and tight inclusive firewalls often stop such packets. Multi-homed DHCP servers require special consideration and further complicate configuration.

To allow DHCP, network administrators need to allow several types of packets through the server-side firewall. All DHCP packets travel as UDP datagrams; all client-sent packets have source port 68 and destination port 67; all server-sent packets have source port 67 and destination port 68. For example, a server-side firewall should allow the following types of packets:
* Incoming packets from 0.0.0.0 or dhcp-pool to dhcp-ip
* Incoming packets from any address to 255.255.255.255
* Outgoing packets from dhcp-ip to dhcp-pool or 255.255.255.255
where ''dhcp-ip'' represents any address configured on a DHCP server host and ''dhcp-pool'' stands for the pool from which a DHCP server assigns addresses to clients

===Example in Cisco IOS Extended ACL===
The following entries are valid on a Cisco 3560 switch with enabled DHCP service. The ACL is applied to a routed interface, 10.32.73.129, on input. The subnet is 10.32.73.128/26.
 10 permit udp host 0.0.0.0 eq bootpc host 10.32.73.129 eq bootps
 20 permit udp 10.32.73.128 0.0.0.63 eq bootpc host 10.32.73.129 eq bootps
 30 permit udp any eq bootpc host 255.255.255.255 eq bootps

===Technical details===
[[Image:DHCP_session_en.svg|thumb|Schema of a typical DHCP session]]

DHCP uses the same two IANA assigned ports as BOOTP: 67/udp for the server side, and 68/udp for the client side.

DHCP operations fall into four basic phases. These phases are IP lease request, IP lease offer, IP lease selection, and IP lease acknowledgement.

====DHCP discovery====
The client broadcasts on the local physical subnet to find available servers. Network administrators can configure a local router to forward DHCP packets to a DHCP server on a different subnet. This client-implementation creates a UDP packet with the broadcast destination of 255.255.255.255 or subnet broadcast address.

A client can also request its last-known IP address (in the example below, 192.168.1.100). If the client is still in a network where this IP is valid, the server might grant the request. Otherwise, it depends whether the server is set up as  authoritative or not. An authoritative server will deny the request, making the client ask for a new IP immediately. A non-authoritative server simply ignores the request, leading to an implementation dependent time out for the client to give up on the request and ask for a new IP.

&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

====DHCP offers====
When a DHCP server receives an IP lease request from a client, it extends an IP lease offer. This is done by reserving an IP address for the client and sending a DHCPOFFER message across the network to the client. This message contains the client's MAC address, followed by the IP address that the server is offering, the subnet mask, the lease duration, and the IP address of the DHCP server making the offer.

The server determines the configuration, based on the client's hardware address as specified in the CHADDR field. Here the server, 192.168.1.1, specifies the IP address in the YIADDR field.

&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;&lt;caption&gt;DHCPOFFER&lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;DHCP option 54: 192.168.1.1 DHCP server&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

====DHCP requests====
The client selects a configuration out of the DHCP &quot;Offer&quot; packets it has received and broadcasts it on the local subnet. Again, this client requests the 192.168.1.100 address that the server specified.  In case the client has received multiple offers it specifies the server from which it has accepted the offer.

====DHCP acknowledgement====

When the DHCP server receives the DHCPREQUEST message from the client, it initiates the final phase of the configuration process. This acknowledgement phase involves sending a DHCPACK packet to the client. This packet includes the lease duration and any other configuration information that the client might have requested. At this point, the TCP/IP configuration process is complete.

The server acknowledges the request and sends the acknowledgement to the client. The system as a whole expects the client to configure its network interface with the supplied options.

&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

====DHCP selection====
When the client PC receives an IP lease offer, it must tell all the other DHCP servers that it has accepted an offer. To do this, the client broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST message containing the IP address of the server that made the offer. When the other DHCP servers receive this message, they withdraw any offers that they might have made to the client. They then return the address that they had reserved for the client back to the pool of valid addresses that they can offer to another computer. Any number of DHCP servers can respond to an IP lease request, but the client can only accept one offer per network interface card.

====DHCP information====
The client sends a request to the DHCP server: either to request more information than the server sent with the original DHCPACK; or to repeat data for a particular application - for example, browsers use ''DHCP Inform'' to obtain web proxy settings via WPAD.  Such queries do not cause the DHCP server to refresh the IP expiry time in its database.

====DHCP releasing====
The client sends a request to the DHCP server to release the DHCP and the client unconfigures its IP address. As clients usually do not know when users may unplug them from the network, the protocol does not define the sending of ''DHCP Release'' as mandatory.

==e-mail==
Email is composed of two types of protocols: Server to Server and Client to Server.

===Server to Server===
'''Simple Mail Transfer Protocol''' ('''SMTP''') is the ''de facto'' standard for e-mail transmissions across the Internet. Formally SMTP is defined in RFC 821 (STD 10) as amended by RFC 1123 (STD 3) chapter 5. The protocol used today is also known as ESMTP and defined in RFC 2821.

SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, where one or more recipients of a message are specified (and in most cases verified to exist) and then the message text is transferred. It is quite easy to test an SMTP server using the telnet program (see below).

SMTP uses TCP port 25. To determine the SMTP server for a given domain name, the MX (Mail eXchange) DNS record is typically used, falling back to a simple A record in the case of no MX (not all MTAs (Mail Transfer Agents) support fallback). Some current mail transfer agents will also use SRV records, a more general form of MX, though these are not widely adopted.

===Client to Server===
SMTP is a &quot;push&quot; protocol that does not allow one to &quot;pull&quot; messages from a remote server on demand. To do this a mail client must use POP3 or IMAP. Another SMTP server can trigger a delivery in SMTP using ETRN.

POP3 has made earlier versions of the protocol obsolete, POP (informally called POP1) and POP2.  In contemporary usage, the less precise term ''POP'' almost always means ''POP3'' in the context of e-mail protocols.

The design of POP3 and its procedures supports end-users with intermittent connections (such as dial-up connections), allowing these users to retrieve e-mail when connected and then to view and manipulate the retrieved messages without needing to stay connected. Although most clients have an option to ''leave mail on server'', e-mail clients using POP3 generally connect, retrieve all messages, store them on the user's PC as new messages, delete them from the server, and then disconnect. In contrast, the newer, more capable Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) supports both ''connected'' and ''disconnected'' modes of operation.
E-mail clients using IMAP generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them.
This and other facets of IMAP operation allow multiple clients to access the same mailbox.
Most e-mail clients support either POP3 or IMAP to retrieve messages; however, fewer Internet Service Providers (ISPs) support IMAP.
The fundamental difference between POP3 and IMAP4 is that POP3 offers access to a mail drop; the mail exists on the server until it is collected by the client.  Even if the client leaves some or all messages on the server, the client's message store is considered authoritative.  In contrast, IMAP4 offers access to the mail store; the client may store local copies of the messages, but these are considered to be a temporary cache; the server's store is authoritative.

==Web==
'''Hypertext Transfer Protocol''' ('''HTTP''') is a method used to transfer or convey information on the World Wide Web. Its original purpose was to provide a way to publish and retrieve HTML pages.

Development of HTTP was coordinated by the W3C and the IETF, culminating in the publication of a series of RFCs, most notably RFC 2616 (1999), which defines HTTP/1.1, the version of HTTP in common use today.

HTTP is a request/response protocol between clients and servers. The originating client, such as a web browser, spider, or other end-user tool, is referred to as the user agent. The destination server, which stores or creates resources such as HTML files and images, is called the origin server. In between the user agent and origin server may be several intermediaries, such as proxies, gateways, and tunnels.

An HTTP client initiates a request by establishing a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to a particular port on a remote host (port 80 by default; see [[w:List of TCP and UDP port numbers|Wikipedia's list of port numbers]]). An HTTP server listening on that port waits for the client to send a request message. 

Upon receiving the request, the server sends back a status line, such as &quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&quot;, and a message of its own, the body of which is perhaps the requested file, an error message, or some other information.

Resources to be accessed by HTTP are identified using URIs (or, more specifically, those using the &lt;tt&gt;http:&lt;/tt&gt; or https URI schemes.

===Request message===
The request message consists of the following:

* Request line, such as &lt;tt&gt;GET /images/logo.gif HTTP/1.1&lt;/tt&gt;, which requests the file &lt;tt&gt;logo.gif&lt;/tt&gt; from the &lt;tt&gt;/images&lt;/tt&gt; directory
* Headers, such as &lt;tt&gt;Accept-Language: en&lt;/tt&gt;
* An empty line
* An optional message body

The request line and headers must all end with CRLF (''i.e.'' a carriage return followed by a line feed). The empty line must consist of only CRLF and no other whitespace.

In the HTTP/1.1 protocol, all headers except Host are optional.

===Request methods===
HTTP defines eight methods (sometimes referred to as &quot;verbs&quot;) indicating the desired action to be performed on the identified resource.

; HEAD
: Asks for the response identical to the one that would correspond to a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.
; GET
: Requests a representation of the specified resource. By far the most common method used on the Web today. Should not be used for operations that cause side-effects (using it for actions in web applications is a common misuse). See 'safe methods' below. 
; POST
: Submits data to be processed (e.g. from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both.
; PUT
: Uploads a representation of the specified resource.
; DELETE
: Deletes the specified resource.
; TRACE
: Echoes back the received request, so that a client can see what intermediate servers are adding or changing in the request.
; OPTIONS
: Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server.
; CONNECT
: For use with a proxy that can change to being an SSL tunnel.

HTTP servers are supposed to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods and, whenever possible, also the OPTIONS method.

=Transport Layer=
The '''transport layer''' is the second highest layer in the TCP/IP reference model. It responds to service requests from the [[CCNA_Certification/Application_Layer|application layer]] and issues service requests to the [[CCNA_Certification/Application_Layer|network layer]]. It is also the name of layer four of the seven layer [[CCNA_Certification/The_OSI_Model|OSI model]], where it responds to service requests from the [[CCNA_Certification/The_OSI_Model#Session_layer|session layer]] and issues service requests to the network layer. The definitions of the transport layer are slightly different in these two models. The following text primarily refers to the TCP/IP model.

The transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between hosts. It is usually responsible for end-to-end connection, error recovery, flow control, and ensuring complete data transfer. In the Internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) this function is most commonly achieved by the connection oriented [[#TCP|Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP).  The datagram-type transport, [[#UDP|User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP), provides neither error recovery nor flow control, leaving these to the [[CCNA_Certification/Application_Layer|application]].  The purpose of the Transport layer is to provide transparent transfer of data between end users, thus relieving the upper layers from any concern with providing reliable and cost-effective data transfer. 

The transport layer usually turns the unreliable and very basic service provided by the Network layer into a more powerful one. There is a long list of services that can be optionally provided at this level. None of them are compulsory, because not all applications want all the services available. Some can be wasted overhead, or even counterproductive in some cases.

; Connection-oriented: This is normally easier to deal with than connection-less models, so where the Network layer only provides a connection-less service, often a connection-oriented service is built on top of that in the Transport layer.
; Same Order Delivery: The Network layer doesn't generally guarantee that packets of data will arrive in the same order that they were sent, but often this is a desirable feature, so the Transport layer provides it. The simplest way of doing this is to give each packet a number, and allow the receiver to reorder the packets.
; Reliable Data: Packets may be lost in routers, switches, bridges and hosts due to network congestion, when the packet queues are filled and the network nodes have to delete packets. Packets may be lost or corrupted in for example Ethernet due to interference and noise, since Ethernet does not retransmit corrupt packets. Packets may be delivered in the wrong order by an underlying network. Some transport layer protocols, for example TCP, can fix this. By means of an error detection code, for example a checksum, the transport protocol may check that the data is not corrupted, and verify that by sending an ACK message to the sender. Automatic repeat request schemes may be used to retransmit lost or corrupted data. By introducing segment numbering in the transport layer packet headers, the packets can be sorted in order. Of course, error free is impossible, but it is possible to substantially reduce the numbers of undetected errors. 
; Flow Control: The amount of memory on a computer is limited, and without flow control a larger computer might flood a computer with so much information that it can't hold it all before dealing with it. Nowadays, this is not a big issue, as memory is cheap while bandwidth is comparatively expensive, but in earlier times it was more important. Flow control allows the receiver to say &quot;Whoa!&quot; before it is overwhelmed. Sometimes this is already provided by the network, but where it is not, the Transport layer may add it on. 
; Congestion avoidance: Network congestion occurs when a queue buffer of a network node is full and starts to drop packets. Automatic repeat request may keep the network in a congested state. This situation can be avoided by adding congestion avoidance to the flow control, including slow-start. This keeps the bandwidth consumption at a low level in the beginning of the transmission, or after packet retransmission. 
; Byte orientation: Rather than dealing with things on a packet-by-packet basis, the Transport layer may add the ability to view communication just as a stream of bytes. This is nicer to deal with than random packet sizes, however, it rarely matches the communication model which will normally be a sequence of messages of user defined sizes.
; Ports: (Part of the transport layer in the TCP/IP model, but of the session layer in the OSI model) Ports are essentially ways to address multiple entities in the same location. For example, the first line of a postal address is a kind of port, and distinguishes between different occupants of the same house. Computer applications will each listen for information on their own ports, which is why you can use more than one network-based application at the same time.

On the Internet there are a variety of Transport services, but the two most common are TCP and UDP. TCP is the more complicated, providing a connection and byte oriented stream which is almost error free, with flow control, multiple ports, and same order delivery. UDP is a very simple 'datagram' service, which provides limited error reduction and multiple ports. TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, while UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol.  Other options are the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) and  Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).

Some things, such as connection orientation can be implemented at either Transport or Network layer. The idea is that the Network layer implements whatever set of options is easiest: for some underlying networks it is easiest to implement connectionless communication, while for others it is easiest to implement connection oriented communication. The Transport layer uses this simplest set of options to implement whatever combinations of options are actually desired.

==TCP==
The '''Transmission Control Protocol''' ('''TCP''') is one of the core protocols of the Internet protocol suite, often simply referred to as TCP/IP. Using TCP, applications on networked hosts can create ''connections'' to one another, over which they can exchange streams of data using Stream Sockets. The protocol guarantees reliable and in-order delivery of data from sender to receiver. TCP also distinguishes data for multiple connections by concurrent applications (''e.g.'', Web server and e-mail server) running on the same host.

TCP supports many of the Internet's most popular application protocols and resulting applications, including the World Wide Web, e-mail, File Transfer Protocol and Secure Shell.

In the Internet protocol suite, TCP is the intermediate layer between the Internet Protocol (IP) below it, application above it. Applications often need reliable pipe-like connections to each other, whereas the Internet Protocol does not provide such streams, but rather only best effort delivery (''i.e.'', unreliable packets). TCP does the task of the transport layer in the simplified OSI model of computer networks.  The other main transport-level Internet protocol is UDP.

Applications send streams of octets (8-bit bytes) to TCP for delivery through the network, and TCP divides the byte stream into appropriately sized segments (usually delineated by the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of the [[CCNA Certification/Data_Link_Layer|data link layer]] of the network to which the computer is attached). TCP then passes the resulting packets to the Internet Protocol, for delivery through a network to the TCP module of the entity at the other end. TCP checks to make sure that no packets are lost by giving each packet a ''sequence number'', which is also used to make sure that the data are delivered to the entity at the other end in the correct order. The TCP module at the far end sends back an ''acknowledgment'' for packets which have been successfully received; a timer at the sending TCP will cause a ''timeout'' if an acknowledgment is not received within a reasonable round-trip time ( RTT), and the (presumably lost) data will then be ''re-transmitted''. The TCP checks that no bytes are damaged by using a checksum; one is computed at the sender for each block of data before it is sent, and checked at the receiver.

==UDP==
The '''User Datagram Protocol''' ('''UDP''') is one of the core protocols of the Internet protocol suite. Using UDP, programs on networked computers can send short messages sometimes known as ''datagrams'' to one another. UDP is sometimes called the '''Universal Datagram Protocol''' or Unreliable Datagram Protocol.

UDP does not provide the reliability and ordering that TCP does. Datagrams may arrive out of order, appear duplicated, or go missing without notice. Without the overhead of checking whether every packet actually arrived, UDP is faster and more efficient for many lightweight or time-sensitive purposes. Also, its stateless nature is useful for servers that answer small queries from huge numbers of clients. Compared to TCP, UDP is required for Broadcasting (send to all on local network) and multicast (send to all subscribers).

Common network applications that use UDP include the Domain Name System (DNS), streaming media applications such as IPTV, [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) and online games.

==Ports==

UDP utilizes ports to allow application-to-application communication.
The port field is 16-bits so the valid range is 0 to 65,535.
Port 0 is reserved, but is a permissible source port value if the sending process does not expect messages in response.

Ports 1 through 1023 are named &quot;well-known&quot; ports and on [[Unix]]-derived operating systems binding to one of these ports requires root access.

Ports 1024 through 49,151 are registered ports.

Ports 49,152 through 65,535 are ephemeral ports and are used as temporary ports primarily by clients when communicating to servers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Below is the proof of the '''Normal Equations''' for OLS.

&lt;math&gt;        = \sum (Y_i - \hat{\alpha} - \hat{\beta} X_i)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

=Differentiate the RSS (so that we can then minimise it)=
&lt;math&gt; min_{\alpha} \sum \hat{\epsilon_i}^2&lt;/math&gt; =

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \sum \hat{\epsilon_i}^2}{\partial \hat{\alpha}} = \sum 2 \hat{\epsilon_i}\frac{\partial \hat{\epsilon_i}}{\partial \hat{\alpha}}  = 2 \sum \hat{\epsilon_i} (-1) = 2 \sum (Y_i - \hat{\alpha} - \hat{\beta} X_i) (-1) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;min_{\beta} \sum \hat{\epsilon_i}^2&lt;/math&gt; =

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \sum \hat{\epsilon_i}^2}{\partial \hat{\beta}} = \sum 2 \hat{\epsilon_i} \frac{\partial \hat{\epsilon_i}}{\partial \hat{\beta}} = 2 \sum \hat{\epsilon_i} (-X_i) = 2 \sum (Y_i - \hat{\alpha} - \hat{\beta} X_i) (-X_i) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

So we have two equations:

&lt;math&gt; \sum (Y_i -  \hat{\alpha} - \hat{\beta} X_i) (-1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;
 \sum (Y_i - \hat{\alpha} - \hat{\beta} X_i) (-X_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
(The two(2) here is divided from both sides)

setting them both equal to &lt;math&gt;\sum Y_i&lt;/math&gt;

We get 

&lt;math&gt;\sum Y_i = n \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta} \sum X_i &lt;/math&gt; 
(This is the first OLS Normal Equation)

and 

&lt;math&gt; \sum Y_i X_i = \hat{\alpha} \sum X_i + \hat{\beta}\sum X_i^2&lt;/math&gt;
(This is the second OLS Normal Equation)

=Solve the Normal Equations=

Divide the first equation by n


&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n} \sum Y_i = \hat{\alpha} + \frac{1}{n}\hat{\beta} \sum X_i&lt;/math&gt;

Leaves us with &lt;math&gt;\left( \sum W_i \frac{1}{n} = \bar{W} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \bar{Y} = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta} \bar{X} \Leftrightarrow \hat{\alpha} = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta} \bar{X}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we know how to get α(hat), we can work on β(hat)


&lt;math&gt; \sum Y_i X_i = \hat{\alpha} \sum X_i + \hat{\beta}\sum X_i^2 = [\bar{Y} - \hat{\beta} \bar{X}] \sum X_i + \hat{\beta}\sum X_i^2 = [\frac{(\sum X_i)(\sum Y_i)}{n}] + \hat{\beta}[\sum X_i^2 - \frac{(\sum X_i)^2}{n}]&lt;/math&gt;

We can move β(hat) to one side

&lt;math&gt; \hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum Y_i X_i -\frac{(\sum X_i)(\sum Y_i)}{n}}{\sum X^2_i - \frac{(\sum X_i)^2}{n}} = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x} )(y_i - \bar{y}) } {\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

- n \bar{X} \bar{Y}

And now we have our Normal equations for OLS.

Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we are able to solve for them (&lt;math&gt;\hat{\alpha} , \hat{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;).
&lt;!-------------------------------------- Show the two deviation-from-means form too. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Matrices==
A matrix is an array of numbers arranged into rows and columns.  Some examples of matrices are,

&lt;math&gt;A=
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 4 &amp; 6 \\ 0 &amp; -5 &amp; 7.105\\ 1 &amp; -3 &amp; 2
\end{bmatrix}
,\quad
B=
\begin{bmatrix}
	-3 &amp; -4 \\ \pi &amp; \sqrt{2}
\end{bmatrix}
,\mbox{ and }\,\,\,
C=
\begin{bmatrix}
	-3 &amp; -5 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ -1 &amp; 4.56 &amp; 3.28 &amp; 19
\end{bmatrix}
.&lt;/math&gt;

When describing matrices we indicate the number of rows first, then the number of columns.  For example, the matrix &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with two rows and four columns is said to be a &lt;math&gt;2\times 4&lt;/math&gt; matrix.

It is standard notation to name matrices with capital letters and to use lower case letters with subscripts to identify particular entries in a matrix.

For example, to identify the entry in row 1 and column 3 of matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; we would write  &lt;math&gt;a_{13}&lt;/math&gt;. To indicate that this entry is a six we would write the equation &lt;math&gt;a_{13}=6&lt;/math&gt;.

Two matrices are considered to be 
'''equal''' only if they are the same size and every pair of corresponding elements are equal.

A '''column matrix''' is a matrix with only one column.  Similarly, a '''row matrix''' has only one row.
==Vectors==
A '''vector''' is an object often defined by a long list of properties.  However, for now we will avoid the more complicated definition, and just say that a vector is an ordered list of numbers.  Later we will see that vectors can really be much more.

An ordered pair, &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;, that is used to identify a point in the plane can be considered to be a vector.

Similarly, an ordered triple, &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector.

Obviously, row and column matrices can also be considered to be a vector.

It is common to name vectors using variables with arrows above.  

For example, we might write
&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}=(2, 3, 5, -4),\mbox{ or } \vec{w}=
\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ 0 
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

For the most part, it will convenient to think of vectors as column matrices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Identity Matrix==
The identity matrix, with a size of ''n'', is an ''n''-by-''n'' square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. It is commonly denoted as &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt;, or simply by ''I'' if the size is immaterial or can be easily determined by the context.
:&lt;math&gt;I_1=[1] \quad I_2=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} \quad I_3=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} \quad I_n=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The most important property of the identity matrix is that, when multiplied by another matrix, ''A'', the result will be ''A''
:&lt;math&gt;AI_n=A\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_n A=A\,&lt;/math&gt;.

This wikibook needs some serious editing. The section mentioned in the title has various missing spaces, bad grammar, mixed use of cases and missing referenced figures.

: I intend to (among other things) update the spanning tree section as one of my next projects. I'm not too happy with the majority of the content in this book. For example, it refers to 'spanning tree bridges' as if there is such a thing as a bridge that doesn't implement the spanning tree protocol these days. I have a feeling large swathes of this are going to need to be rewritten. I'm happy to discuss this with anyone who's interested in this book. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 21:39, 2 March 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Learning as an Internally Reconstructible Sequence of Stages of Competence ({{H:title|middle of 2nd paragraph on p.3|p. 3.2.mid}}) ==

Habermas’s view is that, to understand the cognitive and moral stages of development experienced by a person or a society, one must take an internal position and reconstruct the presupposed structures that people employ in their learning experiences.  An external observer can see the contents and uses of learning experienced by that person or culture, but cannot understand the experience itself. Nor can one infer the experience of individual development from an observation of higher stages of cultural cognitive and moral development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Distinction between Realist and Phenomenological Approaches ({{H:title|p. 11, 2nd paragraph, middle|11.2.mid.}}) ==

In the realist perspective, objects are assumed to exist as givens, without explanation.  Goal-oriented action, and associated kinds of knowledge, build upon these givens.  The phenomenological perspective begins, rather, with communication, and treats the putatively objective world as something whose raw reality is not questioned but whose import is determined in communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Argumentation vs. Force ({{H:title|p. 18, paragraph 1|18.1}}) ==

In some instances, people cannot repair disagreements by relying on everyday routines, and must instead choose between argumentation and the potential or actual use of force.  Argumentation is a practice that is ultimately based upon reason, in the sense that the rationality of the participants in an argument is determined by whether they could, if necessary, under suitable circumstances, provide reasons for their expressions. Reasons that count for this purpose may include any of three different kinds of rational expressions and their corresponding speech acts:  objective (constative speech acts), normative (imperative speech acts), or subjective (expressive or preference speech acts).

The potential or actual use of force (i.e., the negation of argumentation) occurs when the situation fails to supply the necessary conditions -- the regulating principles -- for a communicative setting in which reasons can be given and discussed. Those conditions include the presence of people who, at the time, share equal social status, autonomy, and responsibility, and are open to criticism and willing to discuss reasons rather than assert dogmas.  These conditions are the compenents of an ideal speech situation which, though rarely encountered in daily life, is tacitly understood as the ideal for communication -- which, that is, if not understood by one or more parties, negates their capability to participate in reasoned argumentation.  It is the limit case in the sense that perfection is a limit case:  within its specified criteria, one cannot exceed it.

According to the foregoing comments, an example would arise where the professor does not threaten or command, but simply asserts and repeats dogma (e.g., &quot;An ethnography class is always essential&quot;).  Even without that, the mere disparity in social status and autonomy between professor and student typically limit the latter’s freedom to offer a spirited, self-respecting defense, such that almost any diagreement between a professor and student on a curricular matter would tend to transgress one or more of the foregoing regulating principles, though it seems unlikely that all such transgressions would be thematized (i.e., made a theme, in itself, of the ensuing discussion) -- that, indeed, it could be risky for the student to do so.

== Strategic and Communicative Action ({{H:title|p. 18, paragraph 1|18.1}}) ==

Strategic action seeks to get something from others, as distinct from being honest.  Absent sincerity, an expression of a subjective state fails to raise a claim of validity, and thus, unlike communicative action, is not a candidate for theoretical or practical discourse.  An example arises when a person says that s/he enjoys something that, in fact, s/he does not, and is saying so only for purposes of creating an image of him/herself in the mind of the listener.

== Grounding Is Interwoven with Learning ({{H:title|p. 18, bottom paragraph, line 3|18.bot.3}}) ==

Truth claims are assertions about objective states of affairs.  As such, they are a subset of validity claims, which also include normative and subjective rational expressions.  Habermas understands &quot;theoretical discourse&quot; to be argumentation in which truth claims are thematized and discussed, and &quot;moral-practical discourse&quot; to be argumentation in which normative claims are thematized and discussed.  Reasons advanced in argumentation may include objective, normative, or subjective expressions, all of which are (or perhaps have at least the potential to be) rational.

I am not certain, however, whether theoretical, moral-practical, and subjective forms of discourse are all capable of being grounded. All three are falsifiable (by e.g., pointing out that my allegation of a subjective state of mind does not square with my outward affect), and as such are a subset of validity claims.  But the significance of falsifiability is that the expression in question &quot;therewith has a relation to the objective world (that is, a relation to the facts) and is open to objective judgment&quot; (TCA1, p. 9).  To say that a normative or subjective expression &quot;satisfies the precondition for rationality if and insofar as&quot; it has this connection to objectivity (id.) seems tantamount to saying that a speech act is rational only to the extent that directly, or by objectification, it places the objective world in the foreground).  Certainly an objective expression is &quot;susceptible of criticism and grounding&quot; (TCA1, p. 9) in this sense; but it seems that a normative or subjective expression is not, per se, but rather than that it can be made to be so through objectification -- when, that is, it is supported with objective, real-world reasons that supply its grounds (TCA1 p. 39).

Grounding is interwoven with learning, in that learning depends upon the ability to successfully identify one’s mistakes and learn from them, and also from the refutation of hypotheses and the failure of interventions (TCA1, p. 18). In studies of cultures, it seems that all three of those aspects of learning are implicated, insofar as one must learn to think as the people being studied think.  Similarly, in a developmental context, Habermas believes that learning is best understood as an internal progression through stages of competence, whether in person-physical (Piaget) or moral practical (Kohlberg) terms.  The emphasis upon internality appears to indicate that the study of development is best done, not as an externalist series of judgments upon the person’s relative capacity for a given kind of knowledge or performance, but rather as an internalist, phenomenological understanding of what it is like to be him/her at that time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Redeeming Validity Claims ({{H:title|p. 19, paragraph 2, line 4|19.2.4}}) ==

To redeem a validity claim is to objectify it. A normative validity claim is &quot;redeemed&quot; through objectification and argumentation, it appears, in the sense that it is made a theme of discussion and objective reasons are given for it. One might argue, alternately, that the normative validity claim is thereby redeemed only in a sense of interest to an empiricist -- that, rather, Habermas rejects the per se legitimacy of the normative claim unless and until it can be objectified and, thereby, thematized in terms satisfactory for purposes of empiricist argument.

Practical discourse is the medium in which we can hypothetically test whether a norm can be impartially justified.  In practical discourse, claims to normative rightness are thematized.  The reference to &quot;impartial&quot; justification, consistent with the restriction of rational discourse to objectified expressions, and the difficulty of identifying any other means of ultimately grounding normative claims, collectively seem to imply that there is no way in which practical discourse can avoid being largely assimilated into theoretical discourse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cultural Values, Norms of Action, and Claims to Universality ({{H:title|p. 20, paragraph 1, line 8|20.1.8}}) == 

A normative expression makes a validity claim to the effect that a certain act is right or wrong. The meaning of that validity claim is, in part, the set of reasons that could be given in its support.  The imperative speech act citing a norm rests upon the claim that people should follow it. There may be a circle of intersubjective recognition (but not necessarily general assent) among some members of a culture regarding a cultural value.  Cultural values of the type Habermas has in mind are those that arise in &quot;the discussions of art, music, and literary criticism&quot; (TCA1, p. 20).  That is, they are not values of a culture (e.g., Hispanic); they are simply values of culture (i.e., &quot;high&quot; culture, e.g., oenophilia). The values expressed in such contexts may be advanced, but are typically not successfully defended, as universals.

A cultural value becomes a normative value to the extent that its proponent suggests that it does indeed apply to others generally. The question appears to be, then, whether a personal value crosses the line into normative territory when, &quot;if occasion arises,&quot; others begin to critique it. But I think that people do generally -- indeed, almost invariably -- internally critique personal values expressed by others, regardless of whether those values consist of personal reflections on (high) culture or on less commonly approved phenomena.

I would construe the rotten apples example as an instance of &quot;one’s own desires and inclinations&quot; (TCA1, p. 21) -- which, in the reference to desires, seems to me to be a continuation of the concept of the reference to desires on page 20.  That is, on page 21 Habermas seems to be addressing the case of self-deception, but without seeming to depart from his attention to cultural values.

On page 19, Habermas distinguished the objectivist perspective of theoretical discourse from the internalist approach that people do (and/or should?) adopt toward personal values (i.e., &quot;interpreted needs and wants&quot;) in practical discourse.  In the internalist, personal context of value claims, there is presumably neither attempt nor desire to bind others to any common standard capable of being argued over in theoretical discourse.

Foreword

The Vietnamese language is spoken by over 80 million people in Vietnam and a few more million in other countries. It is of great interest to foreigners who want to communicate with Vietnamese people and know Vietnam’s culture. More and more people, especially those from English speaking countries, attends Vietnamese courses. For the time being, there is a variety of Vietnamese coursebooks designed for different levels of learners. In using these books in our teaching, VTG’s tutors, however, find them not very effective for learners to follow. Therefore, the tutors in VTG have made great efforts to produce a new coursebook basing on our experience and the available course books as references. At this time, we just compose the book for beginners.

The book is designed to enable learners to perceive the language better and use it naturally in daily practical situations.It includes 10 units covering familiar topics designed for learners from beginners to higher levels.
In preparing this course book, it might be impossible to avoid all imperfections, we highly appreciate any feedback or suggestions from all users for future revision of this book. If it is a success, VTG will continue to develop higher-level course books to meet the need of learners.

 II. Tonemes in the Vietnamese sound system
    The standard Vietnamese language has six tones. Their fuction is to distinguish   
    the meaning of different words. They are often placed right above the single vowel (exept Ụ)
    or main stressed vowels in vowel clusters such as: 
                                chuyển, hóa, rượu, yếu

   and never appear on the consonants.

'''Tabasco sauce''' is a tangy hot sauce made from tabasco [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]], [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], then aged in wine barrels. It has been made by the McIlhenny Company of Lousiana, USA, since 1868.

Since &quot;Tabasco&quot; is a trademarked name, similar sauces made by other companies are known as &quot;Louisiana hot sauce&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Definition''' ==


Beta blockers, also known as beta antagonists, are a class of drugs that were first developed for the treatment of certain heart conditions and hypertension. Later, beta blockers were also found to be useful in glaucoma, migraine, and some psychiatric disorders such as performance anxiety, tremors secondary to lithium, and movement disorders that are caused by some drugs used in the treatment of psychosis. In the United States, the most commonly used beta blocker used in psychiatric practice is propranolol (Inderal). Nadolol (Corgard), metoprolol (Lopressor), and atenolol (Tenormin) are also used in psychiatric practice but to a lesser degree.


'''Purpose'''

Beta blockers are proven effective in the treatment of performance anxiety, lithium-induced tremor, and neuroleptic-induced akathisia (a physical condition caused by certain antipsychotic drugs). Beta blockers have sometimes been used with benzodiazepines in treating alcohol withdrawal.


'''Description'''

Beta blockers act on that part of the central nervous system that controls mental alertness, lung function, heart rate, and blood vessels. Although there is more than one mechanism by which beta blockers work in anxiety states, the most beneficial result probably arises from the fact that beta blockers slow the heart to a normal rate and rhythm. Therefore, persons with performance anxiety do not experience the usual chest tightness and rapid heart rate that is associated with such acts as public speaking or acting.

Certain antipsychotic medications known as neuroleptics can cause an unwanted effect called akathisia, which is the inability to sit, stand still, or remain inactive. Patients are restless, and in severe cases, may pace constantly and forcefully and repeatedly stomp their feet. Beta blockers can sometimes treat this condition with a lower incidence of side effects than any other drugs used to treat this condition.

Propranolol is available in 10- to 90-mg tablets. Nadolol is available in 20-, 40-, 80-, 120-, and 160-mg tablets. Atenolol is available in 50- and 100-mg tablets. Metoprolol is available in 50- and 100-mg tablets.


'''Recommended dosage'''

For the treatment of performance anxiety, sometimes called stage fright, a single dose of propranolol ranging from 10–40 mg is given 20–30 minutes before the event causing the unwanted reactions.

For lithium-induced tremors that cannot be controlled by reducing caffeine intake or administering the dosage of lithium at bedtime, propranolol at a dose of 20–160 mg daily can be given in two or three evenly divided doses.

For akathisia caused by antipsychotic medications, propranolol can be administered at doses of 10–30 mg three times daily.


'''Precautions'''

Because of their ability to narrow airways, beta blockers, especially propranolol, should not be taken by people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). If there is an urgent need to use beta blockers in persons with respiratory problems, atenolol or metoprolol are the beta-blockers of choice because they are less likely to have this side effect, although even these drugs should also be used with caution. Patients with congestive heart failure or certain cardiac conduction abnormalities such as a heart block, should also receive these drugs with caution.

Beta blockers should be used with close physician monitoring in people with diabetes, since the symptoms of low blood sugar (increased heart rate, lightheadedness, and abnormal perspiration) may be not be recognized by patients.


'''Side effects'''

Beta blockers can cause undesired decreases in blood pressure and are typically not given if blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg or less.

Beta blockers can also cause an undesired drop in heart rate. People whose resting heart rate is less than 55 beats per minute should not take beta blockers.

Occasionally, beta blockers can cause heart depression, bronchoconstriction, impotence, fatigue, depression, bradycaardia, rash, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and stomach discomfort.

Beta blockers should be discontinued by patient to reduce the likelihood of angina.


'''Interactions'''

Each medication in the class of beta blockers has the potential to interact with a multitude of other medications. Anyone starting beta blocker therapy should review the other medications they are taking with their physician and pharmacist for possible interactions. Patients should always inform all their health care providers, including dentists, that they are taking beta blockers.

Unlike Wikipedia or Wiktionary&amp;mdash;which are essentially very large books with a single manual of style&amp;mdash;the individual books found on Wikibooks can be written in vastly different styles, according to what best suits the topic and the preference of the authors.

# The first thing to note is that there is a [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]]. Before you write a manual of style for a new book you probably should have read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]].
# It may be useful to imagine the [[#Basic structure|structure of the book]] before you begin or to create a draft as a sub-page of your user page.
# If the book should have unique recurring [[#Other Stylistic Concerns|style elements]], like boxes for exercises or anecdotes, these elements should be available as [[#Templates|templates]] and be listed and explained in the manual of style.
# If the book should have a strategy for [[#Categories|content grouping]] or [[#Navigation|navigation]] this strategy should be explained in the manual of style.
# If the book should have certain requirements for the creation of further [[#Images|artwork or pictures]] that should be mentioned in the manual of style.
# A book with many authors can become inconsistent if some authors agree on a certain [[#Language|writing style]] and some authors do not follow that style. A specific writing style should be described in the manual of style.
# A book that aims to follow a certain didactic approach may need special considerations from the contributing editors. The didactic approach, if any, should be explained in detail in the manual of style.

{{TOC|float=none|limit=2}}

==Purpose==
Wikibooks are normally a creation of many contributors, maintaining single &quot;voice&quot; and style, in order to provide users with a consistent experience when using the work becomes of extreme importance. It is something that should be considered before it becomes a burden to the collaboration and a defining factor for the overall quality of the work.

While the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] has a few tips that apply to all books,
each individual Wikibook typically has its own local manual of style that attempts to describe the desired &quot;voice&quot; and explains how to use book-specific templates and other helpful tools that only apply to that one book.

== Language ==
When possible, books should attempt to be neutral to all English speakers, and not rely on mannerisms or language specific to one region. Books require a consistent use of language and so, somewhere along their evolution a decision needs to be made whether the book will rely on British English or American English, or whether to use a simple subset of either of those languages (like small words for children, [[w:simple:Main Page|simple english]], or [[w:E-Prime|E-Prime]], etc.).

==Basic structure==
===Flat structure (Book/chapters)===
The flat structure is often preferred, because it's easier to keep organised and to link to. &quot;Flat&quot; means that there is only one level of subpages (Book/chapter1, Book/chapter2).
;Advantages
:Allows for easy linking both within the book and from other books and projects.
:*From the main page, chapters can be linked to using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Chapter/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:*Within the book, chapters can be interlinked using the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../Chaptername/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, rather than using the full header.
:*From other books and projects, templates are much simpler if only one variable needs to be entered, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{See also [[Book/{{1}}]]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, etc.
;Disadvantages
:The automatic headers on the top of the page only lead to the main book page, rather than to section headings.

===Deep structure (Book/chapters/subchapters/subsubchapters/etc.)===
The deep structure has a stronger inherent organisation. &quot;Deep&quot; means that there are more than one level of subpages (Book/chapter1, Book/chapter1/section2, Book/chapter2/section5/page9).
;Advantages
:The organizational structure is &quot;built in&quot;, so that subchapters auto-link to main chapters, allowing for easier navigation within the book
;Disadvantages
:Linking between chapers, other books, and other projects can become more arduous
:Changing the position of a chapter in the book is more difficult than a single edit to the main book page. See [[Meta: Accidental linking and hard-wired category schemes]].
:Does not look as &quot;neat&quot; when printed out.

===Examples===

==Naming conventions==
===Use &quot;Name of this Chapter&quot;, &quot;Name of Section&quot;===
Most books (both on wikibooks and in print) capitalise all words except for articles and prepositions. 
;Advantages
:Looks better when printed, since it follows the standards of most published books.
;Disadvantages
:May be harder to link to.
===Use &quot;Name of chapter&quot;, &quot;Name of section&quot;===
Some books (both on wikibooks and in print) capitalise only the first letter of book and chapter titles 
;Advantages
:More familiar &quot;wiki&quot; style of naming, as established on Wikipedia
;Disadvantages
:Doesn't conform to normal book publishing styles.

===Examples===

==Page length restrictions==
===Restricted page length===
Some books may have a limit on page length (wikipedians for example try to limit page length for articles). 
;Advantages
:Limiting page length will make chapters easier to download for users with slow connection speeds.
:May be helpful to set an arbitrary limit on page length to give the book a more consistent feel.
;Disadvantages
:May bring about arbitrary section breaks that might otherwise not be warranted.

==Templates==
It's often helpful to use [[WB:Templates |templates]] for each chapter or page, in order to create a consistent structure. A template can create an outline using headers, infoboxes, and other features to make each chapter of a book resemble others. 
;Advantages
:Gives the book a consistent feel.
:It is much faster to make a change in a template than to edit every single page by hand.
;Disadvantages
:Can be limiting.
:Makes it more difficult for new contributors.

===All chapters follow a template?===
Some books may benefit from the use of standardized templates for the chapters.
;Advantages
:Makes it easier to ensure that every chapter follows the same format.
;Disadvantages
:Depending on the template, it may be harder to create variety across pages.
:Makes it more difficult for new contributors.

===Different templates for different types of chapters?===
Some books may use different templates for different types of pages. The [[Cookbook]], for example, uses different templates for recipes, ingredients, etc.
;Advantages
:Allows a more customized (yet consistent) style for pages that discuss general types of topics.
;Disadvantages
:Can make the book difficult for new contributors to get used to.

===Complex templates?===
Some very useful and attractive templates can be made using parser functions.
;Advantages
:Attractive and flexible.
;Disadvantages
:Difficult for inexperienced authors to use.

===Examples===

==Wikilinking==
===Use only intra-book piped links?===
Restricting links to only the chapters of a book makes the book &quot;self contained&quot;
;Advantages
:Keeps the book together, without needing to rely on external sources.
;Disadvantages
:Requires making a new page for every term
===Use cross-project links?===
Links can be made across wikimedia projects using prefixes within the brackets. w: leads to wikipedia, wikt: leads to wiktionary, etc.
;Advantages
:Allows easy explanations of terms
;Disadvantages
:Makes the book rely on other projects. If this kind of linking is done, authors should check periodically to make sure the destination page has not been moved.

===Restricted links?===
Books might use wikilinks for certain cases only, when the information being linked to is well beyond the scope of the book.

Many books restrict links outside the book to a &quot;Further reading&quot; section on each page.
Some go even further and restrict links outside the book to a single &quot;Bibliography and resources&quot; page.

;Advantages
:Makes the book comparatively self-contained, so it remains useful if the book is printed or the user has no internet connection.
;Disadvantages
:Links at the end of a page or section are not as easy for the reader to find as links that are included in the text of the book itself.

==Navigation==
===Use navigation templates?===
A [[WB:Templates/Navigation |navigation template]] can be used to create an index, table of contents, or other book features.
;Advantages
:It is easier to use a template to create a professional-quality navigation feature than trying to reinvent the wheel.
;Disadvantages
:Makes it more difficult for new contributors.

===Use an index?===
An index is a detailed list, usually arranged alphabetically, of the specific information in a book.
;Advantages
:Easier for the reader to find the information he or she is looking for.
;Disadvantages
:The index has to be compiled based on information from the book, and maintained as things are added or removed.

==Images==
===Fair use===
&quot;Fair use&quot; images are those that are copyrighted, but are considered to be fair game for public use.
;Advantages
:Allows for more images to be used than if fair use images are not acceptable for a book.
;Disadvantages
:Definitely a gray area of law, and it might be better to simply avoid using these .

===Commons only?===
Images used in wikibooks can either be stored in the wikibooks image namespace, or on commons. 
;Advantages
:By only using images that are on commons, it makes it easier for other projects to transwiki the book (e.g., if German Wikibooks wants to make a translation, they can copy it over without having to chase down the images).
:The images will likely be organised into galleries and/or categories on commons, which might lead the author to related and/or better images for the book.
;Disadvantages
:Fair use images are not permitted on commons.

===Use thumbnails?===
Thumbnails are small versions of an image, that can be expanded by clicking.
;Advantages
:Allows for many images to be placed on a page without taking up too much space or bandwidth.
;Disadvantages
:Thumbnails are often too small to be useful in printed versions.

==Categories==
===Use a single category for all book chapters?===
;Advantages
:Keeps the whole book &quot;in one place&quot;, so it's easy to keep track of.
;Disadvantages
:For larger books with more than 200 pages, the category page will be broken up.
:Limits the structure of the book

===Use subcategories within the book?===
;Advantages
:Helps to group together related sections of a particular book
;Disadvantages
:Makes it more difficult to see all chapters at once.

== Mathematical formulae ==
Many books in the mathematics, science, and engineering bookshelves make use of mathematical formulae. Also, these books will also frequently rely on various notations to denote different mathematical concepts. Whenever a book makes use of such formulae or notations, they should be consistent throughout the entire book.

For example, some books have a LMOS that recommends using &quot;2+3i&quot; vector notation, while other books have a LMOS that recommends using &quot;2+3j&quot; vector notation.

==Print versions==
Many books have a printable version, and some books even have multiple printable versions. Many books also include PDF versions for easy reading and downloading. Print versions should use page transclusions so that all updates to the main book pages are automatically reflected in the print version text. PDF versions should likely be updated on a regular basis, to stay consistent with the text. 

There are a number of specialized templates for use with print versions and PDF versions. For more information, see [[Help:Print versions]].

Print versions may typically want to use the &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; magic word to suppress the automatically generated TOC in the book. In this way, the printed version can produce its own TOC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Bits and pieces of user interface =

Although based on a &quot;thin client&quot;, ERP5 is a rich user interface which offers many functionalities. What is important is that the interface is uniform throughout the system, so if you know how to use Person module, you don't have to learn anything new when it comes to doing sales or accounting.

This section briefly describes various parts of user interface.

== Module view ==

Module view is what you see when you enter something from the home page - module is meant for storing some &quot;top-level&quot; objects, so the only thing a module shows is a list of something (persons, organisations, sale orders or something else). Usually all the objects a module contains are of the same type, sometimes of a few similar types (e.g. Accounting Transactions show four or five types of transactions).

When you are in a module - assume it is Persons - you see something like this:

[[Image:A_moduleview.png]]

Let's examine every part of this screen.

=== Menu bar ===


&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_favourites.png|200px]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Favourites''' 

This dropdown list shows some options which are either user-specific or related to administration of the ERP Site; most of them are - or will be - covered in other parts of this handbook or on erp5 wiki, like:
* [[ERP5_Handbook#Chapter:_Business_Templates|Business templates management]]
* [[ERP5_Handbook/Getting_Started#Workflows|Worklists]]
* [http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToUsePreferences Preferences]
* Creating and editing category trees

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_modules.png|200px]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Modules''' 

This is basically a navigation aid  - it lists all modules that are currently present in the system (and available for you to view), so that you don't have to go back to the site's main page to travel to another module.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_languages.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Languages''' 

This lists all translation packs that are currently installed, and allows you to change the user interface language whenever you feel like it.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_search.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Search box''' 

It is a quick, site-wide search facility; may require some additional configuration to work properly.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_jump.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Jump''' 

Some modules or objects may define special &quot;jump&quot; actions, which bring up lists of object related in some way to the one you are currently looking at - e.g. if you have a CRM package, you'd be able to jump from a person to a list of all sale opportunities related to this person. On this picture, you have only one jump-list - to all queries that this person has posted in the system.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_action.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Action box''' 

This is a dropdown that actually lets you do things in the system. It comprises three sub-lists of actions you may undertake:

;Add : lists types of objects that can be added inside the module (or object) you are currently in; since we are in &quot;Persons&quot; module, the only thing that can be added here is a Person object.

;Workflow : this list actions that are currently possible within a workflow which this object is in (will become more obvious when we are looking at an object, not a module)

;Object : actions that are defined by the object itself.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_cutcopy.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Cut/copy/paste''' 

These are standard actions that pertain to the objects shown on the list - if the listbox has checkboxes on the left and you select some objects, you can cut or copy, and then paste. There is nothing magic to it.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_print.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Print (optional)''' 

This button may be present or absent, depending on whether the object defines some &quot;object_print&quot; actions. Usually it produces a pdf representation of what you currently have on your screen. It can be very handy when listbox is used, because you can filter and sort objects, show and hide columns, and then print the list as you see it.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_new.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''New''' 

When in a module, this button creates a new objects of the type which can be created within the module and shows it to you on the screen. If more than one type of objects can be created within the module it creates the first one (alphabetically). CAUTION: when you press this button, the object is created immediately and presented to you for editing. It is too late to cancel, the object is already there - if you change your mind, you have to go back and delete it.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_delete.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Delete'''

Select some records, click this - you will see a confirmation dialog. This dialog will tell you if there are some other object related to the ones you are trying to delete. You can't delete an object if another objects has a &quot;link&quot; to it.

What happens when you confirm, depends on the implementation - objects can be either deleted, or moved to a &quot;deleted&quot; state.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_searchbutton.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Search button (optional)''' 

Some modules define their own, dedicated search facilities (e.g. Accounting Transactions module), then this button  appears. Clicking on it will bring up a search dialog.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_showall.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Show all objects''' 

If you had filtered the object in one way or another, this button will erase all filtering criteria you might have applied and show all records you can see in the current module.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_filter.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Manual filtering''' 

If you want the listbox to display only a few records selected manually by you, tick some checkboxes in the leftmost column and press this button.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_sort.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Multi-column sorting''' 

If you want to sort by one column, click on the column header (see below). If you want to do more elaborate sorting, like &quot;first by this column, then by that one&quot;, use this button.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_exchange.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Exchange (optional)''' 

Present if the module defines some &quot;object_exchange&quot; actions - usually there are things like: export data to CSV, generate dataset in spreadsheet format, import data from another application etc. If only one action is defined, it is launched immediately; if more than one, a selection dialog pops up. Can also produce a dialog asking for data input.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_report.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Report (optional)''' 

Present if the module defines some &quot;object_report&quot; actions - like generating VAT transactions report, producing paysheet in MSWord format etc. If no report variables to specify exists it is launched immediately, otherwise it takes you to a dialog form on which you can choose report specific variables or limitations for report data. If more than one report is defined, a selection listbox appears on the dialog form.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_tool.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Customize listbox''' 

By default, listbox shows columns which were defined by the person who made the application. By using this tool, you can hide some columns and show other ones. Your settings will be seen only by you, and will be remembered even if you log out and in again.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=== Navigation ===

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_breadcrumb.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Navigation breadcrumb''' 

A standard web breadcrumb to show you where you are - some applications allow you to get fairly deep into the data structure. Also, allows you to go up as many steps as you want.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=== Listbox tools ===

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_flatlist.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Flat list mode''' 

Brings you back to the standard, &quot;flat&quot; mode of a listbox (see [[ERP5_Handbook/Understanding_listboxes|Understanding listboxes]] for detailed explanation, and http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToConfigureListbox for technical information).

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_tree.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Tree list mode''' 

Goes into a &quot;tree&quot; mode whereby you can browse the listbox data by category tree (see [[ERP5_Handbook/Understanding_listboxes|Understanding listboxes]] for detailed explanation, and http://wiki.erp5.org/HowToConfigureListbox for technical information).

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_listaction.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''List Action''' 

In module, does nothing. In an object, usually goes to a &quot;folder contents&quot; view which would allow you to cut, copy, paste and delete items.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_pageselector.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Page selector''' 

Standard page selector, if listbox has more items that it is configured to display on one page.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_selectall.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Select/unselect all items''' 

Quicky check/uncheck all items in the listbox.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_gear.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Apply''' 

Applies filters which you typed into search/filter boxes (see below) - basically, has the same effect as pressing enter while cursor is in one of these boxes.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_sortrow.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Sort by column links''' 

If the configuration says a column is sortable, clicking on the link will sort listbox contents by this column in an ascending order; click again to reverse sort order.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_searchrow.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Search/filter boxes''' 

If the configuration says a column is searchable, enter something into the box and press enter. Columns differ int the search mode they use - some search by partial matches (type &quot;John&quot; to find &quot;Johnny Knoxville&quot;, some accept wildcards (&quot;John%&quot;).

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:A_selectcolumn.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Item selection column''' 

Select items for copy, cut, delete etc.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

== Object view ==

When you click on an object (a person, in this case), you enter a slightly different view, like this:


[[Image:O_object.png]]

Basic things are the same, here we briefly describe what is different.

=== Navigation ===

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:O_new.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''New object''' 

It is similar to the &quot;new&quot; button on the module level, except that it always creates the same type of object like the one you are currently working on.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:O_navi.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Listbox navigation buttons''' 

If you entered the object by clicking on a link in a listbox (which is the most common way of accessing an object), these buttons allow you to move to previous, next, first and last item in that listbox; importantly, the listbox &quot;remembers&quot; any filtering and sorting you did, so you move only among the items you selected before and in the order you sorted them.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:O_up.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Up to the listbox''' 

Takes you back to the listbox from which you came here (if you want to move up, you can also use breadcrumb, but the breadcrumb always takes you to the &quot;view&quot; tab, while this one takes you to the place whence you came.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:O_tabs.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Object tabs (or &quot;views&quot;)''' 

An object often has lots of properties (or attributes), far too many to present on one screen - then it defines many &quot;views&quot;. The first - and default - one is always called &quot;view&quot;; also, every object has &quot;history&quot; and &quot;metadata&quot; tabs.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=== Working with object ===

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:O_save.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Save button''' 

Saves any changes you might have made to the object. Sometimes it is not there, if the object is read-only for some reason.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:O_message.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Status message''' 

This is the place ERP5 tells you if the operation you tried to perform was successful, and if not, then why. In this case it says the object was successfully saved.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=== Basic fields ===

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:O_textfield.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Text box''' 

Just a text box, nothing special - type anything you like, press save.

Any field in an ERP5 form may be additionally equipped with a &quot;validator&quot; - in such a case if you enter an invalid value and try to save the field will tell you what was wrong.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:O_relationfield.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Relation field''' 

This field represents a &quot;relation&quot; of this object to some other object - in this case it says that this person works for that company. It has some very nice features:

* if it is empty, the little gear will show a list of object you can make a relation to - pick one and save
* if it has some value, the little airplane takes you straight to the related object (the &quot;ERP5 Polska&quot; company in this case)
* if it is empty and you type something into it and press the gear, it will make a search and present a limited list of objects
* if it is empty, you type something into it and press Enter or click Save, it will check how many matching objects there are - if only one, the system will immediately set the relation; if more than one, it will present a dropdown for you to choose which one did you have in mind.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:O_dropdown.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Category dropdown''' 

The category system (described elsewhere) lets you classify objects - here you can choose the region in which the person lives, from a tree-like category structure.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:O_listbox.png]]&lt;/span&gt;
'''Listbox''' 

This is a similar listbox to the one you've seen before in the module view; the main difference is that because it shows a more customized selection of objects, it does not have the &quot;select column&quot;; also, the &quot;list action&quot; is now usually meaningful - it brings you to another listbox displaying all objects &quot;contained within&quot; this person, and then you can copy, paste, delete etc.

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==Steps==
# Approach your desired object at a steady pace (if jumping over an object).
# Push off of your strongest foot first and carefully arch your body using your stomach muscles. 
# Place you hands out in front of you, being careful to tuck your head into your chest. 
# As you roll make sure you follow the roll from your head down your back and back up onto your feet. If diving from a higher object, follow steps 1 and 2 however place your hands out slightly later make sure to absorb the shock onto your arms by timing the start of your roll correctly and making sure your arms do not remain straight and locked for more than a split second. Making sure that you roll correctly is the key to avoiding impact damage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:After_effects_logo.jpg|left]]'''After Effects''' is a variable, mathematic-based animation program that has the ability to make use of click and drag animation. After Effects also has built in scripting abilities through its expressions language to allow for animation without key frames.  After Effects can also make use of many third party plug-ins to extend its abilities to include 3D animation, advanced particle systems and much more. Although After Effects uses a similar interface to other Adobe Creative Suite products it does have a significant learning curve; however there are many free training resources available online to help a new user get started.  Both PC and Mac platforms are supported by AE, and at the moment it's the industry standard for motion graphics editing..&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Motion''' is a loop-based animation program (can also be linear if desired) that primarily utilizes click and drag animation. The platform is Mac only and it uses various particle systems and basic movement animation to bring projects to life. Motion also allows keyframing in its simple key frame editor which lets you draw out your animation curves. Like After Effects, Motion keyframing allows you to edit many different aspects of your animation such as opacity, position, rotation, and many others. Motion has many time-saving features. Unlike After Effects, Motion allows you to click and drag your animation into Final Cut without having to render, export, and import. Motion is also able to send animations to After Effects 7 as a nested composition..&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">An inclusive definition for interactive media is elusive, if not impossible to write. Perhaps interactivity can be described by degree, but not by a single, all-encompassing definition.  Interactive media (hereafter referred to as &quot;IM&quot;) has been called a &quot;hybrid media technology&quot;, because it can combine any format (print, web, disc, video, audio, etc.)  that allow users to interact with content.  

A primary characteristic that makes inteactive media difficult to define is the fact that this field is evolving more rapidly than most other aspects of new technology.  For example, multisensory possibilities being developed by Japanese researchers are bringing startling new considerations to the multimedia mix.  Movies an audience can taste, touch, see, hear and feel are not science fiction.  User created content on YouTube is a manifestation of people's desire for interactivity in the media they experience.  Ultimate control over a movie is achieved when the auidence creates the content themselves. 

Interactive media designers are information designers and rely on communication. User feedback defines the interactive process so, most (but no all) web sites can be considered primitive interactive experiences by clicking buttons.  Video games provide some of the most advanced experiences and demonstrate that interactive design is maturing at light-speed - - although it's important to realize that not all forms of interactive media are electronic.  Magazines provide some of the most primitive interaction when users send a response to the publisher for future publication.  Puzzle and game books are also interactive since they demonstrate that participation and communication are key elements in making media interactive. 

[[Image:JonathanSlide.jpg|right|400px]]

Turning the pages of a textbook in order to read requires minimal involvement, while blockbuster video games can be described as much more highly interactive multimedia. A book might be defined as a multimedia format in that it can include pictures, maps, graphs, charts, or timelines, but while it uses other media, it is not interactive, because it is designed to be navigated in a way that the author has predetermined. A reader can use the index at the back of a book, or flip through pages, but the text itself has only one hierarchy of topics and is intended to be read from beginning to end.  Writers can't include large volumes of additional information between the covers of a book even though that content might be a vital part of the story.

Interactive Multimedia programs, on the other hand, bring the opportunity for extraordinary storage and delivery capabilities of computerized material. This is especially important for schools, libraries and learning institutions where books are difficult to obtain and update. Multimedia can provide access to other kinds of inaccessible materials, such as hard to find historical films, rare sound recordings of famous speeches, illustrations from difficult to obtain periodicals, and so on. Multimedia can put primary and secondary source materials at the fingertips of users in even the remotest locations of the world.

It's not just access that makes multimedia powerful, but the control over content given to users. IM programs enable the user to manipulate the materials through linking, sorting, searching and annotating activities. 

[[Image:IMG_o2661.jpg|left|400px]]
&lt;br&gt;




Interaction with others gives our lives meaning. In contrast, total isolation from human contact or any stimuli is considered one of the most effective forms of torture. These facts help define the significance of multimedia that is designed to respond to user interactions. Just as there seems to be a craving for virtual experiences that increasingly resemble the real world, perhaps it is possible that the requirement for interaction is at the core of all human needs.







[[Image:IMG_0116.jpg|right|400px]]
&lt;br&gt;
When human (person to person) interaction is impractical, unlikely or impossible, the next best experience requires interactive, immersive, multi-sensoral, IM. It follows that the most effective interactive experience should consider each of these issues. Until now, the technology to generate these kinds of experiences has been restricted to the holodeck of the starship Enterprise. With the advent of powerful and affordable personal-computer workstations and the rapid development of user-friendly multimedia software, almost anyone can get into the game.

Among all the choices of hardware and software available to create IM, it is a challenge for students to identify the most effective tools that are accessible for creating IM. Once identified, learning to use this hardware/software can seem overwhelming, but this may be the least of all problems to be conquered. Judging by the general lack of success of IM thus far, the greatest challenge seems to be that of creating a product of significance, that is, something that makes a difference in people's lives.

Addictive blockbuster video games are the essence of IM, but what is their lasting significance? The power of interactive, immersive, multi-sensoral, IM is unleashed by these games, but to what end?

The generation of people born between 1982-2000 have been brought up in a completely different world than ever before. No longer does a young person spend their free time with their nose in a book, but rather, they express a need to be completely immersed in multi-sensory interactive media. In order to keep the attention of this up and coming generation of young people, companies are going to have to make their content more and more interactive. Teachers can no longer stand in front of a class and lecture to their students. Instead, teachers are now compelled to learn how to teach via interactive and immersive tools. Even three-year olds don't just sit and play with toy cars anymore, but are completely immersed in video games. If today's 12 and 13 year olds can't pay attention in class now, then what is it going to be like when today's 3 year olds are 13 and 14?  Interactive, immersive media is taking over in every arena of life and it something that needs to be dealt with by the older generations. However, the window of opportunity available for those older generations to influence this change is a limited one. The pace of change in the IM world dictates that only those who are constantly involved can keep up; otherwise, it will be the users themselves, most notably the youngest of generations who are growing up under these new dictates that will be the shapers, reversing millennia of human history, whence the older generations always used to shape the deveopment of those younger than them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Some of the first things I heard from students about the process of creating an interactive, immersive, multimedia project were frustrations such as:'''

1. &quot;I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing to get my part of the project finished. I know I'm on the ________ team but it's not clear what we're supposed to be doing right now&quot;. 

2. &quot;How is this different from other projects we've done in the MultiMedia Institute so far. Is this going to be like creating one of our video pieces, or like making my own web site?&quot; 

3. &quot;I have to wait until the Design Team gets their work done before I can get started&quot; - or &quot;I have to wait until the Project Director gives us the navigation outline before I can do my part&quot; - or &quot;I have to wait until the Interactive Team tells us what software they're going to use before I can get started&quot;.


It makes sense that students who have never created an interactive team project before are unsure what they are to do to help their particular team accomplish their work. Interactive design is deceiving in that the processes are very similar to those used to make a video documentary or any other piece of conventional, linear media. It's confusing because rules for conventional media are not enough to finish an interactive product.

For example, video components must be planned, shot and edited for either presentation format. Interactive clips must, however, make sense when played out of sequence or all by themselves. Transitions to and from many other non-linear components must be created and, in most cases, video clips will be very short and numerous.

[[Image:IMG_00156.jpg|right|400px]]
&lt;br&gt;




'''The sequential order for interactive development usually looks like this:''' 

1. Define the end user, time line and budget in detail. 

2. Describe and understand all possible environments where the project might be accessed (at a living room desktop computer, integrated with live actors, from a lap top, in a classroom, etc.) 

3. Decide what format of media (pictures, video, PDFs, text, VRs, URL links, etc.) will communicate your story the best. 

4. Describe (storyboard) for each type of media. 

5. Collect media and translate, compress, reformat it into a form that can be read by the final authoring tool (in this case, Adobe's Director software). 

6. Create at least one prototype for each kind of media and test it on an end-user's playback device (computer, DVD player, etc.). 

7. Author the project, keeping in mind to give users what they expect as well as something they didn't expect that makes the product memorable (&quot;sticky&quot;) and effective. 

8. Test the product. 

9. Debug. 

10. Duplicate, if necessary, and distribute.


'''With this much information it is possible for every team member to tackle their part of the project while giving direction to other development teams.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe that Interactive Media is the most wide range type of media possible. There is no limit to what you can do in interactive media. All types of avenues such as web design, web development World Wide Web, Internet forums, computer games, online games, interactive television, e-Mail and electronic literature and many other sources of media apply. One of the benefits of interactive media is that the technologies of it are always emerging. It does not stay at a stand still because there is no definite measure of interactive media. Many times, clients have changing views for what they want for their product and being the developer for the product as an interactive developer, this makes it that much more difficult. I assume that in other forms of media it is more clear cut in the sense that you have a need and without little trouble, the product is developed. In conclusion, if you crave to be creative in what you do or want to pursue, then interactive is the way to go!

People will always crave media that will allow them to experience an environment that is more like the world as God made it. In other words, the more media becomes like the &quot;real&quot; world, the more it will be accepted and embraced by human beings. We are made in God's own image and this is why we can look at the beauty of the earth and say &quot;it is good,&quot; just as God said in the book of Genesis.

This is also why television overtook radio, color television overtook black and white and why high definition television is overtaking standard definition television. Interactive, immersive, multi-sensoral, multimedia will eventually be widely accepted and even demanded, because it is more like God's real world - never as good as His world, but &quot;like&quot; His real world. When it's not possible to actually stand in a rain forest, virtual experiences will offer the next best thing until you can get there.

Is interactive media something that is completely attainable? I view it as an immersive element of our world that few will actually indulge in when the media becomes available. I am not doubting that the media will be attainable (technology and creativity are at an all-time high), I am merely asking whether or not those ordinary people in everyday life will be excited about the medium that is creating a huge buzz in this field.

&lt;br&gt;

Then my second question - is it healthy to have such interactive media in today's lifestyles? According to www.healthgood.com, One in three people in this world are obese. According to the National Institutes of Health, obesity and being overweight, together, are the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, close behind tobacco use. An estimated 300,000 deaths per year are due to the obesity epidemic. [1] My question then: is it going to be a problem as more and more interactive types of media are surfacing; is it going to take away from user physical interactivity or will it add to it.

In my personal opinion I believe that it is our job as the initiators and developers of this medium to make it add to the amount of physical activity. I believe Nintendo hit the mark when they released the Wii to the consumer. It is completely interactive and it makes the user become physically involved in the interactive pursuit. If our media, which up until now has been engaged in by sitting back and watching or by clicking a mouse here or there, can physically involve its user in the process, I think that we can help better our future.

So how can media logically be used to improve our future? One answer is social networking, and many websites are created just for that!


'''Getting the Word Out'''


How can you create a buzz without a budget? Use what you have - which just might be one of the many free tools now available to you.

Interactive media can address a vast audience with little to no budget simply by creating a buzz about your message. 

Post a video on You Tube with links to your Myspace and Facebook accounts and e-mail friends in your address book to view your project. If they like it and mail it on to their friends you just might have some highly contagious, viral media on your hands.

Friends in your Facebook and Myspace accounts view the video and may decide to link it to their pages, adding more exposure. Other free online sources such as Xanga or online blogging can branch to different audiences and multiply your audience exponentially. The only cost to you is your own creativity along with friends who help you get your message linked up to the world.

People are grabbing hold of this concept and bypassing the traditional avenues of marketing. Several people have created a buzz about themselves, bypassing Hollywood and, as a result, it opened the door to a job. If you get a large enough audience, people will listen. Television executives are lost and disarrayed over the power of this medium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As the interactive team, the success of the MultiMedia Institute's recruiting product for college weekend relies on our skills.  It is our primary goal to create a multisensory interactive presentation that not only encapsulates the essence of the MultiMedia Institute, but also emerses the subject within the media in such a way that man is one with technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tortfeasors are generally judged by the &quot;reasonable prudent person&quot; standard.  This is an objective person, not the individual in question.  The RPP is judged based on an individual in like circumstances.  

Here is my section from my Torts outline on this.  It was the first outline I did, so it may not be great.  I'll try to &quot;clean it up&quot; later, but if someone else wants to, feel free.
&lt;pre&gt;
b.	Reasonable Person Standard
i.	Physically disabled
1.	Smith v. Sneller
2.	Must take reasonable precautions (such as carrying a cane for a blind person); if not,l then negligent (Poyner v. Loftus)
ii.	Mentally disabled
1.	Breunig v. American Family Insurance Co.
2.	Generally not considered
3.	EXCEPTION:  insanity CAN be an excuse for intentional tort if the insanity causes the person to be unable to realize that the contact would occur
iii.	Youth
1.	Williamson v. Garland, Garratt v. Dailey
2.	Base “reasonable” standard on the same age child
3.	EXCEPTION:  doing an “adult” activity such as driving a boat requires standard of care of an adult (Dellwo v. Pearson)
4.	US standard holds even young children responsible because someone needs to bear the loss and it should not be the totally innocent plaintiff. (Child begins to assume liability for negligence around age 5/6/7, but always for intentional)

iv.	Elderly	
Reynolds v. LA Gas and Electric Co
Advanced age doesn’t matter 
v.	Professional training
						Public Service of NH v. Elliot					Judged by “reasonable” standard for someone with similar training
vi.	RESTATEMENT OF TORTS THIRD:  LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL HARM §12 
“If an actor has skills or knowledge that exceed those possessed by most others, these skills or knowledge are circumstances to be taken into account in determining whether the actor has behaved as a reasonably careful person”
a.	Gender
i.	Not considered
ii.	Other “related” factors may be considered such as individual strength
b.	Illness—if foreseeable, negligent; if unforeseeable (heart attack) not negligent
c.	Economic status—not considered
Default duty-Reasonable Person Standard
d.	Objective
i.	Looks at Averages, not extremes (Bligth v. Birmingham Water Co)
ii.	Even if someone subjectively does not “get it” still judged by “reasonable” person
e.	Learned Hand Test–balance burden of duty against utility or benefits	
i.	P*L | B 	
ii.	If product of probability of harm (P) and Π’s loss (L) is greater than Δ’s burden (B), then Δ guilty and should have taken precautions
iii.	If product of P and L is less than or equal to Δ’s burden, then Δ is not guilty of negligence 
f.	Benefits
i.	Provides some standard
ii.	“Am I being too risky?” 
iii.	Limit to how safe you have to act
g.	Drawbacks
i.	Hard to apply and determine standard
ii.	Fails to take individual differences and abilities into account
iii.	Individuals (i.e. jury) use themselves as “reasonable person”	

ii.	Children
1.	Judged to a reasonable child of like age, experience and intelligence
2.	Mentally Ill
iii.	Physically disabled
iv.	Elderly
v.	Below average intelligence
vi.	Specialized knowledge
1.	Industry standard
a.	Sometimes not high enough (TJ Hooper–operator is liable without a radio even though it wasn’t the industry standard)
b.	If the cost-benefit analysis clearly shows that the burden is less than the cost, then that will override industry standard
2.	Professional standard (Helling v. Carey)
a.	Doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc
b.	The established practice is dispositive factor
c.	Formerly used role of locality (Bergara v. Doan), not so relevant now with advanced technology and national standards for professions; however location, technology and resources may be looked at.
d.	If 2 established schools, either could be accepted
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Classic E-Commerce - Amazon, eBay ''etc.''==
When one thinks of e-commerce the first things which come to mind are the early
American online companies and the dot.com boomers 
such as 
[[w:Amazon.com | ''Amazon.com'']] operating since 1995, [[w:eBay | eBay Inc]] and
[[w:lastminute.com | lastminute.com plc]].

===SibeliusMusic.com===

SibeliusMusic.com has a paperless online music store model for displaying music
with  protection of the copyright. It developed as an offshoot of the 
[[w:Sibelius_(computer_program) | Sibelius music setting software]].

==E-Commerce by Classic Businesses - Supermarkets and Mailorder==
Constraints on the growth of supermarkets due to market saturation, land availability and competition considerations have meant that to maintain their edge many such traditional businesses have used their supply chain to enable a mail-order catalogue and an online web site for ordering and home delivery. This brings shop based businesses into competition with ''pure'' e-business and traditional mail-order catalogues.

==Online Financial Services==
One of the greatest challenges for any business is to attract new customers, not just any customers, but want to meet the right customers, the customers who know they need your products and services and who are ready to buy. Finding new customers can be time consuming, but it is a critical part of building value into business. It's need process. Working with a financial advisor or company like wellfargo or acura, would be a better option.

==Ecommerce Development Services==
The most effective solution for expanding the customer base and achieving the biggest platform with a very small investment is E-Commerce. But surely, developing an Ecommerce website is not an easy task. E-Commerce is a field that requires an experience and a day to day operation in setting up website such as an online store. By joining an [http://kemanaservices.com/en/ecommerce Ecommerce web development] company like shopify or [http://kemanaservices.com kemana services] will reduce many issue when developing a ecommerce website. Those ecommerce company offer solution to those who would like to sell their products and services online. They have a highly experienced team that will help out in setting up the store and also a technical maintenance team to help out if face any problems in day to day operation.

OK... we got the beginnings of a chapter outline done.  From here, write the introduction and perhaps fill-in more details in the outline before adding a lot of content.[[User:Kgrr|Kgrr]] 21:01, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

morning..... 

i'm so interest with UMTS especially about the different between GSM and UMTS-WCDMA..I have done to searching in many books and internet but i didn't find the answers...
i wish you want to explain me about the different between GSM and UMTS-WCDMA..and how about the formula..??thanx for your help..!

'''Seminoma'''


==Epidemiology==
*Does not develop before puberty
*Stage distribution: Stage I 85%, Stage II 11%, Stage III 4%
*Risk factors: DES, cryptorchidism, Klinefelter's syndrome, microlithiasis, immunosuppression (3rd most common AIDS malignancy after Kaposis and NHL)
**Cryptorchidism: Degree of maldescent related to risk with 1:20 risk for intraabdominal vs 1:80 if located in inguinal canal.
*Environmental factors play a role due to significant geographic variation in incidence (highest in Scandinavia, lowest in Asia)

==Pathology==
*Intratubular germ cell neoplasia (IGCN) is the putative precursor (also called testicular intraepithelial neoplasia, TIN, Tis)
**Abnormal germ cells in seminal tubules
**Found adjacent to germ cell tumors in &gt;95% cases
**Found in all clinical groups at high risk for testicular cancer (cryptorchidism, infertility, ambiguous genitalia, contralateral testes of patients with testicular CA)
**Stain strongly for placental alkaline phosphatase (normal germ cells are negative)
**Estimated risk of invasive germ cell tumors is 50% at 5-years, and 70% at 7 years
*Seminomas are not differentiated (unlike NSGCTs, which have some parthenogenesis), and retain some aspects of spermatogenesis
*Classic type seminoma
**&quot;Fried egg&quot; appearance
**&gt;90% positive for placental alkaline phosphatase
**hCG elevated in 15-30%, related to presence of syncytiotrophoblastic cells
**AFP not elevated
**Anaplastic seminoma no longer a separate category, since mitotic count is not prognostic
**Younger patients (20-40)
*Spermatocytic Seminoma
**Probably not a seminoma, but precursor unknown
**Older patients (mean 54 years)
**Different natural history and management (cured by orchidectomy alone)


*Radiation sensitivity
**Type A spermatogonia: presumed stem cells of spermatogenesis, considered relatively radioresistant. Possibly due to long cell cycle
**Type B spermatogonia: relatively radiosensitive

==Lymphatic drainage==
*4-8 lymphatic trunks drain hilum of the testis, and run along spermatic cord up to the internal inguinal ring
*Drain into retroperitoneal LNs between T11-L4, with majority between L1-L3
*Then upward via thoracic duct through mediastinum and to supraclavicular fossae, and occasionally to axillary LNs
*Right testis tumor: 
**Landing zone: Inter-aorto-caval LNs immediately below renal vessels
**Ipsilateral distribution: para-caval, pre-aortic, right common iliac
**Para-aortic LNs are considered contra-lateral
*Left testis tumor:
**Landing zone: Para-aortic LNs below left renal vessel
**Ipsilateral distribution: para-aortic, pre-aortic, left common iliac
**Para-caval LNs are considered contra-lateral
*Prior inguinal surgery may disrupt drainage, and redirect to iliac LNs

==Prognostic Factors==
''Stage I orchiectomy + surveillance''
*'''Multi-national, 2002''' PMID 12431967, 2002 &amp;mdash; &quot;Prognostic Factors for Relapse in Stage I Seminoma Managed by Surveillance: A Pooled Analysis. Warde P et al.  J Clin Oncol. 2002 Nov 15;20(22):4448-52.
**Pooled data from 4 large registries (Princess Margaret Hospital, Danish Testicular Cancer Study Group, Royal Marsden Hospital, and Royal London Hospital). 638 Stage I patients managed with surveillance after orchiectomy.  Median follow-up of 7 years. 
**Multivariate predictors for relapse: 1) tumor size &gt; 4 cm and 2) invasion of rete testis
***If tumor &lt; 4 cm then age less than 30 independent risk factor
**5-year actuarial relapse free survival (RFS) = 82%. Risk of relapse - no risk factors: 12%; one risk factor: 16%; both risk factors: 31%
***If tumor &lt; 4 cm, risk relapse if &gt; 30 yo: 11%; if age &lt; 30 yo: 20%
**Comment: not validated by independent data set


''Metastatic''
*'''Multi-national, 1997''' PMID 9053482, 1997 &amp;mdash; &quot;International germ cell consensus classification: a prognostic factor­-based staging system for metastatic germ cell cancers.&quot; J Clin Oncol 1997;15(2):594-603.
**Pooled data from 10 countries. 5202 patients with non-seminoma and 660 with seminoma. Metastatic GCT treated with cisplatin-containing chemo. Median F/U 5 years
**&lt;u&gt;Good risk&lt;/u&gt;: Any primary site AND No nonpulmonary visceral metastases AND normal AFP (LDH and B-HCG can have any value)
**&lt;u&gt;Intermediate risk&lt;/u&gt;: Any primary site AND presence of nonpulmonary visceral metastases AND normal AFP
**&lt;u&gt;Poor risk&lt;/u&gt;: ''none''

==Surgery==
*'''Inguinal orchiectomy'''
**Inguinal incision
**High ligation of spermatic cord
*Trans-scrotal orchiectomy contra-indicated
**Development of alternative lymphatic drainage to inguinal and pelvic LNs
**Leaves behind intact spermatic cord above scrotum


==Stage 0 (TIN) Treatment==
*TIN is a precursor for invasive CA, with 70% chance at 7 years. It may be found in ~5% of the contralateral testis of patients with germ cell CA
*A contralateral testicular biopsy is recommended in patients with testicular germ cell tumors. Due to false positives, it is common to do double biopsy
*TIN is effectively treated by 20/10 RT only (no surgery), but this dose damages Leydig cells in ~25%, leading to androgen dependency
*Chemotherapy is not particularly successful
*Results from de-escalation trials show that 16 Gy in standard fractionation is insufficient; testosterone production remains impaired even at 14 Gy
*Lowest effective dose/fractionation is yet to be determined


*'''German Testicular Study, 2003''' (1998-2001) PMID 12644817 - &quot;Radiotherapy with 16 Gy may fail to eradicate testicular intraepithelial neoplasia: preliminary communication of a dose-reduction trial of the German Testicular Cancer Study Group.&quot;  (Classen J, Br J Cancer. 2003 Mar 24;88(6):828-31.)
**Prospective. Step-wise dose reduction starting at 18/9 Gy in 2 Gy steps. Results verified by biopsies
**Dose level 14 Gy aborted after a similar Danish trial (below) experienced a failure at 14 Gy. Cohort 16 Gy was expanded for more statistical power
**Interim resuls show that 16 Gy is not sufficient to control TIN (there were also viable spermatogonia present). Recommend considering different fractionation schedules. Endocrinology data not yet mature

*'''Copenhagen, 2002''' (Denmark) PMID 11896102 -- &quot;Effect of graded testicular doses of radiotherapy in patients treated for carcinoma-in-situ in the testis.&quot; (Petersen PM, J Clin Oncol. 2002 Mar 15;20(6):1537-43.)
**Prospective. Dose reduction starting at 20/10 in 2 Gy steps. Results verified by biopsies
**Remission in all patients at 20, 18, and 16 Gy. One relapse at 14 Gy after 20 months
**Toxicity: Leydig cell function - testosterone decrease for &gt;5 years after RT. Need for androgen substitution similar at all RT dose levels
**Conclusion: 20/10 safe, 14/7 might result in relapse. Hormone production impaired even at 14 Gy

==Stage I Treatment==
===Treatment Overview===
*Historically, seminoma was treated with orchiectomy + inguinal/para-aortic RT, and sometimes also mediastinal RT
*Prophylactic mediastinal RT resulted in significantly increased cardiac mortality, and was ultimately abandoned in the 1960's and 1970's
*Para-aortic fields plus ipsilateral iliac LNs (&quot;dog leg&quot;) at 30/15 became standard
*British MRC trial TE10 published in 1999 showed that para-aortic fields only are comparable to classical &quot;dog-leg&quot; extended fields, with lower acute toxicity and improved sperm counts. Para-aortic irradiation became accepted as the new standard, recognizing that there is a small but higher risk of pelvic relapse
*British MRC trial TE18 published in 2005 demonstrated dose equivalence between 30/15 and 20/10, with lower toxicity and faster return to work in the 20/10 cohort
*For patients who had prior inguinal surgery, ipsilateral LNs (&quot;dog leg&quot; field) should still be used
*Meanwhile, since chemotherapy is very effective in more advanced disease, efforts are being made to use chemotherapy in Stage I. British MRC trial TE19 published in 2005 showed comparable outcomes with single dose of carboplatin (AUCx7) to RT (both 20 and 30 Gy). The follow-up is still somewhat short, so no conclusion can yet be drawn
*Some institutions are also experimenting with surveillance only in selected patients. Early outcomes appear good (20% relapse at 15 years), with very high rates of salvage. A risk-adapted management as demonstrated by the Spanish Germ Cell Group may be a reasonable treatment paradigm

===Surveillance Only===
*'''Toronto, 2005''' (1985-1996) PMID 15708251 -- &quot;Long-term outcome of postorchiectomy surveillance for Stage I testicular seminoma.&quot; (Choo R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Mar 1;61(3):736-40.)
**Prospective, single-arm. 88 patients with Stage I (normal post-op AFP and hCG) managed with radical inguinal orchiectomy alone, followed by surveillance. 20% rete testis invasion, 45% &gt;4cm. Median F/U 12.1 years, 3 lost to follow-up
**Relapse-free rate: 5-years 83%, 10-years 80%, 15-years 80%
**Relapse site: 88% (15/17) below diaphragm. Predictor for relapse: invasion of rete testis (HR 3.5)
**Salvage: 14/17 treated with RT, 3/17 chemo-RT. 1 had second relapse, and was further salvaged by chemotherapy. All 17 remained disease free after salvage
**Conclusion: Surveillance is a safe alternative


===Risk-Adapted Management===
*'''2nd Spanish Germ Cell CCG''' (1999-2003) PMID 16260698 -- &quot;Risk-adapted management for patients with clinical stage I seminoma: the Second Spanish Germ Cell Cancer Cooperative Group study.&quot; (Aparicio J, J Clin Oncol. 2005 Dec 1;23(34):8717-23.)
**Prospective. 314 patients. 100 with no risk factors treated with surveillance. 214 patients with risk factors (tumor &gt;4 cm, rete testis involvement) had carboplatin AUC=7 x 2. Median F/U 34 months
**5-year DFS: surveillance 94%, chemo 96%. Relapses: surveillance 6%, chemo 3% (1% if tumor &gt;4cm, 9% if rete testis, 6% if both). All but one in retroperitoneum. Median time to relapse 9 months (4-28 months)
**Conclusion: risk-adapted strategy safe and feasible

*'''3rd Spanish Germ Cell CCG'''  (2004-8) PMID 22042940 -- &quot;Risk-Adapted Treatment in Clinical Stage I Testicular Seminoma: The Third Spanish Germ Cell Cancer Group Study.&quot; (Aparicio J, J Clin Oncol. 2011 Oct 31. [Epub ahead of print])
**Prospective. 227 pts. 84 pts (37%) with no risk factors treated with surveillance. 44 pts (19%) had tumor &gt; 4 cm, 25 (11%) with rete testis, 74 (33%) had both. Only the latter group (both risk factors) received treatment w/ carboplatin x 2. All others received surveillance only.
**Median f/u 34 mo. 16 relapses (7%) for pts on surveillance; 1 relapse (1.4%) for pts on carboplatin.. 3 yr DFS 88% (surveillance group), 98% (adjuvant carboplatin group). OS 100%.
**All relapses in retroperitoneal LNs except 1 pt w/ pelvic nodes. Median time to recurrence 14 mos; median node size 2.5 cm. All pts w/ relapse were made NED with chemotherapy.
**Conclusion: risk-adapted strategy is effective for stage I seminoma. For 2 risk factors: carboplatin. For 0-1 risk factors: observation.

===RT Field size===
''Superior edge of para-aortic field''
*'''Hannover; 2005''' (1992-1999) PMID 15788293 -- &quot;Adjuvant radiotherapy in stage I seminoma: is there a role for further reduction of treatment volume?&quot; (Bruns F, Acta Oncol. 2005;44(2):142-8.)
**Retrospective. 80/163 patients, Stage I seminoma. Treated with PA field extending from T11/T12 (vs historical T10/T11) to L4/L5. Median dose 20 Gy. Median F/U 7.1 years
**Outcome: 5-year RFS 95%; no relapse above T12
**Dosimetry: Median reduction of treated volume 16% (13-21%)
**Conclusion: This approach is recommended to minimize risk of radiation-related late effects


''Dog-Leg vs. Para-aortic''
*'''MRC Trial TE 10''' (1989-1993)
**'''1999''' PMID 10561173 -- &quot;Optimal planning target volume for stage I testicular seminoma: A Medical Research Council randomized trial. Medical Research Council Testicular Tumor Working Group.&quot; (Fossa SD, J Clin Oncol. 1999 Apr;17(4):1146.)
**Randomized. 478 men with Stage I to PA or Dog-Leg. RT 30 Gy. Median F/U 4.5 years
**Fields: PA (sup T10/T11, inf L5/S1, lat inclusion of ipsilateral renal hilum); Dog-Leg (sup T10/T11; inf mid-obturator foramen; ipsilateral inclusion of renal hilum vertically down to L5/S1, then diagonal to lateral edge of acetabulum, then vertically down to mid-obturator foramen; contralateral transverse process vertically to L5/S1, then diagonal parallel with ipsilateral and vertically down to mid-obturator foramen)
**Relapse: 9 in each group (NS), but pelvic recurrences 0 DL vs. 4 PA
**Toxicity: Acute toxicity less frequent and less pronounced in PA arm; sperm counts significantly higher in PA arm (median time to recovery 13 months vs. 20 months if normal, 24 vs. 37 months if abnormal pre-RT)
**Conclusion: No difference, decreased morbidity in PA-only arm. Recommended PA as standard


''(Prophylactic) Mediastinal Irradiation''
*'''MD Anderson, 2004''' (1951-1999) PMID 14726503 -- &quot;Mortality after cure of testicular seminoma.&quot; (Zagars GK, J Clin Oncol. 2004 Feb 15;22(4):640-7.)
**Retrospective. 477 patients Stage I or II seminoma treated, 453 (95%) never relapsed and were evaluated. 71 treated with PMI. Median F/U 13.3 years
**All-cause specific mortality ratio: no difference first 15 years of follow-up (SMR 1.3, NS), but increased thereafter (SMR 1.9, SS). Cardiac SMR 1.61 (SS)
**Prophylactic mediastinal irradiation (PMI): more cancer deaths (SMR 2.0, SS), and more cardiac deaths (SMR 2.4, SS), but significant only &gt;15 years out

*'''US National Survey, 1992''' (1973-1974) PMID 1447034 -- &quot;Seminoma of the testis: long-term beneficial and deleterious results of radiation.&quot; (Hanks GE, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1992;24(5):913-9.)
**Retrospective. 387 patients followed for &gt;15 years
**Freedom from recurrence: Stage I 93%, Stage II 96%. Second malignancy 8% (SS)
**Non-cancer deaths: cardiac 10 (8 received mediastinal RT), SMR 2.3 (SS); pulmonary fibrosis 2
**Conclusion: Eliminate mediastinal RT in Stage IIA, treat Stage IIB with chemotherapy. Dose shouldn't exceed 30 Gy for Stage I and 35 Gy for Stage II

*'''Princess Margaret, 1982''' (1958-1976) PMID 7085374 -- &quot;Seminoma of the testis: results of treatment and patterns of failure after radiation therapy.&quot; (Thomas GM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1982 Feb;8(2):165-74.)
**Retrospective. 444 patients with seminoma Stage I-III (using Walter Reed staging)
**No PMI used for Stage I (testicle, capsule or cord): only 6/329 relapsed in mediastinum; 4 were ultimately not salvaged (1.2%)
**Stage II (intra-abdominal tumor spread): nonpalpable disease 0/40 relapsed in mediastinum; palpable disease 10/46 relapsed in mediastinum (7/10 salvaged with mediastinal RT)
**Conclusion: PMI unnecessary in Stage I and II patients

===RT Dose===
*'''MRC Trial TE 18''' (1995-98)
**'''2005''' PMID 15718317 -- &quot;Randomized trial of 30 versus 20 Gy in the adjuvant treatment of stage I Testicular Seminoma: a report on Medical Research Council Trial TE18, European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Trial 30942 (ISRCTN18525328)&quot;. (Jones WG et al.J Clin Oncol. 2005 Feb 20;23(6):1200-8.)
**Randomized. 625 pts. Paraaortic radiation (dogleg for patients with prior inguinal surgery). 20Gy/10 vs 30Gy/15 after orchiectomy
**Relapse: 30 Gy 10 relapses vs. 20 Gy 11 relapses (NS), 2-year relapse rate of 3-4%. 1 death (allocated to 20 Gy)
**Toxicity: At 4 weeks, 20 Gy significantly better (moderate/severe lethargy 5% vs. 20%); at 12 weeks no difference
**Conclusion: 20 Gy/10 sufficient, with faster return to work

*'''German Testicular Study''' PMID 12644817 - Classen J et al.  &quot;Radiotherapy with 16 Gy may fail to eradicate testicular intraepithelial neoplasia: preliminary communication of a dose-reduction trial of the German Testicular Cancer Study Group.&quot;  Br J Cancer. 2003 Mar 24;88(6):828-31.
**Please see above, but 16 Gy considered insufficient to eliminate TIN/Tis


===RT vs. Chemo===
*'''MRC TE19/EORTC 30982''' (1996-2001)
**Randomized multi-national. 14 countries. 1447 patients, Stage I. Arm 1) 1 cycle carboplatin (AUCx7) vs. Arm 2) radiation (PA or DL AND 20Gy/10 - 30Gy/15).
**'''4-years; 2005''' PMID 16039331 - Oliver RT et al. Radiotherapy versus single-dose carboplatin in adjuvant treatment of stage I seminoma: a randomised trial. Lancet. 2005 Jul 23-29;366(9482):293-300. Median F/U 4 years
***3-year relapse-free survival: RT 96% vs. carbo 95% (NS)
***Toxicity: carbo less lethargy and less likely to cause time off work. One seminoma-related death after RT, none after carbo
***Second testicular tumors: RT 10 vs. chemo 2 (SS)
***Conclusion: 1 dose of carbo not inferior to RT, but follow-up only 4 years
**'''6.5-years; 2008''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCO/Abstracts+%26+Virtual+Meeting/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=55&amp;abstractID=34426 ASCO Abstract] -- &quot;Radiotherapy versus carboplatin for stage I seminoma: Updated analysis of the MRC/EORTC randomized trial (ISRCTN27163214).&quot; (Oliver RT, J Clin Oncol 26: 2008 (May 20 suppl; abstr 1))
***Outcome: RFS carbo 95% vs. RT 96% (NS); 1 death from seminoma in RT arm. Predictors: large tumors (&gt;4 cm), carbo AUC &lt;7
***Second testicular tumors: carbo 2 vs. RT 15 (HR 0.2, SS)
***Conclusion: Non-inferiority of single dose of carboplatin AUC7; reduced risk of 2nd GCT

***5-yr RFS 94.7% (carbo) vs 96.0% (RT); HR 1.25. 1 death from seminoma in RT arm. 
***Pts receiving &gt;= 99% of the AUC 7 dose had RFS of 96.1% vs 92.6% of those who had lower doses (p=0.08). 
***Reduction of contralateral GCTs with carbo (carbo n=2 vs RT n=15; HR 0.22). 
***Conclusion: confirmed non-inferiority of single dose carboplatin vs RT; reduced risk of 2nd GCT.

==Stage II==
Stage IIC (lymph nodes &gt; 5 cm) is considered advanced seminoma and is classified as good risk.

===Radiation===
*'''Germany (Multicenter)''' (1991-1994)
**'''2003, Final results''' PMID 12637477 -- &quot;Radiotherapy for stages IIA/B testicular seminoma: final report of a prospective multicenter clinical trial.&quot; (Classen J, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Mar 15;21(6):1101-6.)
***Prospective. 94 patients, seminoma Stage IIA (n=66) or IIB (n=21). RT to para-aortic and high ipsilateral iliac LNs. Dose Stage IIA 30 Gy and Stage IIB 36 Gy. Median F/U 5.8 years
***Outcome: 6-year RLF Stage IIA 95%, Stage IIB 89%
***Toxicity: Grade 3 nausea 8-10%; no late toxicity
***Conclusion: RT for Stage IIA-B seminoma, with reduced portals, yields excellent tumor control and no late toxicity
**'''1997''' PMID 9308934 -- &quot;Radiotherapy in stage IIA and IIB testicular seminoma with reduced portals: a prospective multicenter study.&quot; (Schmidberger H, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Sep 1;39(2):321-6.)
***n = 58 (39 Stage IIA, 19 IIB).

===Chemotherapy===
*'''Spanish Germ Cell Cancer Group''' (1994-2003)
**Prospective, non-randomized. 72 pts (18-Stage IIA, 54-Stage IIB). Treatment with 4 cycles of cisplatin + etoposide or 3 cycles of BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin).
**'''2008:''' PMID 18936476 &amp;mdash; &quot;Chemotherapy As an Alternative to Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Stage IIA and IIB Testicular Seminoma: A Spanish Germ Cell Cancer Group Study.&quot; (Garcia-Del-Muro X, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Nov 20;26(33):5416-5421.)
**Median f/u 71 m. 83% achieved CR, 17% PR. 5-yr PFS 100% and 87% for Stage IIA and IIB. 5-yr OS 95%
**Conclusion: Chemotherapy is a highly effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with stage IIA or IIB seminoma and represents an available alternative that could avoid some of the serious late effects associated with radiotherapy.

===Comparisons===
'''''Prospective, Non-randomized:'''''
*'''Institut Gustave Roussy; 2013''' (1980-2001) PMID 21665493 -- &quot;A risk-adapted strategy of radiotherapy or cisplatin-based chemotherapy in stage II seminoma.&quot; (Domont J, Urol Oncol. 2013 Jul;31(5):697-705.) -- Median f/u 9.4 yr
**Prospective, non-randomized. Treatment policy is radiation for pts with Stage IIA-B with &lt;= 3 cm tumor size, and chemotherapy for State IIB-C with &gt;3 cm tumor size. 
**67 pts: 5 Stage IIA, 31 IIB, 31 IIC.  RT given to 37 pts (5/5 IIA, 28/31 IIB, 4/31 IIC). Chemo given in 30 pts (3 IIB, 27 IIC). 
**19 relapses (28%), 11 with RT (30%) and 8 with chemo (27%).  5-yr RFS 71%.  Salvage with chemotherapy in 16 of 19.  5-yr OS 97%.
**Conclusion: &quot;With an overall survival rate of 97%, the overall outcome of patients with stage II seminoma managed according to this risk-adapted strategy is good. The possibility of extending the indications for chemotherapy to selected stage IIB seminoma patients needs to be further evaluated as potentially beneficial in terms of relapse risk.&quot;


'''''Retrospective:'''''
*'''Florence, Italy; 2009''' (1965-2005) PMID 18848787 -- &quot;Management of Stage II testicular seminoma over a period of 40 years.&quot; (Detti B, Urol Oncol. 2009 Sep-Oct;27(5):534-8.) -- Median f/u 21 yr. 
**106 pts: 83 Stage IIA, 19 IIB, 4 IIC. RT alone given in 89 pt; 13 combined chemo + RT; 4 chemo alone.
**5-yr DSS 96%.  5-yr RFS 94% IIA, 72.5% IIB, 75% IIC.  15 relapses: 5 salvaged; 10 deaths. 
**Second malignancy rate: 4 pts (3.7%).
**Conclusion: In Stage IIA seminoma, radiotherapy continues to provide excellent results, as the majority of patients will be cured with this treatment alone. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy should be offered as an alternative to Stage IIB patients. Chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice for Stage IIC seminoma.

==Stage III==
Stage III is considered advanced seminoma. Patients are considered good risk unless they have non-pulmonary visceral metastases, which are considered intermediate risk.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The timeline is one of the most important toolbars in Flash. On a timeline you have frames and keyframes. A frame is simply an intermediary between keyframes, there is no change in the amount of objects on the stage during a normal frame. Keyframes are major changes in the state of the stage. You use them to add a new object or end/begin an animation.

Keyframes are marked by small squares with a black dot in them. Blank keyframes are marked by a square with an empty dot. You can insert a frame with F5, a blank keyframe with F7, and a non-blank keyframe with F6. (You can also insert frames and keyframes from the contextual menu, which can be accessed by right-clicking on the timeline.)

All commands to insert and delete keyframes are available by right clicking (Mac: Control Click) on any frame of the timeline.

On a timeline there are layers. A layer can contain only 1 animation at a time, so therefore to animate multiple objects you need to use multiple layers to do multiple animations. Any layer above another layer will have the layers contents stacked above the lower layer.

[[File:Tomato grafting timeline.jpg]]

Here we have the upper portion of the interface in Flash, the timeline window. This area is used to edit the work file frame by frame. Key frames, motion tweens, onion skins are some of the things that can be added/edited here. The left portion of this window also allows for the option of several layers of frames.

This is the lower portion of the interface, the property inspector. Here, several aspects of any given selected object can be viewed and changed. For example, at the moment nothing is selected, so the properties of the stage is currently showing. The user has the option to change the dimensions, background color, and frame rate of animation just to name a few options.

I've removed Image:Emergen-C.jpg from [[Ethnomedicine]]. You must provide a source for the image and the copyright status. If the source is on the web, you should provide a URL directly to the image and a URL for a page the image is in. For example, if your image were at [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Lincoln.jpg], you should also provide [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Lincoln.jpg]. Please provide a source and the copyright status of the image before reinserting it into Ethnomedicine. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 03:50, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The information provided here is intended to help Visual Basic 6 developers who are making the switch to Visual Basic .NET and who wish to learn how to accomplish tasks without the use of the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace (which contains all of the legacy Visual Basic 6 functions).

Do not be mistaken; by using functions in the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace, you are not using &quot;old code,&quot; because all of those functions map to their new equivalents within the .NET Framework. The main benefit of avoiding these functions is so you can familiarize yourself with the namespaces contained in the .NET Framework.

If you would like to remove the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace, you can do one of two things:
* Manually remove the import every time you start a new project.
* Create a project template that does not include the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace.

To create a template, take look at these links:
*[http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?t=382884 What you will need to change about the project template]
*[http://www.dotnetspider.com/kb/Article324.aspx How to make a project template]

==Notes==
*Some functions listed here may not be exact equivalents, but are the closest that are available.
*You are encouraged to use the Object Browser (F2) to explore the .NET namespaces yourself.
*Click on any of the .NET equivalent functions to visit Microsoft Developer Network and find out more information about that function.

&lt;big&gt;'''Non-Seminomatous Germ Cell Tumors (NSGCT)'''&lt;/big&gt;


*''Subpage: [[Radiation_Oncology/Testis/NSGCT/Randomized|NSGCT Randomized Evidence]]


==Prognostic factors==
'''International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group:'''
*PMID 9053482, 1997 &amp;mdash; &quot;International germ cell consensus classification: a prognostic factor­-based staging system for metastatic germ cell cancers.&quot; J Clin Oncol 1997;15(2):594-603.
*''Non-seminomatous tumors:''
**Good risk: Testicular or retroperitoneal primary tumor AND No nonpulmonary visceral metastasis AND good markers (see below)
**:Good markers (all of the following):
**:    AFP &lt;1,000 ng/mL
**:    hCG &lt;5,000 mIU/mL
**:    LDH &lt;1.5 x ULN 
**Intermediate risk: Same as good risk but with Intermediate markers
**:Intermediate markers (any of the following):
**:    AFP 1,000-10,000 ng/mL
**:    hCG 5,000-50,000 mIU/mL
**:    LDH 1.5-10 x ULN
**Poor risk: Mediastinal primary tumor OR Nonpulmonary visceral metastasis OR Poor markers
**:Poor markers (any of the following):
**:    AFP &gt;10,000 ng/mL
**:    hCG &gt;50,000 mIU/mL
**:    LDH &gt;10 x ULN


==Treatment Overview==
*'''Stage I, Good and intermediate risk:'''
**Treatment is orchiectomy alone.
***30% chance of relapse after orchiectomy if tumor markers are normal at time of treatment.
**Adjuvant treatment:
***Observation vs retroperitoneal lymph node dissection - ultimately 99% will be cured.
***Observation:
****Assessment of tumor markers q1month for first year, q2m for 2nd year, q6m for years 3-5, then yearly starting with the sixth year. CT scan of the abdomen q2m (year 1), q4m (year 2), q6m (year 3-5).
***RPLND:
****30% chance of positive nodes on dissection despite node-negative CT. Relapse rate is 10% after lymph node dissection, primarily to lungs.
****RPLND leads to 96% PFS for Stages I-IIA with normal markers after surgery. Not indicated for Stage IIB or higher or persistent tumor markers.
***BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin) x1 cycle
****German randomized trial showed this approach superior to RPLND
*'''Positive tumor markers'''
**Chemotherapy indicated for Stage IIB or higher or positive tumor markers after surgery.

*'''Stage II''' (positive node discovered only after lymph node dissection)
*:Relapse rate 30-50%. Treatment is BEP x 2 cycles.

*'''Bulky Stage II-III'''
*:Treatment is BEP x 3 or EP x 4.

*'''Poor risk'''
*:BEP x 4 leads to 50% cure rate. Investigational treatments may be offered.


==Adjuvant Therapy==
*'''AUO AH 01/94''' (Germany)(1996-2005) -- RPLND vs. BEP 1 cycle
**Randomized. 382 patients, clinical Stage I NSGCT. Arm 1) retroperitoneal lymph node dissection vs. Arm 2) bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin (BEP) x1 cycle
**'''5-years; 2008''' PMID 18458040 -- &quot;Randomized phase III trial comparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection with one course of bleomycin and etoposide plus cisplatin chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of clinical stage I Nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors: AUO trial AH 01/94 by the German Testicular Cancer Study Group.&quot; (Albers P, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jun 20;26(18):2966-72. Epub 2008 May 5.). Median F/U 4.7 years
***Outcome: 2-year RFS surgery 92% vs. BEP 99% (HR 7.9, SS)
***Conclusion: One course of BEP is superior over RPLND in clinical Stage I disease


==Surveillance==
'''''Frequency of CT scans:'''''
*'''MRC Trial TE08''' (1998-2003) -- 2 CT scans vs 5 CT scans
**Randomized. 414 patients, clinical Stage I NSGCT. Treated with orchiectomy. 10% high risk (LVI). Normal serum markers. Arm 1) 2 CT scans (3 and 12 months) vs. Arm 2) 5 CT scans (3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months). CT was chest/abdomen; all other investigations (CXR, serum markers) were same between arms
**'''2007''' PMID 17416851 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized Trial of Two or Five Computed Tomography Scans in the Surveillance of Patients With Stage I Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumors of the Testis: Medical Research Council Trial TE08, ISRCTN56475197—The National Cancer Research Institute Testis Cancer Clinical Studies Group.&quot; (Rustin GJ et al. J Clin Oncol. 2007 Apr 10; 25(11):1310-1315.) Median F/U 3.3 years
***Outcome: 2-year RFS 2-scan 79% vs. 5-scan 84% (NS). For pts with vascular invasion, relapse 63% to 67%. No pts relapsed with poor prognosis disease; intermediate prognosis relapse in 2 pts (5.6% of relapses) in 2 scan group and 1 pt (3%) in 5 scan group.
***First indication of relapse: markers 39%, abd CT 39%. 9 relapses were picked up by the 12 month CT scan.
***Conclusion: CT scans at 3 months and 12 months after orchiectomy reasonable options in low-risk patients. 12 month CT scan is necessary. Chest CT may be unnecessary. LDH is not useful in follow-up.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Fields===
As you will remember, a function is a machine that accepts a number and returns a number. A ''field'' is a function that accepts the three coordinates of a point or the four coordinates of a spacetime point and returns a scalar, a vector, or a tensor (either of the spatial variety or of the 4-dimensional spacetime variety).

====Gradient====
Imagine a curve&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; in 3-dimensional space. If we label the points of this curve by some parameter&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\lambda,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by a 3-vector function&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(\lambda).&lt;/math&gt; We are interested in how much the value of a scalar field&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; changes as we go from a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(\lambda+d\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt; By how much &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; changes will depend on how much the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; change, which are themselves functions of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\lambda.&lt;/math&gt; The changes in the coordinates are evidently given by
:&lt;math&gt;
(^*)\quad dx=\frac{dx}{d\lambda}\,d\lambda,\quad dy=\frac{dy}{d\lambda}\,d\lambda,\quad
dz=\frac{dz}{d\lambda}\,d\lambda,
&lt;/math&gt;
while the change in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a compound of three changes, one due to the change in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x,&lt;/math&gt; one due to the change in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y,&lt;/math&gt; and one due to the change in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
(^*{}^*)\quad df=\frac{df}{dx}\,dx+\frac{df}{dy}\,dy+\frac{df}{dz}\,dz.
&lt;/math&gt;
The first term tells us by how much &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; changes as we go from &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(x{+}dx,y,z),&lt;/math&gt; the second tells us by how much &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; changes as we go from &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(x,y{+}dy,z),&lt;/math&gt; and the third tells us by  how much &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; changes as we go from &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z{+}dz).&lt;/math&gt;

Shouldn't we add the changes in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that occur as we go first from &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(x{+}dx,y,z),&lt;/math&gt; then from &lt;math&gt;(x{+}dx,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(x{+}dx,y{+}dy,z),&lt;/math&gt; and then from &lt;math&gt;(x{+}dx,y{+}dy,z)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(x{+}dx,y{+}dy,z{+}dz)&lt;/math&gt;? Let's calculate.

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f(x{+}dx,y,z)}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial \left[f(x,y,z)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx\right]}{\partial y}=
\frac{\partial f(x,y,z)}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y\,\partial x}\,dx.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;If we take the limit &lt;math&gt;dx\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; (as we mean to whenever we use &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt;), the last term vanishes. Hence we may as well use &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f(x,y,z)}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f(x{+}dx,y,z)}{\partial y}.&lt;/math&gt; Plugging (*) into (**), we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
df=\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{d\lambda}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{ d\lambda}
+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\frac{dz}{ d\lambda}\right)d\lambda.
&lt;/math&gt;
Think of the expression in brackets as the dot product of two vectors:

* the ''gradient'' &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; of the scalar field&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f,&lt;/math&gt; which is a vector field with components &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z},&lt;/math&gt;
* the vector &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{d\lambda},&lt;/math&gt; which is tangent on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we think of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; as the time at which an object moving along &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(\lambda),&lt;/math&gt; then the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{d\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is this object's speed.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a differential operator that accepts a function &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; and returns its gradient &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathbf{r}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The gradient of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is another input-output device: pop in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r},&lt;/math&gt; and get the difference

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=df=f(\mathbf{r}+d\mathbf{r})-f(\mathbf{r}).
&lt;/math&gt;

The differential operator &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is also used in conjunction with the dot and cross products.

====Curl====
The ''curl'' of a vector field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\hbox{curl}\,\mathbf{A}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\times\mathbf{A}=\left(\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial z}\right)\mathbf{\hat x}+
\left(\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial x}\right)\mathbf{\hat y}+
\left(\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}\right)\mathbf{\hat z}.
&lt;/math&gt;

To see what this definition is good for, let us calculate the integral &lt;math&gt;\oint\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; over a closed curve&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt; (An integral over a curve is called a ''line integral'', and if the curve is closed it is called a ''loop integral''.) This integral is called the ''circulation'' of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; along&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; (or around the surface enclosed by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;). Let's start with the boundary of an infinitesimal rectangle with corners &lt;math&gt;A=(0,0,0),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;B=(0,dy,0),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;C=(0,dy,dz),&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D=(0,0,dz).&lt;/math&gt;

[[image:dydz.png|200px|right]]

The contributions from the four sides are, respectively,

* &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}:\quad A_y(0,dy/2,0)\,dy,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}:\quad A_z(0,dy,dz/2)\,dz=\left[A_z(0,0,dz/2)+\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial y}dy\right]dz,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{CD}:\quad-A_y(0,dy/2,dz)\,dy=-\left[A_y(0,dy/2,0)+\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial z}dz\right]dy,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{DA}:\quad-A_z(0,0,dz/2)\,dz.&lt;/math&gt;

These add up to

:&lt;math&gt;
(^*{}^*{}^*)\quad\left[\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial z}\right]dy\,dz=(\hbox{curl}\,\mathbf{A})_x\,dy\,dz.

Let us represent this infinitesimal rectangle of area &lt;math&gt;dy\,dz&lt;/math&gt; (lying in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; plane) by a vector &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; whose magnitude equals &lt;math&gt;d\Sigma=dy\,dz,&lt;/math&gt; and which is perpendicular to the rectangle. (There are two possible directions. The right-hand rule illustrated on the right indicates how the direction of &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is related to the direction of circulation.) This allows us to write (***) as a scalar (product) &lt;math&gt;\hbox{curl}\,\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma}.&lt;/math&gt; Being a scalar, it it is invariant under rotations either of the coordinate axes or of the infinitesimal rectangle. Hence if we cover a surface &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; with infinitesimal rectangles and add up their circulations, we get &lt;math&gt;\int_\Sigma\hbox{curl}\,\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that the common sides of all neighboring rectangles are integrated over twice in opposite directions. Their contributions cancel out and only the contributions from the boundary&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\partial\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; survive.

The bottom line: &lt;math&gt;\oint_{\partial\Sigma}\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{r} =\int_\Sigma\hbox{curl}\,\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[image:Stokes.png|250px|left]]

This is ''Stokes' theorem''. Note that the left-hand side depends solely on the boundary&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\partial\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Sigma.&lt;/math&gt; So, therefore, does the right-hand side. The value of the surface integral of the curl of a vector field depends solely on the values of the vector field at the boundary of the surface integrated over.

If the vector field&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the gradient of a scalar field&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f,&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a curve from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b},&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=\int_\mathcal{C} df=f(\mathbf{b})-f(\mathbf{A}).
&lt;/math&gt;
The line integral of a gradient thus is the same for all curves having identical end points. If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a loop and &lt;math&gt;\int_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; vanishes. By Stokes' theorem it follows that the curl of a gradient vanishes identically:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_\Sigma\left(\hbox{curl}\,\frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\right)\cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma}=\oint_{\partial\Sigma}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot d\mathbf{r} =0.
&lt;/math&gt;

====Divergence====
The ''divergence'' of a vector field&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\hbox{div}\,\mathbf{A}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{A}=\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial z}.
&lt;/math&gt;

To see what ''this'' definition is good for, consider an infinitesimal volume element&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d^3r&lt;/math&gt; with sides &lt;math&gt;dx,dy,dz.&lt;/math&gt; Let us calculate the net (outward) flux of a vector field&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; through the surface of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d^3r.&lt;/math&gt; There are three pairs of opposite sides. The net flux through the surfaces perpendicular to the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis is

:&lt;math&gt;
A_x(x+dx,y,z)\,dy\,dz-A_x(x,y,z)\,dy\,dz=\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}\,dx\,dy\,dz.
&lt;/math&gt;

It is obvious what the net flux through the remaining surfaces will be. The net flux of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; out of &lt;math&gt;d^3r&lt;/math&gt; thus equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial z}\right]\,dx\,dy\,dz=\hbox{div}\,\mathbf{A}\,d^3r.
&lt;/math&gt;

If we fill up a region &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with infinitesimal parallelepipeds and add up their net outward fluxes, we get &lt;math&gt;\int_R\hbox{div}\,\mathbf{A}\,d^3r.&lt;/math&gt; Observe that the common sides of all neighboring parallelepipeds are integrated over twice with opposite signs — the flux out of one equals the flux into the other. Hence their contributions cancel out and only the contributions from the surface&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\partial R&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; survive. The bottom line: 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial R}\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma} =\int_R\hbox{div}\,\mathbf{A}\,d^3r.&lt;/math&gt;

This is ''Gauss' law''. Note that the left-hand side depends solely on the boundary&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\partial R&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;R.&lt;/math&gt; So, therefore, does the right-hand side. The value of the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field depends solely on the values of the vector field at the boundary of the region integrated over.

If &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a closed surface — and thus the boundary&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\partial R&lt;/math&gt; or a region of space&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; — then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; itself has no boundary (symbolically, &lt;math&gt;\partial\Sigma=0&lt;/math&gt;). Combining Stokes' theorem with Gauss' law we have that

:&lt;math&gt;
\oint_{\partial\partial R}\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{r} =\int_{\partial R}\hbox{curl}\,\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma}=\int_R\hbox{div curl}\,\mathbf{A}\,d^3r.
&lt;/math&gt;

The left-hand side is an integral over the boundary of a boundary. But a boundary has no boundary! The boundary of a boundary is zero: &lt;math&gt;\partial\partial=0.&lt;/math&gt; It follows, in particular, that the right-hand side is zero. Thus not only the curl of a gradient but also the divergence of a curl vanishes identically:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\times\frac{\partial f}{\partial\mathbf{r}}=0, \qquad \frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\times\mathbf{A}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

====Some useful identities====
:&lt;math&gt;
d\mathbf{r}\times\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\times\mathbf{A}\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}(\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{r})-\left(d\mathbf{r}\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\right)\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\times\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\times\mathbf{A}\right)=
\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{A}\right)
-\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\right)\mathbf{A}.
&lt;/math&gt;

 * InstaView - a Mediawiki to HTML converter in JavaScript
 * Version 0.6.1
 * Copyright (C) Pedro Fayolle 2005-2006
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pilaf
 * Distributed under the BSD license
 *
 * Changelog:
 *
 * 0.6.1
 * - Fixed problem caused by \r characters
 * - Improved inline formatting parser
 *
 * 0.6
 * - Changed name to InstaView
 * - Some major code reorganizations and factored out some common functions
 * - Handled conversion of relative links (i.e. [[/foo]])
 * - Fixed misrendering of adjacent definition list items
 * - Fixed bug in table headings handling
 * - Changed date format in signatures to reflect Mediawiki's
 * - Fixed handling of [[:Image:...]]
 * - Updated MD5 function (hopefully it will work with UTF-8)
 * - Fixed bug in handling of links inside images
 *
 * To do:
 * - Better support for &amp;lt;math&amp;gt;
 * - Full support for &amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;
 * - Parser-based (as opposed to RegExp-based) inline wikicode handling (make it one-pass and bullet-proof)
 * - Support for templates (through AJAX)
 * - Support for coloured links (AJAX)

The '''Small White''' (''Pieris rapae'') is a small to mid-sized butterfly of the '''Yellows''' and '''Whites''' Pieridae family. It is also commonly known as the '''small cabbage white''' or just the '''cabbage white'''. It is native across Europe, North Africa and Asia but has also been introduced to North America, Australia and New Zealand where they have become pests on cultivated cabbages and other mustard family crops.

==Description==
In appearance it looks like a smaller version of the Large White. The upper side is creamy white with black tips to the forewings. Females also have two black spots in the center of the forewings. Its underwings are yellowish with black speckles. 

Its caterpillars can be a pest on cultivated cabbages, but it will readily lay eggs on wild members of the cabbage family. The eggs are laid singularly on foodplant leaves.

Known in the United States as &quot;Imported Cabbage Worms&quot;, the caterpillars are green and well camouflaged. Unlike the Large White they don't store the mustard oils from their foodplants and so are not distasteful to predators like birds.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Leaves are eaten one side at a time, starting from the edge and often eventually reduced to just a stem and the base of the midrib. Seedlings may become completely defoliated after only a day or two. Greenish-brown frass may collect in the leaf axils.

==Ecology==
Like its close relative the Large White this is a strong flyer and the British population is increased by continental immigrants in most years. Like other &quot;White&quot; butterflies it hibernates as a pupa. Along with the Large White it is sometimes known as the '''Cabbage White''' or '''Cabbage Butterfly'''.

It has two flight periods, mid-spring and midsummer. 

==Host plants==
Hosts include members of the following genera, and possibly other mustard-family weeds. 
*''[[../Armoracia/]]'' (Horseradish)
*''[[../Brassica/]]''
*''[[../Capsella/]]'' (Sheperd's Purse)
*''[[../Lactuca/]]'' (Lettuce)
*''[[../Lobularia/]]'' (Sweet Alyssum)
*''[[../Raphanus/]]'' (Turnip)
*''[[../Sisymbrium/]]''
*''[[../Tropaeolum/]]'' (Nasturtium)

'''Radish pie''' is a savory [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]] suitable for a vegetarian diet.  Radishes, fresh goat cheese, and walnuts give the pie a unique taste, which is most flavorful when served cold.

==Ingredients==
*1 to 2 bunches red [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]]es
*1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1/4 cup (60 ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], divided
*8 ounces (227g) phyllo dough
*1 red [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped
*2 tablespoons dry sherry [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
*2 large [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s, plus 1 yolk
*3/4 cup (177ml) heavy [[Cookbook:cream|cream]]
*4 ounces (113g) fresh goat [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]] 
*3/4 cup (177ml) broken [[Cookbook:walnuts|walnut]] pieces
*1/3 cup (80ml) fresh Italian [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
#Wash the radishes well, remove and discard tops. Put radishes into a small baking dish and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for about an hour. Let them cool and then cut into small dice. (See tip #2 below.)
#Use half the butter to grease a pie pan, and then line it with pieces of [[wikipedia:Phyllo|phyllo dough]], covering the pan evenly. Tuck under any stray bits to make a nice edge.
#Heat the remaining butter in a large pan and sauté the onion in it for about five minutes. Add the wine and diced radishes, then cook for another minute. Remove from heat and pour into the pastry shell.
#In a bowl, mix together the eggs and cream, and then pour over the vegetables in the pie crust. Crumble the goat cheese over the cream. 
#Bake the pie in a preheated oven at aforementioned temperature for 20 minutes.
#Add the walnuts and cook for another 15 - 20 minutes.
#Remove the pie from the oven and top it with the chopped parsley. 
#Let cool completely before serving.


Makes 6 to 8 servings.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Tip 1: Use fewer radishes for milder taste, or add more according to your own taste.
*Tip 2: The radishes can be baked the day before and then refrigerated until you make the pie.
*Tip 3: For a professional look, garnish each serving with a sprig of parsley.

      <comment>Added a note about the script's purpose being obsolete.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Note: This script is obsolete for it's purpose, since by these days Safari prompts user for confirmation if there is more than one window/tab open while quitting. But as the code itself is valid, it may be kept as a general example.

This is quite much doing same than Firefox's alert box that pops up when you're about to quit the browser with more than one window/tab open.

I use external tool (iKey) to force this script to be run when cmd+Q is hit while Safari is active application. I just plain hate it, when I mispress it instead of cmd+W or opt+Q.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(*
I made the code ignore window &quot;Downloads&quot;, as it is relatively
irrelevant, especially since Safari already alerts if you got downloads
going. Plus, if you once open that window, Safari will count it open
even when you close it - until you quit Safari.

If you don't use english as OS language, then change it to represent
the window name in the language you use - in variable setting just
right after this note ends - if you want to (not nessessary if you
don't care what counts the alert gives).

Enjoy your browsing. :)

*)

set wDowns to &quot;Downloads&quot;

tell application &quot;Safari&quot;
	set wCounter to 0 -- Window Counter
	set bCounter to 0 -- Button Counter
	set wList to name of every window
	repeat with vWindow in wList
		-- Counts the amount of windows
		set wCounter to wCounter + 1
		(* Counts the amount of tabs.
		I did put it into try-block so that &quot;Downloads&quot;-window wont 
		mess this script up, since it doesn't have &quot;group 3&quot;-item.
		Luckily - regarding easiness of tab-counting. *)
		try
			tell application &quot;System Events&quot; to tell process &quot;Safari&quot; to set bCounter to ¬
				bCounter + (count (every button in group 3 of window vWindow))
		end try
	end repeat
	-- Causes  &quot;Downloads&quot;-window to be ignored in counting
	if wList contains wDowns then set wCounter to wCounter - 1
	if wCounter &gt; 0 then
		-- If there is more than 1 window open...

      <comment>Put in more &lt;source&gt; tags, specifying applescript as the lang</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes, your script will need to do something that doesn't have an AppleEvent defined to accomplish the task.  In this case, you may be able to script the task anyway by going through the graphical user-interface (GUI), using a technique called '''GUI Scripting'''.

For example, to hide frontmost application, you can do the follwing:
&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;tell application &quot;System Events&quot; to keystroke &quot;h&quot; using command down&lt;/source&gt;

Then, to hide all background programs:
&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;tell application &quot;System Events&quot; to keystroke &quot;h&quot; using {command down, option down}&lt;/source&gt;

But when you want to hide a &lt;i&gt;specific application that is at background&lt;/i&gt;, it gets more tricky:
&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;tell application &quot;System Events&quot; to tell process &quot;Safari&quot; to set visible to false&lt;/source&gt;
Safari is just an example here.

I use iKey to run this script once Adium is deactivated:

&lt;source lang=&quot;applescript&quot;&gt;
tell application &quot;Adium&quot;
	set vCounter to count every window
	if vCounter &lt; 2 then tell application &quot;System Events&quot; to tell process &quot;Adium&quot; to set visible to false
end tell
&lt;/source&gt;

Shortly explained, it hides Adium if there is only one window (like, buddy-list) open.

{{see also|w:Catalan language}}

The Catalan language is derived from the Latin language which the Romans brought into [[w:Hispania|Hispania]] after the defeat of the [[w:Carthage|Carthaginian]] army of [[w:Hannibal|Hannibal]] in the [[w:Second Punic War|Second Punic War]]. It is closely related to Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian and especially Spanish. There are over 7.5 million native Catalan speakers and an additional 3 million non-native speakers. The Catalan language is an eminent poetic language, known for its long and rich poetic tradition. It is the second most widely-spoken language in [[w:Spain|Spain]] and enjoys extensive use in culture and art.

==History==
Catalan had its first &quot;golden age&quot; in medieval times. It was the language of the [[w:Crown of Aragon|Crown of Aragon]] and, until the 15th century, a key Mediterranean tongue. From the 15th century until 19th, Catalan suffered a long period of relative disuse and decadence that culminated in its first prohibition by [[w:Philip V of Spain|Philip V of Spain]]. Since the 19th century, Catalan has recovered its former status, in spite of suffering a second prohibition in [[w:Francoism|Francoist]] Spain.

==Extent of the Language==
[[Image:Catalan in Europe.png|210px|thumb|Catalan is spoken in the western Mediterranean area, especially in the Iberian Peninsula.]]

Catalan is currently spoken in [[w:Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[w:Land of Valencia|Valencia]], the [[w:Balearic Islands|Balearic Islands]], [[w:Andorra|Andorra]], the city of [[w:Alghero|Alghero]] in [[w:Sardinia|Sardinia]], [[w:Northern Catalonia|Northern Catalonia]] in France, a region of [[w:Aragon|Aragon]] known as [[w:Franja de Ponent|La Franja de Ponent]], and the shire of [[w:Carxe|El Carxe]] in [[w:Autonomous Community of Region of Murcia|Murcia]].

The '''Western Flower Thrips''' is a major agricultural and garden pest, affecting hundreds of cultivated and weedy species. Aside from damage due to feeding, its ability to act as a vector for viruses makes it particularly problematic.

==Description==
Very small, oblong insects.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Puncture holes, silvering, yellowing, or browning of plant parts, eventually leaves and flower parts die off and drop. 

==Ecology==
&lt;!--distribution, invasiveness, reproduction, etc.--&gt;

name=Inferius|
type=Animated corpse|
features=Stopped by fire|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Inferi''''' are corpses that seem alive.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Inferi are actually animated by the will of a wizard. They are greatly feared because, being already dead, they cannot be killed, and are effectively fearless. Animation of Inferi is a very dark form of magic, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] made great use of them in his attempts to take over Wizarding society before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] was born.

It appears that Voldemort has used Inferi to protect one of his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]; we see them in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. At this point, we learn also that they can be stopped by fire.

We learn in that book, also, that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] has been imprisoned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] for impersonating an Inferius. It is in relation to Mundungus that Inferi are described; they are mentioned beforehand, but it is only when a student brings up the story of Mundungus' imprisonment that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], actually describes what they are.

== Analysis ==

In the cave of the Horcrux, there are a large number of Inferi lying in wait under the surface of the water. We have reason to believe that those Inferi have been there for at least fifteen years, most likely much longer, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] tells us that they were there when Voldemort was initially hiding that Horcrux, before Harry was born. Thus, we must assume that either some part of the spell used to create Inferi, or some additional spell that is not discussed, must halt the natural processes that would result in the dead body decomposing.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we meet the animated corpse of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]]. While her body does contain [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Voldemort's pet snake Nagini]], it is uncertain whether Nagini is controlling Bathilda, or whether what remains of her has been made into an Inferius. It is true that her remains have not deteriorated significantly in the several months since her passing, so some of the magic that preserves the Inferius must have been used on her.

The '''silverleaf whitefly''' (''Bemisia argentifolii'', formerly referred to as sweetpotato whitefly-strain B ''Bemisia tabaci'') is one of several whiteflies that are currently important agricultural pests. The silverleaf whitefly was first found in poinsettia crops in Florida in the mid-1980's. It was found to have moved on to tomatoes and other fruit and vegetable crops less than a year later. Within five years, the silverleaf whitefly had caused over $100 million in damage to the Texas and California agriculture industries.

==Description==
The adult silverleaf whitefly is about 1 millimeter in length and pale yellow in color. 

==Symptoms and Signs==
In addition to inflicting typical whitefly-type damage on plants, this species can transmit plant viruses such as geminiviruses.  The broad mite (''Polyphagotarsonemus latus'') also uses the whitefly as a dispersal mechanism by clinging to the legs of the fly and dropping off at another plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Yuqing | last = Fan | coauthors = Petitt, Frederick L. | year = 1998 | month = Jul | title = Dispersal of the broad mite, ''Polyphagotarsonemus latus'' (Acari: Tarsonemidae) on ''Bemisia argentifolii'' (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) | journal = Experimental &amp; Applied Acarology | volume = 22 | issue = 7 | pages = 411-5 | id = [[doi:10.1023/A:1006045911286]] | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/p62501x2382ph231/ | accessdate = 2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==
This particular pest has been shown to be a good candidate for biological pest control, as it has several natural enemies, including parasitic wasps such as ''Encarsia'' and ''Eretmocerus''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial will familiarize yourself with the most common of commands used in RM2k3. You'll learn how to use, edit, control, and activate the following: 

* Creating Maps
* Editing Map Attributes
* Copying and Pasting Maps
* Setting Start Party Position
* Create Events
* Edit Events
* Sprite Association
* Sprite Facing
* Switch Creation and Use
* Creating Multiple Pages
* Editing Party Inventory

===Getting Started===

Since this is only a tutorial, and should not be used directly with the construction of a new game, please create a New Project. Name it RM2k3 Tutorials, or something to that affect. We'll be using this Project file to create other maps used for this tutorial, and you wont clog up your program with 12 different project files.

You'll see the usual blank map. We wont need all that space, so right click where it says Map0001 and edit it's properties. Change the map name to &quot;Blank Tutorial&quot; and make it's map size as small as possible. Click OK and allow the settings to take effect.

Cover the map with the grass tile, as to remove all the water.

Save your Project at this point.

===Copy And Paste New Map===

Now that we have the blank map set up, right click the blank map and choose &quot;copy&quot;
Right Click the Game Folder (You should have named it Blank Tutorials) and choose &quot;paste&quot;
A new map has been added, and it should be exactly the same as the first map.
Right click the new map (making sure Blank Tutorial will remain as the very top map) and edit it's properties.
Change the name to &quot;Chest Tutorial&quot;
Get familiar with this action of copying the blank map and renaming it to the name of the tutorial you are working on. If you use this tutorial step by step, you should eventually have a composite list of maps that will have a working model of all common RM2k3 FAQs.

===Chest Tutorial===
====Creating The Chest====
OK, now that we have our Chest Tutorial Map set up, go ahead and switch the program into it's Second Layer. Above the Map Screen, you'll see three icons, colored box with a white arrow cursor. These are your &quot;Layers&quot; which will be explained later. 
For now, click the Second Layer, The blue box in the middle. 
Your chipset on the left hand screen should have changed. 
Right click anywhere on the blank map and choose &quot;Set Party Start Position.&quot; This is self explanatory, but it essentially tells the program that when the game is first loaded, to set the starting location at this point. Moving along...

Next Step Is To Create Your Chest. Switch to the Third Layer, the Yellowish Orange Box...  Right click anywhere else on the map and choose &quot;New Event&quot;

=====Changing The Graphic=====

Bear with me hear, as I haven't any screen shot available. On the Left Hand Side of the window that popped up, there should be a Pinkish Tile under the Event Graphic. Choose &quot;Set&quot;. Choose Object 1 and pick a chest.
Click OK. At the Top of the window, left hand side, you should see the words &quot;EV001.&quot; Rename that to &quot;Chest&quot;

Right Next To Event Graphic, You'll see Trigger Condition. Open the drop down menu and choose &quot;Action Key&quot; (It should have been set by default, but I wanted you to actually USE the Trigger Condition.)

=====Coding The Chest Part 1=====

Now the fun part. In the Event Commands window, click the first line and press enter.
Click the Second Tab. Choose the fourth command from the bottom &quot;Move Event.&quot; 

At The Top of this window in the left corner, pull down the drop down menu and choose &quot;Chest&quot; since this is the event we want to move.

Now press the following commands in this order. Take your time as necessary, and make sure your code is the same as mine

* Face Right
* Wait
* Face Up
* Wait
* Face Left
* Wait

After the Wait Command, you'll play a sound effect. I think &quot;key&quot; at this point would be right. Your code should look EXACTLY like this:

&lt;&gt;Face Right&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;Wait&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;Face Up&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;Wait&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;Face Right&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;Wait&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;Sound effect:key&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;

There you go... Now what that has done is change the look of the graphic. 
The chest event will turn in the directions you've chosen it to face. The RM2k3 default graphics have it set up as if it is opening. You can choose to close the chest if you wish by reversing the facing commands.
We're not going to do that yet. We're going to attempt to give the party something cool... So.. moving along..

Press OK out of that window and go back to the main event's Command. You should see the following..

&lt;&gt;Move Event:&lt;&gt;Face Right
&lt;&gt;Wait
&lt;&gt;Face Up
&lt;&gt;Wait
&lt;&gt;Face Right
&lt;&gt;Wait
&lt;&gt;Sound effect:key

Believe it or not, all that is only 1 line of code. Make another line of code beneath that with the following command, &quot;Wait&quot; (2nd tab, bottom right)

Have the wait duration 00 tenths of a second. 

* Next Command: Change Money (First Tab, Seventh From The Bottom)

Increase the money amount by 100 or so. 

* Next Command: Switch Operations (First Tab)

Open the ... button next to 0001
The first switch is already chosen for you. In this window, you can create, rename, and choose switches. 
Name the 0001 switch to &quot;Chest1&quot;

Make sure the operation is Turn ON. Click OK. Your code should look EXACTLY like this:

&lt;&gt;Move Event:&lt;&gt;Face Right
&lt;&gt;Wait
&lt;&gt;Face Up
&lt;&gt;Wait
&lt;&gt;Face Right
&lt;&gt;Wait
&lt;&gt;Sound effect:key&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;Wait 0.0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;Change Money: 100 Add&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;Switch Operation: [0001:chest1] ON&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;&gt;

=====Coding The Chest Part 2=====

Now that all that is finished, at the top of your window, you should see the words &quot;New Page&quot; Click it.
A Second Tab should have been added to the window, and it should be labeled number 2. It also should be completely blank.

Change the Event Graphic. The chest should still be shown, so make it face LEFT. Click OK.

At the Top of the Window, you'll see the words &quot;Preconditions&quot;

Below that, click the first check box. Make sure 0001:chest1 is shown in the window. If not, change the command to that switch. 

Now why did we do that? Obviously, after the Chest Opened, the hero took out the gold right? And you remember turning on that switch.

Now you created a new page under the same event. The page has absolutely nothing on it (though you can in fact add a message if you want saying &quot;Nothing inside...&quot;)
This page is only activated if the preconditional switch was turned on. Since after the hero takes the gold, the switch comes on, he'll only come back later to find the message &quot;Nothing inside...&quot; (or unless the hero figures out how to turn off the switch, or a later event toggles that switch.

Now test play the new map. Your hero should be able to walk a short distance before unable to proceed further. There will also be a chest in the field... try using it... find out what happens...

      <text xml:space="preserve">===RM2k3 Tutorials Wiki Contibution Guidelines===

====Basic Step By Step Principle====
The user of this tutorial is to perform in a STEP-BY-STEP Sequence of how to program/code/create the feature you are discussing. Bear in mind, once the general method has been established, &quot;hand holding&quot; can be ignored.

=====EXAMPLE=====
* '''Double click the &lt;&gt; to create your first line of code''' - Tells a first time user EXACTLY how to add a line of code 
* '''Click the &quot;Message Box&quot; and type in what you want the charecter to say, then press OK'''-Tells the user, EXACTLY How to add a message
* '''Add a second line of code, adding the villian's response''' - Ignores the Step By Step, as it has been shown previously HOW to add a line of code, and add a message. However, this step is fully information, as you are telling the user to &quot;Add a second line...&quot; and &quot;..add the villian's response.&quot; You dont need to tell the user where to find the message button, or how to add the line of code. You've told the user to just simply Add the Code, and the message.

====Adding New Content====
When submitting new content to this wiki, be sure to do several things...

At the very top, review the list of techniques the tutorial will cover. If a new technique is to be discussed

* A) Add the technique at the top of the page, in descending order (at the bottom)
Example: SHOW PICTURE has yet to be discussed as of March 10, 2007. If a tutorial has the command of &quot;SHOW PICTURE&quot; used, please add that to the list.
* B) Give a Brief, yet DESCRIPTIVE EXPLANATION of what this feature does for the user. Discuss how it will be used in your tutorial.
* C) Make Sure the Tutorials You REMIND THE USER TO COPY THE BLANK TEMPLATE BELOW THE PREVIOUS TUTORIAL MAP USED. I will enentual have the user add Teleport Events to &quot;walk&quot; to each map, and use each tutorial in one large game. I'll be using the tutorials myself to add to my existing Tutorial Game Project, so users can download it and see the work in action before doing it themselves.
* D)Sign your tutorials. I can't stress this enough. Please. Why wouldn't you anyways? You created the content, may as well put the four tilda's (~) at the bottom of the editing window. Not that hard.

Any Questions please give me a hollar.

This is the '''Blender wind and soft body tutorial'''. This tutorial will try and help your knowledge of using Soft Body and the Fields and Deflection panels in Blender 3D. (For best results, I recommend you use Blender version 2.43 or higher). Don’t forget to save your work at various points throughout the tutorial.

==Setting up scene==
===The plane===
Delete the default cube [X key, or yes, even the Delete key] and enter Front view mode [Num. Pad 1]. Add a plane, scale 3 times [S key, 3, Enter] and sub-divide 4 times until you get something like the shape below. If your computer can handle more, and you want more, sub-divide as many times as you  like, but if your PC is struggling with this, undo once or twice.

[[Image:Soft+wind.JPG|700px]]

===The wind items===
TAB out of edit mode (if you haven’t done so already), enter side view [Num Pad 3] and add an empty. Clear the rotation [ALT + R] and rotate it 90° [R, 90]. Place it about -5 from the centre [G, y, -5] and make sure its still in the middle of the X axis. Your scene should look like the picture below:

[[Image:Soft+wind2.JPG|700px]]

For the second wind item, add an empty like before and clear its rotation, but DON’T rotate it any more. Move it along the Y axis by 4 places [G, Y, 4] and -10 by the Z [G, Z, -10]. And now your scene should look something like this (with all items selected).

[[Image:Soft+wind3.JPG|700px]]

And that’s all your items you’ll need for this. Onto the harder part.

==Designating each object's job==
===The plane===
Now, the plane will become a soft body, so enter the Object Panel [F7], click on the Physics Button (beside the three arrows, see second picture below) and click on the soft body button. You will get a load of boxes, but we only need to look at the Grav, Goal, and the bottom parts:

[[Image:Soft+wind4.JPG]]

Change the values of these as shown above. Change the Aero part to 732 (if you go up to 1000, it changes the final output by a bit).

Now, click on the Soft Body Collision tab and click on the Self Collision and Deflection buttons. You don’t need to change any of the numbers here. The buttons window should look something like this:

[[Image:Soft+wind15.JPG]]

Now we will move on to the Empty items which will be the wind.

===Creating the wind===
The two empty’s we created earlier will be the items that will act like wind, and when you render at the end, they will be invisible, just like the wind. Anyway, select one of the empty’s and enter the Physics panel. Click on the box under the Fields and select “Wind”. (Blender 2.5+ note: First you will have to choose &quot;Force Field&quot;, then change the Type to &quot;Wind&quot;.) Change the Strength to 20, click on Use MaxDist and change MaxDist to 2.5.

[[Image:Soft+wind16.JPG]]

Do the same for the other empty. Your scene should look something like this:

[[Image:Soft+wind5.JPG|700px]]

==The movement==
This is probably the most complicated part, but shouldn’t take long.

===The Empty on the left===
In side view [Num pad 3], select the empty on the left and do the following:
1. Press [I key] and then select LocRotScale from the list it gives you. This inserts a key frame, saying that on this frame, keep the Location, Rotation and scale the same throughout the rest of the movie, unless it comes across another key frame, which might tell it to move or stay the same. Now, press the Up Arrow Key until you get to frame 31 (about 3 times). If you don’t know where the box is that tells you what frame your on, check the following picture: 

[[Image:Soft+wind6.JPG|700px]]

Number 1 shows the current frame number and the name of the selected object while number 2 shows the current frame and allows you to change the frame with the arrows on either side.

===Back to the movement===
On frame 31, select the empty on the left (the one selected in the picture above) and press [G key]. Now press [Y key] and press “4”, then [Enter key]. Now press [I key] and select LocRotScale again. Now, if you press and hold the Left Arrow Key, you should see the Empty move back to its starting place. Now, to check the curve guide (called the &quot;IPO Curve Editor&quot;); right-click on the top panel (number 1 in picture below), then select &quot;Split Area&quot; and click when the line is a bit out from the side (number 2 in picture below).

[[Image:Soft+wind7.JPG|700px]]

Now, click on the box (shown below) and select &quot;IPO Curve Editor&quot; from the menu.

'''Noob note'''  In Blender 2.6+ the '''IPO Curve Editor''' has been replaced by the '''Graph Editor''', which allows you to edit F-curves. 

[[Image:Soft+wind8.JPG|700px]]

This window just shows where the key frames you entered are, and how much the shape changes, moves or rotates.
Now, go back to frame 1 and press [ALT]+[A], which plays the animation. You should see the &quot;wind&quot; hit the sheet and the sheet will blow away. Pretty nice, huh? Now, it would be fine like that (I’ll show you how to get rid of the blockyness in the last part), but say you want to hit the sheet again and send it upwards? We will use the second empty for this.

Select the second empty (the one on the bottom). Insert a key frame ([I key], LocRotScale) on frame 1 and frame 50. Go to frame 60, grab the empty and move it up 8 places ([G key], [Z key], 8). Insert a key frame ([I key], LocRotScale) and then go back to frame 1. You have completed the basics, and the most of this tutorial. Now, press [ALT]+[A key] and watch your animation.

==Finishing touches==
===Blockiness===
Now, to sort out the blockiness, go to the Editing buttons panel [F9] and select the &quot;Set Smooth&quot; button.

[[Image:Soft+wind9.JPG]]

Now if you preview again ([ALT]+[A]) you should see the plane is smoother, but might be a bit unrealistic (i.e. not acting like real cloth). Now, that can’t be helped, the only way to get rid of it is to subdivide the plane several more times, but that will put a LOT of strain on your computer, so I wouldn’t recommend doing it unless your computer can handle it.

===Background===
First of all, got to the Scene panel [F10] and over at the Format panel, change SizeX to 400 and SizeY to 300. Now, to change the background colour when you render, go to the shading panel [F5] and select the World buttons.  Now, in the World panel change HoR to 0, HoG to 0.80 and HoB to 1.0.

[[Image:Soft+wind10.JPG]]

All that does is just changes the background colour to a brighter, nicer shade of blue. Now, I’m just getting a bit lazy, so I’ll just explain this part with a picture: (don’t forget to select the plane).

[[Image:Soft+wind11.JPG]]

Change the values and press the buttons shown in the picture. This will change the colour of the plane to white.

The only problem now is the light. Press [F12] and you should see what I mean. There's no light shining on the plane where the camera is, so its just shaded dark. To fix that, select the light and go to the shading panel [F5]. You now have options for the light. Click on the &quot;Sun&quot; button and press [ALT]+[R] to clear rotation. Now, in side view [Num pad 3] press [R] and then type -45. Enter top view [Num pad 7] and press [R] and then -45. This now shines the light in the direction of the plane, but, if like mine, the light is above the plane in top-view, press [G], [Y] and then -5. The line coming out of the light source should be roughly pointing at the centre of the plane. Here’s what your window should look like:

[[Image:Soft+wind12.JPG|700px]]

The pink line is the light. This was taken in camera view [Num pad 0]. Render the frame and you should see what the final product looks like. Move to any frame you want and press [F12] and it will show the rendered image for that frame. Now, rendering the entire animation might, in fact, will take a long time unless you have a completely new PC, are using a big server like DreamWorks (one of the big PC’s, used for rendering images faster) or have a quicker renderer, I don’t use any external renderers, and am stuck using a PC that is about 2 years old (in other words, full of junk). It took my PC less than 5 minutes to render 100 frames, and the last 25 were just blank (as the plane just flew above the camera). To change the amount of frames to render, and to render the full animation, here’s what you press:

[[Image:Soft+wind13.JPG]]

The box that says End:100 lets you select what frame you finish rendering the animation on (NOTE: the Sta:1 button lets you select what frame to start rendering the animation). When you press the ANIM button, it starts rendering the animation.
The Box covered in blue, that says Jpeg, lets you change the format of the image in the end.

To export the animation as an AVI format, select the AVI button shown below, then press OK. Now, you need to Animate the sequence again, so press the ANIM button again. 

[[Image:Soft+wind14.JPG]]

The finished .AVI will be saved in a folder with the rest of your rendered images. It should be saved in a folder called tmp, which (on a Microsoft computer) is in My Computer/tmp. The name of the file will be whatever your start and end frames are, so in this movie, mine is called 0001_0100.avi. You can now do whatever you want with your movie now, and hopefully you have learned a trick or two that will be helpful later on in your Blender career.

'''Radish Tart''' is a tasty and colorful [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]], best served hot from the oven.  Fresh red radishes and yellow cheese give this pretty pie any interesting look and taste.

==Ingredients==
*1 cup all purpose flour
*1/2 cup cold [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
*1 cup (4 ounces) shredded Edam, Gouda, or Gruyere [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]], divided ([[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Cheddar]] is also acceptable)
*1 cup heavy [[Cookbook:cream|cream]], divided
*4 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]] yolks
*1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1/2 to 1 small bunch of red [[Cookbook:radish|radishes]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 425° F (220° C).
#Sift and measure flour into a bowl. Cut in the butter until the particles are coarse. Stir in 1/2 of the cheese. Pour in 1/4 cup of the cream; toss the mixture with a fork until all parts are moistened.
#Turn the dough into a 9-inch round pie pan. With floured fingers, press the mixture into the bottom and sides of the pan, then prick the shell with a floured fork.
#Bake the pie shell for 10 to 12 minutes. (The sides will slip down a little during baking.) Cool on a wire rack.
#Lower the oven temperature to 325° F (160° C).
#Sprinkle the remaining cheese evenly over the bottom of the cooled pie shell. Beat together the egg yolks, the 3/4 cup cream, and the salt. Pour the egg mixture over the cheese. Place the radish slices evenly over the top of the pie.
#Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until set. 
#Remove the pie from the oven, cut it into wedges, and serve it hot. 

Makes 6 to 8 servings.

==Tips==
*If you really like the taste of radishes, use 1/2 cup or more. For a milder pie, use 1/4 cup.
*The cheese crust has a pleasant crisp texture when eaten fresh out of the oven. Leftovers can be refrigerated and reheated later, but the texture will not be as good.
*A really sharp knife will aid in cutting the wedges without displacing the radishes.

* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

: Note that I've removed Image:200px-12 017.jpg from [[Ethnomedicine]] and replaced it with [[:Image:12 017.jpg]], which is the same image at a larger scale. You can add images from Wikimedia Commons to modules here on Wikibooks the same way that you can add images you've uploaded to Wikibooks. You'll likely be find all the images you'll need there. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 03:38, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

I've also removed [[:Image:Solitary-tea.jpg]], it is a copyright violation. Please refer to [[commons:Category:Tea]] for a freely-licensed image to use in [[Ethnomedicine]]. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 03:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

I've also removed [[:Image:Humidifier-311353x.jpg]]. You do not need to upload an image from the Internet, you may simply take a photograph of a humidifier and release it under a free license. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure if it's proper, but in the amount of time needed for this recipe I included prep time for slicing, chopping, and shredding veggies and cheese, and gathering all the ingredients. Once you've got that part done, it doesn't take long to assemble and bake the pie.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hello! I'm Nyanna==
I also have an English Wikipedia account [[w:user:Nyanna|My en:wikipedia page]] and a Wikimedia account [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Nyanna My wikimedia page], both under the same name. You can also see my photos at flickr.

===List of recipes that I've added to Wikibooks===
*[[Cookbook:Radish_Pie|Radish Pie]]
*[[Cookbook:Radish_Tart|Radish Tart]]
*[[Cookbook:Zucchini_Pie|Zucchini Pie]]

===A note about my photos===
I make the photos that I post with my recipes, and I put up small versions that I've released to the public domain. I've done the same with all of the photos I've put up in any Wiki space. However, the larger resolution photos that you will find on my flickr pages are almost all copyright protected. So feel free to use my 250px Wiki photos for whatever you like, but please don't use my flickr pictures without my persmission. Thanks!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electric current is necessary for amateur radio equipment to work.  However, different components of a radio setup use different &quot;types&quot; of current.  Although the electrons are the same, the rate at which they flow is different.  Electric current can be divided into two main categories:  direct current and alternating current.

==Direct Current==

Direct current can be defined as current that flows in only one direction.  Although imprecise, this definition will suffice for now.  This current is generated, for example, from a battery.  Consider a resistor connected across a battery.  The current only flows from the positive terminal, through the resistor, and into the negative terminal of the battery.  Furthermore, the current does not change as a function of time.

[[image:Dcdemo.png|left|frame|A DC source connected to a resistor.]]&lt;!--change this to Dcidemo.png after the move is made--&gt;
[[image:Dcigraph.png|none|frame|The resulting current.]]  In this circuit, a current of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I} = \frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{R}} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \mathrm{mA}.&lt;/math&gt;  This current is constant and travels in the direction of the arrow.  This battery provides '''direct current'''.


==Alternating Current==

Alternating current can be defined as current which flows both forwards and backwards.  This is the current that is found in the outlets in a house.  

[[image:Acidemo.png|left|frame|An AC source connected to a resistor.]]
[[image:Acigraph.png|none|frame|The resulting current]]  In this circuit, the current again travels in the direction of the arrow.  However, every half second, the current switches sign.  This can be interpreted as the current reversing direction.  This is an example of '''alternating current'''.

==Changing Current==

As mentioned above, it is not entirely accurate to define direct current as flowing in only one direction.  If the current changes with time, it is still said to be alternating current, even if it travels in only one direction.

[[image:Dciswitch.png|left|frame|A DC source connected to a resistor through a switch.]]
[[image:Dciswitchgraph.png|none|frame|The resulting current.]]  In this circuit, the switch is turned on (closed) and off (open) every half second.&lt;!--need to word this better; are both done rapidly every second?--&gt;  Once again, the current travels in the direction of the arrow.  The current does not go negative; it thus travels in one direction only.  However, it is not constant and is thus considered to be alternating current.

===List of Maladies===

===Anemia===
Anemia is a deficiency of red blood cells. This results in a reduced ability of blood to transfer oxygen to the tissues, causing tissue hypoxia. Since all human cells depend on oxygen for survival, varying degrees of anemia can have a wide range of clinical consequences. Anemia is the most common disorder of the blood. There are several kinds of anemia, produced by a variety of underlying causes. Anemia can be classified in a variety of ways, based on the morphology of RBCs, underlying etiologic mechanisms, and discernible clinical spectra, to mention a few.

===Acne===
A treatment for facial acne is to apply [[#Yellow Egg Yoke|Yellow Egg Yoke]] to the infected area. Or use [[#Toothpaste and Honey|Toothpaste and Honey]] with a bandaid for an overnight fix. Another home remedy is simply [[#Toothpaste|Toothpaste]]. Sometimes washing affected area with [[#Tea Tree Oil|Tea Tree Oil]] can also be beneficial.

===Alzheimer’s Disease===
Alzheimer’s is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining activities of daily living and behavioral changes. It is the most common type of dementia. The first symptom is loss of memory which increases with illness progression, then intellectual impairment extends to the areas of language, skilled movements, and recognition. The main cause of the disease is unknown.

===Asthma===
Asthma is a chronic condition affecting populations around the world. Public attention has recently focused on this condition because its prevalence and the associated mortality rate have increased over the last several decades. While familial aggregation is observed, no clear pattern of segregation can be discerned. Most likely, there are multiple genetic, developmental, and environmental factors which interact to produce the overall condition.
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma

===Arthritis===
A treatment for arthritis is [[#Glucosamine| glucosamine]].  Some easy and effective home remedies used to prevent or treat arthritis are the consumption of one of the following: [[#Kombucha|Kombucha]], [[#Potato Juice|Potato Juice]], or [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Apple Cider Vinegar|Apple Cider Vinegar]]

===Bad Breath===
Hydrogen Peroxide is used to '''cure bad breath''' within many [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Culture_Group#Western_Culture|Western Societies]].   You are supposed to mix about a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide with 8-10oz of water . Rinse your mouth with the solution and let it stand for 2-3 minutes.  If you look into your mouth you will be able to see the peroxide solution working in between your teeth and under your gum line.  Rinse your mouth well and brush your teeth as usual.

===Baldness===
A treatment for baldness is [[#cod liver oil and apple cider vinegar|cod liver oil and apple cider vinegar]]

===Bedwetting===
Bedwetting has been attributed to a number of causes including deep sleep, urinary disorders, or even problems with the spinal cord.  There are however a couple simple before bed solutions to this unfortunate common occurrence.  Cranberry juice, if taken in the amount of about eight ounces before going sleeping each night can help.  You can also eat two teaspoons of raisins and one teaspoon of walnut halves. 

===Bee Stings===
One remedy for bee stings is the use of [[#Broadleaf Plantain|Broadleaf Plantain]] and [[#Soybean Paste|Soybean Paste]]. Another is to apply the mixture of baking soda and water to the bee sting area. Mix a third of a cup of baking soda with two thirds of a cup of water, and put it on and around the sting. After a couple of minutes, you should start to feel relief. The paste will dry up and stop working after about 15 minutes, so apply more.

If stung by a bee one way to reduce pain and inflammation (if you are not allergic to bee stings) is to make a paste with a few drops of water to a teaspoon of meat tenderizer. In order for this to be affective however you must use a brand of meat tenderizer that has Papain in it. Papain breaks down the protein that is in insect bites which is why it is needed. Adolph's and McCormick are two brands that contain Papain.

If you'd like to safeguard yourself against future [[#bee stings|bee stings]], you may want to start taking zinc or thiamine. These nutrients may affect your body odor, which in turn could keep the insects away. You can infuse your diet with foods such as red meats, oysters, and fortified cereals, which are high in zinc. If you decide to go that route, make sure to check with your doctor first, as high amounts of nutrients may be unhealthy.

Placing peeled and sliced [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Potatoes|potatoes]] on a bee sting can also help the sting become less painful and irritating faster.

===Black Eye===
A black eye occurs when blood begins to pool near the tender area of the eyeball in order to hasten the healing process. Asprin is not a good way decrease the pain of a black eye due to the fact that it's is a anticoagulant which will not allow the blood to clot as it should,slowing the healing process.[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Black Eye|Black Eye]]

===Blisters===
A treatment for healing blisters is with [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Tea Bags|Tea Bags]]. One should use a non-flavored tea bag and soak it in a cup of hot water just as if making a drink. After 2-3 minutes, when the tea bag begins to soak up the water, remove it and place it directly on the open wound/blister. For 10 minutes, push slightly down on the tea bag, allowing the herb juice within to trickle out onto the wound. After 10 minutes, check the skin surrounding the blister for a discoloration of either tan, brown, yellow, or orange skin. If this is apparent, take the tea bag off. If not, soak the tea bag on the blister for 2 more minutes. For the next half hour leave the blister open to fresh air, no allowing it to touch any objects or clothing. One should continue this process twice a day until the blister is properly healed. This treatment with tea bags will allow the blister to heal quickly. This remedy is used in the [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Culture_Group#Western_Culture|Western Society]].

===Bloody Nose===
Bloody noses can be helped with [[#Cold Water|cold water]] applied to the forehead. Another, less common method is stuffing the nostril with ruptured [[#Yarrow Plant|yarrow]]. This with help the blood coagulate more quickly.

The most common type is called the Anterior nosebleed. This could be caused by a dry nose, smoking, or medicinal blood thinners. In the case of these, one should sit in a chair and lean forward without tilting the head. Pinch the nose lightly with a small, wet cloth for about 5 minutes. Some cayenne pepper can be mixed water and can be drunk. This will draw blood away from the head to the stomach.

The other common type of nosebleed is called a Posterior nosebleed,which is most common among the elderly. It is caused by high blood pressure,the bleeding begins at the rear of the nose a begins to flow down the throat.

In both Posterior and Anterior cases an increased intake of iron can make them less frequent.

=== Bruising ===
Dit Da Jow, “hit and fall wine”, commonly called “Jow”, is a liniment used by practitioners of the Chinese martial arts. More specifically used by practitioners of the iron body styles of kung fu; iron palm, vest, arm, leg, fist, and head. Jow is used to treat soft tissue damage such as bruising, strains, aches, increases blood flow. 

There are two types of Jow, hot and cold. The “Hot Jow” is used for more heavily damaged areas, deep bruising and very tight muscles. “Cold Jow” is more generalized and used for typical daily training training. The differences between the two are 1) “Hot Jow” is heated before application and 2) the recipes are slightly different. The ingredients may differ to some degree but all Jows are fundamentally the same, they are a combination of a strong alcohol (Chinese rice wine or Vodka are common) and specific quantities of specific herbs such as Artemesia (Liu ji nu), Myrrh (Moyao), Borneol (Bingpian), Carthamus (Honghua), Cirsium (DaJi), Dragon's Blood (Xuejie), Musk (Shexiang), Pinellia (ShengBanXia), Cinnabar (Zhusha).

Jow is applied to the effected area right befor

Another way of clearing up bruises quickly is to [[#massage|massage]] the bruised area for a short period of time. This may seem painful, but if you can handle it, it is effective. The massaging breaks up the blood in the area and allows it to move, and thus the bruise will clear up faster.

===Burns===
A way to alleviate the pain of burns is [[#Aloe Vera|Aloe Vera.]] Another way to alleviate the pain of burns is by applying Crest Original Toothpaste, see [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Toothpaste|Toothpaste]]
To prevent sunburns, use [[#Daily Suncreen|Daily Suncreen.]]

===Canker Sores===
Canker sores are painful reddish, sometimes white, sores on the inside of the mouth. The exact cause of canker sores is unknown, but is linked to stress, poor nutrition, menstrual cycles,changes in climate and food allergies.

The use of baking soda can help ease the pain and aid healing of canker sores. Using a mirror locate the sore, expose the canker sore by holding lips open with one hand. Dip the tip of one finger in baking soda and dab it onto the sore, covering it in baking soda. Continue to hold lips to expose the area, and avoid getting the area wet with saliva. Allow the baking soda to sit on the sore for a minute or two, then rinse with water. By the next day the canker sore should be less painful and begin shrinking. Hot fluids, such as green tea seem to aid healing. Repeat daily until the sore disappears.

This remedy has its origins in the great farm lands of Wisconsin, and likely many households across the country.

Also gargling a warm mixture of salt and water can help relieve canker sores. Mix a tea spoon of salt with a cup or so warm water (as hot as you can stand without burning yourself). Stir it until it dissolves. Gargle or rinse the solution in your mouth for 20-30 seconds, spit it out and repeat. Don't use the same solution over; rinse with it once and spit it out. Do this several times a day.

Using a tea tree oil mouth wash can also be a natural way of helping let your mouth heal itself of canker sores. Desert Essence is a company which produces such a product.

Rinsing your mouth out with sauerkraut juice has long been known to cure canker sores and prevent future ones from forming.  Just swish a tablespoon of sauerkraut juice in your mouth for about thirty seconds one or two times each day.

There are also ways to prevent the occurrence of canker sores through your diet. Eating foods rich in vitamin b such as whole grain foods and a variety of vegetables. Some man need to avoid dairy products and acidic foods as these can irritate canker sores even further.

Although dairy products can be a cause of canker sores, yogurt consumed while experiencing one may help relieve symptoms. It is believed that the cultures in Acidophilus yogurt may help combat the bacteria present at the site of a canker sore. For more information, see [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Yogurt_for_Canker_Sores|Yogurt for Canker Sores]].

===Carpal Tunnel Syndrome===
Remedies include a wrist support pad.

===Chapped Lips===
Chapped lips is seen as a dehydration problem. Licking the lips has a temporary effect, but the evaporation that occurs afterwards only leads to further dehydration. Lip balm is the most effective way to lock in moisture and prevent the lips from dehydrating. Vaseline and suntan lotion also work.

===Chickenpox===
A home remedy for the chickenpox is an  [[#Oatmeal Bath|Oatmeal Bath]]
Other home remedies for chicken pox are to take baths daily in baking soda or oatmeal. Using calamine lotion or benadryl liquid or capsules by mouth for the itching skin. Use Neosporin ointment about 4 times a day for infected sores. Use Vitamin E oil or honey over skin to help the healing process. Trim nails and do not scratch sores, let the scabs fall off by them selves.  Take Tylenol of fever. 

===Cold Sore===
Not sure if originating from but from Australia and china combined as a home remedy they would use nail polish and tea tree oil. On first notice of a cold sore coming on take a q-tip and dip it in nail polish remover. Place the q-tip on your cold sore until the q-tip is somewhat dry. Through out the rest of the day dab tea tree oil on the cold sore 3 times a day. If the cold sore is still a problem the next day repeat from step one starting from the nail polish remover. There are risks doing this, its not for someone with sensitive skin since 100% tea tree oil can be very irritating to the skin and so can nail polish remover, and first of when you read the back of nail polish remover it will say &quot;do not inhale or put directly onto skin&quot; so use at your own risk. If you are worried about the nail polish remover skip it and just try the tea tree oil.

Another remedy for cold sores involves vitamin E gel capsules. Pierce a hole in one of the capsules and smear the liquid on the cold sore 3-4 times per day. The sore tends to heal in a few days' time, as vitamin E is very beneficial to skin health and maintenance, and direct application is quicker than increased ingestion.

===The Common Cold===
A common cold can be prevented by taking [[#Airborne|Airborne]], [[#Humidifiers|Humidifiers]], [[#Zinc|Zinc]] or [[#Emergen-C|Emergen-C]], [[#Daily Multi-Vitamin|Daily Multi-Vitamin]]. [[#Exercise|Exercise]] and proper diet can aid in prevention.

===Diarrhea===
If you are having flow problem in the bathroom with Constipation and Diarrhea, You should consume the meat of an apple to loosen things up, or consume the skin of an apple to tighten things up.

===Disinfectant===
For a shallow wound or other minor cuts, [[Hydrogen Peroxide]] can be used to sterilize the injury. Take a small amount, about a cap full, and pour it over the infected area.   If bacteria are present, the reaction will cause the hydrogen peroxide to bubble. This means that it is working and the area is being disinfected. Once you have poured the hydrogen peroxide over the wound anywhere from 1-5 times, rise off the wound with water. Repeat twice a day, until the reaction no longer bubbles. However, this method can be dangerous as the amount of hydrogen peroxide used is considered excessive, and can cause damage to the skin and flesh surrounding the wound.

Honey can be smeared on a minor cut or scrape to aid in healing, as it possessed antibacterial properties. Aloe vera gel or liquid can also be used for this purpose.

===Eczema===
One remedy for eczema is [[#Cold Compress|Cold Compress]]. Another good remedy is putting [[#Coconut Oil|Coconut Oil]] directly on affected area.

A remedy for toenail fungal infections is [[#Vicks Vaporub|vicks vaporub]].

===Glaucoma===
Glaucoma is a group of diseases of the optic nerve involving loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy. Although raised intraocular pressure is a significant risk factor for developing glaucoma, there is no set threshold for intraocular pressure that causes glaucoma. One person may develop nerve damage at a relatively low pressure, while another person may have high eye pressure for years and yet never develop damage. Untreated glaucoma leads to permanent damage of the optic nerve and resultant visual field loss, which can progress to blindness. [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Cannabis|Cannabis]] is widely used by and legally prescribed to patients with glaucoma in Western Culture.

===Halitosis===
Halitosis can be prevented with [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Saliva|Saliva]] or the process of salivation.

A hangover is the result of drinking too much alcohol and not drinking water.  The symptoms are nausea, headache, and sometimes dizziness  There are simple [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Foods to Prevent Hangovers|food solutions]] to prevent hangovers. There are also a lot of different things you can do in the morning to alleviate your symptoms such as taking [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Alka Seltzer|alka-seltzer]] and drinking a cup or two of water.

===Headache===
Headaches are a common complaint among many people, but oftentimes they can be treated fairly easily. Headaches are usually caused by stress, lack of sleep, eyestrain, loud noises etc. 
One of the most effective ways to treat a headache is to lie down in a cool, quite, dark room with a cold ice pack or wet washcloth over your eyes. This will mainly promote relaxation, which in most cases is the cause of the headache. 

Another possible solution for temporarily treating a headache is pinching your hand as hard as possible. This creates another minimal pain, but will draw the attention away from the headache.

Another usually never thought of remedy for headaches is working out. Usually working out is probably the last thing that someone with a really bad headache would want to do, but it has been shown to help alleviate the pain. Try a light work out program, such as a brisk walk or join an actually fitness program. Too much exercise during a migraine could make it worse though. Working out releases natural endorphins, releases tense muscles, reduces anxiety, increased blood and lymph circulation, reduced fatigue, improves sleep which means more sleep, and improves digestion among many other things. All of these things that exercise helps can help to cause headaches, so exercising can help to reduce headaches.

One remedy for headaches is drinking [[#Gatorade|Gatorade]]
If at-home remedies do not help to alleviate the pain, acupuncture is an excellent next step to recovery.

===Hiccups===
An effective cure for hiccups is [[#Drinking water upside-down|drinking water upside-down]] or [[#Drinking water with nose and ears plugged|Drinking water with nose and ears plugged]].

They may last anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. A hive can be caused by an insect bite or in response to an allergic reaction. Hives can be treated with [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Benadryl|Benadryl]]

===Influenza===
Prevention for influenza can be [[#Flu Vaccine|Flu Vaccine]].

=== Ingrown Toenails ===
Many of you have accumulated ingrown toenails and may have wondered how to get rid of them. Within the [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Culture_Group#Western_Culture|Western Societies]] a cure that may help get rid of ingrown toenails may be to soak your foot in warm water for 15 minutes to soften the skin around the nail. To do this, it is best to soak your foot in hotter water than you would usually use and massage the foot for the 15 minutes allowed.  Daily [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Foot_Soaks|foot soaks]]  in warm water will help relieve the swelling or tenderness while the toenails grow out. Letting the toenails grow out and taking proper care of them will help prevent them from being ingrown again.

===Insomnia===
A remedy for insomnia is [[#Passion Flower|Passion Flower]]
A remedy for insomnia is [[#Warm Milk|Warm Milk]]
A remedy for insomnia is [[#Chamomile Tea and Whole Wheat Snack|Chamomile Tea and Whole Wheat Snack]].

===Jaundice===
Jaundice occurs when the liver can not handle the load it is given. Urine becomes darker, stools become lighter, and bilirubin (a yellow/brown substance that is the result of red blood cells breaking down) begins to collect in tissue all over the body. Jaundice is more of a symptom of a disease than a disease iself. It can be a sign of pernicious anemia, hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and hemolysis.Some symptoms of Jaundice are yellowing of the eyes,the mucous membranes,and also the skin.

===Lice===
Lice are mites (prediculosis) that can be seen with the naked eye.  They lay eggs on the shafts of hair on the scalp (nits, shells that contain eggs, are glued to the head).  In about a week the immature louse hatches and hides in the scalp for two to three weeks until it matures enough to lay eggs of its own.  They survive on human blood acquired through tiny bites in the skin of the scalp.  These pesky parasites cause itching- just the thought of them can tickle!  If one itches too often or too hard, the scalp can become inflamed or even infected, which can cause the glands in the neck to swell.  Being socially shunned for a couple of days can also be a side effect of lice.

It is a common misconception that if one acquires lice, they don't practice good hygiene.  Actually, lice come whether or not one bathes regularly.  However, there are some preventive practices.  Since lice are transmitted through direct contact with a contaminated person's hair and/or through the sharing of brushes, combs, hats, and other hair accessories, one should not share these objects.  This is one time being selfish can actually help the greater good of everyone!   

Lice can be treated with medication and other treatments.  Medicated shampoos kills the live lice (regular shampoo doesn’t work, so cleanliness is not a prevention practice), and egg (nit) remover gets rid of the eggs and nits that are more firmly attached to the hair and scalp.  Combing one’s hair after using the shampoo and remover should dislodge anything that is left over.  There are also other sketchier ways of removing the lice, one of which is Malathion (or Ovide) which is a pesticide that should be used cautiously and on children no younger than six years of age.  Malathion is not widely used because of its potential toxicity, and should be used as a last resort.  A few alternative home remedies include [[#olive oil| olive oil]], [[#mayonnaise| mayonnaise]], and petroleum jelly (Vaseline), all of which prevent the lice from moving, thereby killing them. Some have found that  [[#Listerine|Listerine]] mouthwash works as well. Saturate your hair, then cover with a shower cap for 15 minutes and shampoo as normal. You may want to repeat this process if it does not kill all the lice eggs immediately. A more drastic approach is to shave ones head compleatly. It may seem extreamly drastic, but this is an extreamly quick and effective way to remove not only the adult lice, but the eggs as well. However, many people feel that it's quick and effective results are not worth the cost of loosing all of ones hair.

A preventative practice for muscle aches is [[#Stretching|Stretching]].

===Muscle Cramping]===
Muscle cramping is very common in [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Culture_Group#Western_Culture|Western Societies]]. It often occurs during exercise in hot weather and at night. It is often caused by low levels of potassium in ones body. [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Potassium|Potassium]] and sodium work together across cell membranes to regulate muscle cramping.

===Muscle Soreness===
After working out, playing a sport, or working with heavy objects, it is possible to pull a muscle. When you pull a muscle, it hurts quite a bit, and will impact your ability to work out afterwards, or even go about daily tasks. When a sore muscle occurs, there are creams and other such things that you can apply. However, at the interest of time and money, there are simple treatments that can be taken. 1st, it is important to apply ice to the region that hurts for twenty minutes, once every hour until pain subsides. After pain subsides, and even in between icings, one should stretch to rid the area of lactic acid, which contributes to the pain. Stretching gently is important, since the area is already sore, and vigorous stretching will only cause the muscle to hurt more. It is important that you walk 15-30 minutes a day, not just because walking is good for your mind and body, but also because it will increase circulation through your body, and will deliver oxygen to the sore muscle. Drinking 8+ glass’ of water a day will help increase hydration to the muscle, which will also ease the pain. Most importantly, stay off the muscle. Do not curl weights if your biceps is sore, and do not run 4 miles if the sore muscle is in your leg.

===Overall Wellness===
Maintaining a balance of yin and yang, mind and body can be done by performing [[#Tai Chi|Tai Chi]] regularly. Drinking a glass of [[#Kombucha|kombucha]] can also stimulate metabolism and other bodily functions in turn leading to overall wellness.

===Pain===
Pain can be alleviated by a lot of medications and practices.  One popular medication used to treat minor aches and pains is [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Acetaminophen|Acetaminophen]]

===Pneumonia===
Pneumonia is a sickness of the lungs and the respiratory system that causes the lungs and the alveoli to become inflamed and produce fluids. This can result from a variety of causes including viruses, bacteria, and over cooling of the body. A remedy for this sickness is a [[#Lung Compress|Lung Compress]].

===Pink Eye===
Pink Eye is also called conjunctivitis, it is an inflammation of the membrane (the conjunctiva) that lines the eyelid and covers the surface of the eye.  Bacteria and viruses (which are very contagious) allergies, dry air, and irritants in the air such as smoke, fumes, or chemicals can cause pink eye.  When bacteria or a virus is involved, the condition is more commonly called an infection.

The symptoms of pinkeye may include redness in the whites of the eyes, red and swollen eyelids, lots of tears, itching or burning, a sandy feeling in the yes, and sensitivity to light.  Most cases of pinkeye will clear up on their own in 7 to 10 days.  A [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Warm_Compress|warm compress]] applied directly to the eye several times a day will relive discomfort during this period.

===Poison Ivy, Oak, Sumac===
Itchy and occasionally painful skin irritations caused by poison ivy, oak and sumac are a result of physical contact with the poison secreted by these plants. The most effective preventative measures, know what these plants look like and which environments they grow, can reduce the chance of exposure. For those who regularly find themselves in the wilderness contact with these plants is inevitable. Thankfully the poisons are only frustrating and itchy not deadly. 

The rash that is caused by the poison is typically reddish, bumpy, and itchy. The rash itself will secrete a toxin that causes it to spread to other areas or other people through direct or indirect contact. With this in mind the first step in treatment is containment. Areas effected should not be touched by any other part of the body, a simple ACE bandage wrapped around the area will suffice. Itching irritates the rash and prolongs the infection. 

Over the counter rash ointments are available, ointments do reduce itching and help stimulate healing, but there are several home remedies that work just as well if not better. The first of which is the topical application of oatmeal, the heat and moisture from the oatmeal sooths the itching. Oatmeal’s thick viscous consistency conducts heat and insulates very well. An oatmeal treatment may be used as needed for the entire duration of the rash. 

Secondly, a mixture of baking soda and vinegar is believed to extract the toxins from the rash, quickly reducing the size and reducing the duration of the infection. A large amount of baking soda is mixed with a relatively small amount of vinegar to create a thick paste. The vinegar is added in small increments to reduce the size of the resulting chemical reaction. Heating paste prior to it’s application will sooth the itching upon contact and open the pours of the skin allowing the toxins to flow out into the paste. When the paste has become dry and brittle it is washed off with cold water and reapplied as needed. 

Or for an irritating plant induced rash you could try a [[#Honey Wrap|Honey Wrap]].

=== Psoriasis ===
Psoriasis is a non-contagious skin disease that creates lesions or sores on skin and is treatable by many methods. The use of moisturizers will help relieve some of the itch associated with the condition. Exposure to sunlight also seems to benefit persons with this condition. Vitamin D, Vitamin E, as well as [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Grape_Root|Grape Root]] have been shown as treatments for the symptoms.

===Red Eyes===
The use of a [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Cold Washcloth|Cold Washcloth]] over closed eyes helps to constrict blood flow within your eyes. This aids in reducing red eyes because the restricted blood vessels stop pumping blood into your eye. Also, the cold washcloth helps add moisture to your eyes which will help get rid of any unwanted material within your eyes. This is a typical medical practice of the [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Culture_Group#Western_Culture|Western Societies]].

===Rheumatoid Arthritis===
A remedy for rheumatoid arthritis is [[#Borage Oil|Borage Oil]].

===Seasonal Affective Disorder===
Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD, is a mood disorder experienced during the winter months.  Between September and April, an estimated half-million people experience SAD every year.  It is caused by a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus due to the shortened daylight hours and general lack of sunlight in the winter.

Symptoms include a general feeling of depression, not normally experienced throughout the rest of the year.  SAD is more commonly found at latitudes north of 30°N and south of 30°S and rarely found in tropic regions.

SAD can be prevented and remedied by so-called SAD lamps, which emit full spectrum bright light.  SAD lamps do not emit UV light, so the imbalance may be corrected without resulting in skin damage.

===Sore Throat===
Sore throats are most commonly cause by infection, about 90% of which are viral. Usually, cases are minor and can be cured through simple at home remedies. If serious, they may lead to strep throat or bronchitis.
A home remedy to treat sore throats include [[#Honey Tea|Honey Tea]]. A remedy to treat sore throats includes [[#Menthol Eucalyptus Cough Drops|Menthol Eucalyptus Cough Drops]].
Gargling salt water is an age old remedy that helps relieve pain associated with a sore throat.  This remedy is best utilized if you catch the sore throat at an early stage.  The reasoning behind using water with a high concentration of salt is to soak out the some of the inflaming agents that cause a sore throat.  Additionally, salt water has a certain cleansing effect with regard to viral or bacterial infection.   A normal salt to water ratio is 1/2 teaspoon per 8 ounces of water.  This remedy provides only short term relief, and must be repeated often to continue to see results.  But over/extended use may cause more harm than help. As a good rule of thumb don’t gargle more than 2 teaspoons an hour, this will allow for 4 gargles per hour, which should be plenty.  This is a family practice, passed down generation by generation, and has no specific cultural ties. Another way to cure sore throats that has traditionally been used in many different cultures is consumption of [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Licorice root|licorice root]], which increases mucous production in the throat. Ice cream has also commonly been used in Western Society to deal with and sooth sore throats.
In Chinese culture, [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Ginseng|ginseng soup]] is commonly ingested for a simple cure of calming and relaxing the throat.

===Snake Bite===
[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Leeches|Leeches]] can be very effective in extracting snake venom from a snake bite. More recently in medical history the leech is used to prevent venous congestion (pooling of excess blood) when re-attaching fingers, toes, or ears. The most effective species of leech for medical use is called the ''Hirudo medicinalis'' which has three jaws that look like little saws with about 100 sharp teeth used to puncture the skin of a host. It is recommended to leave the leech on the infected area for about 6-12 hours. By that time the leech will have extracted enough blood to digest and live off for about another year before needing another host while removing poisonous venom or excess blood. The hirudo medicinalis leech’s saliva contains anesthetic so the host or patient feels little pain while it is attached. Their saliva also contains an anticoagulant which keeps the host’s blood from clotting which may cause more bleeding after the leech has been removed but is not dramatic enough to affect a human. It is normal for a healing leech bite to itch and should be thoroughly cleaned to prevent any kind of infection. There is nothing that exists in modern medicine today as effective for snake venom or venous congestion used today which is why leeches are used around the world. The practice of using leeches to extract blood was first recorded to have been used in ancient Greece as a part of the humoral theory. Leeches are known to be sold in animal markets in Istanbul and many other civilizations around the world.

===Spina Bifida===
Spina bifida refers to a disorder involving the incomplete development of the brain, spinal cord and/or the protective coverings of a developing baby.  A way to prevent spina bifida in a developing fetus is the regular consumption of [[#Folic Acid|folic acid]] among pregnant and sexually active women.  
http://www.stronghealth.com/services/urology/pediatricurology/spinabifida.cfm
The Food and Drug Administration recommends that every pregnant women 
incorporate 400 micrograms of folic acid into their diet.

===Sprain===
A sprain can be alleviated with [[#Ginger Root|ginger root]]. Alternating hot and cold packs on the affected area is also thought to be helpful, as it stimulates blood flow and helps damaged tissue to mend. Resting the sprain and wrapping it with a tension bandage to aid in support is also recommended.

===Stinging Nettle===
A natural remedy that can be used upon contact with a stinging nettle can be applied using specific [[#Ferns|Ferns]] to the infected area.

A home remedy used to treat the pain associated with stinging nettle skin contact is an application of [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Cottage Cheese|cottage cheese]] to the affected area.

A natural remedy that is used to cure the affects caused by stinging nettles are [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Doc Leaves(Rumex obtusifolia)|Doc Leaves (Rumex obtusifolia)]], they are simply rubbed on the area affected.

===Stomach Ache===
A stomach ache is usually referred to when there is any discomfort in the abdominal area. One of the common diagnosis of a stomach ache is indigestion, which can be aided by [[#uncooked rice| uncooked rice]]

Other cures or treatments for a stomach ache are [[#antacids| antacids]], [[#gatorade| gatorade]], [[#ginger ale| ginger ale]], and [[#yogurt| yogurt]].

Also try [[#Sprite and Crackers| Sprite and Crackers]] or [[#Peppermint Tea| Peppermint Tea]].

===Stress===
A way to relieve stress is [[#Playing Music/Singing|Playing Music/Singing]], ingesting forms of [[#St. John's wort|St. John's wort]], [[#Yoga|yoga]], [[#Massage|Massage]], and [[#Incense]].

Common Symptoms of excessive stress:
* Regularly walking, eating, or working in a hurried way. 
* Thinking and worrying excessively about the past or future. 
* Frequent tension in the body (esp. neck, face, shoulders, back and chest, and stomach) which often goes unnoticed until one slows down, breaths deep and carefully surveys the body. Sometimes leads to tension headaches or migraines.
* Feeling of the &quot;weight of the world&quot; on your shoulders. 
* Feeling emotionally on edge or uncharacteristically irritable. 
* Regular tiredness during the day. 
* Significant need for outside stimulation to feel good (coffee/[[#caffeine|caffeine]], sweeteners, food, sex, TV, alcohol, money, accomplishments, etc.) 

Strategies for Relieving Stress:
The most common way to help reduce stress is to try to make life as stress-free as possible. This may include getting activities out of the way that are causing your stress or constantly reminding you that you shouldn't be stressed out, especially about small things. [[#Exercise|Exercise]] is a great long term reducer of stress. Enrolling in an exercise class such as [[#yoga|yoga]] or dancing has been shown to significantly reduce stress over time. Another simple way of becoming stress free is cleaning around your environment. It clears the mind and is a light exercise. Cleaning allows for a cleaner more relaxing environment to work in. Working in a more relaxed environment lets the mind focus on what’s important. [[#Sleep|sleep]] is another terrific method of getting rid of stress.

Prayer and [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Meditation|meditation]] also helps cope and manage stress.

===Sty===
To rid those painful bumps on your eyelid use the [[#Tea Bags|Tea Bags]] trick to sooth them away.

Another way to help rid of a sty would be to use an [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Eye Cup|Eye Cup]].  A sty is an infection or inflammation of the secretory glands of the eyelids. This common infection or inflammation results from blocked glands within the eyelid. When the gland is blocked, the oil produced by the gland occasionally gets backed up and forms a lump, which can be red and painful. The eye cup can be used to clean out the eye and wash out the glands. The idea is to use the cup 3-4 times daily with warm (NOT HOT) water mixed with a little bit of sulphur. Blink as many times as possible for about 45 seconds. This remedy is very common within [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Culture_Group#Hispanic culture|Hispanic culture]].

===[[Such diseases as Diabetes, Parkingson's Disease, Gallstones, and Obesity]]===
For such diseases as these [[#Caffeine*|Caffeine]] can be used to reduce the risk of getting such disease.

=== Sunburn Skin ===
The best over-counter lotion/crème to alleviate sunburn pains such as stinging is to use Noxzema moisturizer that is found in the stores. It feels terrific especially if you store the Noxzema in a drawer because the crème naturally maintains a cool level which feels incredible on a sun burned skin. Apply enough Noxzema to cover the sunburn completely; and apply a minimum of 2-3 times a day. The sunburn should most likely be gone within 2 days depending on the degree of the sunburn. NOTE: Some of the Noxzema moisturizer's come with Aloe-Vera; and use caution if your skin is sensitive to Aloe-Vera or use a different kind of Noxzema without Aloe-Vera. 

[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Licorice root|Licorice root]] can also help heal inflammation of the stomach. When taken, it coats the stomach membrane with mucous to reduce the damage done to the membrane by stomach acids and kills &quot;Helicobactor pylori&quot;, a bacteria associated with stomach inflammation.

===Tooth Ache===
Toothaches can be a pain, but a quick remedy is [[#Vanilla Extract|Vanilla Extract]].

===Tooth Discoloration===
To eliminate plaque and gain whiteness and shine, use a mix of baking soda and salt as a paste.

===Upset Stomach===
A home remedy for curing an upset stomach is the use of [[#Coca Cola/ Coke Syrup|Coca Cola/ Coke Syrup]].

Also try [[#Sprite and Crackers| sprite and crackers]], [[#Peppermint Tea| peppermint tea]], [[#Burnt Toast|eating burnt toast]], or [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Pressure_Points]].

===Warts===
A hard rough lump growing on the skin, caused by infection with certain viruses and occurring typically on the hands or feet. [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Morning Spit|Morning Spit]] can also be used to treat warts. Many people in the Western culture cure warts in mainly two different ways.  One is going to the doctor and getting them frozen off.  The other is getting a prescription medication drug that will make the wart go away.  The less known method of wart removal is the use of morning spit has been known to cure a wart in about a week. This has to do with the bacteria in the mouth that comes when people fall asleep.

Some people have been known to apply a paste of baby powder and aloe vera gel to the wart.

== Introduction ==


This Story Takes Place in the Union of Soviet Socialism Republics.
The Main character is from Ukraine and was taken to a special training facility to work on a special space project to the moon. He and his fellow workers are almost exiled to the most northern part of Siberia when an explosion at the reactor 10 in a top secret facility occurs and they are blamed.





== Unknown Job ==


	The year is 1985 and I am almost done with my training at the national aeronautics academy in Russia. I am being trained to build and fly a space craft. I have a wife and kids that live in Ukraine in the city of Chernobyl. The city offers all the best for them and I don’t regret sending them there to live. My wife said as soon as I was sent away that I shouldn’t worry about them, that she and the children would be just fine. Even though she told me this as every day goes by I still worry that I might never see them again.

	Today is May 18 1985 and I am finally graduating from the academy! The commencement hall was so packed with people, and still more was trying to get in! It was decked out in all the Soviet Unions Colors and even had an extensive snack area. Though the people and all the commotion. It all seized when a man that I had never seen before came up onto the stage and announce the session in order. He wore a Black suit jacket, red tie, and Wine red shoes. The man was also accompanied with another couple of men that were dressed in the same accord. I sat and wondered what this was all about? None of the staff seemed to be bothered by the presence of these people although the audience seemed to be dressed in there finest. Click! In my head I had figured out that these people where from the Kremlin palace. They were apart of the socialist government, and obviously “top dogs”.

	 With in minutes the whole program went underway. They started pledging to the flag of Soviet Socialism and then the Man said a speech, “Today we honor these fine students for there academic excellence! Most of them are going to be sent to Chernobyl to work on the nuclear power facility and others to do other odd jobs for the government. We would now like to recognize these people for there academic abilities…” I thought it was getting a bit old and now all I could do is to wait to be called. For 20 minutes he continued to call out names and then he said Sasha Pankratova! As I went up a large round of applause was heard and then I received five awards and then a beautiful diploma! The man then whispered something in my ear saying, “I have something special planned for you. Come to the entrance hall here at the academy and I will take you to your job.” I was scared and did not reply. After the ceremony was over, I than began making my way back to my dorm. Upon entering I started packing and getting ready for the trip to my new job. Though it was very unlike a government official to come and see you just to take you to your job.

	That night was full of nightmares and dreams of death. Suddenly I was dreaming that my family would be in an accident in Chernobyl. On April 26 1986 a reactor would explode killing many people in the city and causing cancer in most of the surrounding cities. Though it was a very scary dream I was just going to ignore it and go on with the day ahead of me. When it was 7:00 am I went to the entrance hall were, like he said he would be, he was waiting for me. He told me to get into his car. He told me we were on our way to the city of Tomsk. There I would be working on a nuclear reactor. “For what” I asked. He said “I can’t say, though you will find out.” I did not say anything else the whole ride to the air port. I was being flown on a private jet. Just before I boarded he gave and ID card with all my information and my picture. He said that I was supposed to show it to them so I could enter the facility. Then without a word of goodbye he left. The door of the plane closed and all that he said started to become a reality.

	The Pilot started the plane and it began to take off. Soon we were out of Moscow and into the country side. It was very warm in the plane. Then the Pilate shut all the windows and the plane started to go fast. It was a ten hour flight and then all of a sudden the plane started to land. All of a sudden the door opened and very polluted air started to pour into the plane from the outside. Towering buildings all gray and black because of the acid rain and polluted air. There were 10 building spread fare apart each labeled [Vosc reactors reactor 1] and so forth. Then in the first section of the complex lied a little building that I entered into and showed the man my card. They looked at me odd but I just went on. There was a man that said, “Are you Mister Sasha Pankratova” I replied saying “yes.” Then he took me to an elevator explaining all that I would be doing. After we exited the elevator he told me that if I did anything to jeopardize the mission that I would be exiled to an exile camp in the near the city of Ambarchik in Siberia. He then showed me who I would be working with. He opened a door to a narrow hall way that seemed to get smaller as you walled down it. Then he opened another door and the men on the other side of the door where really tall and all had beards except one. Serhiy was his name he was very friendly. He had just started working on this project like the rest of us and was a very educated. As the man was going down the list introducing us we became aware of each others personalities me and Serhiy had a very fun time exploring the facility. The good thing is that the man told me that Serhiy and I had to share a dorm together. 

	That night we partied and had fun. We ended up getting drunk! We were talking and sharing are life stories and laughing at each others failers in life. Then after a while we calmed down and then began telling stories of our past life. That instant I knew that Serhiy was from a poor family. His mother lived in the city of Tatarsk. He started to say that she was being killed by cancer and an awful truth came to pass.  Serhiy and I began getting very close as friends sharing secrets and stories that I would not even tell my own mother.
As I fell asleep me and him heard a plane pass over than an explosion!
That instant we knew that the plane had been shot down, But why? We never answered that question. Until we figured that our jobs where unknown. No other people except the leader of the facility and our group knew of our jobs. Not even the leaders of the Soviet Union knew. We discovered we had Unknown jobs.







== Meltdown ==



	As the year progressed I was promoted to do test runs on the reactors. Soon after the first one was constructed I was the first to start it. With great force this reactor was one of the best in the world. It produced large amounts of energy and could not be beat. But as me and Serhiy looked at the control deck, there was no emergency shut down. I called one of the scientist over that worked on its design and he told us that it was safer to manually shut it down. So I took his word for it. As the day progressed the facility was powered by its first Nuclear Power Reactor! The only problem with this is that it let all its toxic waste into the Ob River. It was very unwise to do this because may lives could be at stake if someone drinks out of this river. Still I looked at the reactors profile and found that the rate at which it makes electricity is good but it makes more radiation than electricity! Right after I found this out I ordered that the reactor be shut down for some serious maintenance. It took almost 8 hours to shut it down and after that it still was hot. It took 10 days for all the radiation to be filtered out of it so people could install a better reactor core. I helped design this reactor core so I knew if it was working properly or not. It was in the middle of august 1985 when it was installed. The Leader of the Facility was very impressed and Serhiy and I was promoted to the head of design and testing of the Reactors!

	The next Day was when we all were called to the Promotional Hall and we talked for 30 minutes or so and a man got up on the stage. He was the Leader of the Facility. He said that we are now in order for phase two. Unfortunately I was not informed about a phase2 I had always thought that this facility was only to build and test nuclear reactors. He said the next phase was to be announced by the head of your Branch. I thought to my self that me and Serhiy were the heads of our branch and that we were not informed of any such phase 2. After the speech was over a great cloud of doubt came upon me and I overheard one of the men say, “there was to be a craft to fly to the…” I didn’t catch the last sentence that he said but I knew somehow that something was not as it seemed. As I headed back to my workstation on my desk was a letter. Seeing it was from the leader of the Facility I ran down to Serhiy’s Office and showed it to him. Together we read it and it read, 

	DEAR MR. PANKRATOVA,
PLEASE READ THIS LETTER CAREFULLY BECAUSE ONE MISTAKE AND YOU WILL BE EXCILED. TELL ALL THE WORKERS UNDER YOU THAT THEY NEED TO BEGIN MAKING A COMPACT NUCLEAR REACTER, AND THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH ANOTHER GROUP OF SCIENTIST TO DO THIS. YOU AND MISTER SERHIY WILL BE HEAD OF THE PROJECT LUNAR COSMONAUT 1. THIS PROJECT WILL LAND A HUMAN ON THE MOON FOR A MONTH. MORE INFORMATION WILL BE ON ITS WAY AFTER WE COMPLETE PHASE 2.

	So I did what the letter had said. I told all the scientist that they were to make a compact Nuclear reactor and where going to be working with another group to complete the project. Serhiy and I were on our way to success. Then next couple of ours Phase 2 was in full swing. I was very worried that something was going to go wrong so kept close watch on the progress that was made. I was very surprised how much work was being accomplished, yet the fear of something going wrong was a very startling thing. I always new that though you give someone directions doesn’t always mean that they will follow them. Nevertheless the project kept going strong until one night someone under me tried to start reactor ten! Good thing it was in the middle of no where and had little to no uranium it exploded with massive balls of fire! There was nothing left of this reactor and critical power levels set phase two back a couple of days. Then almost instantly the Leader of the Base laid a note on my desk reading,

	DEAR MR.PANKRATOVA,
IF ONE MORE THING GOES WRONG YOU WILL BE EXILLED ALONG WITH SERHIY. 

	This lead to mass confusion. After the autumn leaves had all fell and the winter started to set in the reactor ten was rebuilt and full power was restored. Soon it was December and the Facility began showing signs of the holiday cheer! Christmas was almost here and all the people that worked in or on the facility was all called together on December 24 for the Christmas Eve party! Everyone except the administrators was there. The promotion hall was decorated in beautiful lights and holly everywhere. They even let you send letters to your family. So I was one of the 50 people in line to write a letter and when my time came to write a letter I wrote,

	




	DEAR WIFE AND KIDS,
MERRY CHRISTMAS! I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE A NICE CHRISTMAS. I MISS YOU A LOT AND CANNOT WAIT TO SEE YOU THIS COMING JUNE! 

				LOVE YOU
					SASHA PANKRATOVA

	When you’re away from your family you understand that the holidays are the hardest of all. Good thing Serhiy was around or I don’t know what I would do! He cheers me up just by seeing his face!
Though I couldn’t figure out why the Phase was taking so long to complete was my question? The “unknown job” that I supposedly have is tougher than I thought, with the winter coldness that I have to put up with going from one reactor another checking the control rooms for any problems.  The only thing that could go wrong is for something else to go wrong but, I didn’t no if anything else would go wrong and if so what? My mind was full of doubts at the current time and the only way to clear my head was to take a shower. The only thing is the showers where community showers and I really hated to take showers other men. I thought it was wrong because I thought I should have my privacy! So I went down at 12:00 am and there was no one there and I was happy that I didn’t have to put up with anyone so I got my shower. But upon exiting there was a very scary sight. A man walked down the hallway with a large rash. I didn’t know what it could have been but I sure wasn’t going to find out. A few days latter it felt like my heart was having a melt down like a nuclear reactor, it was releasing toxic thoughts all through my body. I was lonely because serhiy began working longer hours and I was in the dorm all by myself and when he did come back he seemed to be exhausted and went strait to his bed. Every day he did this and I started getting angry! One night I asked him what he was working on and he said follow me.






== Chernobyl ==


	I went up and followed him down a hallway I had never seen before. After went through a very heavy door he showed me a space training facility. He said that I have also been chosen to Pilot. I was confused Pilot what? This was it the last straw, I was about to do something I had never thought of doing before. Then a man walked up to me and said, “Please follow me,” then he led me to an odd looking machine. It somehow spun tremendously fast and I wondered what it was used for. The man wasn’t that tall and he was very in shape. He told me to get into the machine, buckle the seat belt and plug all the heart monitors to you. So I did as he instructed without hesitation. Then the door to the machine closed and it started to spin and spin and spin! It was going at a record 110 kph and I was scared and it still went faster then all of a sudden it stopped. But as I got out I was very dizzy. As the night progressed I was put through odd test and quizzes. The next day I was permitted to stay in my dorm and sleep so I did. And then Serhiy came in and showed me my test results. Surprisingly I passed every single one! Though I had no idea what they where for.

	The month was March 1986 and the reactors were still making electricity. Nothing had happened except phase 3 was starting and I was permitted to go to Chernobyl on June 3! I couldn’t wait to go back, but poor Serhiy, he would be by himself all alone. So I had to ask if Serhiy could go with me. The next day someone knocked on our door Serhiy proceeded to open it and then it was decided! The man said, “Serhiy is aloud to go with you to Chernobyl.” “YES!” I said.
So we couldn’t wait to get away from the Facility but, the only thing is if spill any information then we are dead! We don’t want to be exiled because of the fact that being exiled is the worst thing that can happen to a soul. You are given a hut like thing in the middle of a mining village in Siberia and you have to mine or they will kill you!

	The days seemed to grow longer. The date was April 25 1986.
Serhiy and I seemed to be celebrating our recent promotion. March the 28 we were promoted to official Cosmonauts! This was an easy way to get money and really fun to. That night I didn’t know this but Serhiy as crazy as he is spiked the punch. And we both were really drunk because he emptied three bottles of Vodka into the punch. Nevertheless we were doing really thing we happened to almost bust a hole in the wall because we were seeing who was the strongest! We had never in our friendship had ever gotten into a fight or argument. 

	The next day I was in the middle of work and then the Television sets all came on. Everyone thought it was just a briefing but in fact it was much more than that. They started showing pictures of Chernobyl and then it exploded! As I kept watching they showed a map of the city and showed which parts were destroyed and then I saw and heard something I regret from hearing the rest of my life: The Apartment Complex of 12 STREET was destroyed in the blast! I felt my heart start to drop and then I started to cry. I thought of all the good times I had with my family and how they were so innocent and how they didn’t deserve to die. The burning and feeling of loose was all I could feel. I then proceeded to turn of the television. Then I Picked it up and threw it against the wall! At that very moment Serhiy walked in and said, “Why is the Television set broken thrown against the wall?” I said, “Chernobyl’s reactor number four just explode and my wife and children all just died.” He then came over and wrapped his arms around me hoping to comfort me but it didn’t work. This was the only time in my life that Serhiy could not comfort me! The next few days were pain full when I received a letter that stated that my family all perished in the accident. The office laid empty and the workers all taking a break because as you know working on designing things wasn’t easy. After there break it was back to the office for me and the way things were going was really surprising. The Compact reactor was finally finished and the space craft being finished! The Lunar cosmonaut 1 was to be better than what the Americans launched! The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics strived for perfection and to be better than anyone else. A soon as the engines were designed we could work on the actual vehicle. The boosters were being designed and no problems were occurring until a problem that no one thought would happened occurred! We thought that we could generate enough power to ignite and power the rockets while keeping electricity for all the components, but we can’t so we have to figure out how to put enough fuel to get to the moon. So after a couple days I said to myself if I do figure this out then I will be proud, but I know that I will not be promoted unless Serhiy gets promoted. The following days made me wonder if we could figure something out because the scientist were very unwilling to contribute there ideas and I was going to go crazy unless they would help so I prayed and then finally it was answered. The next day a man named Jonathan came to work for me. His family was immigrants from America and this lead me to believe that he couldn’t speak Russian. Then without a thought he spoke Russian saying, “Hello my name is Jonathan. It is a pleasure to meet you.” And he just walked on. 
	Whe the other scientist told him what the problem was he started to think…then he found it, the solution to the problem! Maybe if we mounted the fuel tanks on the side of the craft we could save space. The idea seemed to work and he was a very good designer. I had to promote him to the head of design and so he was working my old job. He was keeping the operation going and we actually were ahead of all the rest of the Facility. The Leader of the Facility sent me a letter of Congratulations stating,

	DEAR MR.PANKATOVA,
SORRY ABOUT YOUR FAMILLY. ALSO I AM PROUD OF YOUR HARD WORK AND SO I AM GOING TO MAKE YOU HEAD OF THE WHOLE PROGRAM. 

That night I went to see his secretary and told her to tell him that I would not accept the promotion. And then she paged his office stating that I did not except the promotion. As soon as she told him this he seemed startled and asked why. I said, “I want to work with Serhiy”

				


== Flight to the heavens ==


	“No you can not work with Serhiy” he said. So I decided to leave it at that though I had really wished that some how I could work with Serhiy but as I had been told I must not for some odd reason. The next couple of weeks I had gotten use to my new job. The job was to oversee the office Serhiy was working in. It was an easy job and if I wanted to go Serhiy I could! The only thing is that Serhiy couldn’t see me. The good thing is that I saw him every day at work and in our dorm. That wouldn’t last for long because I was promoted to a dorm with a shower, a kitchen, and living room with a bedroom. That was it! I was lonely! The next couple of months were hard because I had been so caught up in all this project, Plus I had to pilot the Lunar Cosmonaut 1 to the moon alone for 1 month. The “time to fly” seemed so far away, the scheduled date: July 22 1986, the time: 9:00 am. More and more training had to be done so I would be able to pilot this thing! As young as I am I should be able to pilot this thing, I am 31years old for crying out loud. I mean you would think that Serhiy would be able to pilot it he is only 25 years old. I didn’t want to pilot it because I was afraid that I would forget something and that I would kill myself. That was what I was so worried about. Then one day Serhiy had some papers he needed to give to me and he heard me say that I was worried about killing myself. He said, “Don’t worry you’ll be fine.” I just smiled.

	After I had moved and Serhiy and I had no problem being spread apart. He and I noticed that something was going wrong. Every night in the hallway of his dorm was a strange smell! So we ignored it because some people would think that it would be weird to report a strange smell. So as the days went on and the days were fewer to launch I grew worried. Some of the staff said don’t worry, but that’s hard not to do. One day about a week before I had to pilot the craft to space, Serhiy had a rash on him! I thought to myself that maybe it was a small skin rash, but then! In my brain I remembered that man with the rash walking down the hall. His death was in the news letter that the facility handed out! It read,

MAN DIES OF CANCER
MAN THAT WORKED ON ONE OF THE 
REACTORS GET A CANCER AND DIES.

I thought that this could be the same cancer that killed that man! “Serhiy, Serhiy that rash is cancer” I said. “No it’s not, your crazy” he said. “Please go to the nurse that works here and have it checked” I said. He agreed and so we went to the nurse and she sat him on the examining table. “Sir you have a form of cancer caused by exposure to radiation from the nuclear Reactors” the nurse said. “Oh my god! What the heck is happening to me! I’m going to die!” Serhiy said. I started to mourn and said to the nurse, “Is there anything we can do?” “No she said. We could help him if we sent him to Moscow, but he’s not allowed out of the facility.” Serhiy and I went to the dorm where I stayed and I said, “Do you think it was the smell?” “What smell” he said. “The smells that we keep smelling in the hallway were your dorm is” I said in anxiety. “Maybe” he mumbled. “You know you can’t just sit around here and not do anything. You just can’t give up. Were is the Serhiy I used to know?” I said. Then he got up slammed the door shut and left. I knew he was depressed but I couldn’t do any thing to help him. He was tired and so I decided he should go to bed. I did the same thing too.

	Believe it or not the day of the launch was tomorrow! I looked all the papers over and over until I couldn’t see! I found out that Serhiy was working on the ground team that launched the space craft into space. I was told to tell everyone that I needed to goodbye that day. So I stopped to tell Serhiy goodbye. He was setting in his office with his head lying on the desk. I said, “Bye Serhiy” he responded in a sad voice, “You know I probably will die by the time you get back, you have been a brother to me and even when we met I knew there was a connection. I wish you didn’t have to leave me. If I’m dead please come and see me in the grave.” “I will” I said. I left and he just started to cry, then I closed the door to his office. That was the last time I would see him. So I returned to my dorm and got a good sleep.
Then as I awoke it was 6:00 am and the papers said to be in the office at 7:00 am. As I ate my breakfast I thought of how scary the flight would be. As I took a shower the water was so cold and I thought of the cold loneliness of my family being dead. As I walked down the long narrow hallway that seemed to never end. I had remembered how I walked down the hallway for the first time. Oh and how I remembered how Serhiy and I had first met. How we partied and got drunk. Thus leading to the room were I put the space suit on. I put the suit on layer by layer, and as I thought of what Serhiy said. I then went to the launch control room and found Serhiy’s computer module and wrote,




Dear Serhiy,
I love you like a brother never change, Hang in there and beat the cancer so I can see you when I get back. 
			Love,
				Sasha Pankratova

As I wrote this my hands trembled and I started to cry. It was 8:30 when Serhiy found this note by then I was already in the space craft. As the minutes ticked away I found myself in a state of depression. All that I knew and loved was a light year away from me! It was 8:55 when the launch sequence began and in a matter of 5 minutes I was in space. I knew that there was no turning back because I was in flight to the Heavens!





== Stranded ==


	As I soared through the sky I felt the G forces on my stomach. The sensations of being punched in the stomach, which lead me to remember the time in school, were a kid happened to punch him in the stomach. This left him to remember his friends. Along with the hours that passed came memories and memories, some meaningful and some meaningless. Then looking at the panel above read, [MOON KEEPER-LUNAR COSMONAUT 1] it was what I had created, a monster. I created a monster that separated me from the world. If I hadn’t got this job maybe I wouldn’t have lost my family to Chernobyl, and maybe Serhiy wouldn’t have this cancer and… Maybe I wouldn’t be remembering all this stuff in my head! Lost among memories I was falling asleep just to find myself exiting the earth’s atmosphere. I was told that I may go to sleep. As the days went on I was nearing the moon until I was there.

	 I was skimming the moons surface preparing to land when a frequency came in that I needed to land in the sea of clouds which is 50 km ahead of you. As I proceeded to land there I knew that I would be spending a month there and that I would not be able to go back. The option of going back was something I usually had but not now, no, I couldn’t go back ever. As I landed I felt the boosters start and I started to plummet to the ground. Since I was on the ground I stared at the earth and that how I would be spending an eternity up here. The darkness all around me the absence of other humans was hard for me. It was hard enough not knowing anybody in a room let alone having no one in a room. Though I felt like god in a way because I looked at the humans from space, but god isn’t alone he has angels to keep him company. As I prayed to god I prayed for Serhiy and his cancer and myself being all alone. The cold lonely space was very scary also the fact that I might get stuck up here to rot. Though I knew that man always relied on his creations but this was one situation that Moon Keeper was causing me to be independent, like the cave men I thought that I had to recreate fire up here to survive! I then received a transmission to stay put, and not to go out into space. Though as I thought that I was going to be ok Moon keeper didn’t seem to shelter me anymore, instead it seemed to try to strangle me and send me adrift in space among the stars fending for myself. Without resources to use to my advantage. It was my enemy the Metal Cold hearted Moon Keeper. As I fell asleep I thought of how it would be such an experience up here after all if I die, I die! After the first couple of days I felt sick. I radioed back to the facility and asked if there was any pain killer on board. They responded saying, “Yes, in the sleeping quarters underneath the cabinet in the closet.” So I went and retrieved the medicine and started to suit up to walk on the moon! I had no partners no company to make sure I do everything right, so I went and put the Soviets flag in a crater where I think I saw a piece of a space probe! So I dug through the lunar dirt until, at last! This was the space probe Lunas probe 1! It was launched in 1969 in part of the race to space. It didn’t succeed because it crashed into the moon and never gave anymore readouts. It all made since to receive its computer memory core, so maybe it could give us some info on how it crashed. After the first half of the month I had done so many sample collections and test on the environment that I was crazy!

	Then all at once I lost contact with the Facility and I couldn’t gain contact for the next couple of days! I began to worry and worry because for a whole week I had no contact! When I did gain contact I received notice of a very startling subject! Serhiy died of cancer two days before I regained contact on June 21 1986! I was so mad now to the earth no more friends, no family, and no help my soul stranded on this body of rock and the world just inside my grasp, everything cold hearted. The earth where I seaked comfort I only had a cold hearted piece of turf. 

	 As it grew closer and closer to go back to earth I thought that it would be nice to put a piece of me on the moon’s surface. So I took one of my favorite shirt which was green with yellow stripes and cut a piece of it and laid it by the Soviet flag and then I prepared for the days ahead. It took great knowledge and time to make sure that the Nuclear power reactor was in check. Then I had to make sure all the computer systems were online and working. The communication outlet was getting jammed frequently and the on board flight computer started to act a little funny. Then many people on the ground team started to notice that a weird deterioration of the outer tiles and the probe was starting to sink into the lunar surface! The ground team said that no one had thought that this would happen to the space craft and that the only way to fix it would be to send a space probe with a emergency repair kit to my current location. I knew that it would take to much money and to long to do it because by the time it was done and up here I would run out of oxygen and food! So it seemed that I was stranded.





== Dealing among the Stars ==


	As if my life was just like a game of cards, every time I lost it seemed some one would die! It was a game I would lose for death was about to come upon me. For the next day I checked the fuel, the gages read,

Bottom Left rocket-50%-Good
Bottom Right rocket-45%-Fair
Top Left rocket-12%-Critical
Top Right rocket-45%-Fair
Center Buster rocket-0%-Warning! No fuel left for reentry 

I radioed back to the Facility and told them what the gages said. They responded and said I was most likely not going to make it home. And that if I wanted to try to make it home I could. The consequences were that if I didn’t make it home I would most likely orbit earth for four years and run out of food and oxygen or burn up in the earth’s atmosphere! Though I knew I wouldn’t make it I told them that tomorrow I would try to launch back to earth! They sent the onboard flight computer the way to launch and the monitor read,

Launch using all the rockets then use little to none upon entering orbit. Then use the rockets to propel into a definite entry point until you have gained enough speed. Then try to make the flotation devices inflate and someone should pick you up.
Enter the atmosphere above Australia and then hit the Bering Sea.

That night I said the longest prayer I think I have ever said. I asked god to help me get to heaven when I die and that I want you to do what was in your will. I didn’t sleep easy that night, I tossed and I turned and had night mares about dieing! I then realized that Serhiy and I had a bond. We both died serving the Soviet Union and we also had both had no family left so did I have anything to look forward to on earth? Was this just another nightmare? Was there any hope for me? And if I survived what would be my next job.

	The next day I had to launch the Space craft. I got ready said a prayer, and sat in the pilots seat. I radioed the facility and told them that I will be going back to earth and that I was going to start in about 10 minutes. I then started up all the computer systems and then went to launch mode. As soon as I switched the fuel on button and then hit the ignite booster I began to raise slowly off the moon and Moon Keeper held our course steady. As we exited the moons gravitational field the Earth seemed to suck us in! I then hit the full of button and we started to orbit! After three days of orbiting the monitor finally Okayed me to start a course into the atmosphere. I hit the fuel on and ignite and we started to plummet toward earth! It was a very startling feeling having made it this far, just after we entered though tiles started to fly of the vehicle. The sensors started displaying messages like this,
On board Flight Computer
The tiles on the side of the Vehicle are deteriorating and that the Vehicle is heating up and at any second may explode!
When all sensors say Warning excessive heat please hit the abort button on the manual fly control panel.

As soon as it said this we were in the troposphere and I was heading right into the Bering Sea! “Yes!” I cried! After the Flotation devices deployed I realized there waiting for me was the rescue team and as soon as I got out of the Moon Keeper I noticed the name Moon Keeper had been melted off of it. As soon as I returned to the Facility I was greeted with positive replies and then received my pay for the Deadly assignment! I then went to Serhiy’s dorm to see if any thing was left there that he had wanted me to have. Strangely nothing was missing and strangely the door wasn’t locked. I then went to his office and wondered if the was a note for me but there wasn’t and there were still papers on his desk! I went down to my dorm and took a shower and there on my dresser laid a note saying,

I am writing you this letter because I don’t think I will make it much longer.
Serhiy

I knew he was dead but how could you not pity him. I mean he never even got to tell me bye and I couldn’t even see him in his final hours.






== Realizing ==

	That night I fell into a deep sleep and when I woke up I heard a knocking on my door. “Who is it” I said? I then proceeded to open the door and there standing outside my door was…Serhiy! “I thought you were dead?” I said. “No why would you think that.” He said. “We’ll, they contacted me and told me that you were dead.” I said. “Oh, that was somebody else, on the list of people working the ground team that Serhiy was somebody else. Oh, and the rash on my back isn’t cancer!” he said. After we finished our conversation I discovered do to funding problems that the facility was closing down in two days! So I packed my clothes and then Serhiy asked me if I wanted to live with him and his mother in Tartask and we can take care of her! I said why not and then after the next two days we moved there. His mother had a small apartment and was very sick! We always tried to help her but after 10 years she gave up the Ghost. The news paper in the town read,

Locale Woman Dies of Cancer!
Miss Maxine Yakovel died on June 4, 1987. She had been diagnosed with mild cancer in her kidney and did not receive medical attention. She lived for two years with cancer and has lived a long and painful 2 years.

At here funeral the following week Serhiy Gave a speech like no other about his mother and it touched the heart of many people at the funeral. Serhiy and I lived at the apartment for 45 years until I was diagnose with Skin cancer! I lived for 1 year with the cancer. After I died Serhiy experienced very serious depression. Three years after I died he died when he had a stroke and then a massive heart attack just 1 hour apart. After all this time of joy and sadness I realized that though it may be raining the sun is always shining (Though sadness may be upon you god is always there to help you!)! 














== Conclusion ==

	I wrote this fiction story because I wanted to show how these two friends relied on each other and that there is always help somewhere. Moon Keeper is a story that really touched my heart and I hope you enjoy it like I did!
