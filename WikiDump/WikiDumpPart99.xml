Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?
  
COMPLIMENT:
I liked how you were very thorough on each section. You were not affraid to say exactly what you thought and so that helps me see how the article is percieved by others. 

SUGGESTION:
I wish you would ahve picked a different color to write the review in, after reading for a while the pink was hurting my eyes.

EFFECTIVE:
I found effective that you clearly stated what specific areas I needed to work on the article and how you provide some words of encouragement at teh end. Nice touch! 

MORE EFFECTIVE:
To have given an exact example of what you meant by &quot;sentences are to wordy&quot;, Hcomb003.

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

COMPLIMENT: 
I really liked how you were very specific about certain suggestions on areas of the feedback. I also likes when you mentioned that I was picking your brain presenting pondering questions in my introduction. That is the reaction I wanted to create in any potential reader. 

SUGGESTION:
I think you should have used Caps along with bold letter for your review. 

EFFECTIVE:
I liked how you suggested to include more information on the articles to be able to comprehend the learning targets.

I enjoyed reading your comments. I thought each one was very helpful.  I noticed a couple of grammatical errors I made after my article had been peer reviewed. I would just make sure to look over the articles more than once to make sure nothing was overlooked.  Thank you for all your comments. I found them very helpful.

I found the comments on my sidebars to be very positive and informative. There were a couple grammatical errors I found after my article was peer reviewed. I would possibly check the article I was reviewing a few times to make sure I did not miss anything. Other than that I appreciate everything said and found. Thank you!

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

Be more specific in your responses, maybe show where spelling errors occur. 

Suggestions for improvement were understandable and helpful.</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

The author of my peer review was effective about choosing which section of the paper to edit.....Instead of copying the whole paper and editing the whole paper, the reviewer chose a paragraph that was viewed as being most in need of revisions.  The reviewer then added some helpful reviews to this paragraph....

Suggestion:  the reviewer could have given some additional comments on mechanics and grammar rather than just giving edits of a pasted paragraph.

I considered many things from this particular feedback.  I revised my learning targets and some grammatical errors.  I felt like I did consider my bias in sources, although I could have provided the other side to the federal curriculum debate.  However, that is a paper on its own.  I simply tried to present the issue as a current debate without giving any of my opinions.  I also changed my fourth multiple choice question accordingly.  Thanks.

I changed a few things after reading this feedback.  I changed how some of my references were cited.  I edited a learning target and multiple choice responses.  Overall I appreciate the feedback.  It was difficult to find some of the grammatical errors mentioned, but I eventually located the problem.  Thanks.

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

Your feedback is very specific and detailed. Thank you for fully reading the article and reviewing all areas. The feedback allowed me to go back to specific areas in the article to make my changes, and I did not have many questions or confusion. 

In the grammar and feedback review, there are some suggestions as to what ideas or sentences should be added to certain parts of my article. To make this more effective, I would prefer that this information was put in a different section and just the grammar and mechanics be reviewed in that section.</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

There were some good, specific suggestions at the end of the review. I found this most effective, and I liked the specific suggestion to remove some of the sources for the reader to investigate on their own.

Please provide more specific detailed feedback throughout the entire peer review. There was no explanation of ratings, the grammar and mechanics section review was not copied and pasted, and the review was less than 150 words. I greatly appriciate your rating, but please offer some feedback as to why I received each rating in the areas of importantance, interest, credibility and writing skill. Thank you!</text>

Many of the gramatical errors were clearly shown and pointed out. This made it easy to go back and fix them.

I appreciate the suggestions but sometimes it was confusing to read (maybe could have been a bit more concise with explanations). Overall, very helpful feedback. Thank you.

It was easy for me to see the gramatical errors that I made because you pointed them out clearly. Thank you for your suggestions as to how to fix them!

Some of the comments seemed very short, it may have been helpful if you had elaborated on why something was confusing/didn't seem right so that I knew how to fix it. Overall, very helpful though.

You were a little less harsh on me than I would have been, but that's your prerogative. Thank you for the compliments and I'm glad it was (at least somewhat) amusing.

If you've any idea for sidebars or pictures... I was going to freehand something ridiculous to go with the title, but I'm pretty sure my drawing ability is terrible. I'll have to see. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 02:39, 19 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

Compliment: The most effective thing was pointing out the careless spelling and grammar errors that I tend to commonly make.

Suggestion: For the corrections in my actual article, if they could not only be in all caps, but also in another color. It's still hard to find them when they're black.

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

Compliment: Most of the feedback was very helpful in revising my article and finding my careless grammar/mechanics errors.

Suggestion: For the most part, I have no suggestions. Everything was good and helpful.

I thought the review was had a good amount of feedback.  I believe the feedback would have been more effective if there were a little more detail in explanations.

'''Thank you for the comments and suggests...your review was very concise
I especially liked the review and suggestions regarding the grammar section...I will definatly use your suggestions
One suggestion might be to specifically state what part of that sentence was confusing to you so that I could go from there and change the wording...other than that, everything was well reviewed...thanks again[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 19:26, 18 June 2009 (UTC)'''</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

'''Compliment''': Thank you for reviewing my article. I appreciate your revisions under the grammar section. I am revising my article with both peer reviewer's suggestions in mind.
'''Suggestion''': Feedback is more effective when specific examples are given so that the reader thoroughly understands what the reviewer is referring too.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 08:14, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

The feedback was very specific so it is easy to see what needs correction.

Perhaps the reviewer could be more specific as to which answers they would like to see expanded on.</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

The feedback was very specific and reflected the review criteria exactly.

I'm trying to come up with a suggestion but I thought the review was fair and accurate.  Most of the APA citation errors are because the information was just not to be found.  Also, I'm very confused about the coding errors as they were not there when my article was posted.</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

Your suggestion on modification of my learning targets lead me to reevaluate them. I rewrote two targets to make them more specific.

While I understand your concern about the formatting of my citations and the use of older materials, APA guidelines state how to format a source found within a source. I followed those guidelines while citing my sources. Those same guidelines require I list the secondard source in my references, which is where the old sources come into play. In actuality, my source is dated 2006 with secondary sources listed with a later date. Just trying to keep the professor happy and myself on the right side of the law!

Thanks for the grammar and mechanics check. I would suggest copying the article and placing the just the corrections in another color. They are easier to locate when they jump out at you.

Great work!

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

Your suggestions were clear and concise.  I am especially grateful for your thorough grammar check.  It is always good to have a second (and third) set of eyes.  I amended my article and it flows nicely.  Thanks!

While I understand your concern about the formatting of my citations and the use of older materials, APA guidelines state how to format a source found within a source.  I followed those guidelines while citing my sources.  Those same guidelines require I list the secondard source in my references, which is where the old sources come into play.  In actuality, my source is dated 2006 with secondary sources listed with a later date.  Just trying to keep the professor happy and myself on the right side of the law!

Your comments were excellent.  Try not to type them in all CAPS.  While I appreciate the comments and suggestions, they go down easier if they aren't &quot;shouted&quot; at you.

Great work!

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?


The peer reviewer was really good at finding grammatical errors that I missed and also making smart suggestions as to how I could improve my article. However, they forgot to explain why they rated me the number they did prior to the rubric.</text>

Thought the author was thorough in locating my grammatical errors.  However, they forgot to explain why they gave me the numerical rating the did prior to the rubric.</text>

I FOUND THAT THE SUGGESTIONS YOU PROVIDED FOR IMPROVEMENT WERE GREAT. IT REALLY MADE ME LOOK AT THE ARTICLE AGAIN AND SEE IT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN MY OWN. BRINGING MY ATTENTION TO THE CITATIONS WAS DEFINITELY A GOOD THING BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT IS NOT MY STRONGEST AREA. I FOUND THIS TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE AS FEEDBACK BECAUSE OFTEN AS THE AUTHOR, IT IS HARD TO ACCEPT CRITIQUES ESPECIALLY IF YOU FEEL YOUR ARTICLE IS FINE JUST THE WAY IT IS. SO I DEFINITELY WELCOMED ALL SUGGESTIONS YOU MADE, AND THEY WERE ALL VALID AND I AM GLAD YOU CAN HELP IMPROVE MY ARTICLE!

MY ONLY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO ADD MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED OR CHANGED WITHIN THE ARTICLE.TO MAKE THE FEEDBACK MORE EFFECTIVE IT COULD INCLUDE SPECIFIC PASSAGES OR QUOTES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED, OR SPECIFYING WHAT ADDITIONAL CITATIONS NEED TO BE FIXED BESIDES THE ONE COPIED AND PASTED. OTHER THAN THAT GREAT FEEDBACK, I REALLY ENJOYED WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY ABOUT MY ARTICLE! :) [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 05:00, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

I FELT YOU DID A GREAT JOB PEER REVIEWING MY ARTICLE. LISTENING TO YOUR FEEDBACK I COULD REALLY SEE WHAT THINGS I NEEDED TO CHANGE THE MOST AND PUT MORE ATTENTION TO. ESPECIALLY YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS, I DEFINITELY CAN SEE WHERE ADDING MORE INFORMATION TO SOME OF THE ANSWERS WOULD PROVIDE A DEEPER LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING FOR READERS. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE OUTDATED SOURCES, AND APPRECIATE THE COMPLIMENT ON THE DIVERSITY OF THE SOURCES! I FELT YOU PROVIDED SPECIFIC DETAILED FEEDBACK, AND I THINK IT WILL HELP TO IMPROVE MY ARTICLE GREATLY!

THERE IS NOT REALLY MANY SUGGESTIONS I CAN THINK OF FOR YOU TO DO, BUT ONE THING WOULD BE TO ADD A LITTLE MORE TO THE DESCRIPTION OF ADDING NEWER SOURCES. MAYBE SUGGESTING A POPULAR OR SCHOLARLY SOURCE? OR A VARYING OPINON? ALSO STATING WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WOULD BE GOOD TO ADD TO THE ANSWERS OF SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE SHORTER. BUT OVERALL, GREAT FEEDBACK!!  [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 05:14, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

==What is strategy?==

Lamb offers an important definition of strategy.  Strategy is also:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_strategy Strategic management] 

{{cquote|Drafting, implementing and evaluating cross-functional decisions that will enable an organization to achieve its long-term objectives. It is the process of specifying the organization's mission, vision and objectives, developing policies and plans, often in terms of projects and programs, which are designed to achieve these objectives, and then allocating resources to implement the policies and plans, projects and programs.||| David 1989}}

This book focuses on strategic management.  Strategy is an ongoing process that develops both long-term and short-term objectives at the strategic and operational levels, establishes and/or modifies the organizational hierarchy to manage operational processes, and determines the suitability, feasibility and acceptability of the strategy.  An explicit way to represent the corporate strategy is using strategy diagrams.  Strategy diagrams aid in all aspects of strategic management.  They allow us to explicitly capture strategic and operational objectives.  Cascading the strategy through the organizational hierarchy provides a means to align strategy with operations.  Finally, using strategy diagrams makes it possible to evaluate the strategy by determining if it is being successfully implemented and if it is the correct strategy.  

An effective BI system must aid in all aspects of strategic management, including the formulation, implementation and evaluation of strategy.  

==Strategic Management==
For our purposes we will define strategic management as a combination of three main processes:
#Strategy formulation
#Strategy implementation
#Strategy evaluation

===Strategy formulation===
Strategy formulation requires examining where you are now, determining where you want to go, and then determining how to get there.  This requires the following three processes: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_strategy]

*Performing a situation analysis, self-evaluation and competitor analysis: both internal and external; both micro-environmental and macro-environmental.
*Concurrent with this assessment, objectives are set. These objectives should be parallel to a timeline; some are in the short-term and others on the long-term.  This involves crafting vision statements (long term view of a possible future), mission statements (the role that the organization gives itself in society), overall corporate objectives (both financial and strategic), strategic business unit objectives (both financial and strategic), and tactical objectives
* These objectives should, in the light of the situation analysis, suggest a strategic plan. The plan provides the details of how to achieve these objectives.

===Strategy implementation===
The implementation process requires the establishment or modification of the organizational hierarchy so that the company can achieve its objectives.  The following items constitute the strategic implementation process:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_strategy]

*Allocation and management of sufficient resources (financial, personnel, operational support, time, technology support)
*Establishing a chain of command or some alternative structure (such as cross functional teams)
*Assigning responsibility of specific tasks or processes to specific individuals or groups
*It also involves managing the process. This includes monitoring results, comparing to benchmarks and best practices, evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the process, controlling for variances, and making adjustments to the process as necessary.
*When implementing specific programs, this involves acquiring the requisite resources, developing the process, training, process testing, documentation, and integration with (and/or conversion from) legacy processes.

===Strategy evaluation===
Johnson and Scholes present a model in which strategic options are evaluated against three key success criteria:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_strategy]

*Suitability (would it work?) - Suitability deals with the overall rationale of the strategy. The key point to consider is whether the strategy would address the key strategic issues underlined by the organization's strategic position.
*Feasibility (can it be made to work?) - Feasibility is concerned with the resources required to implement the strategy are available, can be developed or obtained. Resources include funding, people, time and information.
*Acceptability (will they work it?) - Acceptability is concerned with the expectations of the identified stakeholders (mainly shareholders, employees and customers) with the expected performance outcomes, which can be return, risk and stakeholder reactions.

==Framework approach and Strategy==


Causal link maps identify the causal relationships between goals.  The Activity, Chatterjee and Strategy maps can easily be translated into a causal link map.  The map contains all the 

===Porter - Activity Map (1996)===

Porter argues firms must achieve both operational and strategic effectiveness for superior performance.  Operational effectiveness means performing similar activities better than rivals perform them by better utilizing inputs.  Part, but not all of this, is efficiency.  Companies achieve profitability over time through strategic positioning, meaning performing different activities from rivals' or performing similar activities in a different way.  

Porter focus on strategy as unique activities is crucial.  Firms must choose a set of activities to deliver a unique mix of value.  These activities are linked and mutually reinforcing.  Not only must companies choose the right activities but the essence of strategy is choosing to perform a set of activities different than rivals and are strong enough block any company that would seek the same market.

What does performing different activities than rivals achieve?  Companies achieve profitability over time through strategic positioning, meaning performing different activities from rivals' or performing similar activities in a different way.  They achieve differentiation, which arises from the choice of activities and how they are performed.  A company can outperform rivals only if it can establish a difference that it can preserve

Specifically, to achieve profits companies can focus on two different types of activities.  The first is for companies to provide goods or services with greater value, charge higher prices, thereby increasing revenue.  The second type of activity aims to provide goods or services at a lower cost, reduce costs, thereby increasing profitability.  Porter asserts that activities are the basic unit of competitive advantage.  Competitive strategy is about being different.  Companies must choose different sets of activities to deliver a unique mix of values.

An activity map shows how a company creates value in a competitive market (Morgan et al. 2007).  The map shows which activities a company must align to generate value in the market.  Activity maps identify the most critical activities needed to achieve strategic objectives and the investments necessary to support these activities.  Creating the map requires focusing on the most important activities while putting less important actives to the side.  The final map allows us to determine what projects, programs and activates are critical for a company to achieve its strategic objectives.  The goal is to identify important activities so that it will be possible to develop ways to measure how well the company is performing these activities.  An example of an activity map for Southwest Airlines appears below.

[[Image: Southwest Activity Map.jpg|400px |Southwest Activity Map]]

The dark blue circles denote higher-order strategic offerings.  The light blue circles denote activities or investments tailored to deliver it.

===Chatterjee Map===

Sayan Chatterjee advances the subject of strategy maps by switching the focus to customer outcomes instead of customer needs.  &quot;Focusing on outcomes generates a different set of questions from a focus on needs (Morgan et al 2007 page 153)&quot;.  To this end the Chatterjee Map there starts (from the top) with customer outcomes.  Then the focus becomes the competitive objectives necessary to achieve the customer outcomes.  

In essence, the Chatterjee Map rearranges the Activity Map to reflect customer outcomes.  This provides a different set of objectives and capabilities compared to focusing on customer needs  (Morgan et al. 2007).  

The Chatterjee Map contains four swimming lanes:

;Customer Outcomes
:These generally correspond to the higher-order strategic offerings displayed in the Activity Map.  
;Competitive Objectives
:Also called strategic outcomes are the means by which a company translates core objectives into customer outcomes.  
;Core Objectives
:These are the leading indicators of strategic outcomes (Morgan et al. 2007).  Data on lagging indicators, such as ROI, earnings per share, profit margin, etc., signals success for failure well after there is time to adjust operations.  Excellence in strategic execution at the operational level will correspond to high measures on leading indicators, assuming that the Chatterjee Map is correct.  Low measures on leading indicators could indicate a few problems, such as a problem with strategy-operations alignment, but always signals the need for management to take a closer look at the business.  
;Execution Capabilities
:These are operational resources and activities necessary to execute the strategy.  The execution capabilities align with the strategy.  A lack of alignment will often surface first among the leading indicators.  If unchecked it will in turn will have a ripple effect, propagating up to the customer outcomes.

===Strategy Map===

Strategy maps are a way of providing a macro view of an organization's strategy, and provide it with a language in which they can describe their strategy, prior to constructing metrics to evaluate performance against their strategies (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_map wikipedia article]).  Key Performance Indicators KPI ’s are financial and non-financial measures or metrics used to help an organization define and evaluate how successful it is, typically in terms of making progress towards its long-term organizational goals (see F. John Reh).  The map must show the objectives and how objectives support other objectives. 

Components of a strategy map:

;Four Perspectives
:Financial perspective: Shareholders (profit) versus subsidizers/financers (non profit).
:External Customer perspective: The customer is concerned with:
::Time
::Quality
::Performance and Service
::Cost
:Internal (business) process perspective: Involves:
::Operations management processes
::Customer management processes
::Innovation processes
::Social and regulatory processes.
:Learning and growth perspective: This involves developing the human, information and organizational capital.
;Themes

All strategy diagrams identify important assumptions that drive the strategy.  Strategy maps outline how objectives between different strategic themes and perspectives influence each other.

The purpose of a strategy map is to align the strategy with daily activities.

===Causal Link Map===

&quot;The strategy map is a visual representation of the various cause-and-effect relationships that make up the strategy.&quot; [http://www.businessintelligence.com/article.asp?id=34&amp;pagenum=3]

There are two purposes of reports

#Confirming a Theory/Hypothesis regarding the business (i.e., confirm causal link)
#*Why did it happen?: X--&gt;Y
#*How did it happen?: X1 --&gt;Y2
#Running the business using Business Process Monitoring or prediction
#*What may happen?: Xf --&gt;Yf
#*What happened?: X1 versus X2

This section focuses on reports designed to confirm theories or hypotheses.  This is necessary in order to test the cause-and-effect relationships needed to confirm strategy.  The causal link map explicitly identifies the cause-and-effect relationships between important business concepts. These relationships are important because they allow business leaders to make assumptions about the future performance of a company (Morgan et al. 2007).

Perhaps the most important unifying principle behind all the strategy diagrams is that each explicitly identifies causal links.  First, remember that each strategy diagram is an explicit, tangible model designed to capture strategy.  To capture strategy each diagram/model explicitly identifies important assumptions that drive the strategy.  These assumptions are either a/an:

#Objective
#Activity
#Link between objectives or activities

However, without a means to achieve an objective, or a direction for activity, the company could not function effectively.  So, the company links activities and objectives.  For instance:

* Quicker terminal turnaround (activity) translates into on-time delivery (objective)
* Closing railroad crossings (activity) translates into fewer accidents (objective)
* Minimizing maintenance costs (objective) translates into higher profits (objective)

Each of the bulleted items above is a causal link.  The Activity Diagram, Chatterjee Map and Strategy Map all contain these types of links.  In essence, each type of diagram assumes causal links.  The difference between the diagrams is simply based on the perspective it brings to understanding the strategy.  The activity diagram identifies important higher-order strategic offerings and the activities or investments necessary to execute.  The Chatterjee Map &quot;made a significant contribution to the subject of strategy maps by overlaying a subtle but crucial distinction between a focus on customer outcomes versus customer needs.&quot;  Finally, Norton and Kaplan Strategy Maps offer a process, when combined with scorecards, with the ability to translate specific objectives into leading indicators that help determine if objectives are being met (Morgan et al. 2007).  This helps the decision maker identify those initiatives that will allow the company to achieve its objectives.

Given that all strategy maps contains objectives, activities and links, it is possible to turn any strategy diagram into a causal link map.  Therefore, the unifying principle behind strategy diagrams is that they can all be translated into causal link maps.  The causal link map explicitly identifies the cause-and-effect relationships between important business concepts.  Identifying these relationships is important because they not only allow business leaders to make assumptions about the future performance of a company but also provide them with the means to test these assumptions.  A strategy map is only useful if its empirically testable assumptions are accurate.  The section on scorecards will describe how to test these assumptions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Democracy ==

The family council is recognized as a democratic committee.

* Every family member has one vote.
* Decisions are made in open ballots. Secret ballots can be decided with a [[wikipedia:simple majority|simple majority]].
* All decisions require a simple majority unless the rules ask for [[wikipedia:consensus|consensus]].
* Family members who feel they have been to passed over and have lost in a voting can request a second vote for a later voting. To award the second vote a simple majority is sufficient. Only one further vote per voter is possible but can be preserved indefinitely.
* Changes to these rules require consensus.
* Parents have a [[wikipedia:veto|right of veto]] but it requires the consensus of the parents.  

=== Appointments ===

* The initiator of an appointment is the chairman and allows others to speak.
* The chairman should present an [[wikipedia:agenda|agenda]] one day before an appointment, the adherence of which can be demanded. 
* An appointment can be postponed for one week. Family members who cannot keep an appointment that is supported by a majority are responsible to make a new appointment. The office of chairman is not affected by this and remains with the original initiator.
* The family council can demand willingness for discussions of up to two hours per week.
* An appointment requires consensus of the participants.
* A family member not attending a meeting of the council can delegate his or her vote to another family member without explanation but only if the decision is made in advance. 

=== Discussions ===

* Opinions must be explained, which requires the word &quot;because&quot;.
* An opinion can be rejected as not conclusive, which requires a single majority. Unsubstantiated opinions are ignored; the same applies to resulting votes.
* Explanations about the topics being discussed can be demanded by every participant and must be given. If a relevant explanation is not given the family council is no longer quorate (competent to make decisions). The chairman also allows others to speak when explanations are given.

== Assignment of tasks ==

* The family council can assign and withdraw household tasks and obligations.
* The family council can use a [[wikipedia:Job_rotation|rotation system]] for tasks.
* Assigned household tasks should not exceed four hours per week.
* The family council can impose a penalty of another four hours per week upon disregard of the council.

== Budgets and other resources ==

* Expenditures and the distribution of other resources can be regulated in the family council.  
* Usage of rooms, pocket money, choice of meals, computer time and TV time can be seen as resources.

== Lists ==

The following lists are annotations to the rules of the family council and can be changed in consensus only.

=== List of problems ===

Problems are meant to be seen as [[wikipedia:anti-pattern|anti-pattern]]s the family council has agreed to prevent.

=== List of decisions ===

Decisions are important choices the family council has agreed to append to the rules of the council as a reminder.

== Comments (1 + 1) ==


Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

Compliment: Most of the comments were very straight forward and specific. This will make it easy to change problem areas. (Example: color of the side bars)

Suggestion: Give examples from the article when making general comments. For instance, you said that you feel there is bias in the article, specifically mention portions of the text so it is more easily remedied. Bias is difficult for an author to see so it is best to point it out explicitly so it can be avoided.

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

Compliment: Thank you for the very specific points in the rubric describing my article. 

Suggestion: Next time it would probably be best to fill in the entire template without so many blanks. Also more specific feedback, and suggestions would be beneficial.

The peer reviewer did provide good feedback on the article's learning targets. 

The peer reviewer did not complete the majority of the peer review, making it difficult for the author to do a sufficient revision.</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?

I really appreciated the comments made by the peer reviewer. I felt that they are very achievable and will certainly do my best to improve my article. I thought that the most effective comment was that I should expand my FAQ page. I felt that I covered all bases, but I can now see that there is room for more relevant information.

With this being a FAQ page, I have a hard time putting in a lot of my own thoughts/opinions. Perhaps a section at the bottom would remedy this by giving me an opportunity to express my thoughts but still keeping the FAQ clean and free of opinions or bias.

I think that this peer reviewer did an excellent job of reviwing my article. It was easy to understand, and gave me specific details that I could use to improve my article.  
However, I am having a hard time with one of the suggestions that was given. The suggestion was that I should add more opinions and personal touches to the article. I can see more of that in the other types of special feature articles, but have a hard time putting a lot of opinions and such in the Chapter FAQ.

Thank you for reviewing my article.  I couldn't find much that you overlooked regarding the quality of my article.  I realize now I have a few things I want to &quot;beef up&quot;.  Also, thanks for catching some of my gramatical errors.

I believe all my sources were scholarly and not popular, as I found them in educational journals.  Some of the grammar was correct that you said was in correct.  (You're = You are &amp; I'm is I am.) Thanks for looking over it.  

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?</text>

Provide ONE compliment and ONE suggestion for your peer reviewer. For example, what did you find most or least effective? What would make the feedback more effective?
&lt;BR&gt;
Compliment -  Did a good job of acknowledging that I can use my expert as a resource.  During the interview I didn't even think that I could use them as a scholarly source.
&lt;P&gt;
Suggestion - Make sure to use to rubric in your reviews.  While you quoted them in your ratings, sometimes it helps to see where you fall on the actual rubric diagram.</text>

==About this book==
This book is brought to you by many [[Java Programming/Authors &amp; Contributors|authors and contributors]] as well as anonymous editors.
==Introduction==
This book is an introduction to programming in [http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/index.htm Oracle-Sun&amp;rsquo;s Java&amp;trade; programming language], a widely used programming language and software platform. This book serves as a comprehensive guide, complete with a [[Java Programming/Tutorials|series of tutorials]] to help users better understand the many ways one can program in Java. In its entirety, this book is meant to be both an introductory guide and a useful reference on Java and related technologies. As is the nature of this book, the content within the book is continuously being updated and revised. With every chapter within this book, the complexity of the context increases, building up on lessons learnt in the previous chapters. Beginners should therefore start from the beginning and proceed in a sequence throughout the material of the book.

Other special purpose books on Java, such as Java Enterprise Edition programming, [[Java Persistence]], or Java Swing programming, with more details, would complement this book nicely.

As requested, I've gone over your book's wording and corrected typos or errors where I found them.  I also improved the use of your question and answer templates so they are easier to edit and use wiki code to achieve the same effect.  The answers were also too small to read because of the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag around them.  I put tables around the questions and answers and gave the tables a fixed width so they do not extend all the way across the screen unnecessarily.  Additionally, I gave the question and answer table rows a fixed height so the text on the page does not bounce up and down when an answer is shown.  I improved the code of the pages and made it so your vocabulary tables sit side-by-side instead of top-to-bottom.  I added a horizontal rule above your navigation to improve the appearance.  I think the book looks quite good now.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:17, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is under construction.  It will be a child's field guide to the flowers in bloom in Northern New England in the summer.  As such it will avoid technical terminology and feature many photos of the &lt;s&gt;inflorescenses, foliage, and habit&lt;/s&gt; (ack! technical terms!) flowers, leaves, and plant form of several species.

==How to Use This Book==
This book works best if you can take it with you out in nature as an aid in identifying wild flowers that bloom during the summer in Northern New England (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont).  It does not cover the flowers that people try to grow in their gardens.  Those are usually a lot harder to identify.  

Look around in nature for flowers first, and ''then'' see if you can figure out what they are.  This book is organized first by the flower's ''main'' color, with five sections:
*[[/White Flowers/]] {{stage short|100%|17 June, 2009}}
*[[/Yellow and Orange Flowers/]]{{stage short|100%|25 June, 2009}}
*[[/Red and Pink Flowers/]]{{stage short|100%|25 June, 2009}}
*[[/Blue and Purple Flowers/]]{{stage short|00%|17 June, 2009}}
*[[/Green and Brown Flowers/]]{{stage short|00%|17 June, 2009}}

Some colors are grouped together because sometimes it's hard to tell which of two colors a flower is.  Is it red, or is it pink?  Blue or purple?  Sometimes it's hard to tell.  

Some flowers have more than one color (like white petals with a yellow center).  Flowers have been placed in the color chapters based on their main color, so whichever color it is the ''most'', that will tell you which chapter to look in first.  If a flower is a very light, light, blue, and you have to look really closely at it to see that it has a touch of blue - it will be located in the white chapter, because it is mostly white.  You shouldn't have to think too hard to figure out which chapter it's in, but if you can't find it under one color, try another.

Once you've decided which color the flower is and have found that chapter, look at the chapter's index page.  The flowers on these pages are sorted by where you are most likely to have found them.  Each chapter has three sections:
*In Yards or Fields
*In Forests
*In or Near Water
If you found the plant in a sunny place such as a yard or a field, look first in the &quot;In Yards or Fields&quot; section.  If it was growing in a shady place like in the woods, check the &quot;In Forests&quot; section.  If it was growing in a pond or on a river bank, check the &quot;In or Near Water&quot; section.  Simple, right?  I hope so!

Now you should have it narrowed down pretty good.  Scan the pictures in the section looking for a photo that looks like the flower you have found in nature.  Don't stop looking as soon as you see something close - look for the ''best'' match.  Some flowers tend to look a lot alike, and we have grouped these together so hopefully you can see them all at once.  If you can't tell which it is by looking at the index page, find the flower's page within the section.  Then read the description of the plant on that page.  If there are look-alikes, the description will point out some differences for you to look for.  

If you still can't figure out what it is, well... maybe it's not in this book.  Maybe you found it in the Spring or in the Autumn, and this book only deals with ''Summer'' flowers.  Or maybe you found it outside Northern New England.  Or maybe we just missed it when we put this book together.  If you want to, you could add it to this book yourself. Take a picture and upload it to http://en.wikibooks.org, and then leave a note on this book's [[Talk:Summer Flowers of Northern New England|talk page]].  Someone here will be glad to help you.  If that doesn't work, and you still want to know what the flower is, try sending a photo of the flower to Mr. Smarty Plants at http://www.wildflower.org/expert/ which is a gang of very friendly plant scientists.  If they can't help you... maybe no one can?

Have fun looking for flowers.  See how many you can identify!  If you're learning the name of the flower, why not learn the scientific name too?  Then you can surprise everyone when you start sounding like a scientist yourself.

In 2004, Theo Van Gogh directed the film, &quot;Submission&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia entry for [[w:Submission_(film)|Fitna]]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Even though the movie was a fictional story about a muslim woman, the story was based on the interpretation of the Koran and centred in role of muslim women.  Later that year, Van Gogh was murdered by a muslim named Mohammed Bouyeri&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Mohammed Bouyeri]]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The author, muslim-turned-atheist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, is still criticized by the Muslim leadership for her criticism of Islam, including death threats.&lt;ref&gt;http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/print_503977.html Furor over author Ayaan Hirsi Ali's visit stirs debate on religious freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUXpYswi7ck Ayaan Hirsi Ali death threats -France24 EN&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Geert Wilders released a film called Fitna&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Fitna_(film)]]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The film argued that Islam encourages acts of terrorism, antisemitism, and violence against women and homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamhouse.com/tp/107068 The anti-Islam Dutch film – comment, criticism and advice]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In conformity with the Quran ==
* Muslims have more freedoms in the USA than in some Arab or Muslim countries.

== In contradiction with the Quran ==
* Supports Israel. Israel has fought a series of wars with neighboring Arab states, and in consequence, Israel controls territories beyond those delineated in the 1949 Armistice Agreements.
* Permits the public expression of sexual acts.
* Permits torture. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almoslim.net/node/111400 التعذيب الديمقراطي,موقع المسلم]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Has no alcohol prohibition.
* Land of cinema ,movies and video clips.
{{TODO|Some of these items need a rewrite to be directly related to the subject matter.  Supporting Israel is problematic but not directly against the Quran, probably linking it to a similar list on Israel and then explain what are the violations.|Islam In The World}}

== External opinions ==
* Many Muslims perceive that US cultural, political and economic hegemony as enemy number one.

== How to get Students to take Ownership for their own Learning ==
I have found that with my own children as well as myself self-assessment is a good way to pretest yourself as well as involve the students. As the articles stated students have better retention when they have a personal interest in the lesson. Having students create questions after the lesson has been presented gets them involved. Whether those questions would be actual test questions is up to the teacher but I have has teachers use this technique in my children's class and they feel great when their question is on a test.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 23:25, 26 June 2009 (UTC)

I just submitting a huge paragraph on how students can keep records on objectives of a course, making note the ones they've learned and still need to learn.  I talk about how they continue to update as they take assessments and follow up assessment.  I'm on my honor to say that I did this, but I lost the material because I'm having internet connection difficulties.  [[User:Mbrowder|Mbrowder]] ([[User talk:Mbrowder|talk]]) 20:58, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

Both of the articles read were found to be very interesting.  I would help my students take ownership for their own learning using many techniques.  I would really like to teach a lesson and have the students make up questions that were from the lesson.  I would like to come up with some &quot;game show&quot; ideas for the students to apply their questions they made.    I also like the idea of having the students teach a lesson or part of a lesson to the rest of the class.  I think this is a great way to assess what exactly the children have taken from the lessons taught by the teacher.  I also think projects are a great way to assess what students have learned from a lesson.  I really liked the idea of giving our quizzes and not grading them.  i think doing this before a big tests will allow the students to feel less pressured when the graded tests are given.  I think using assessments will definitely help students feel more confident when taking graded tests. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 16:03, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


As a science teacher, I used hands-on learning opportunities not only to reinforce class content, but as an assessment tool to identify areas of success and those in need of improvement.  Scientific inquiry through experiments are a great assessment tool.  I divide the class into small groups (4-5) and make sure that each group contains a variety of learners from diverse backgrounds.  Each person is assigned a specific duty: leader, scribe, organizer (makes sure that the group has the materials they need to perform the task), and scientist (performs actual tasks).  This gives individual students an opportunity to explore a topic and formulate their own set of questions to be tested.  While I walk around the room, I am taking notes on what I see and hear, as well as stop and pose questions to a group or student.  When the experiment is over, students can share what they have learned from an activity.  From their discussion I can make decisions regarding plans for future lessons and whether a topic should be re-examined.  The best part is that the kids are having a blast and learning at the same time while I am assessing and giving feedback in a positive environment.

I really enjoyed reading these two articles as they offered some great ideas and suggestions! The second article was really interesting to read because it was from the perspective of a teacher learning from his/her mistakes. I think this is a great way to explain some of these concepts because it helps young teachers understand common misconceptions and offers some solutions. To help students retain information better and learn from their own mistakes, I will try to use as much review of test materials as possible. In this way, the tests will not only serve as a grade, but as a way for the student to understand why he or she made mistakes, how to change them and why it is necessary. Time does not always allow for one on one teaching and reviewing, so I will also use peer reviewing, editing of their own individual work (not only correcting answers but giving reasons as well) and constant feedback. With all of these methods, students will know where they stand and can begin to understand how they learn and why this is important.

These two articles really shed some light on the importance of assessment and feedback.  Both articles were very informative.  I especially liked the first one and the ideas that it suggested.  I think the nongraded quiz is a great idea.  This will take pressure off of student and help teacher know who needs help and what may need to be emphasized again.  The thought of highlighting phrases on scoring guide reflecting strengths and areas for imporovement and stapling to work is a good way to give feedback.  Which we all know is also so important.  Another really great way to engage students in their learning process is having them comment on their own progress.[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 23:46, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

Though it could potentially be disastrous, I would allow students a multitude of choices to depict what they have learned. Research papers, presentations, critical analysis– whatever peaks their interest, allows them to explore an area that interests them in a way that is adequate with their desired way of learning. That is not to say I would allow them to be unguided or totally free of constraints. To ensure things don't go sour, I would have to keep tabs on their progress, giving feedback as they go along. Even if they figure what they chose doesn't work best for them, they'll have learned why. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 19:28, 12 June 2009 (UTC)


I don’t think I could honestly say I would do this or that I would do that, one thing I do know is I would rely on the advice and techniques of experienced teachers. I do know that everyone learns differently, so assessments would have to vary. [[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 02:53, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

I really liked these articles on assessment.  I really learned a lot about how to do assessments and what to look for when doing assessments for students.  I like the idea of doing graphic organizers. Graphic organizers would not only give the students, but the teacher something concrete to see how well they knew the subject. One graphic organizer I would use specifically is the K-W-L-H graphic organizer because the student would fill out the organizer before the lesson was read, share their responses with the class, and as the lesson goes along see how they did with the subject. When the lesson is over, go back to the K-W-L-H organizer and compare what the students wrote. I think letting the students take responsibility for their own learning is a great way to get them involved and interested in their learning.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 21:20, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

I absolutely loved the idea in the second article to have assess students through multi forms.  There were examples of drawings and discussions...even music would be an amazing aspect when done in the right setting.  I find that it is great when students are placed in groups to work individual yet receive feedback from the other students.  Each student has something unique to bring to a discussion and a different point of view and it is important for all students to be heard.  I would believe that students take ownership in learning when they are given many interesting topics for to meet the needs of many and giving them some freedom as to how they would like to express what they have learned. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 00:26, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

Reading the articles and reviewing the class lecture really opened my eyes to the fact that students greatly benefit from being involved in their own learning. If I were teaching SOL 2.6 (The student will investigate and understand basic types, changes, and patterns of weather), there are many steps I would take to allow the students to take ownership for their own learning. The first thing I would do would be to share the objectives with the students at the beginning of the unit. I would have the students write the objectives in their own words, so they clearly understand all components. I would have them write their own goals and keep track of their own performance of the objectives. I may also have the students develop their own rubric, and conduct self and peer reviews. I think by taking these steps, I as the teacher would be able to see what the students know or don't know, and what they can do or can't do. I would see who and what I needed to re-teach, what the strengths and weaknesses of my students are, and how to group my students for instruction.

I think one of the best ways to put students in control of their own learning is to have them make up multiple choice questions that have the potential of being featured on their next test. This not only gives students some say in how they are tested, but it requires them to look at what they've learned and how it should be assessed. Another good way to put students in control of their own learning is to have them complete group assignments. Though many students dislike working in groups, it is very helpful. They not only learn from whatever assignment they are given, but they also teach each other. Group work is a very helpful way to have students work together, as well. Having students make a list of their own goals is also a very good way to put students in control of their own learning. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 22:37, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

Assessments are valuable information tools for both students and teachers.  They provide teachers a greater understanding as to what students are interested in, how far they have come in their journeys, where they want to go, and where they are going.  I am a firm believer in project-based learning.  With that said, students in my classroom will learn curriculum with hands-on, sensori-motor activities.  They will be able to explore curiosities and answer questions that are important to them under given principle topics.  By giving students more choice and control in the ways they express their learning, teachers are giving themselves more room to observe how and what students are learning.  This informal assessment method allows students more autonomy in the classroom; while a teacher has the opportunity to discover strengths and weaknesses in each student, or even groups of students.  Observation, journal writing, researching, drawing, and role-playing are all good examples of formative assessments for students in elementary years.  I just hope I can organize it all.  [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 03:33, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


Both articles presented some well-thought out ideas regarding assessments.  To help my students take responsibility for their own learning, the first thing I would do when introducing a new lesson is give the students a list of learning targets they should know by the end of the lesson.  I strongly believe in using graphic organizers and KWL would be an appropriate choice.  A non-graded quiz at the beginning of the lesson would show the students and myself where they are in relation to the learning targets and help me tailor my instruction to where it is needed most, to whom it is needed most.  It would also help me form cooperative learning groups as each student will excel in different subjects.  Having cooperative learning groups create projects and then present them to the class also encourages students to take responsibility for their own learning as they understand that other students are depending on them for tasks in the project.[[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 00:23, 11 June 2009 (UTC)


I believe that having students keep a journal from the beginning of the school year to the end would be an excellent assessment tool. In the beginning I would have them write down their fears or elations about the class then every 6 weeks have them reflect on schoolwork and look back at what they wrote previously. I believe that for many students they would look back at the end and say..&quot;wow! I can't believe that I thought that I couldn't do that. It was so easy.&quot; This reflection would allow them to build confidence and set future goals. I know that I was so scared to take Chemistry, but with the help of my professor I was able to gain confidence in myself and achieve my goal. (He helped me set the goal.) I believe that he was actually the one who pointed out some of the questions that I should be asking myself as a student. I believe that if we can teach that then students will become more proficient at each task that they endure. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 01:48, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

I thought that both of these articles were very interesting and allowed me to learn a lot about assessment and feedback. Unfortunately, a lot of times teachers do not have the chance to complete formative assessments due to time constraints. However, this method of feedback can be one of the best ways to get your students to take ownership for their own learning. They will know where they are on target and where they are lacking. Also, giving students a chance to see the correct answers and mistakes they made during summative assessments will give them some feedback (although it is too late to change that grade.) In this class we are writing and reading our own textbook. I see no better way to give students ownership of their learning then this. Students will learn while they teach. Coming up with your own presentations, articles, questions, etc. and presenting to the class is a great way for everyone to benefit [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 01:17, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

When students are learning to become teachers, I believe the get overwhelmed when you start talking about all of these assessments.  I don't think they realize how many times they assess their students knowledge without every &quot;planning&quot; for it in a lesson plan.  Even questions during a lecture can be used as an assessment of the material.  By using the Socratic method in class you can assess your students.  An example of the Socratic Method is if a teacher asks a question and calls on a student who may or may not have volunteered an answer. The teacher either then continues to ask the student questions or moves on to another student.  Wikipedia state that &quot;The employment of the Socratic method has some uniform features but can also be heavily influenced by the temperament of the teacher. The method begins by calling on a student at random, and asking about a central argument put forth by one of the judges (typically on the side of the majority) in an assigned case. The first step is to ask the student to paraphrase the argument, in order to ensure that the student has read and has a basic understanding of the case. (Students who have not read the case, for whatever reason, must take the opportunity to &quot;pass,&quot; which most professors allow as a matter of course a few times per term.) Assuming the student has read the case and can articulate the court's argument, the teacher then asks whether the student agrees with the argument. The teacher then typically plays Devil's advocate, trying to force the student to defend his or her position by rebutting arguments against it.&quot;  Even these types of formative assessments can help you dictate the pace and knowledge of your classroom.

These two articles were very informative and helped me understand better the types of assessments that could help each student's need. I believe in a more visual type of assessment. I would like for my students to be hands on in what they have learned, like have them create a presentations where they are forced to teach the class a certain subject. This assessment would help the students understand the material given in class better. Due to time restraint and financial issues in schools, formative assessments are overlooked and replaced by summative assessments, but definitely formative assessments are far more beneficial for students. it gives a chance for the teacher to clear up any misunderstandings and see where the student is struggling.[[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 02:27, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

I think that giving students a project that demonstrates their assessment allows them to reflect on what they have learned and apply it.  I have had the experience in my classes to give them group tasks that get them talking, involved and apply the information that we have gone over.  It is a technique I have see in my observations also.  I like it when the students have to do their presentation in front of the class because they are not only sharing their information but participating in the feedback for their peers.  I have also used roleplays and scenarios and those are ways to allow the personalities of the students to come out and use their creativity to create interesting assessments.  Many of the time the students need to understand the relevance of what they are learning and what that means to them. [[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 03:06, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

I believe that having students involved in their own assessments is very important because then students can provide their own reactions and responses to the assessment, and help to develop future assessments that adequately monitor their progress in school. Some ways in which I would help my students to take responsibility for their own learning include giving them consistent and frequent feedback. By allowing them to consistently understand what they are doing right and wrong with assignments they will be able to know for future assignments what to change, or what not to change. I would also use positive reinforcement and motivation techniques as often as possible, because I feel that using positive remarks and praise in addition to motivation will make students more driven to doing their school work and taking the initiative to get it done. I also feel that using projects, both group and individual, is a good way to enable students to take responsibility for their own learning. This is because it makes students apply what they have learned to a project and requires them to think creatively about what to do regarding the assignment. Also, it allows teachers to assess the students' understanding of the topic. I believe that using these strategies will enable students to take responsibility for their own learning, so that they can take the initiative with their academic careers.[[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 17:14, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


One of the most important aspects of being an educator is having a good understanding of what is assessment, the difference between summative and formative assessment and how to appropriately use them in the classroom. Between teachers and students, the teacher is obviously going to do the majority of assessment because they are, typically, going to know what to do with that information and better their students’ learning. However, this does not mean that students cannot partake in the assessment process. In fact, assessment can be very beneficial for students well beyond their elementary and secondary school years. The strategies that they learn and develop will help them understand how they learn and what they can do to improve. One method involves students assessing themselves about learning objectives during a unit in three stages. In the first stage, the teacher presents the objectives students will learn during the unit and ask students to identify what they know or do not know about each subject. It can be as simple as a journal entry or a KWL before the beginning of the unit. As the class proceeds through the unit, students determine their strengths and weaknesses of the learning objectives to improve their learning. The last stage occurs toward the end of the unit, which consists of students looking where they have been, and where they are now. Students look at what they have improved on and what they may still need to improve on before some type of summative assessment. By this point, students should be able to identify a majority of the objectives learned. During this entire process, the teacher is giving constant feedback but it is the students that are acting upon it. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 19:18, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

As an art teacher, the best method of assessment is how well the student can follow the directions and create a hands on work of art during class. After explaining things such as what a line is, or what a circle is, students are assessed on their understanding by, for example, being able to draw a line or cut out a circle from paper. During the class observations I did in an elementary school, I observed first hand that not all students understand elements of art after the first explanation. It was through the use of pictures as examples, demonstrations of the concept, and sometimes a short video that helped students understand. Then, they were able to reproduce in their own creative way, the concept that was just taught to them. It was really neat to see when the &quot;light bulb&quot; went off in a students head and they finally understood concepts such as, so this is how I hold the paintbrush to get this certain effect. So, assessing students in art comes through practicing and using hands-on techniques. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 20:18, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


I believe that by using the Multiple Intelligences, we as educators can encourage students to take responsibility for their learning by getting to know themselves, and understanding the best way for them to learn personally. For instance, the idea of homework is perfectly understandable, practice makes perfect. But the idea is stale. Students do not all learn in the same way, so they should be given the freedom to choose the best method to do their &quot;homework&quot;. Say you taught a vocab today and the students need to learn it by the next class. For homework, the students could be told to do what they need to do to learn the words. If one student is into music, they might make up a song to learn the vocab, maybe another student learns best through flash cards. The idea is that students can take responsibility in their education and learning by choosing the avenue of learning that is best for them. Everyone is different, so why do we treat them all the same?[[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 21:07, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


I would use the Formative assessments mentioned in the first article and later viewed in the second one to develop better teaching strategies. Creating these types of assessments that would be targeted to specific points measuring the amount of information learned compared with the lessons taught.  Offering students information of what will be tested, what they are required to know by the end of the class and offering feedback on their areas of weakness as strengths does allow students to measure themselves and see where they stand.  I think that the summative assessment is more for principals, creators of curriculums and teachers. I think that this type of assessment helps as an overall view as to what the students are learning in the long run and what areas need to be improved or added  in the future. The formative assessment is in the now and at the moment. I think that current test and assessments to students that measure the knowledge on what has been taught at the moment is more beneficial to students in helping them realize what they might need from the teacher. When students know where they stand in the current time in class they can decide whether they want to improve themselves or just stay the same.  The teacher takes the responsibility of going over the material that may need some refreshing but the student is ultimately and solely the one responsible for their final grade. When Formative assessment is used in the classroom the correct way the student becomes the manager of their education and not the teacher.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 02:20, 14 June 2009 (UTC)


I think that answering this question is hard to answer without actually having much experience in the classroom. I think one thing I can say is that I will try to experiment with several different methods, testing to see whether or not techniques work or whether they don't work. So it will be trial and error until I find a method that works. [[User:Rcoll029|Rcoll029]] ([[User talk:Rcoll029|talk]]) 02:20, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

A good way for students to own his or her own learning, would be for them to keep active records of their work and progress.  This would make the students feel like they have more power over their grade in the course, and would be a tangible display of what he or she needs to improve on.  In terms of a music class, however, I would constantly test the knowledge and practice/improvement of the students.  The student and I would then have a one on one conversation and assess his or her learning and improvement.  [[User:Abeck017|Abeck017]] ([[User talk:Abeck017|talk]]) 01:25, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

I really liked both articles. As for having students take responsibility for their own learning...informative assessments are a great way to do that. I believe in the hands on approach when teaching in the classroom.  The more kinesthetic learning or active learning...the better the results. For instance...I worked as a Instructional Assistant for a reading teacher years ago and she allowed me to make up my own lesson unit plans. For a few weeks, I taught the students about Egypt. We did a lot of hands-on activities, as well as reading and assignments. At the end of the unit...I gave them a test to see how much they retained (along with a questionaire to assess their feelings about the unit) and the teacher was shocked that they all passed...because it was a low-level reading class...that was the most fun I had in a while. As for the articles...I agree with Ms. Tomlinson that in order to assess how your students are doing, it is necessary to take notes on your students, their reactions, attitudes, personalities, etc. to gage how they are learning and if they are having problems...find out why.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 05:54, 14 June 2009 (UTC)


Last week, one of my professors administered a personality test to all of her students.  This test was used as an assessment to gauge our personality styles hence understanding our learning styles as well.  It turned out to be accurate and incredibly beneficial to our success as students.  I learned that my weakness lies in gathering and organizing data, but I excel at visual presentations.  By understanding out strengths and weaknesses professor Pond was able to put us into groups where we could flourish in our own strengths and lean on others for support.  Where someone else was the strong leg in compiling the information I was able to put it all into powerpoint and make it visually and aesthetically appealing.  Professor Pond now understands what makes us tick and where we need encouragement and/or a little more assistance.  I never would've thought this form of assessment would prove that effective but it was.  An additional method of assessment  is to have the student re-teach what was taught to them.  Allow them the creative freedom to re-teach in their own format.  This lets you asses their interpretations of your lessons as well as their creativity and communication skills.  Any time information is asked to be regurgitated it requires them to pay attention and truly learn the material.  These two methods have proven beneficial to myself, and I think would do the same to a class of mixed learning levels. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 14:34, 14 June 2009 (UTC)


I would have my students take responsibility for their own learning by implementing a more dynamic system of grading. I’m inspired by a segment on NPR’s fantastic radio show, “This American Life”, about an inner city Chicago school that used formative teaching methods extensively. They had their own teacher created report cards that listed more detailed information about every student and were issued once every month. On these cards students could mark their own progress, and these same cards were presented to parents at their yearly parent-teacher conferences. Rather than browbeat the students with permanent records, and meaningless averages, performance would be accessed and focused more on actual progress than “standards.” The grades for standardized tests came later. I would very much like to duplicate such a system, especially their methods for creating an effective writing program. Rather than teach mechanics, or have students write essays, they let the children write about whatever they wanted, usually in the form of journal entries, or related thoughts on a story they read in class. These assignments were never graded, just read and talked about. Low and behold grades improved.  Ideally, I would work comics into the equation somewhere along the line.  There’s a reading program in a juvenile facility, built mostly around the comic book Runaways. I’d love to try something like that, but I have no illusions. I’m highly doubtful any administration would let any such program exist. (The one in Chicago has since been gutted by the education board, I’m unaware of the situation regarding the “Runaways” reading program at the moment. In light of it being an actually decently written comic, with anti-establishment ideals, suffice it to say, I’m doubtful the program still exists.

I might end up linking again before it's all over, especially if it helps to force page breaks when it comes time to create the PDF. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:37, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
::Oh - and the reasoning was because I didn't want to have a list of plants in the final PDF version.  I like to go straight to pictures.  That does not mean we can't switch back to the list though - it would be a small matter to not include the list pages in the collection when I make it.  An index would sure be nice though.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:39, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

OK, what do you think of this?  I kinda like the graphical TOC, as it will serve as a quick visual reference.  A kid could figure out the flower color, flip to the correct color section, and scan the page(s).  Then follow the link to the plant's page and read about it and see more pictures.  Works for me! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:52, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
: I do like the appearance of it.  I only notice a minor problem for usability.  A child wanting to know more about a flower might click the picture and not the link, so they would then get taken to the picture's page instead of the plant's page. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:26, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

:::After much experimentation, I came across [[:Template:Click]] which helped tremendously.  It's a little buggy though, so captioning and linking elsewhere are not simultaneously available.  So I had to resort to subterfuge to get the captions.  The wiki markup is ugly, but the result looks pretty OK.  Clicking the photo now leads to the plant's page within the book. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:18, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

This approach will also allow an easy rename in the future if anyone ever desires to do so.  I was also thinking about creating [[:Template:WJ Flower Row]] to create a row of four cells and reuse the binomial variable(s).  That way it would have forced consistency.

{{BookCat}}
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Deciding what factors should be included in the calculation of students’ grades is an important and contentious issue. Discuss your philosophy for determining students' grades. Consider the following questions:

Should students' grades be based mainly on tests and projects? What about homework? 

Should grades be a reflection of performance/achievement only or should effort be considered as well? 

What about zeros and late work? How might these influence the grade a student receives?

&lt;/span&gt;

''Add your response below. Extra credit will be awarded to multimedia responses.''

These articles really open my eyes to all the different aspects of teaching; assessment, feedback etc.  I believe that all things should be considered in the grading process.  Tests, projects, homework, performance, and effort should all be factored in the final grade.  Learning is a process therefore, the grading should reflect just that.  I do believe that tests/projects should have a higher value, but also include the homework/performance/effort/and class participation as well.  Grading with a rubric is a great idea.  This is easy way for teachers to make expectations clear for an assignment.  When I was in school I never came across a rubric.  None of my teachers ever gave me one.  Man, would it have helped on many assignments.  Sometimes when teachers give you an assignment you have no idea what to do or what they are looking for.  Grades are one way of giving feedback so make it easier on teacher and student to know what is expected.  I definitely agree that giving zeros is not an appropriate consequence for students because as teachers we are supposed to help students learn and try to motivate them to achieve.  I believe giving them a zero does not support that.

== What Makes the Grade? ==
Yes, I do think that students grads should be based '''''mainly''''' on tests and projects. I also think that enough tests and projects should be given so that the students grade isn't based on two or three grades.  tests and projects are '''''in my opinion''''' the best way to assess knowledge at the end of a lesson. It is not the only way.  Homework should only count towards a grade in the way of whether it was done or not.  Perhaps a Rubric for homework grades would be 2pts for doing it well, 1pt for doing it at all, and 0 for not doing it. Take an average and that can be used to boost your grade but not reduce your grade. Effort should always be considered with grades.  If there is a student whois an excellent achiever than that student deserves good grades for their hard work.  If there is a student who does not achieve top status or even one who is barely passing but they work as hard as the excellent achiever than the teacher should take that into consideration when calculating grades. The dedication it takes to work hard at something is a quality that should be encouraged whether or not the student achieves top grades. As for zeros and late work and whether they are necessary I would have to say they are.  If there were no penalties than where is the incentive to do what is expected. I think that the teachers should do all they can to help the students who are struggling but at some point if the student does not respond to the help and extra time given than the teacher may have to give a zero.   However if the student is that disinterested in helping themselves than the zero probably doesn't matter much to them and there may be a larger issue to deal with.  So I guess I am &quot;on the fence&quot; with whether or not to give zeros.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 23:49, 26 June 2009 (UTC)  


No, I don’t think student grades should be based mostly on tests and projects.  Homework and class participation should count as well.  Many good students do poorly on tests because they simply get nervous and are just not good test takers.  As a future art teacher, I think students that put forth a lot of effort towards class work should be rewarded.  Some students just aren’t as artistic as others, but do very well in keeping up with class work and are very motivated.  These students should definitely be rewarded!  As I stated as my response to the article “The Case Against the Zero”, I do think that if a student fails to hand in an assignment they should (in most circumstances) receive a zero for the work they did not attempt to complete.  Of course a zero doesn’t average in well with other grades that student is given, but if a student doesn’t even try to do the work I don’t believe they should receive a higher grade.  For late work, points should be deducted from the grade.  If points aren’t deducted, it wouldn’t be fair for the motivated students that do manage to turn their work in on time.

I think that students' grades should be based on a multitude of assessments.  I do not agree that students' grades should be based solely on tests and projects.  I feel a students should be assessed on aspects of education that include tests and projects, but the students should also be graded on in class assignments, homework, class participation and attendance.  I feel a strong way to assess students is to teach a lesson, and have the students write a paper or complete a project as one way of assessing what they have learned from the lesson.  I also feel another strong way to assess a student is to have him or her or a team of students teach the lesson to the class. This is a great way to see what the students have learned over the course of the lesson. I look forward to using this philosophy in the future when I begin to teach.[[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 17:13, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

No students' grades should not be based primarily on tests and projects. They should be taken into heavy consideration, but tests and projects are not the sure fire way to assess what someone has learned in the class. Effort can be easily determined and would play a huge factor in my determination of an adequate grade. If I had a student that made a hearty effort, but failed miserably on my tests, I would council him/her into showcasing another way in which to express what they had learned in my class. I am still on the fence concerning zeros and late work. Outside of a college level I would be profoundly for making a student do their work, if it means forcing them to. I would feel obligated to make sure they do what they need to do. However, at a college level I would inherently expect more responsibility from my students and would feel more obligated to hand out zeros. Late work I would stipulate that they must discuss it with me. If they made a habit out of it, their grade would reflect their lack of effort in getting papers/projects/homework in on time– and I think it would be just. There is just this fine line between using grades as punishment and giving people what they have truly earned. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 03:07, 19 June 2009 (UTC)


My philosophy for determining students' grades is that I really had not thought about it.  I say, &quot;I didn't give them the grade, they earned the grade&quot;. If a student puts forth 100% or 50% effort then they deserve the grade they get. I agree that tests and homework should make up the students' grades, but should also take into consideration the effort as well as the student's performance because this shows that the student is trying. When thinking about teaching my class, the only time the students would have homework is if the week's work is not done.  I would not assign homework over the weekend. When teachers put a zero in the gradebook it is not letting the teacher know if the student knew the work or not. I think teachers should give students a chance to make up late work, give them a lesser grade instead of just putting a zero in the gradebook.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 14:31, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

I have a new persective on grading after reading these articles! I believe that grades should not be solely based on tests and projects. Homework, particiapation and effort should all be included. Perhaps some things will be weighted more than others, but all things should be considered. We have talked about giving feedback a lot recently and I think that the more feedback a student receives, the better. Grades are one form of feedback and can offer the students an idea of how he/she is performing. When using different tools, like rubrics, students can have a better understanding of where they are successful and where they may need to work harder. By incorporating homework, participation, and timeliness of turning in work, students can realize that ALL these factors are important. Giving a zero is not beneficial, since the main goal is to help the students learn and understand the information, right? So, make consequences and stick to them. Let the students know they will be penalized for turning work in late or not turning it in at all; however, they will be required to complete it and when they do, they will have a chance to earn some credit. This offers a situation where the students wont feel hopeless if they miss an assignment but also know how important it is to have things in on time! I hope to try to include all of these ideas in my teaching style! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 17:57, 16 June 2009 (UTC)khedl002


I base a student's grade on tests, quizzes, special assignments (projects, etc.,), classwork which includes science labs, and participation.  Tests are weighted 33.3% of the total and the remaining grades are grouped together with a weight of 66.67%.  Homework is assigned regularly.  However, I think that homework is something that is used for practice and to gage student understanding.  I assign a value for completion, not a value for correctness.  This ties in to my class participation grade which is based on class discussion, group participation, and homework completion.  Students are given an opportunity to turn in late work, such as projects, and I assign a penalty for each day the assignment is late (usually 10 pts. per day). Make-up work is due 5 days after an absence unless there are prior arrangements.  I do not randomly assign grades to my students.  What they receive is an accurate account of their participation and effort as well as the work that they have completed.  Grades should not be the end all-be all of education, but are the traditional measure of academic success. [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 14:04, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

No, a students grade should not be based on tests and project.  I belive that is a disservice to the student.  There should be many opporunities to earn grades.  I, personally, do not believe in homework.  I believe there needs to be a separation between school and home.  I have heard many times with teachers, &quot;do not take your work home with you.&quot;  I believe this should apply to the student as well.  Also, in many cases, homework is setting the student up for failure.  Many times the work may be too hard for the student or there is too much given in one day.  Performance, achievement, and effort should all be considered in a grade.  Every aspect of a project or work should be taken into consideration for a grade.  Never should a student receive a zero for being late or possibly not doing something right.  I don't believe in late work.  There will be a date set for the students who like to work that way and then other students will be given the assignment and have till the end of the year.  As I said before,  I truly do not believe anyone should receive a zero that has turned in work.  It doesn't make sense.  There is an effort placed in the assignment and that should be rewarded and then they should have the opportunity to make changes and improvements and receive a higher score.  All part of the learning process. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 01:46, 16 June 2009 (UTC)


Grading shouldn't be something that a teacher can assign randomly. Student's grades should not only be based on academic work but also their attitudes and actions in class. Tests should count the most because they are a refection of what students have learned. Homework should be graded for completion and not always correctness. Other things that happen in addition to tests and homework (projects, etc.) should be graded based on their size and difficulty. Grading should be both a reflection of performance/achievement and effort. &quot;Partial credit&quot; should be awarded when a student has worked hard but not fully reached the ending goal. Zeros should be given if students blatantly fail to complete assignments. Late work should be handled on a case-to-case basis. For normal lateness (laziness) students should be penalized and have points deducted until the assignment is turned in.

This year I co-taught with a teacher that has been teaching for 36 years.  She was helping to show me the ropes my first year at the school.  About halfway through the first semester the class had a project due.  She let them know a head of time that it had to be turned in.  She told them they couldn't just NOT DO the assignment.  At the time I was wondering how she was going to enforce that rule.  Time came for them to turn in the assignment and we both had about 5 kids that didn't turn it in.  She then proceeded to assign them lunch detention till the assignment was done.  At first I didn't agree with her, I thought she was holding their hand and not letting them take consequences for their actions.  I later realized that she was having them suffer consequences and making them turn in their assignment as well.  It was a valuable lesson for me this past year.  [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 01:04, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

Grades should be something that students know exactly what they have to do to earn.  I love rubrics and believe they can be used as soon as students begin writing.  A good one will spell out clearly what the student needs to do to accomplish their task and how it will be graded when completed.  I also agree with Douglas B. Reeves that giving &quot;zeros&quot; for not turning in work does not help a student in any way.  I know more than a few students who would rather take a &quot;zero&quot; than complete a difficult project.  I think the student should still be required to complete the work, be denied the &quot;fun&quot; class activities, and when finally turned in, be given a grade lower than if they had turned it in on time. [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 15:54, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

Student grades should be well balanced and should not be randomly assigned. Tests and projects should carry the most weight, as these are a direct relection of the students understanding of what has been taught. Homework should carry some weight in the grade, but should be graded for completion and not for accuracy. If a student completes their homework each night, this will help give their final grade a boost. Growing up, I knew many students who did great on tests, but did not complete their homework, so in the end they ended up with a low final grade. Grades should be a reflection of performance and achievement as well as effort. The way to grade effort is to factor in a participation grade. This will help the students who may not have fully grasped the material but put in as much effort as they could. If students fail to turn in the assignment, I think they should initially be given a zero, but they should be forced to complete the assignment. By this I mean staying in from recess or lunch and working until it is complete. The project should then be graded, with a percentage taken off because of its tardiness. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 17:21, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

I believe that grades are earned. In my book grades can be earned by completing homework, putting forth an honest effort, and taking tests. The tests would be graded differently because they are an assessment. However, if a student completes the homework and tries this will also affect his/her test grade. I know that when I didn't do my homework I done worse on tests than when I did do my homework. Homework should not be looked at as busy work, but as an understanding and practice of material that was presented in class. I also agree that homework shouldn't be graded, but to check to make sure students are doing it. If a student is really giving it his all and is not a trouble maker then I would more than likely add bonus points to his test for that six weeks. I am not a fan of the zero either. It is too devastating to a student. I like to grade by class average on some things. That way students see that no one is perfect and makes 100's all the time. Maybe it's the wrong thing to do. I don't know. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 01:51, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

I believe in giving grades for all three testing, projects, and homework. Consideration for effort will be given, on a project by project basis. Zeros and late work should influence the student’s grade. I feel that they fall under effort.  If no effort is given then no grade should be received. I think a combination of the two grading methods will be considered when I grade my students. One thing is clear to me is that grading is not going to be an easy task. It is going to be a learning experience all by itself.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 16:41, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

These articles made me see grading in a totally different way than I used to think about grading. I believe that students' grades should be earned, because if they do not put forth the effort and initiative then they will not push themselves to do the best that they possibly can. I believe that certain assignments should be worth more points than others such as tests or quizzes, because in some cases students can forget homework assignments which should be weighted lower, in which they can put forth more effort and time towards the assignments that are worth more. I believe that students should understand completely what is expected of them for assignments, and that is why I believe that rubrics are a great grading assessment. It allows students to see what exactly they need to do for the assignment, and the things that they will be graded on. Regarding homework assignments, I believe that they should not be graded too difficult because they should assess whether the student completed the assignment or not, and not entirely on whether the answers are correct or not. I believe that participation and effort are important factors for the student to be graded on, although I do believe that it should not be weighted too heavily. The main reason I believe this is because some students are uncomfortable with speaking in the classroom, and participation determining their grade should not be a huge factor. I also believe that students' grades should not be solely based on tests and projects, because some students do not do well with testing and should be provided with other opportunities to raise their grades. Regarding zeros, I do not believe that it is to the student's benefit, because it is just allowing them to continue not to complete assignments. I believe they should be instead given some form of incentive or punishment that will cause them to do the assignment rather than a number received. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 22:44, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

Students need many opportunities for assessments, but they should be varied in their types and applications.  Assessment could mean many things for someone teaching at the elementary level.  Teachers could evaluate class participation, homework, quizzes, individual projects, group work, tests, reading, writing, art…the list could go on.  As a teacher of this level, I am more concerned with the journey than the result.  I want my students to retain what they are studying and I know that means providing a lot of engaging, sensori-motor activities.  When students have some choice, some control of their studies, and are engaged in the classroom, they are better prepared and more successful at any type of assessment.  In essence, they will retain more of what they learn because it will have functional value to them.  Learning will be personal.  Therefore, this dividing line or gap between learning and assessing will almost be nonexistent.

Every aspect of class a student partakes in should be considered in the grading process. Tests and projects are important and need a grade, however homework should reflect part of the students grade as well. Homework should not have as strict a grade, though, because the purpose of homework is to help students learn the topic at hand, not penalize them for not completely understanding the topic. Homework can become a type of assessment for teachers so they know what they need to spend more time on in class, and what students understand the most.  A student should also be graded on their performance/achievement in the class because how well they complete an assignment and how well they do on the tests and projects should be a factor of their success in the class. Effort should be graded, as well, because some topics will be more difficult or confusing for a student. If they are giving their best effort to be successful on the topic at hand, they should be rewarded for their attempts. As the article read explained, zeros and late work should not completely go hand-in-hand. A late assignment does not always deserve a zero, students should be given the chance to makeup work they forgot to do or did not understand and need more help on.

I think that grading a student's work is probably one of the hardest things that a teacher has to face. For instance the way that you choose to grade a certain paper could decide whether or not a student passes your class or not. I think that grading assignments should be the one thing that a teacher should take absolutely seriously. sometimes i think it is easier to assign a fair grade when you don't know who wrote the assignment. for instance it might be a little unconventional but I might tell my students to put their name on the last page of their paper so that as I read I'm grading for content and not thinking about Johnny talking back to me during class that morning. Grading papers should not be taken lightly. Also the different kinds of assignments should be graded differently . For instance, if you assign a research paper that is worth twenty five percent of the students grade the a quiz should not also be worth the same value. The value of the assignment should be determined by thinking about how long it should actually take a student to complete that assignment. What could be done is that if there are ten quizzes throughout the semester then all of the quizzes cold equal twenty fove percent of the students final grade. The over all grade of any given assignment should be based on the amount of effort that was put in and the quality of the final piece of work.

Grading a student's work is not as easy as it sounds. These articles have really opened my eyes about things to consider when grading, making ruberics, etc. I think that a grading system should not be arbitrary. It should be set in stone and consistent across the board. Afterall, a simple grade on one assignment can make a pass or fail difference for a student. I think that homework, participation, in-class assignments, discussions, etc. should also have important weights within a student's overall grade. I don't think that tests and projects can assess a students true capabilities and there should be a wide variety of assignments to assess a students potential. By using different approaches the teacher is also helping the students learn in different ways and also being conscious of the fact that not all students are good test-takers and not everyone writes perfect essays. Teachers should put a lot of thought into each grade and make sure that they are fair, reliable and valid. The article by Reeves really made me think twice about assigning a zero for work that is not turned in. I agree with him that privileges could be taken away until a student decides to complete the assignment. This way, not completing the assignment is NOT an option. To some students, a grade is a number written on a paper, but sitting in detention or not being able to participate in a school activity may seem much more important. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 01:44, 19 June 2009 (UTC)


Grades should represent the full spectrum of a student's work. They should be made up of homework, classwork, quizzes, tests and projects. Also there should be some consideration of effort. I factor effort into my student's grades by grading homework and classwork for completion not correctness. In this way, I am grading their effort to complete classwork and homework and rewarding those students who put fourth the effort and tried. Late work should be penalized and zeros should be used for work that was never completed. When I factor in effort into a student's grade that means that I am grading them less on what they know and more on how hard they try. This means less pressure for the student, but in return they must turn in their work on time. Accepting late work reaffirms to students that they do not have to complete assignments for a deadline, they can wait and do it in their leisure, or get by without completing it at all. This is NOT a life skill that high school students specifically need to develop. Is it okay for you to tell your boss, &quot;Oh I'm sorry I just don't feel like doing that right now or at all. Sorry I'll just take a zero.&quot; No, it's not and in real life the person would be fired, so students need to learn early that work is to be completed on time.

This is a subject that I find is talked about over and over.  I think it is so ridiculous for teachers to put such a heavy weight on tests.  Not that I do not think that tests are important and needed, but to have tests carry the difference of passing and failing a course is preposterous.  I have actually had a course that had a mid term and a final and those were the only two grades for the course.  Thankfully, I do not have a mental block when it comes to tests but I know people who do.  Those are the people that this practice does a total disservice.  A student's mastery of a subject should be reflected in tests, quizzes, projects, homework, papers. etc.  To give the weight of passing and failing to one or two tests does not take into account all of the students that are not regurgitators, people who take in the information and spit it back out.  There should be an opportunity for all students to be able to be evaluated on their broad spectrum of learning styles.  Also, grades should be earned not given.  If we do not hold our students responsible for not completing assignments how will they ever learn accountability?  If they are in the real world and miss a deadline, would they not suffer consequences for that?  We are not only providing students the knowledge that they need to acquire as well-rounded members of society but we are also giving them the tools to go out and succeed in their work life and continuing education.  If we do not show students the importance of earning their grades, being held accountable for work that is due, and realizing that the effort that they put forth will be rewarded in the grades that they receive, we are teaching them nothing.

For a task that at a glance appears simple, grading is perhaps one of the most complex aspects of being an educator because of all the issues that surround it. While grades will continue to be an ongoing debate, teachers almost ''have'' to develop their own personal philosophy for grading. My own personal philosophy on grades is that the teacher should focus on the work, but they should also consider the student. When teachers are often assessing students’ work, they may hold some bias towards them when grading. This is when it is essential to use a rubric, particularly instructional rubrics because they can enhance learning and assessment simultaneously. It is very important that teachers grade without bias because they are not helping their students by not being honest about their performance or achievement, particularly on tests and projects. However, behind each assignment are students with feelings, and educators have the power to “make them or break them”. Even the most well-intended teachers can have a power trip when grading, and many do not realize the impact a failing grade on their students. Some students give all of their effort, and barely manage to receive a C. It would not be fair for the student to receive a failing grade just because the teacher may be holding a grudge against them. Teachers are also not mind-readers, so they may not know if a student is having personal problems at home. 

This does not mean that teachers should or need to be sympathetic, because grades should reflect student performance. But student performance should also be balanced with student effort. A classroom will have some students do the hardest assignments with ease and have other students struggle on the easiest. I would grade a student’s assignments based on their general performance but I would also take note of their effort in doing the assignment by asking myself questions: Did the student appear to be struggling while doing the assignment? Did they frequently ask questions? Did they stay after class or school to receive additional help? Were they overall giving it their best shot? As for zeros and late work, it is more beneficial to have students complete the assignment on their free time than to give a zero. There have been many cases where I have gotten so frustrated with an assignment, I take the zero as the lesser evil simply because I did not want to do the assignment. While I personally think that making this decision is acceptable for a college student, it is not for a elementary, middle and even high school student because they do not yet realize how impacting a zero is. By taking away some of their privileges, like free period or extra-curricula activities, they will be more motivated to complete the assignment on time instead of not doing it at all. It may also be important to consider doing different projects based on student interest.[[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 00:35, 21 June 2009 (UTC)


I think that students’ grades should be mainly focused on tests and projects as a whole. Homework should be something that plays a role, but it should not be the main source of assessment in my opinion. Tests and projects are much more apt to truly give an understanding of a student’s capabilities than homework is, by the very nature of homework itself. It is work for the home, supplemental lessons but not the real “meat” of the curriculum.  I think both achievement and effort should be included at all levels in grading. Every person has natural aptitudes and deficits in their capabilities. Educators should understand this and at least on some level consider effort when dolling out grades. Personally, I am against zeroes. They seem ineffective and more superstitious than inspiring. Zeroes were only looked at two ways when I was in school, either as the “boogey man” of grading or as a meaningless consequence. The phrase, “I’ve already got like three zeroes, screw it.” Was used quite often to describe a zero’s affect on the average student. I  am wholeheartedly in favor of late work. Late work provides opportunity for improvement. To me that is an important basis for teaching, improvement. Without improvement, what’s the point?

I think that the determination of a student's grade should not be solemnly based on test and projects. A grade should be a reflection of a student's progress in different areas of the class. Such examples are class participation, homework, classwork, and other creative skills. As a aspiring teacher I believe in the learning strategies of visual and auditory learners, and should incorporate different lessons for the diversity of student's personality and learning approach. Motivation is a key factor in the classroom, for a teacher should motivate their students to do their absolute best and not settle. If the grades in the classroom are just based on tests which could lead to poor grades, then something is not working in my teaching strategy. Late assignment acceptance could also replace many &quot;zeros&quot; on the grade book. For one, I understand the &quot;zero&quot; if the student was given multiple chances and they still did not complete an assignment. I believe in fair chances, improvement and motivation... But that, is just a working relationship between teacher/student communication. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 18:18, 21 June 2009 (UTC)


I think grading should be based on everything in the classroom. It should include tests, homework, classroom assignments, projects, attendance, punctuality, grammar, writing skills, etc. I also think extra credit is a great way to persuade students to set their goal higher and give 110% or more. Too many times I have witnessed students doing &quot;just enough&quot; to pass because they did not want to put forth any effort to go above and beyond &quot;average&quot;. As for performance and achievement, I think effort needs to be a part of the mixture. Without including effort, we are including those who have different learning capabilities.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 23:42, 21 June 2009 (UTC)


How grading should be done depends completely on who the students are.  If we are talking about college level students, then in most cases, the grade should be a composite of tests, exams, and projects.  Nothing more is needed.  How grading is done with the high school level alone should also vary according to circumstance.  A teacher who teaches in a highly affluent county with 1% of the people in poverty should expect students to turn in homework and count this heavily into their grade (everyone can afford caculators for math homework).  A teacher who teaches in a highly impoverished county, where no one can afford to buy their children calculators, should not weigh homework as a large portion of the grade.  I think class participation and classwork should be a factor in one's grades, but I also think tests should be heavily weighted.  Students who work extra hard should have opportunities for extra credit.

== Description ==

This isn't actually a tracker but a particle detecter.  It emits particles when there is motion in the image, calculated by finding gradients on frame-differences of images over multiple timescales.  See the OpenCV book for more information. It also associates the particles with a color histogram if it's given a foreground model in mDataStructureImageBinary.

== Parameters ==

Note:  I use default values for all parameters.  Read the openCV book and documentation for more details - I wrote this component following the section in the openCV book on motion templates.

=== DiffThreshold ===

Threshold to use for frame differencing.

=== MhiDuration ===

passed to cvUPdateMotionHistory.      &quot;Maximal duration of motion track in the same units as timestamp.&quot;

=== SegmentThreshold ===

passed to cvSegmentMotion.     &quot;Segmentation threshold; recommended to be equal to the interval between motion history &quot;steps&quot; or greater. &quot;

=== MaxTimeDelta ===

passed to cvCalcMotionGradient. &quot;The function finds minimum (m(x,y)) and maximum (M(x,y)) MHI values over each pixel (x,y) neihborhood and assumes the gradient is valid only if min(delta1,delta2) &lt;= M(x,y)-m(x,y) &lt;= max(delta1,delta2).&quot;

=== MinTimeDelta ===

passed to cvCalcMotionGradient. &quot;The function finds minimum (m(x,y)) and maximum (M(x,y)) MHI values over each pixel (x,y) neihborhood and assumes the gradient is valid only if min(delta1,delta2) &lt;= M(x,y)-m(x,y) &lt;= max(delta1,delta2).&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Khwarezm, or Chorasmia, had been a province of Iran since the time of the Achaemenids. In 1077, the province came under the domination of a Turkic commander named Anushtigin Gharchai who became the first Khwarezm Shah. Under his successors, the Khwarezm Shahs conquered much of Iran and Central Asia. The rule of Khwarezm Shahs lasted until 1231, when the last Khwarezm Shah was killed and the kingdom annexed by the Mongols.

==Local Control==
*'''Tata Memorial; India; 2013''' (2005-2013) [http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs13/view.php?nu=SABCS13L_693&amp;terms= Abstract Link] -- &quot;Surgical removal of primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes in women with metastatic breast cancer at first presentation: A randomized controlled trial&quot; (Badwe R, San Antonio Breast Conference Abstract S2-02, 2013)
**Randomized. 350 patients, metastatic breast cancer, status post anthracycline chemotherapy with objective tumor response. Arm 1) loco-regional treatment (lumpectomy or mastectomy and ALND followed by RT) versus Arm 2) No loco-regional treatment. Endocrine therapy as indicated. Median F/U 1.5 years
**Outcome: Median OS LRT 19 months versus No LRT 20.5 months (NS); 2-year OS 41% vs 43%. No difference afer adjusting for prognostic factors
**Conclusion: Loco-regional treatment has no impact on overall survival, and should be reserved for women who need it for palliative reasons

*'''Turkish Study MF07-01''' [http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs13/view.php?nu=SABCS13L_1281 Abstract Link] -- &quot;Early follow up of a randomized trial evaluating resection of the primary breast tumor in women presenting with de novo stage IV breast cancer; Turkish study (protocol MF07-01)&quot; (Soran A, San Antonio Breast Conference Abstract S2-03, 2013)
**Randomized. 278 patients, metastatic breast cancer. Arm 1) loco-regional therapy (mastectomy or lumpectomy + radiation and SNB/ALND) before initiating systemic therapy versus Arm 2) No loco-regional treatment, systemic therapy only. Bone-only 46%; no bone 29%, both bone and other 25%. Median F/U 1.7 years.
**Outcome: 4.5 year OS LRT 35% versus No LRT 31% (NS). Bone-only subgroup mean OS 3.2 years versus 2.7 years (NS); solitary bone only disease statistically significant (numbers not given)
**Conclusion: Overall survival similar; but patients with solitary bone metastases had a survival benefit

*'''Hawaii; 2009''' PMID 19876731 -- &quot;Loco-regional treatment in metastatic breast cancer patients: Is there a survival benefit?&quot; (Ly BH, Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2009 Oct 30. [Epub ahead of print])
**Literature review. 13 studies evaluating loco-regional treatment (surgery, or surgery + RT, RT)
**Outcome: Median OS no surgery 12-28 months vs. surgery 25-42 months; 3-year OS 17-79% vs. 28-95%
**Conclusion: Possibility of surgery and/or RT following induction should be left to individual practice

==Zoledronic Acid (Zometa) + RT==
*'''Turkey''' (2003-2005) -- Zoledronic acid + RT 30/10 vs. Zoledronic acid + RT 15/5
**Randomized. 100 patients, at least one bone metastasis, life expectancy &gt;6 months. Excluded pathologic fractures, prior RT to that area, prior treatment with zoledronic acid, brain mets. Zoledronic acid 4 mg Q28 days, starting day 1 of RT. Used objective measure (MRI, bone scan) and subjective end points (pain, analgesic score, visual analog score)

===—————revision line—————===
USS ''Fly'' patrolled off New London to learn the strength of the British Fleet until June, when she was detached to carry cannon from Newport to [[w:Amboy, New Jersey|Amboy, New Jersey]], where she was blockaded briefly by the British. Later in 1776, she cruised the New Jersey coast to intercept enemy ships bound for [[New York City]]. In an encounter with one of these in November, a number of ''Fly'''s men were wounded, and she was damaged to the extent that she had to put in to [[Philadelphia]] to repair and refit.
--------------------


After repairs at Philadelphia, ''Wasp'' returned to duty in the [[Delaware River]] and Bay.


With repairs completed, ''Lexington'', Capt. [[w:William Hallock|William Hallock]] in command, got underway for [[w:Cap-Haïtien|Cape Francois]] to obtain military cargo. On the return voyage, British frigate [[w:HMS Pearl (1762)|HMS ''Pearl'']]  overhauled the brigantine just short of the Delaware Capes 20 December and captured her. The commander of the frigate removed ''Lexington'''s officers, but left 70 of her men on board under hatches with a [[prize crew]]. But by luring their captors with a promise of [[rum]], the Yankee sailors recaptured the ship and brought her to Baltimore.

--------------------

The USS ''Hornet'' patrolled in the Delaware Bay for the rest of the year of 1776, then ran the British blockade to convoy merchantmen to Charleston.
--------------------
USS ''Alfred'' remained inactive throughout the summer of 1776 due to repairs sustained since its naval action on 6 April, upon returning from the Nassau expedition in the Bahamas months earlier. There may had been other reasons, but high on the list of her problems was lack of funding and a shortage of men.

On 10 May, John Paul Jones assumed command of USS ''Providence'' with temporary rank of Captain. After a voyage to New York returning to the Continental Army about 100 soldiers whom Washington had lent to Hopkins to help man the American fleet, and after returning to Providence, Jones hove down the ship to clean her bottom and sailed 13 June escorting Fly to Fishers Island at the entrance to Long Island Sound. En route he saved a brigantine bringing munitions from Hispanola from the British frigate Cerberus.

USS ''Providence'' next escorted a convoy of colliers to Philadelphia arriving 1 August 1776. There, a week later, Jones received his permanent commission as Captain. On the 21 August 1776, Providence departed the Delaware Capes to begin an independent cruise, and in a few days took the brigantine Britannia and sent the whaler into Philadelphia under a prize crew.

On 7 August, Capt. John Paul Jones, who had helped to fit the USS ''Alfred'' out as a warship (commandeered by Captain Dudley Saltonstall), and had been its first lieutenant on the cruise to New Providence, was placed in command of the ship. She departed Providence, Rhode Island,, on 26 October 1776, in company with [[w:USS Hampden|''Hampden'']], but that vessel struck a &quot;sunken rock&quot; before they could leave [[w:Narragansett Bay|Narragansett Bay]] and returned to Newport.

Her officers and men then shifted to sloop USS ''Providence'' accompanying USS ''Alfred'' to waters off [[w:Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton Island]] which they reached by mid-November. There they took three prizes: on the 11 August 1776, the brigantine HMS ''Active'', bound from Liverpool to [[w:City of Halifax|Halifax]] with an assorted cargo, the next day, the armed transport HMS ''Mellish'', laden with winter uniforms for British troops at [[w:Quebec|Quebec]]; and, on 16 August, the HMS ''Kitty'', bound from [[w:Gaspé|Gaspé]] to [[w:Barbados|Barbados]] with oil and fish. Because of severe leaks, USS ''Providence'' sailed for home soon thereafter and USS ''Alfred'' continued her cruise alone.

On 1 September, daring seamanship enabled Jones to escape from the British frigate Solebay. Two days later Providence captured Sea Nymph, carrying sugar, rum, ginger, and oil, and sent the Bermudan brigantine to Philadelphia. On the 6th Providence caught the brigantine Favourite carrying sugar from Antigua to Liverpool, but HMS Galatea recaptured the prize before she could reach an American port.

Turning north, Jones headed for Nova Scotia, and on 20 September escaped another frigate before reaching Canso two days later. There he recruited men to fill the vacancies created by manning his prizes, burned a British fishing schooner, sank a second, and captured a third, besides a shallop which he used as a tender. Moving to Ile Madame, USS ''Providence'' took several more prizes fishing there before riding out a severe storm. One more prize, the whaler HMS ''Portland'' surrendered to USS ''Providence'' before she returned to Narragansett Bay on 8 October.

On 22 November, boats from the ship USS ''Alfred'' raided [[w:Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso]], [[w:Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia]], where their crews burned a transport bound for Canada with provisions and a warehouse full of whale oil, besides capturing a small schooner to replace ''Providence''. Two days later, USS ''Alfred'' captured three [[w:Collier (ship type)|colliers]] off [[w:Louisburg]], bound from Nova Scotia to New York with coal for the British Army and, on 26 November, captured the 10-gun [[w:letter-of-marque|letter-of-marque]] ''John'' of Liverpool. On the homeward voyage, USS ''Alfred'' was pursued by [[w:HMS Milford (1759)|HMS ''Milford'']] but managed to escape after a four-hour chase. USS ''Alfred'' arrived safely at Boston on 15 December and began a major refit.

On 10 May, John Paul Jones assumed command of USS ''Providence'' with temporary rank of Captain. After a voyage to New York returning to the Continental Army about 100 soldiers whom Washington had lent to Hopkins to help man the American fleet, and after returning to Providence, Jones hove down the ship to clean her bottom and sailed 13 June escorting Fly to Fishers Island at the entrance to Long Island Sound. En route he saved a brigantine bringing munitions from Hispanola from the British frigate Cerberus.

While Providence was at home, Hopkins appointed Jones the Commander of USS ''Alfred''. Shortly thereafter, Capt. Hoysted Hacker took command of Providence. The two ships got under way 11 November. After ten days they took the brigantine Active and the next day took the armed transport Mellish carrying winter uniforms and military supplies for the British Army. On 16 November, they captured the snow Kitty. The next night, Providence, troubled by leaks which had developed during bad weather on the cruise, headed back for Rhode Island and arrived at Newport two days later.

On 24 October 1776, [[w:Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin]] was dispatched to France as appointed '[[w:United States Ambassador to France |Commissioner to France]]' for Congress. Captain Lambert Wickes was ordered by the Continental Congress to proceed to [[w:Nantes, France|Nantes, France]], aboard USS ''Reprisal''. While en route to France, the sailors and Marines captured two brigantines. USS ''Reprisal'' reaches Nantes on 29 November, becoming the first vessel of the Continental Navy to arrive in European waters.
--------------------
By autumn of 1776, Major Nicholas raised four new companies of Marines for four of the new frigates that were to be completed and commissioned in Philadelphia. Armed with marines by the Pennsylvania Committee of Safety, the detachments guarded both the Continental and state vessels and store while waiting for their frigates to sail.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt; On 5 September 1776, the Marine Committee apportioned a uniform for the Continental Marines. It wasn't until the year 1777 that the Marines entirely appeared in uniform in numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevMarines&quot;/&gt;

Sometime in October, [[w:Sergeant#United States|Sergeants]] William Hamilton and Alexander Neilson are promoted to [[w:Lieutenant|Lieutenant]], being the first recorded &quot;[[w:Mustang (military officer)|mustangs]]&quot; (enlistees who received field commission) in the Marine Corps.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

Throughout the winter of 1776, USS ''Columbus'' cruised off the New England coast taking five prizes. Captain Biddle, the captain of USS ''Andrew Doria'', was transferred to another ship in September 1776. Captain Isaiah Robinson took command and was ordered to go to [[w:Sint Eustatius|St. Eustatius]] to obtain munitions and military supplies. The USS ''Andrew Doria'' also carried a precious cargo to St. Eustatius—a copy of the Declaration of Independence. The ship received the first-ever salute to the United States by a foreign power when on 16 November 1776 she arrived at St. Eustatius.  [[w:Johannes de Graeff|Johannes de Graeff]], the Dutch governor of the island paid tribute with a 11-gun salute, two less than the amount of states and stripes in the flag (the event was widely reported in the United States, and provided the title for [[w:Barbara Tuchman|Barbara Tuchman]]'s 1988 book, ''&quot;The First Salute&quot;'', about the [[w:American Revolution|American Revolution]]).

The British seized Narragansett Bay in December 1776 and Providence, with other American vessels there, retired up the Providence River. In February 1777, under Lt. Jonathan Pitcher, Providence ran the British blockade; after putting into New Bedford, she cruised to Cape Breton where she captured a transport brig loaded with stores and carrying two officers and 25 men of the British Army besides her crew. Under command of Capt. J.P. Rathbun, Providence made two cruises on the coast and about mid-January 1778, sailed from Georgetown, N.C., again bound for New Providence in the Bahamas, this time alone.

Near the end of the year, USS ''Wasp'' took three more prizes; HMS ''Leghorn Galley'' late in October, ''Two Brothers'' in December, and an unnamed sloop that same month. She also recaptured ''Success'', an American ship previously taken by HMS ''Roebuck''.

The '''Battle of Nassau''' (March 3&amp;ndash;4, 1776) was a naval action and [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] by American forces against the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] port of [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in the [[Bahamas]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (also known as the American War of Independence). It is considered the first cruise and one of the first engagements of the newly established [[Continental Navy]] and the [[Continental Marines]], the progenitor of the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].  The action was also the Marines' first amphibious landing.  It is sometimes known as the '''Raid of Nassau'''.

===Background===
[[Image:Bf-map.gif|thumb|upright|left|Map of [[the Bahamas]]]]
When the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in 1775, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the British provincial governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]], with the British forces under his command, had removed Virginia's store of provincial arms and [[gunpowder]] to the island of [[New Providence]] in the [[Crown Colony]] of [[the Bahamas]], in order to keep it from falling into the hands of the rebel militia.  [[Montfort Browne]], the Bahamian governor, was alerted by General [[Thomas Gage]] in August 1775 that the rebel colonists might make attempts to seize these supplies.&lt;ref name=R100&gt;Riley, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

The desperate shortage of gunpowder available to the [[Continental Army]] had led the [[Second Continental Congress]] to organize a naval expedition, one of whose goals was the seizure of the military supplies at Nassau.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  While the orders issued by the Congress to [[Esek Hopkins]], the fleet captain selected to lead the expedition, included only instructions for patrolling and raiding British naval targets, additional instructions may have been given to Hopkins in secret meetings of the Congress' Naval Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 94-97&lt;/ref&gt;  The instructions that Hopkins issued to his fleet's captains before it sailed from [[Cape Henlopen]] on February 17, 1776, included instructions to rendezvous at [[Great Abaco Island]] in the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 100-102&lt;/ref&gt;

The fleet that Hopkins launched consisted of [[USS Alfred (1774)|''Alfred'']], [[USS Hornet (1775)|''Hornet'']], [[USS Wasp (1775)|''Wasp'']], [[USS Fly (1776)|''Fly'']], [[USS Andrew Doria (1775)|''Andrew Doria'']], [[USS Cabot (1775)|''Cabot'']], [[USS Providence (1775)|''Providence'']], and [[USS Columbus (1774)|''Columbus'']].  In addition to ships' crews, it carried 200 marines under the command of [[Samuel Nicholas]].&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 108-113&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of high winds, the fleet remained together for two days, when ''Fly'' and ''Hornet'' became separated from the fleet.  ''Hornet'' was forced to return to port for repairs, and ''Fly'' eventually caught up with the fleet at Nassau, after the raid took place.  Hopkins did not let the apparent loss of the two ships dissuade him; he had intelligence that much of the British fleet was in port due to the poor conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hand, pp. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Browne received intelligence in late February that a rebel fleet was assembling off the [[Delaware]] coast, but apparently took no significant actions to prepare a defense.&lt;ref name=M182&gt;McCusker, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;  New Providence's harbor had two primary defenses.  Fort Nassau was in Nassau itself, was poorly sited to defend the port against amphibious attacks, and had walls that were not strong enough to support the action of its 46 cannon.  As a result, [[Fort Montagu]] had been constructed in 1742 on the eastern end of the harbor, commanding its entrance.  At the time of the raid, it was fortified with 17 cannon,&lt;ref name=M182/&gt; although most of the gunpowder and ordnance was at Fort Nassau.&lt;ref name=R101/&gt;

===Surprise foiled===
The fleet arrived at Abaco Island on March 1, 1776. The force captured two [[sloops]] owned by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], one of those men being Capt. Gideon Lowe of Green Turtle Cay, and pressed their owners to serve as pilots.  George Dorsett, a local ship's captain, got away from Abaco and alerted Governor Browne to the presence of the rebel fleet.&lt;ref name=M181&gt;McCusker, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

The landing force was transferred to the two captured sloops and ''Providence'' the next day, and plans were formulated for the assault.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  While the main fleet held back, the three ships carrying the landing force were to enter the port at daybreak on March 3, and gain control of the town before the alarm could be raised.&lt;ref name=M183/&gt;

[[Image:Samuel Nicholas.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Captain [[Samuel Nicholas]]]]
However, the alarm was raised early in Nassau when the three ships were spotted, with Governor Browne roused from his bed.  He ordered four guns fired from Fort Nassau to alert the militia; two of the guns came off their mounts when they were fired.&lt;ref name=R100/&gt;  At 7 am he held a discussion with Samuel Gambier, one of his councillors, over the idea that the gunpowder should be removed from the islands on the ''Mississippi Packet'', a fast ship docked in the harbor.  They ultimately did not act on the idea, but Browne ordered thirty mostly unarmed militiamen to occupy Fort Montagu before retiring to his house to &quot;make himself a little decent&quot;.&lt;ref name=M183&gt;McCusker, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landing and capture===
When the guns at Fort Nassau were heard by the attackers, they realized their surprise was lost, and aborted the assault.  The elements of the fleet rejoined in Hanover Sound, about six nautical miles east of Nassau.  There Hopkins held council, and a new plan of attack was developed.  With the landing force augmented by a company of fifty sailors under the command of ''Cabot''{{'s}} Lieutenant Thomas Weaver, who was familiar with the island,  the three ships, with the ''Wasp'' offering additional covering support, carried it to a point south and east of Fort Montagu, where they made an unopposed landing between noon and 2 pm.&lt;ref name=M184/&gt;  This was the first landing of what eventually became the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref name=M184&gt;McCusker, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

A Lieutenant Burke led a detachment out from Fort Montagu to investigate the rebel activity.  Given that he was severely outnumbered, he opted to send a truce flag to determine their intentions.  From this he learned that their objective was the powder and military stores.&lt;ref name=M185&gt;McCusker, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, Governor Browne arrived at Fort Montagu with another eighty militiamen.  Upon learning the size of the advancing force, he ordered three of the fort's guns fired, and withdrew all but a few men back to Nassau.  He himself retired to the governor's house, while most of the militiamen, rather than attempting to make a stand, also returned to their homes.&lt;ref name=M185/&gt;  Browne sent Lieutenant Burke out to parley with the rebels a second time, in order to &quot;wait on the Command Officer of the Enemy to know his Errand and on what account he had landed his troops.&quot;&lt;ref name=M185/&gt;

[[Image:NewProvidenceIsland1803.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An 1803 depiction of Nassau; the harbor entrances are on either side of Hog Island, just north of Nassau.]]
The firing of Montagu's guns had given Nichols pause for concern, but his men had occupied the fort, and he was consulting with his officers on their next move when Burke arrived.  They obligingly repeated to Burke that they had arrived to take the powder and weapons, and were prepared to assault the town.  Burke brought this news back to Browne around 4 pm.&lt;ref name=M185/&gt;  Rather than advance further on Nassau, Nichols and his force remained at Fort Montagu that night.&lt;ref name=R102&gt;Riley, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;  Browne held a war council that evening, in which the decision was made to attempt the removal of the gunpowder.  At midnight, 162 of 200 barrels of gunpowder were loaded onto the ''Mississippi Packet'' and the HMS ''St. John'', and at 2 am they sailed out of Nassau harbor, bound for Saint Augustine.&lt;ref name=R101&gt;Riley, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  This feat was made possible because Hopkins had neglected to post even a single ship to guard the harbor's entrance channels, leaving the fleet safely anchored in Hanover Sound.&lt;ref name=M187&gt;McCusker, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Nichols' marines occupied Nassau without resistance the next morning, after a leaflet written by Commodore Hopkins was distributed throughout the town.  They were met en route by a committee of the town's leaders, who offered up the town's keys.&lt;ref name=R102/&gt;&lt;ref name=M187/&gt;

===Return voyage===
Hopkins and his fleet remained at Nassau for two weeks, loading as much weaponry as would fit onto the ships, including the remaining 38 casks of gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 115-117, lists the entire inventory taken&lt;/ref&gt;  He pressed into service a local sloop, the ''Endeavour'', to carry some of the materiel.&lt;ref name=F117&gt;Field, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor Browne complained that the rebel officers consumed most of his liquor stores during the occupation, and also wrote that he was taken in chains like a &quot;felon to the gallows&quot; when he was arrested and taken to the ''Alfred''.&lt;ref name=R102/&gt;

During their sojourn at Nassau, the ''Fly'' arrived.  Her captain reported that she and the ''Hornet'' had fouled their riggings together, and that ''Hornet'' suffered significant damage as a consequence.&lt;ref name=F117/&gt;  On March 17, the fleet sailed for [[Block Island]] Channel off [[Newport, Rhode Island]], with Governor Browne and other officials as prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;  The return voyage was uneventful until the fleet reached the waters of [[Long Island]].  On April 4 they encountered and captured the [[HMS Hawk (1775)|HMS ''Hawk'']], and the next day they captured the ''Bolton'', which was laden with stores that included more armaments and powder.  The fleet finally met resistance on April 6, when it encountered the [[HMS Glasgow (1757)|HMS ''Glasgow'']], a heavily-armed [[sixth-rate]] ship.  In [[Action of 6 April 1776|the ensuing action]], ''Glasgow'' was driven off, although ''Cabot'' was severely damaged, with her captain and ten others killed or wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

The fleet sailed into the harbor at [[New London, Connecticut]] on April 8.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Browne was eventually exchanged for American general [[William Alexander (American general)|William Alexander (Lord Stirling)]], and was roundly criticized for his handling of the whole affair.&lt;ref name=R103&gt;Riley, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Nassau remained relatively poorly-defended, and was again subjected to American rebel threat in January 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; It was then [[Capture of The Bahamas (1782)|seized by Spanish forces]] under [[Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez|Bernardo de Gálvez]] in 1782, and returned to British control after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Two ships of the United States Navy have been christened [[USS Nassau|USS ''Nassau'']]; [[USS Nassau (LHA-4)|one]] is named specifically in recognition of this battle.&lt;ref&gt;History of USS Nassau (LHA-4)&lt;/ref&gt;

==[Insert name here], [YYYY]==
[[w:USS Alfred (1774)|USS ''Alfred'']] was inactive through the summer for a number of reasons, but high on the list of her problems were want of funds and a shortage of men. On 7 August, Captain [[w:John Paul Jones|John Paul Jones]] was placed in command of the ship USS ''Alfred''. Captain John Paul Jones had helped fit USS ''Alfred'' as a warship, and had been its first lieutenant on the cruise during the [[w:Battle of Nassau|Nassau expedition]] to [[w:New Providence, Bahamas|New Providence, Bahamas]] in early March 1776. USS ''Alfred'' departed [[w:Providence, Rhode Island|Providence, Rhode Island]], on 26 October 1776, in company with USS ''Hampden''. But USS ''Hampden'' struck a &quot;sunken rock&quot; before they could leave [[w:Narragansett Bay|Narragansett Bay]]. USS ''Hampden'' returned to [[w:Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] where the officers and men then shifted to sloop [[w:USS Providence|USS ''Providence'']] to continue with USS ''Alfred'' to the waters off of [[w:Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton Island]] which they reached by mid-November. USS ''Alfred'' took three prizes: on the 11th, the brigantine HMS ''Active'', bound from Liverpool to Halifax with an assorted cargo; the next day, the armed transport HMS ''Mellish'', laden with winter uniforms for British troops at Quebec; and, on the 16th, the HMS ''Kitty'', bound from [[w:Gaspé, Quebec|Gaspé]] to [[w:Barbados|Barbados]] with oil and fish.

Because of severe leaks, Providence sailed for home soon thereafter and Alfred continued her cruise alone. On 22 November boats from the ship raided [[w:Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso, Nova Scotia]], where their crews burned a transport bound for [[w:Canada|Canada]] with provisions and a warehouse full of whale oil, besides capturing a small schooner to replace USS ''Providence''. Two days later, USS ''Alfred'' captured three colliers off [[w:Louisbourg, Nova Scotia|Louisbourg]], bound from [[w:Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia]] to [[w:New York|New York]] with coal for the [[w:British Army|British Army]]. On 26 November , USS ''Alfred' captured the 10-gun letter-of-marque John of Liverpool. On the homeward voyage, Alfred was pursued by HMS ''Milford'' but managed to escape after a four-hour chase. She arrived safely at [[w:Boston|Boston]] on 15 December and began a major refit.

However, Marines did fight on the duel between {{USS|Alliance|1778|6}} and {{HMS|Sibyl|1779|6}} on 10 March 1783, the last recorded shots of the war, and Pvt Robert Stout of that ship would be the last recorded mention of a Continental Marine one year later. Major Nicholas would die from [[w:yellow fever]] on 27 August 1790. In all, the Continental Marines suffered 49 dead and 70 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;casualties&quot;&gt;Marine Corps casualties by war: [http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Frequently_Requested/Casualties.htm Marine Corps History Division] and

On 28 June Pennsylvania’s brig ''Nancy'' arrived in [[w:Cape May]] with 386 barrels of powder in her hold and ran aground while under fire while attempting to elude British blockaders {{HMS|Kingfisher|1770)|6}} and {{HMS|Orpheus|1773|6}}. The next evening, the Continental Marines aboard ''Lexington'', along with four American warships to assist the wreck ''Nancy''.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; By dawn, the crew in small boats unloaded weaponry and precious gunpowder, leaving only 100 barrels of powder behind. Barry devised a delayed action fuse just as a boatload of British seamen boarded Nancy, exploding the powder.

The Continental sailors and Marines aboard ''Reprisal'' and then headed south to the [[w:Caribbean Islands]] on 27 July. Their assignment was to bring [[w:William Bingham]], who had been appointed agent from the American colonies to Martinique, in acquiring [[w:military  
intelligence|intelligence]], and additional arms and supplies for George Washington's armies.  While enroute, they encountered the British  
[[w:Sloop-of-war|sloop-of-war]] {{HMS|Shark|1776|6}} off the coast of Martinique and forced her out of the area. ''Reprisal'' and her accompanying Marines returned to Philadelphia from the [[w:West Indies]] on 13 September.

The Continental sailors and Marines aboard ''[[w:USS Providence (1775)|Providence]]'' sails north to Canada toward Nova Scotia. By 22 September, the sailors and Marines reached [[w:Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso Harbor]] and recaptured the small port.  The following next day, they struck [[w:Isle Madame]] destroying fishing boats. On 27 September while fishing, ''Providence'', became under surprise attack from the British frigate ''[[w:HMS Milford (1759)|HMS Milford]]''.  Although surprised, the smaller American ship managed to escape in a day of expert sailing.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

Meanwhile at sea, ''Lexington'' becomes captured by the British frigate ''HMS Pearl''.  Momentarily, Marine Captain [[w:Abraham Boyce]] leads his men and ''Lexington'''s sailors in overtaking the small British prize crew. ''Alfred'' also engaged combat with ''HMS Milford'' on 9 December. Although the British frigate was better-armed,  the American ship was able to out-sail their opponent and escape unharmed. The Continental Marines and sailors were able to escape to the harbor at [[w:Baltimore, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

In the [[w:Bay of Biscay]] off [[w:France]], on 5 February, the Continental Marines aboard ''[[w:USS Reprisal (1776)|Reprisal]]'' led a boarding party that seized and sank ''[[w:HMS Swallow (1769)|HMS Swallow]]''.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;The 32-gun frigate ''[[w:USS Randolph (1776)|Randolph]]'' was put to sea in early February 1777, joining the smaller Continental vessels from Hopkins's squadron.&lt;ref name= Clark,&gt;{{cite book | last = Clark | first = William Bell | authorlink = | title = Captain Dauntless: The Story of Nicholas Biddle of the Continental Navy | publisher = Louisiana State University Press | year = 1949 | location = Baton Rouge, LA | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantly, the Continental Navy attempted to breach the cordon of British vessels awaiting their departure; tasks in reaching the  
open seas came with such burden that Congress and the state assemblies attempted to mount a serious naval campaign in an effort to drive away the British warships that were blockading the American harbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clark | first = William Bell | authorlink =  | title = Gallant John Berry |publisher = MacMillan | year = 1938 | location = New York, NY | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One achievement was that they warranted in shifting some of its cruises to European waters, using the ports of their ally, France, as a [[w:base of operation]]. Although it did not totally hinder nor prevent the Royal Navy from going anywhere in American waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Morgan | first = William J. | authorlink =  | title = Captains to Northward: The New England Captains in the Continental Navy | publisher = Barre Gazette | year = 1959 | location = Barre, MA | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But the naval campaigns did made it costly for Great Britain to maintain its army in American.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevMarines&quot;/&gt;

Marines made another overseas strike, raiding the coast of Britain (notably at [[w:Whitehaven]]) with [[w:John Paul Jones]] on the  
{{USS|Ranger|1777|6}} in April 1777.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RevMarines&quot; /&gt;

''[[w:USS Alfred (1774)|Alfred]]''; and ''[[w:USS Raleigh (1776)|Raleigh]]'' under command of Capt. Thomas Thompson; and their accompanying  
Continental Marines, departed for France on 22 August 1777. On 4 September, the Continental Marines aboard the frigate ''Raleigh'' participated in the bold attack on the British sloop ''[[w:HMS Druid (1776)|HMS Druid]]''.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; The approach of the remaining British escorts forced them to break off, unabling them to sink or capture any British prizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/r/raleigh.htm U.S. Naval History on USS Raleigh (1776)]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 14 September 1777, ''Reprisal'' left France, for [[w:New England]].

On 19 September, ''[[w:USS Lexington (1776)|Lexington]]'' and her Marine detachments are defeated by the British cutter ''[[w:HMS Alert (1777)|HMS Alert]]'', near France.

The Continental frigate ''[[w:USS Delaware (1776)|Delaware]]'' and her Marines were forced onto a shoal in the Delaware River as they fought with British batteries guarding the approaches to Philadelphia occupied by the British.  Although ''Delaware'' was captured, many of the sailors and Marines managed to escape.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

On 1 October 1777, caught in an Atlantic storm, ''[[w:USS Reprisal (1776)|Reprisal]]'' foundered off the banks of [[w:Newfoundland]] and all 129 on board (sailors and Marines), except the cook, went down with her. Continental naval officer in command of [[w:sloop-of-war]] ''[[w:USS Ranger (1777)|Ranger]]'', Captain [[w:John Paul Jones]], sailed for [[w:Nantes, France]], on 1 November 1777, to dispatch news to Commissioner [[w:Benjamin Franklin]] about the American [[w:Saratoga campaign|victory of Saratoga]] and the surrender of British General [[w:John Burgoyne]].  On the voyage over, two British prizes were captured. ''Ranger'' arrived at Nantes on 2 December.  Captain Jones sold the prizes and delivered the news of the victory at Saratoga to Dr. Ben Franklin.

During a surprise attack on the night of 28 January 1778, Marines repeated  the raid on smaller scale once again at [[w:New Providence Island]], on Nassau in the Bahamas, under Captains John Trevett and [[w:John Rathbun]]. The [[w:Betsy Ross flag|'Stars and Stripes']] was hoisted over a foreign shore for the first time.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; It was repeated again for the third time, in May 1782, with [[w:Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez|Bernardo de Gálvez]] to secure the island for the [[w:Spain in the American Revolutionary War|Spanish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot; /&gt;

The ill-fated day of 7 March, the frigate ''Randolph'', commanded by [[w:Nicholas Biddle]], explodes while commencing in a firefight with ''[[w:HMS Yarmouth (1745)|HMS Yarmouth]]'', a British 64-gun [[w:ship of the line|ship-of-the-line]].&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;  During battle, the powder magazines onboard combusted, exploding the entire hull.  ''Randolph'' sank taking a loss of 301 sailors, soldiers, and Marines.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

On 9 March 1778, near [[w:Barbados]] in the [[w:Lesser Antilles]] of the [[w:Caribbean Sea]], ''[[w:USS Alfred (1774)|Alfred]]'' and ''[[w:USS Raleigh (1776)|Raleigh]]'' encountered British warships ''[[w:HMS Ariadne (1776)|HMS Ariadne]]'' and ''[[w:HMS Ceres (1777)|HMS Ceres]]''. When the American ships attempted to flee, ''Alfred'' fell behind her faster consort ''Raleigh'', who was unable to reach Alfred in time to assist her.  Shortly afternoon the British [[w:men-of-war]] caught up with Alfred and forced her to surrender after a half an hour's battle.  The Marine detachment, along with the Continental sailors, were taken prisoner.  ''Raleigh'' continued north to [[w:New England]]. On 27 March, ''Raleigh''  was chased ashore on [[w:Point Judith]], near [[w:Newport, Rhode Island]], by a British squadron. The Continental Marines hold off an attack by Royal Marines while the crewmen unload valuable equipment from the grounded ship.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; The Continental Navy ship ''[[w:USS Raleigh (1776)|Raleigh]]'' returned to [[w:New England]] early in April 1778.

On 1 May 1778, the Marines assist in a night battle with the British frigate ''HMS Lark'' in [[w:Narragansett Bay]] as ''Providence'' escapes the blockade and makes it to the open sea.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; Accused of cowardice and dereliction of duty for not aiding ''Alfred'', Captain Thomas Thompson was suspended soon after reaching port. On 30 May 1778 the [[w:Marine Committee]] appointed [[w:John Barry (naval officer)|John Barry]] to replace him as captain.

On 3 August 1778, the sailors and Marines aboard the Continental Navy ship ''[[w:USS General Gates (1764)|General Gates]]'' and intercepted, then defeated, the British [[w:letter-of-marque]] brigantine ''HMS  Montague'', whose under command of Captain [[w:Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

The Marines aboard ''Providence'' attack a 30-ship convoy on 7 August, off the coast of Nova Scotia.  They inflict damage on an armed transport carrying [[w:Highland troops]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

On 27 September, the British ships ''HMS Experiment'' and ''HMS Unicorn'' engage Continental ship ''[[w:USS Raleigh (1776)|Raleigh]]'' off the [[w:Penobscot River]], [[w:Maine]], and force her aground.  Some of the Marines and sailors escape to shore, but more are captured.&lt;ref  
name=Hoffman/&gt;

Marines would mainly participate in in the naval battles of the war, fighting ship-to-ship, such as the [[w:Battle of Valcour Island]] and famed [[w:Battle of Flamborough Head]]. Marksmen would perch in the upper riggings and masts of the ship to fire on enemy sailors from above. However, unlike British Marines, the Continental Marines would take the then-unorthodox missions of landing parties and other services ashore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot; /&gt; For example, Marines would support batteries ashore at the [[w:Siege of Charleston]] in the spring of 1780.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot; /&gt;

The last official act of the Continental Marines was to escort a stash of silver, on loan from [[w:Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI of France]], from Boston to Philadelphia to enable the opening of the [[w:Bank of North America|Bank of North America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot; /&gt;

=====June 1776=====
On 28 June Pennsylvania’s brig Nancy arrived in the area with 386 barrels of powder in her hold and ran aground while attempting to elude British blockaders Kingfisher and Orpheus.&lt;ref name=RekonDog/&gt;

Boats from the four American warships unloaded the precious powder during the night leaving only 100 barrels in Nancy at dawn. Barry then devised a delayed action fuse which exploded the powder just as a boatload of British seamen boarded Nancy.

'''—''USS Lexington''—'''&lt;BR&gt;
On 29 June, the Continental Marines aboard ''Lexington'' assisted in the unloading of arms and gunpowder from [[Pennsylvania Navy]] brigantine ''Nancy'' that has been ran aground while under fire from ''[[HMS Orpheus (1773)|HMS Orpheus]]'' and ''[[HMS Kingfisher (1770)|HMS Kingfisher]]''.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

=====July=====
July 4 1776, the Declaration of Independence is signed.

The Continental sailors and Marines aboard ''[[USS Reprisal (1776)|Reprisal]]'' headed south to the [[Caribbean Islands]] on 27 July to bring [[William Bingham]], who had been appointed agent from the American colonies to Martinique, in acquiring [[military intelligence|intelligence]], and additional arms and supplies for George Washington's armies.  While enroute, they encountered the British [[Sloop-of-war|sloop-of-war]] ''[[HMS Shark (1776)|HMS Shark]]'' off the coast of Martinique and forced her out of the area.

=====August=====
By autumn of 1776, Major Nicholas raised four new companies of Marines for four of the new frigates that were to be completed and commissioned in Philadelphia.  Armed with marines by the Pennsylvania Committee of Safety, the detachments guarded both the Continental and state vessels and store while waiting for their frigates to sail.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;

=====September=====
On 5 September 1776, the Marine Committee apportioned a uniform for the Continental Marines.  The standard uniform was a short green coat with white trim, complemented by a white waistcoat, white or buff short breeches, woolen stockings, and a short black gaiter.  Marine officers wore small cocked hats, and a single epaulette;&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; and the enlisted men sported round black hats with the brim pinned on one side.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;  The adoption of green coats and round hats probably reflects the constraints of availability, for both of the uniform attire were used by the Philadelphia Associators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = McClellan|first = Edwin North|authorlink = |coauthors = |title = Uniforms of the American Marines, 1775 to 1829 | publisher = Marine Corps History and Museums Division |year = 1974 [reprint]|location = Washington, D.C.; Maryland|url = |doi =  |isbn = 1-59114-790-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It wasn't until the year 1777 that the Marines entirely appeared in uniform in numbers.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

The Continental sailors and Marines aboard ''[[USS Providence (1775)|Providence]]'' sails north to Canada toward Nova Scotia.  By 22 September, the sailors and Marines reached [[Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso Harbor]] and recaptured the small port.  The following next day, they struck [[Isle Madame]] destroying fishing boats.  On 27 September while fishing, ''Providence'', became under surprise attack from the British frigate ''[[HMS Milford (1759)|HMS Milford]]''.  Although surprised, the smaller American ship managed to escape in a day of expert sailing.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

''[[USS Reprisal (1776)|Reprisal]]'' and her accompaning Marines returned to Philadelphia from the [[West Indies]] on 13 September.

Sometime in October, [[Sergeant#United States|Sergeants]] William Hamilton and Alexander Neilson are promoted to [[Lieutenant]], being the first recorded &quot;[[Mustang (military officer)|mustangs]]&quot; (enlistees who received field commission) in the Marine Corps.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

On 24 October 1776, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was dispatched to France as appointed '[[United States Ambassador to France |Commissioner to France]]' for Congress.  Captain [[Lambert Wickes]] was ordered by the Continental Congress to proceed to [[Nantes, France]], aboard ''[[USS Reprisal (1776)|Reprisal]]''.  En route to France, the sailors and Marines captured two brigantines.

=====November=====
In late November 1776, General Washington's Continental Army positions along the [[Hudson River]] collapsed from the concurring assaults of British forces.  In emergency response Washington requested assistance of a brigade of Philadelphia militia, a company of local seamen, and Major Nicholas's four companies of Continental Marines.  George Washington wrote a staunchly letter to  [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]], a brigadier general of the Pennsylvania Associators:
:''&quot;...if they came out resolved to act upon Land...instead their Services to the Water only.&quot;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;—''George Washington to John Cadwalader,  7 December 1776.''

''[[USS Reprisal (1776)|Reprisal]]'' reaches [[Nantes, France]] on 29 November, becoming the first vessel of the Continental Navy to arrive in European waters.

=====December=====
On 2 December, Major Samuel Nicholas and his three companies of Marines, garrisoned at the Marine barracks in Philadelphia, were tasked to reinforce Washington's retreating army from New York through [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] to slow the progress of British troops southward through New Jersey.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;  Unsure what to do with the Marines, Washington requested that the Marines be attached to a brigade militiamen from the Philadelphia Associators, in which were also dressed in green uniforms alike of the Continental Marines.&lt;ref name=RekonDog/&gt;

The American marines marched off to aid in support an American army for the first time in history; Major Nicholas led a battalion of 130 officers and enlisted men from Philadelphia,&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; leaving behind one company to man the Continental vessels, and joined Calwalader's brigade of Pennsylvania Associators, a force of 1,200 men.  The Marines lived side-by-side with the militia brigade in [[Bristol, Pennsylvania]] for two weeks waiting for an attack from the British.  However, the British army instead went into winter quarters along the [[New Jersey]] shore of the [[Delaware River]].&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;

Meanwhile at sea, ''Lexington'' becomes captured by the British frigate ''HMS Pearl''.  Momentarily, Marine Captain [[Abraham Boyce]] leads his men and ''Lexington'''s sailors in overtaking the small British prize crew.  The Continental Marines and sailors were able to escape to the harbor at [[Baltimore, Maryland]].  ''Alfred'' also engaged combat with ''HMS Milford'' on 9 December.  Although the British frigate was better-armed, the American ship was able to out-sail their opponent and escape unharmed.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

On Christmas Day, General Washington attack the German garrison at Trenton, though Calwalader's brigade were unable to arrive in time to affect the [[battle of Trenton|battle for Trenton]], due to problems crossing the ice-choked Delaware River; Calwalader finally crossed the river on 27 December on his own initiative reaching Trenton by 2 January as Washington concentrated his army.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;

====1777====

For the first two years of the Revolutionary War, through all the tribulations that the Continental navy and its marine detachments had experienced, it had not been very discouraging. However, it began to decline as Great Britain mobilized, although they were facing war at all fronts with Europe; they could not deploy all of its fleet to the New England colonies. The Royal Navy increased its surplus in warships as they attempted to maintain control of the seas.

Continental Congress had twenty-seven commissioned vessels during the winter of 1776–1777 but declined dramatically thereafter; the Navy and its Marine detachments during its first two years  Its manpower was is most cases not larger than 3,000 sailors and Marines.

&lt;ref name=Smith, &quot;Revolutionary Marines&quot;/&gt;



The also state navies were not proportioned larger than the Continental Navy, nor the hundreds of small [[privateer]]s that cruised the eastern seaboard.

&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;

Even as England mobilized its fleet, they themselves faced a very hostile Europe, their strength increased enough to maintain control of the seas, and struggled to deploy all its fleets to the North America waters.  The Royal Navy numbered 268 vessels and by the end of war, the numbers grew to 468; its naval personnel increased from 18,000 to 110,000.   Nonetheless, the American naval forces found it increasingly difficult to take prizes, let alone influence the outcome of the war.&lt;ref name=Paullin&gt;{{cite book|last = Paullin |first = Charles O.  |authorlink = |coauthors = |title = The Navy of the American Revolution |publisher = Burrows Brothers |year = 1906 |location = Chicago, IL |url = |doi =  |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans shifted part of their operations to European waters and depended on France for ports, suppliers, some seamen and marines, and government money; as well as the protection of the [[French navy]].  Although the French goverment did not become a belligerent until 1778, American navies used the French ports for naval operations as early as January 1777.

The naval war in the European waters were guided by commissioners [[Silas Deane]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[John Adams]].  In 1777, Franklin purchased and outfitted three vessels; ''[[USS Reprisal (1776)|Reprisal]]'', commanded by Captain [[Lambert Wickes]], was the only patriot ship manned by all-American Marines—''[[USS Lexington (1776)|Lexington]]'' and the other new vessels were manned by mixed crews, mostly recruits from France.&lt;ref name=RekonDog/&gt;

=====January=====
As Calwalader and his brigade managed to reach Trenton on 2 January from across the Delaware River, the Continental Marines watched the cannonade between the Continental Army and [[Lord Cornwallis]]' British Army at [[Assunpink Creek]].  The Marines helped defend a crucial bridge against a [[Battle of Trenton#Hessian moves|Hessian attack]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

On the night of 3 January, Calwalader's brigade (including Major Nicholas's battalion of Continental Marines) and General Washington's Army silently departs the battlefield and marches toward [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].  By daybreak, they launched a two-pronged attack.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;  The first prong of attack, led by Brigadier General [[Hugh Mercer]], a close friend of George Washington, attacked a British stronghold.  Mercer's brigade ran into heavy, disciplined musketry of two British regiments that were well-emplaced in front of Princeton, Mercer's brigade position soon collapsed.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;  Calwalader's brigade (along with the Marines) came to the assistance, but too stumbled into the British infantry forcing them to fall back.  The second prong of attack caught the British on in open flank, scattering three British regiments and took Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Stryker |first = William S. |authorlink = |coauthors = |title = The Battles of Trenton and Princeton |publisher = Houghton Mifflin |year = 1898 |location = Boston, MA |url = |doi =  |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The battle for Princeton was the first engagement that the Continental Marines fought and died in battle.

After the [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]]–[[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] campaign, Nicholas's four-company battalion discontinued service; reduced by transfers, desertion, and disease of eighty Marines.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;  The remaining three companies encamped at its winter quartering at [[Sweets Town]], not far from Washington's bivouac at [[Jockey Hollow]], [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] on 4 January.&lt;ref name=RekonDog/&gt;

=====February=====
From 1 February 1777 and throughout the winter, the two companies of Marines either transferred to Morristown to assume the roles in the Continental artillery batteries, or left the service altogether.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;  Captain Robert Mullan's company returned to Philadelphia as prisoner guards after they found that there was no ship to man.  Many would also return to Philadelphia in the spring to become part of the detachments of the new Continental galley ''[[USS Washington (1776 row galley)|Washington]]'' [the third ship to be named as such] and the frigate ''[[USS Delaware (1776)|Delaware]]''.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

In the [[Bay of Biscay]] off [[France]], on 5 February, the Continental Marines aboard ''[[USS Reprisal (1776)|Reprisal]]'' led a boarding party that seized and sank ''[[HMS Swallow (1769)|HMS Swallow]]''.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

The 32-gun frigate ''[[USS Randolph (1776)|Randolph]]'' was put to sea in early February 1777, joining the smaller Continental vessels, mostly from Hopkins's squadron.&lt;ref name= Clark, &quot;Dauntless&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Clark | first = William Bell | authorlink = | title = Captain Dauntless: The Story of Nicholas Biddle of the Continental Navy | publisher = Louisiana State University Press | year = 1949 | location = Baton Rouge, LA | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantly, the Continental Navy attempted to breach the cordon of British vessels awaiting their departure; tasks in reaching the open seas came with such burden that Congress and the State assemblies attempted to mount a serious naval campaign in an effort to drive the British warships blockading the American harbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clark | first = William Bell | authorlink =  | title = Gallant John Berry |publisher = MacMillan | year = 1938 | location = New York, NY | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One achievement was that they warranted in shifting some of its cruises to European waters, using the ports of their ally, France, as a [[base of operation]]; although it did not totally hinder nor prevent the Royal Navy from going anywhere in American waters.&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite book | last = Morgan | first = William J. | authorlink =  | title = Captains to Northward: The New England Captains in the Continental Navy | publisher = Barre Gazette | year = 1959 | location = Barre, MA | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The naval campaigns made it costly for Great Britain to maintain its army in American.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

When the American ships attempted to flee, ''Alfred'' fell behind her faster consort ''Raleigh'', who was unable to reach Alfred in time to assist her.  Shortly after noon the British [[men-of-war]] caught up with Alfred and forced her to surrender after a half an hour's battle.  The Marine detachment, along with the Continental sailors, were taken prisoner.  ''Raleigh'' continued north to [[New England]].&lt;ref name=RekonDog/&gt;

|description = These flowers are no larger than a grown-up's finger nail.  Bluets have four petals that each come to a point.  They are mostly white, but sometimes have a touch of blue in them.  The center of the flower is yellow.  The leaves grow around the bottom of the stem.  Bluets usually stay low to the ground, but sometimes can grow as high as 8 inches.  They are usually found in grassy places.  Sometimes you can find them in yards, or even along a trail.  
|facts = These flowers first appear right around Mother's Day.  Some children love to pick them and give them to their mothers as an extra special gift.

The name &quot;arrowhead&quot; comes from the shape of the leaves.  The roots of this plant are edible, and were once harvested by the Native Americans.  They would wade out into the water barefooted and use their toes to dig up the roots.  Once the roots were freed from the mud, they would float to the surface where they could be easily picked up.

|description = Floating heart is plant you can find in ponds.  Take a close look at the leaves in the picture above.  Can you guess why this plant is called &quot;Floating Heart?&quot;  That's right!  The leaves are heart-shaped, and they float on the surface of the water.  The flowers are small with five white petals.  When the flowers get old, they start to fade and become almost see-through.  
|facts = The Miccosukee, a tribe of Native Americans from Florida, used Floating Heart to treat shortness of breath, trembling, and coughing – an illness they called &quot;turtle sickness.&quot;

|description = This plant lives in ponds, in the shallow parts of lakes, and in slow moving streams.  The flower is famous for its lovely scent.  Long stems grow from the roots and stretch all the way to the surface of the water where the leaves and flowers float.  The leaves are very round with a notch in them.  The stem attaches to the bottom of this notch, near the center of the leaf.  The flowers have bright yellow ''stamens'' ('''stay'''-minz) in the center surrounded by lots of white petals.
|facts =The flowers open each day and close again each night.

Insects visit this plant to help it make new plants (scientists call this ''pollination''), and without their help, there would be no pipewort!  If the plant did not grow tall enough to get its flower above the water, how could insects pollinate it?
|facts =The name &quot;Pipewort&quot; has two parts: &quot;Pipe&quot; and &quot;Wort&quot;.  The ''pipe'' part is easy, because the plant is shaped like a pipe.  But what about the ''wort'' part?  &quot;Wort&quot; is a very old word that means &quot;plant&quot;, so you'll see it in a lot of plant names (Liverwort, Saint John's Wort to name two).

|description =Indian Pipe is an all-white plant with a single flower nodding at the end of the stem.  The reason this plant is all white is because it has no ''chlorophyll'' ('''klor''-uh-fill).  Chlorophyll is the stuff inside a plant that helps turn sunlight into food for the plant.  It also gives plants their green color.  Indian Pipe has tiny little leaves that look like scales on the stem.  It grows no more than about 10 inches tall.  Sometimes you might see one all by itself, and other times you might find several clumped together.  Indian Pipe grows in shady areas like forests.  Since it doesn't need sunlight, it can grow in darker places than most other plants.
|facts =If Indian Pipe doesn't have any chlorophyll, how can it get food?  The answer is that Indian Pipe is a ''parasite'' ('''pair'''-uh-site).  It gets its energy from a fungus that grows on the roots of trees.  The funny thing about that is that the fungus doesn't have chlorophyll either, and it gets its energy from the trees!  If you think about it, Indian Pipe is stealing energy that was stolen from a tree!

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Most Muslims respect animal and there is some words from prophet Mohammad about.

''It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A woman entered Hell because of a cat which she tied up and did not feed, nor did she allow it to eat of the vermin of the earth.''&lt;ref&gt;(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3140; Muslim, 2242. There is also a similar report from Abu Hurayrah).&lt;/ref&gt;

* In many Muslims countries people throw the food into trash cans. then cats digging in the trash to get it's food. while it's better to keep it in someplace so the cats can feed on it.

(So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it, And whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it)Quran 99:7-8

* Islam forbids Muslims to keep dogs, and the punishment for that is that the one who does that loses one or two qiraats from his hasanaat (good deeds) each day. An exception has been made in the case of keeping dogs for hunting, guarding livestock and guarding crops. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/69840/dog Keeping a dog, touching it and kissing it]&lt;/ref&gt; En

This article made me think about how useful formative assessment can be if used properly. The benchmarks given twice a year have always been a good way for me as a parent to evaluate what my child needs to work on.  As a teacher I could use them in the same way as well as other formative tests. All those '''POP''' quizzes in school to see if we were paying attention were formative tests I suppose.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 02:53, 8 August 2009 (UTC)


This article provides a lot of helpful informaiton concerning formative and summative information.  After having taught at the high school level for a few years, I can see how a number of comments in this article are right one target.  One observation I had is that many administrators and teachers are lacking in skills necessary to properly interpret formative and summative assessment data.  Also, I see how oftentimes teachers are too busy having to fit in other material to adequately use data from benchmarks for intervention purposes.  Too often, teachers report only scores of benchmarks to students, and this is, as the article argues, is not an effective means of giving feedback.  I agree with the usefulness of benchmarks and like the article I agree that formative assesments made by the teacher apart from the benchmarks are necessary and superior in preparing students for standardized tests such as the SOL.  Benchmarks don't measure knowledge of content as thoroughly as teacher made assessments can.  In my opinion, this article provides a lot of helpful insights for people such as us who are starting out in the teaching profession.   [[User:Mbrowder|Mbrowder]] ([[User talk:Mbrowder|talk]]) 20:43, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

I absolutely agree with the formative and summation assessment.  I feel these are great assessments that should be used to understand the teachers effectiveness and how much the student is actually learning.  What I really liked was the non graded formative assessments.  These are not used often...personal experience...and I think they would be extremely beneficial.  I feel too many times teachers do not worry whether a student gets material or not and will continue on tot he next subject without the students really learning the material.  Just from experience, I also feel that teachers do not take full advantage of te results received whether it is formative or summative. I do not see a large effort on insturctors part to change what they are doing to better aide the student. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 00:17, 10 June 2009 (UTC)


I really enjoyed reading the article, and felt that I learned a lot. A teacher can get a lot of useful information from formative tests, such as feedback on what the students are learning and need help on, and also to let them know what types of lessons and strategies that the students learned more from. It is a shame that more teachers are not able to take real advantage of formative assessments due to lack of time and too much information to cover. Sometimes the teachers get to wrapped up in preparing for SOLs or other summative tests that they don't make it a point to get feedback from formative tests. If every teacher could do this and see what areas the students need help in, they could alter their teaching and get better results of summative tests later. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 00:58, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

This past year at my school there has been a focus on formative assessments.  It is interesting to see the reactions of some of the older teachers when this was announced.  We had quite a few in the &quot;old regime&quot; that felt they knew their curriculum and had x number of years implementing this course of study.  They didn't feel that they needed to use formative assessments as much as the newer teachers because they could identify when a student wasn't getting the information.   Being a first year teacher in this school system, I found the formative assessments to be valuable in the direction of the class.  You would come to find classes take a life of their own in the direction they go.  Having a one size fits all curriculum doesn't work.  I also found that more formative assessments led to better results on summative assessments.
[[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 00:05, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

I found this article to be very enlightening, in terms of calling to my attention the value of feedback and how to better the students/teacher from tests.  I agree with the point that feedback should be specific in order to help the students learn from his or her mistakes.  It is important for the teachers to take as much from the test setting as the students.  These tests can tell teachers what points that they should stress more than others, how they should better approach the information, and how to improve on the tests themselves.  The formative/summative, however, does not help in the formal test situation.  This sort of test is a pass or fail situation and therefore no real feedback can be given. [[User:Abeck017|Abeck017]] ([[User talk:Abeck017|talk]]) 01:19, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

I agree with various points on this article. It shows that student are far better off and benefit more from formative tests, that focus strictly on the materials learned. A student learns better when they feel like they are comfortable with the material, even if it is a test time, this information will be easier to retain. Formative assessments are quick, to the point and precise material acquired from learned lessons, while summative could be confusing, long and trying to fit a big curriculum into a small piece of paper.In conclusion, formative assessments lead to not only better results in other areas such as summative assessments but makes it easier for the individual to truly learn the material.[[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 02:14, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


It is refreshing to see that we have advanced enough to realize that summative assessment is not the true measure of a student. I have had the experience of being graded using formative tests and although I am a bit of a perfectionist it was a great experience.  It is hard to let the black and white graded performance go and embrace the formative but it speaks to the student as a person that has many facets of learning and requires feedback that will allow them to actually learn.  I think that the summative assessment is necessary for many reasons especially to create benchmarks and maintain curriculum guidelines but I think that students will respond better to a formative approach at assessment.[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 02:46, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


While I do agree with many points in this article, the added assessment it calls for seems to only worsen the problem of over testing. Students are already forced to take high stakes for state standards, as well as local sumative tests, now in order to assess the amount of learning taking place this article advocates giving non-graded quizzes. I very much agree with the reasoning behind such formative assessments, however with all that time spent testing, whether formative, or sumative, graded or not, that does not leave very much time for the students to actually learn. What good is school if all you do is test students on things they have learned, but you never give them anytime to learn it?[[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 20:59, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


I think that this article points out several great points. I know when i took the Virginia Standards of Learning tests I wasn't really sure of the reason of why we had to take them. After I read this article it was a little clearer as to why. The article talked about how both Summative and Formative testing are important in their own ways. One is needed to test a students knowledge and skill level and the other is used to give the student better feedback. When you take the SOL's you are basically just given a score and a pass/fail rating, this is good in some situations. While in others it really isn't as affective. [User:Rcoll029|Rcoll029]] ([[User talk:Rcoll029|talk]]) 22:03, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


I thought this article was very informative and answered a lot of questions regarding assessment. I have to agree with the Chappuis's about time restrictions. Classes today remind me of going to the doctor...you know, the &quot;get in, get out method&quot;...where you spend some of your time in the waiting room, or in the case of school...walking to class and listening for announcements...from there you get into the exam room to see the doctor who spends about 15 minutes with you before moving onto the next patient.  In school, by the time you are done with any announcements, handing back papers, or dealing with other issues...there is little time left to actually go over the class material before the bell rings (I am referring to middle school and high school). Trying to intermix assessments, tests, and other things is very daunting sometimes. In the article, I really liked the steps where the authors' asked question from the student's point of view...it makes a lot of sense.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 04:19, 14 June 2009 (UTC)



I agree with the main thrust of the article but I feel that, while mostly sound, the idea of “formative assessment” is poorly implemented at best. Additional testing, non-graded testing at that, does not sound like a very effective way to get students involved in learning. I think that other methods should be implemented such as “for fun” writing assignments, ideally creative assignments students can do for a nominal amount of extra credit, games in the class room, really anything other than more tests. While tests may seem the most direct and viable source of information, I question if students would really try to the best of their ability on “weightless” tests. With the rigors of testing already in place, and with the really quite abysmal state of any sort of after school activity, most students look at learning like a job. A terrible job, they don’t get paid for, with the added bonus of mind numbing take home work. In short, I love the idea, I hate the method.[[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 02:32, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

This article was full of ways to evaluate your students during the teaching process. Informative assessment makes complete sense.  These two articles have changed my ideas about tests and evaluations; how and why they are given.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 02:57, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I really enjoyed reading this article.  It is refreshing to see a young teachers point of view and to learn from the teachers mistakes as well as her successes.  I find that very important because one day soon I will be a new, young teacher.  I agree that assessments should be more than just tests.  Yes in order to get grades for students tests are needed, but each and every student is different and by using assessments teachers can better assess each of their students.  I want to be able to know how to reach each of my students and by reading this article I have learned how much a teacher can really care for her studetnts.

I enjoyed this article quite a bit and can relate with some of Ms. Tomlinson's views of assessment.  Many teachers label assessment as being a test-heavy task which serves as a measurement tool for learning outcomes.  Traditionally, we equate a child's score to what they have or have not learned.  My teaching experiences have taught me to look past summative assessment and utilize informative assessment in order to reach learners at all levels.  I agree with Ms. Tomilinson's understanding that assessment is a great way to identify the best learning styles or preferences of her students.  In a classroom that has a diverse population, it is essential to find what learning style is best for both the traditional and special education students.  A teacher can provide useful feedback to her students which, when used effectively, can meet learning targets using a variety of tools geared towards individual and group needs.  I agree with Ms. Tomlinson wholeheartedly when she says that assessment should be about the student, as well as the teacher.

I think it was interesting that in the beginning the teacher in the article didn’t really enjoy giving tests.  Definitely assessment doesn’t always have to be about tests.  Tests are necessary to assign grades…etc.…but the assessment that exists in the classroom that isn’t all about tests is just as important.  From reading this article it is apparent that this teacher really cared about the students learning the information that she presented in class and understood the importance of informative assessment.

I found this article to be incredibly interesting and helpful. Seeing things from the perspective of a young teacher learning from mistakes is a really great way for other new teachers to learn. It not only allows the reader to see the correct (or more useful) methods of assessment, but also how these ideas can be easily overlooked. The excitement of a classroom, students, etc. can seem a little bit like we are &quot;playing school&quot;, like the author explains. What is truly important is understanding the purpose behind how we teach and test and how the students learn. It may seem a bit overwhelming at first, but I think once we realize that being a teacher also means learning from our students, I think many people will find it to be much easier.

Between the two articles, I thought this one was the most informative.  This article made me see assessment in a new light.  The ten &quot;insights&quot; made me think about what assessment is really all about.  Not just giving test for grades.  I really believe that the 6th &amp; 10th understanding is important.  Assessment is not only for student.  It is also to help us to become better teachers and learn different ways to give instruction.  When we need to reteach, move ahead, or explain in different way.  Assessment is not just about teacher, I agree that is about the student/teacher relationship and both being part of their success.[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 00:07, 11 June 2009 (UTC)  

I thought this article was an eye opener.  I really liked the different understanding that author Tomlinson brought up. I agree with her 3rd understanding, because it may not be the way the teacher is teaching, but what is being taught. When teachers give assessments and see how the students respond, this gives the teacher a chance to interact with the student and ask questions as to what they understand about the subject/lesson.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 21:43, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

I really enjoyed reading this well-written article on assessment The author admits that when she first became a teacher, she paid little attention to assessment. However, over time, she realized the importance and significance of assessment for both the teacher and student. I greatly agree with the 10 understandings of assessment, and they really opened my eyes and make me think. The first understanding, that assessment is not just about tests, is so true. Providing the student with multiple ways of assessment allows the teacher to see where the student's strengths and weaknesses are. One student may be a bad test taker but an excellent writer. In the second understanding, feedback is focused on. Rather than just giving a grade in the gradebook, providing feedback really allows the student to see which specific areas are their strengths and which they can improve on. As the third understanding explains, assessment does not have to be formal, and can occur at any time. The final understanding I thought to be a powerful statement. Assessment is not just for the teacher, but for the students as well. Through correct and accurate assessment, students become better learners.

I thought this was an outstanding article.  Ms. Tomlinson provides a very thought provoking and insightful look into her evolution from seeing informative assessment as playing a minimal role in her classroom to becoming an advocate for it.  I found two of her “understandings” particularly interesting.  Understanding # 3, Informative Assessment isn’t Always Formal, shows the reader how important just observing a student can be in helping them.  It allows the teacher to tailor methods of learning to specific individuals or groups so that they can maximize their learning ability.  Understanding #6, Informative Assessment Isn’t an End in Itself, I thought was the most revealing “understanding” in Tomlinson’s article.  She sees informative assessment as the beginning of better instruction.  This article gives a clear understanding and examples of just how informative assessment can impact a classroom, both the teacher and the students.[[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 19:52, 8 June 2009 (UTC)


This artilce was very interesting. It really exposed what many young teachers do as &quot;playing school&quot;. Much like the author, my main intention is not to teach, but I want to be sure, if I do teach, to give the students as much as I can. I thought the article was very effective because it was set up in a FAQ way. The ten &quot;understandings&quot; that it laid out are things that I think many teachers are not clear about. I thought Understanding 4 was very important and eye opening. In the past, with expeirence I've had in being a student, I feel as if many teachers think that teaching and assessment are two completely different things and should be handled at different times in different ways. Contrarily, this is not the case. Teaching curriculum, giving feedback, and giving assessment should all go hand-in-hand. This article was very helpful and includes many things that I will try to keep in mind when I am teaching. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 22:16, 10 June 2009 (UTC)


I found the article to be very powerful and helpful. I liked the insight where she said that assessment allowed her to become a better teacher. I think that we all need to assess ourselves as well as our students. They learn from us and we learn from them. She was also very avid about feedback. In one sentence I believe she mentioned how feedback would even ease the mind of a student who received a poor grade. It does make sense when you think about it. Pretty much everything you think assessment is, isn't. I believe that is the key to this entire article. It's not the tests, it's not the gradebook, and it's not even formal. Who would have thought? I acknowledge her for her believing that she still, after 30 years of teaching, is not done with insights on assessment. I believe this to be helpful to future educators to not only better their students, but themselves also. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 01:37, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

Carol Ann Tomlinson in her article shows not only her development of assessment practices but her own willingness to learn, a philosophy that I try to live by which is; you are never too old to learn, and you learn something new every day.  She also shows that as teachers we have to be willing to try new ideas.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 03:06, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

Another showcase of the subversive complexities that tend to spring up well after you've already entered the field of play. I quite enjoyed this. Although I think it's good to keep in mind all of the different facets/mantras that the author lists in accordance with assessments, it'd most likely drive you mad to try and implement them all. Keeping a filing system on the strengths and weaknesses of a multitude of students and adjusting testings/lesson plans in lieu of information gathered in such a way– seems entirely admirable, but problematic in a time consuming fashion. I whole heatedly agree that the traditional mindset of assessment, i.e. grading &amp; testing, can prove to be utterly arbitrary, and a good teacher should always keep in mind other strategies to employ and meld into the framework of what they're trying to get students to learn.

After reading and discussing assessments, I believe that both formative and summative assessments are imperative to a successful classroom.  Formative assessments play a valuable role helping teachers determine where students are in their individual learning.  These types of assessments also provide avenues for differentiation.  It is critical to know where students are day-to-day in meeting targeted standards.  A good teacher will use formative assessments in order to ensure a student’s success on larger summative assessments.  Still, the assessment debate is tricky.  Our country has placed significant value in high-stakes, summative testing.  I am not entirely opposed to some summative assessments.  Our students need to meet benchmarks.  There needs to be some commonality in our curriculum.  However, I do not support the fear we place in our students (or teachers) about these types of tests.  I do not believe that grades or final results are the most significant reinforcement to children.  I believe in the journey.  I believe that students who are engaged daily will meet curriculum standards.  I believe that good teachers will gain a greater understanding of their students by using formative assessment methods.  I believe that students will then retain information long term, remain active in their journeys, and succeed as high stakes testing.  The best thing we can do as teachers is to provide accurate, authentic assessments that challenge students within their “Vygotskian” Zone of Proximal Development.   Learning how to do that is the hard part…
By the way,…pardon the tangent.  The first article was a good, educational, straightforward read.  The second article was more interesting because of its personal nature, practical information, and style of assessments mentioned.  I truly believe in the ways the author approaches her classroom.  I have now read numerous articles stating the importance of assessments, regardless of the type.  (Also noting the significance of effective feedback.)  I am more interested now in learning specific techniques to create these assessments.  I also enjoy articles that provide research on effective feedback techniques as well.  Both of these topics are crucial to successfully managing a positive, growth environment. [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 03:17, 13 June 2009 (UTC) 

This was a very honest glimpse into teaching.  I enjoyed her perspective very much especially the point she made about timeliness.  I have often thought that the problem with assessment is there is not option to gain knowledge from them after they are done.  In English I find it very helpful to continue to go through revisions and gaining feedback to improve the piece.  That is something that is not necessarily done in other classes along the way.  I find it important to make sure that there is continuous re-checks to ensure that the students is retaining the learning targets and not just give a big test that would encompass the entire semester.  I often wondered how some professors got away with only assigning two grades for the semester, the mid term and the final which does nothing but cause undue stress and cramming![[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 02:55, 13

I found this article to be very interesting and eye opening. It was great to hear from a young teacher and her first experiences in the classroom and with teaching since most of us in this class are in the same predicament! I really enjoyed her view on teaching and teaching practices, especially considering she openly acknowledged her mistakes and how far she has come from beginning teaching to three decades later. I do believe that the points she listed for understanding assessment are critical for other teachers and future teachers to look at. Most of the points she mentioned, I was not aware of either until I started taking some education courses at school. I feel that some of the points she made are the most important when considering assessment: assessment is not just about mistakes, not just for the teacher, and assessment is not just about 'after'. I believe these are important because assessment can not just be about these things, otherwise it will not be an effective assessment for the student or the teacher. I feel that the article was very insightful, and I enjoyed reading it and learning from it as well! [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 17:04, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


This article certainly answered many questions or misconceptions that I had about assessment. Just like many other previous, current and pre-service teachers, I think assessment as grading assignments, projects and tests. However, just as Tomlinson addressed, assessment is greater than that; it is a learning process for both teachers and students. One of the understandings that I really related to was that “informative assessment isn’t about after”; it is a process that happens during and even before a unit. Many teachers do not have time to reteach objectives students have not gained an understanding of, because they have already moved on to a different topic. Time will always be an aspect teacher have to fight against, however, formative assessment can actually save time through preassessment and diagnostic assessment. By discovering what a student knows or does not know can save time and interest since the teacher is not moving ahead of their class, or boring them with what they already know. 

Another understanding that I liked was the most important one, that “informative assessment isn’t just for the teacher”. In my opinion, high-stakes testing has taken assessment to a level where we try to improve students’ grades, but not improve their learning. We are so focused on trying to make academic yearly progress or receive funding, that we are almost missing the main reason for teaching: students. Students can be learning objectives, the answers to them and take a high-stakes test, possibly even passing it. However, it does not tell us that the student is a learner; it only tells us that the student is able to regurgitate all the facts we have given them. It also makes the experience of learning nonexistent, because they are just repeating facts. I do believe that teachers have to take accountability for their students learning, and the same basis applies to students. In fact, I even think students want to be responsible for their own learning, because they can say “I did this, not anyone else.” In order for this to happen though, teachers have to share the responsibility and power of assessment with their students, to have an evolving classroom environment.

This article was interesting because it explained the different ways one can use informative assessment. I thought informative assessment was taking a test, however it can be just about anything that assesses the students progress. The author explained that some students are just not good test takers, therefore they can be assessed with different methods to see if they are really learning. Drawing diagrams, answering questions in class, and having a one-on-one discussion with the student helps a teacher find out if the student is retaining the information taught in class. This is a great idea, and helpful for me as well, because as an art teacher (especially in elementary school) students do not usually take tests. Therefore, I will have to assess their knowledge of the lesson based on hands on activities and through discussions. Even though these ways are different from a written test, it is still using informative assessment. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 20:12, 13 June 2009 (UTC)


Oh my gosh, what I have to look forward to in my teaching career.  This article reminded me of something I heard at the training I received while signing up to be a substitute teacher for the Virginia Beach public school district. The lady that gave us our training; who had been a teacher for 28 years told us that there were 3 important stages that teachers go through in their career. Within all these stages Informative assesments are very important for a teacher to develop. First, we are in survival mode, you are able to manage the class room, get pass the initial judgmental thoughts of what do the students think of you, how are they going to perceive you and are they going to like or make your life miserable .The author survived this step being able to get passed the classroom management section and allowing herself to move forward.  The second mode would be actually teaching the lesson plans as made and follow the curriculum hoping that the students would respond positively to the information given. Understandings 1 , 2, 3 and 4 would fit under this mode. As she got passed the fact that assessment was not only about test, grades, following lesson plans and assessments that only fit formally with the curriculum she allowed herself to modify her way of teaching and looking at the assessments towards students to get to the next step.  Mode #3, become a good and respected educator. At this point you realize that students all have different means of learning and that in order for us as educators to get students to succeed in a subject and actually internalize the material you really have to break down the class in individual students and small groups. Understandings 5 and so on describe all the characteristics that every good educator should asses while in a teaching career. Students all have different strengths and weaknesses, they should all be asses formatively to make sure that they understand the material as well as given feedback to let them know where they stand as far as what they are required to know to continue forward in their education. When both students and teachers get to this point the student-teacher relationship becomes more fluent in a way that the students trust the teacher and asks for feedback to be able to improve in those areas to  take responsibility for their education.

Wow, what a great article. This was the most interesting article I have read in a while. Ms. Tomlinson really lays everything out in the open in a step-by-step format that really examines the assessment process that she took. I especially liked the statement she makes, &quot;I am not finished with the insights yet because I am not finished with my work as a teacher or learner&quot; (Tomlinson, C. 2007). We definitely need more teachers like her! After observing in classrooms and working in education previously, it is relate to her way of thought in the beginning...classroom management overtaking classroom assessment and learning for that matter. Understanding your students individually, as well as a whole, is the way to help those who are struggling find their place and even those who have surpassed, find their place as well. Definitely an article worth keeping in my files![[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 04:05, 14 June 2009 (UTC)


How fortunate we are to learn from someone who has experienced first hand the positive and negative effects of assessment. Ms. Tomlinson portrayed her discoveries on the most effective ways to assess a class, she couldn't have been more accurate.  As though it were common sense, I found myself nodding at her every revelation.  It just makes sense, how could it have possibly been any other way?  How could we at one point administered a blanket test and believed it to assess everyone equally?  This article is definitely one that I will refer back to. It will be an excellent resource as to how and when to assess my students. I was able to draw positive correlations between her ideas and those of my past experiences with teachers I've loved.  Mrs. Lena Williams, my eighth grade teacher would emphasize my strengths which gave me a tremendous drive.  I remember wanting to make her proud, she set the bar high and told me constantly that I was capable of achieving it. She gave me the option of a written quiz as oppose to oral since she knew it was a weakness of mine.  I excelled in her class, because she payed attention.  I've found since then that I perform in classes where feedback is offered, not just constructive but praise as well. Typically, when you give the student your attention, they'll return the favor. I found my place and was able to understand my learning style because of teachers like Mrs. Williams and Ms. Tomlinson.  I can only hope that I'll be just as effective.

== Reader Responses ==

Oddly enough this article makes sense. I don't think there was a solution to the zero offered but it was confusing at times. The article did do what it stated in the beginning, it made me rethink giving zeros for missing work. But giving a zero is basically the same as leaving the grade blank even if it isn't mathematically wrong.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 03:06, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I definitely see where the author makes a point about the grading scale.  But I think if a student fails to hand in an assignment, then they are deserving of a 0.  0 grade for 0 work.  I think it's a good argument, but if a student simply fails to turn something in a zero is fair.  Of course, there are plenty of reason why a student wouldn't turn something in so they should be given a chance to make up the work, but why give a grade above a 0 for work that doesn't exist?
[[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 01:28, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

It is funny that this just popped up. When I was doing my student observation this summer, the teacher I was assigned to had an interesting system that surrogates the infamous zero. Whenever a student fails to complete an assignment they sign for it. That is, they literally walk across the room to a clip board and sign their name, the date, the assignment they did not turn in, and the reason why. They then get two more class periods and if it is still not complete they go to ISS. Everything that is late receives and automatic 50, but the work is done. I had the luxury of filing some of her graded papers for her at the end of the year, and notated that the system seemed to be semi-effective. There were quite a few students who just never cared, they got the work done eventually to escape ISS but their folders were full of 50's. However, I noticed there were very few, that were not in the previous category, that had more than two or three late assignments for the whole year. Her opinion was that: &quot;If you give a child a zero, what has he learned? Make them do the work, even if you have to force them to. It is your job to educate them.&quot; She was a bit strict about it, but the vast majority of the class seemed to enjoy her as a teacher.

Reading this article was both enjoyable and informative.  I never really thought of the grading system as he was defining it.  I really thought his idea of making the students who do not complete his assignments lose free time to complete the required work a great idea.  It do not make much sense when a D is a 60 and anything below that is a F.  If the grading scale is set on ten points betweeen each grade it should be that way for every grade.  I do think if a student does not turn in an assignment that the threat of a zero could be used, however, if the students makes up the work partial credit can be given varying with how many days late the assignment is turned in.  I truly think when students who are not completing their assignments are just given Fs, they are not learning much from this except they failed.  I think taking away something the students love like recess or free time will help them staty motivated to complete their required work.  Overall I thought this article was very good and will take this information with me when I begin to teach. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 20:24, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

Reading this article really makes one think about the grading system.  I, myself, never gave it much thought, but I have always been graded on the 10 point grading scale, where anything below a 75 was a &quot;F&quot;.  I think giving students that do not complete an assignment deserves to have a chance to complete it and receive a decent grade, but if they do not do it then they deserve the grade they do get. I will be keeping this article around to remind me how the grading system can get so complicated.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 12:25, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

Wow! I really enjoyed reading this article. The author made so many important points. All of his examples and reasoning behind his argument made perfect sense. I never thought about simple grading as being such an emotional task. I laughed when he stated that teachers just want to get back at those kids who failed to turn in assignments. I think that's really true. Are those kids really much worse than other students who hardly tried at all and turned it in? Probably not! Each article we have read thus far has really brought up great points, this article included! After reading each one, I find that I have a new outlook on teaching. There are so many practices that continue simply because 'that's they way its always been'. I think that the idea of giving a zero to those who don't complete work is just another example of this. I think these outdated (and poorly thought out) teaching practices will continue until people bring up good reasoning to make things change. This article definitely gave me insight into grading and I plan to carry this information with me when I begin teaching!

This article was definitely my favorite to read of all the articles so far. It was extremely fascinating and captured my attention from beginning to end. It really opened my eyes to the fact that students who receive a &quot;0&quot; should really be receiving a -6 on a 100 point scale! I do agree with Reeves that should be forced to complete an assignment, and if they do not, they should lose privileges (free time, study hall) until the assignment is complete. Students are motivated by the opportunity to earn greater freedom, and this will help them to complete their work accurately and on time. If you had asked me prior to reading this article, I probably would have said that if a student fails to turn in an assignment, I would give them a &quot;0&quot; initially and half credit if it was turned in two-three days after the due date. However, I think it is best to have the student complete the assignment no matter what,(during recess or free time) but still be somewhat penalized for not having it completed on time. This way it is still fair for the other students who did complete the assignment on time. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 18:07, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

Both articles were informative, and had good clear arguments for their grading methods.  I like the idea of four point grading system. I will be considering both methods when it is time for me to start grading my own class. [[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 16:51, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

This article is very fascinating.  Reeves is an advoacate of using the 0-4 scale for grading where &quot;0&quot; represents the lowest grade or as we commonly label it, an &quot;F&quot;.  I agree with his argument that a zero on a 100 pt. scale is not fair to a student because there is a 60 pt. spread between the lowest grade and lowest &quot;F&quot; value.  At my school, our grading practices include using 50 as the lowest possible grade a student can receive.  If a child receives a grade less than or equal to 50, it is recorded as a 50.  Our principal chose those scale for two reasons: a zero can destroy a student's academic average and self confidence quicker than a 50 and assigning a &quot;0&quot; on a 100 pt. scale is unfair to the student.  If a student does not complete as assignment, they are given other punishment such as silent lunch or detention.  However, it is their responsibility to complete the assignment.  I rarely gave a 50 because someone didn't do an assignment.  If students think they can get away with not doing the work without a penalty then some will never make an effort. [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 13:47, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

I absolutely agree with this article.  I have always thought the grading system needed a face lift.  I also do believe that we should not punish students with a zero for possibly missing a due date.  Everyone works at their own pace and needs more time then others or whatever the reason may be.  I feel as long as work is turned in at some point in the year it should be acceptable.  I also feel that if a student has not done well on an assignment then they should be able to take it home fix all of the problems and turn it in for regrading.  This is a continuing learning process for the students and probably some of the best lessons they will learn.  Even test and squizzes.  I at times fell that they should be able to retake tests an dquizzes.  Yes, they will be different but they would have studies and worked harder for that grade rather than giving the student a brick wall and there is no hope to change that grade.   They will earn the grades that are given.  I truly feel that the teacher should all that is in his/her power to make it difficult for a student to fail.  There should never be an F.  It was always tough in school that a 100 would weight less on a final grade then a zero would.  It is interesting how there is such an imbalance.

This was a great article.  I enjoyed the author's tone and his tactics in writing.  I must admit that I have been a teacher that at one time or another has wanted to punish a student for failing to turn in an assignment.  At the time I thought that a &quot;0&quot; was an appropriate grade.  The zero signified exactly how much work this student put into the assignment.  While the zero might be harsh, I believe the author's comments about proper ratios would be to give the student a 50 are off base.  I believe that would enable too many students to skate by with C's and D's by doing to bare minimum.  The best scenario that I see, but also believe it has to the most public perception issues to overcome is the 4 point scale.  The author made some very valid points that I agree with when it comes to using the 4 point scale.   We can take the specificity of the points as many decimal points to the right as needed for those that need to know exactly where they stand.  I am going to share this article with my colleagues.

This article was very interesting and I can see how it would be helpful for teachers. I thought the article was written very well and was enjoyable and easy to read. The best point that the author brought up was the difference between a &quot;four point&quot; grading scale and the normal hundred point grading scale. I do believe, however, that some students deserve zeros. When a student blatantly ignores and assignment and does not turn it in, they deserve the grade that matches the amount of work they put in.

It's just amazing what a zero can do huh? I honestly never knew that 2 or 3 zeros could cause failure of an entire course. The author has a very good debate going. I don't like the idea of a 4 point grading system though. I would much rather keep the 100 point system and just let a 50 be the worse grade you could get. I agree that there are other ways of punishing a student and that a zero is not one of them. I do not know how it feels (emotionally) to receive a zero, but I can say that my friend was a zeroholic. She didn't care one bit about doing well in school, so she set out to zeroville. I believe this attitude came from homelife. She didn't want to please anybody. Today she is a nurse. Go figure. I just found this article ironic; especially when it talked about how a zero had such a negative impact that it made kids start to fail and drop out of school. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 01:58, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

I thought this article was excellent.  The author, Mr. Reeves, makes a compelling case as to why students who don't turn in homework or projects should not be given a &quot;0&quot;.  There will always be some assignment that a student would be willing to accept a &quot;0&quot; for just so they don't have to do it.  It makes much more sense to require the assignment be done, even if late, and utilize some other form of punitive response to modify the student's behavior such as not allowing them to do something fun in the classroom.  Failing to turn in an assignment might be an indication that the student was unable to complete it for some reason (too hard, didn't understand what to do, etc.) and it would be sensible to talk to the student to find out their real reason for not completing it.

I found this article to be very beneficial as a future teacher. I never knew that zeros could cause a student to fail a course so quickly, I figured that they were not weighted as much as other grades were! It's amazing that two or three zeros can cause a student to fail a course. I do believe that some students need a lower grade if they consistently turn in assignments late, but I believe if teachers continue to give students zeros for assignments then the student will persist in not turning in the assignment because the only consequence they see is the zero. I do believe that students should be graded on the normal hundred point scale, that way then can be graded in a way so that two or three bad grades do not cause them to fail a course completely. I also agree that the four point scale for the zero is better than the hundred point scale with a zero because there is a greater difference on that scale than the four point scale. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 23:00, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

I had never thought about grades in this way. After having it broken down, though, it makes complete sense that a 100 point grading scale is not accurate. If it were to be accurate it would need to be a 50 point grading scale, or each letter grade needs to be worth more than 10 points. Students that do not turn in homework assignments should not be able to fail a class after a few assignments. There should be a different criteria to go by for what their punishment will be. If a student does not turn in an assignment it does not always mean they are being defiant. Maybe they could not read the assignment, or maybe it was too hard and they just gave up. Sometimes students just need extra help they do not always receive at home, and giving a zero for that reason does not seem very fair.

I really enjoyed reading this article. Reeves makes many good points. I agree with the statement about assigning a zero when using a 100 point scale, can sometimes be a little harsh. at the same time i can also see the other side of that argument. If a teacher tells their class at the beginning of the semester that you have a paper due on this day, this day and this day, and the student doesn't do it, then that is kind of on them. If they come to you and ask about an extension or have some kind of extenuating circumstances then an automatic zero is a little harsh. I think that it all depends on what grading scale you apply to an assignment. If you are using the four point scale then a zero is acceptable because that assignment can be weighted differently in the grade book. This article opened up a different perspective that i hadn't really thought about before. [[User:Rcoll029|Rcoll029]] ([[User talk:Rcoll029|talk]]) 16:41, 18 June 2009 (UTC)


This was a very thought-provoking article. I had never really thought about our grading scale in such a way. Reeves' points are very valid. It does not mathematically make sense to assign a zero for not completing work on a 100 point scale. It seems that he is not saying that the student should be &quot;given&quot; those 50 points, but that it really does not make sense for no work to equate to a zero when every other grade is on a 10 point scale. He is advocating for a 4 point scale, which would make more sense mathematically. I really agreed with his &quot;punishment&quot; for not turning in work. Instead of punishing with grades, you can take away privileges, etc. Students may be even more likely to work hard and get the work done on time because they don't want to lose their activity hour, etc. This article really made me think about our current grading scale and how it may need a reform.  It should be mathematically sound and fair. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 01:31, 19 June 2009 (UTC)


This was an informative article which bring fourth many important points. I agree that it is unfair to give a 0 on a 100 pint scale. As a math teacher, I fully understand the negative effects a zero can play on a students overall grade, however it is beyond me the lack of effort some students put fourth. How hard is it to put your name, and maybe write down one problem on a sheet of paper? They do not even have to work it out, but simply put something down on a sheet of paper. I can not justify giving a 50 out of a 100 when I personally grade classwork and homework for completeness, not correctness. Where I teach the grade percentages are not the teacher's choice. Homework is 10%, classwork is 20%, quizzes are 30% and tests are 40%. That means that any student who at least turns in something for their homework and classwork, gets 30% of their grade just for putting fourth some kind of effort. Mathematically, only 40 % remaining 70% for quizzes and tests is necessary for the student to pass. That works out to maybe a 60 average on quizzes and tests. With all this in mind, giving a 50 out a 100 for an assignment that was not done is unthinkable. In that case, a student could pass a class with a D average on quizzes and tests and never have done their homework or classwork. Maybe it is because of my math background, but this is absurd. The idea of the article is fine, make the student do the work late facing punitive measures and get a 50, but the reality is that some students will not ever do the work. No matter how many times they sit in ISS, some students just don't care, and nothing will get them to do the work. And passing a student who never completed homework, or classwork and only barely passed quizzes and tests is unthinkable, and unethical.

Interesting article to say the least.  Being a parent of a twelve year old soon to be 7th grader, we have found that she is not motivated in regards to some of her homework and thanks to the addition of Edline, the ability to check her grades on the internet, we have caught some of those 0s showing up in homework.  This is the first year that we have required her to have an agenda and do her homework but we were not checking it as we have done in the past.  There were so many reasons for this but mainly I felt that she needed to know that she was no the responsible party for her grades and 0s to count as far as grades go.  In the article is talked about making sure that the student was not just handed a grade when they did no work to deserve it.  I agree wholeheartedly.  When a  good student makes a zero it carries a heavy load to their average and if they chose not to do the work, even if it was wrong, their average would not be affected nearly as much!  Hard lesson for my twelve year old to learn, aside from having to give up her cell phone and ipod if she brings home anything under a C, but if she had a 0 on her grades she gave them up for the rest of the nine weeks and had to turn the work in.  I know mean Mom, but the end result was no 0s by the end of the school year and grades need to be earned not just given!

I find absolutely amazing how a number that has seem logically fair for decades suddenly appears to be the most illogical thing you can do when grading. The grading system, at least in America, is typically based on 100 points, with 10 points aligned with each letter up to D (A = 100-90, B = 89-80, C = 79-70, D = 69-60). Once the grade goes below 60, it is automatically an F which does not make sense, because by that reasoning we are telling students that because you performed less than 60%, you have earned an F. Honestly, after reading the article (and doing some simple math), I discovered that the reasonably fair way to associate letters with a 100 point grading scale is to divide the 100 points into 20 per letter. In other words, A = 100-80, B = 79- 59, C = 58-39, D = 38-19, and F = 18-0 (I think, math was never my strongest suit). Yet, we most live with the flawed grading system where more than half of it guarantees an F.  Perhaps it is because we have lived with it so long, that we have just accepted it as a “fact” that cannot be changed. But I do like how Reeves gave advice to attack this problem by taking away privileges to have students do their work on time. Most current and new teachers would not know any other way to combat late work because they were brought up on a flawed system. If they did not turn in an assignment or turned it in late, a zero was expected. It was only until you got old enough to realize how damaging a zero was, but only a few young students realize this and most of them realize it too late. Personally, it may take time for me to use a 4-point grading system when I become a teacher because it would mean erasing 13 years of being on the system, not including my years in college. Nevertheless, it will be more beneficial for my students and teaching experience. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 01:05, 21 June 2009 (UTC)


I don’t think that zeroes add anything to the learning experience of students. It can be said, however, that they reinforce concepts of repercussion for one’s actions. This is sadly different from actually motivating one to learn. I think, as the article demonstrates, that zeroes are more a byproduct of teacher mentality than a result historically being effective.  A zero merely teaches a student the price of failure, it does not motivate them to rise above or avoid this consequence. There is no improvement because a zero offers no critique of a student’s progress other than its numerical value. There is no communication with zeroes. They are the grading equivalent of summary execution and as such, offer no real motivation for reform other than the fear they inspire.  However, in teaching the goal is purely to reform, not to punish and it is here that zeros fail most egregiously to me.  Unlike criminals, students are in school to grow and more importantly, learn from mistakes.  There should be no “crime” that they are capable of that obscures this goal.[[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 01:48, 21 June 2009 (UTC)


As I stated on the soapbox, I believe in the &quot;zero&quot; when the student is offered various chances to complete and assignment, yet, fail to do so. Zeros should not be a form of settling for students; however, I strongly agree with the author when he states that students should give up free time to do the work missing. It's a great strategy not only to complete the assignment but let's face it, no student wants to be doing work when they can be playing. It's a great form of under-the-radar motivation in order to push students to complete their assignments in a timely manner.

I would like to first comment that Mr. Reeves makes some great points regarding most grading systems. However, unlike the comments above, I had a hard time staying focused on this article (and I read it twice). The reason I think is because Mr. Reeves seems to make his point over and over again until it became redundant. I agree that students who do not turn in their work should be held accountable for it. Giving a &quot;zero&quot; is not a very good choice, as Mr. Reeves states. I liked the fact that Mr. Reeves gave other options to giving a zero. With this being said, I think the article could have been more condensed so as not to be redundant and offer more examples of what to do instead of giving a zero.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 23:23, 21 June 2009 (UTC)


I can speak from personal experience when I say I don't agree with the &quot;0&quot; grading system.  I slipped once and my grade fell by two letters.  I think one should receive a harsher punishment if and only if they've continued to be irresponsible.  I agree that the more effective approach is to make the student complete their work, letting them feel the weight of being behind and missing out.  That is more of a motivator than being knocked in a hole that you have to crawl out of.  It's just to overwhelming and not a fair equivalent to a missed assignment.  [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 02:54, 22 June 2009 (UTC)


Whether or not to use a 0 depends once again on the circumstance.  If a teacher is dealing with a class of highly self-motivated students, in a class where there are very high standards, I thinking giving a 0 for work that is not turned in on time is feasibe and appropriate.  However, if you are dealing with a class of mostly students who are very unmotivated, then giving a 0 for assignments not turned in on time is not helpful for anyone.  In the latter scenario, a 0 may discourage the student and keep him or her from doing less work in the long run rather than more.  Plus, as the article suggests, the big jump between a high F and a 0 is relatively big compared to the score levels of each letter grade.  Such an imbalance scale may be an appropriate challenge for competitive motivated students, but not for classes of unmotivated students who have a track record of doing little in school.

I can see now after reading this article that rubrics are useful in assignments. Even if they are the latest trend they could be a stepping stone to the next best thing so we should embrace any tool that can show its usefulness. I did not think elementary students would be capable of using rubrics but obviously they can.  This is also useful for parents when they are checking their children's work.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 03:13, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I have not had much interaction with rubrics, but I can see how they can be beneficial to a student's assessment.  I agree that a rubric can show a student where their weaknesses and strengths are and help them to improve in that area.  Rubrics give the student a clear understanding of what is expected of them. I think using rubrics are a very good way to assess students and students to assess themselves. Rubrics will be one assessment that I will be using as  a future teacher.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 14:01, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

This article was very informative and beneficial for me as a future teacher.  When I was in school I was never given a rubric with an assignment.  I did not even know what a rubric was until recently.  This article really explain the importance of using one.  It helps teachers teach and helps them to evaluate students work.  After reading this article, I believe it is a great idea to use them.  It absolutely shows the student what is expected of them on an assignment and the rubric makes it easy for teacher to explain the assignment.  I definitely agree that if you can master writing rubrics they would benefit the student.  Grading is an important aspect of feedback and if you can make it easier on the student to know why they will receive a certain grade it can really motivate them to do better.
[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 02:05, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

Rubrics and grading…something teachers need to evaluate thoroughly to ensure students are meeting standards for assignments and for the state.  I really enjoyed both of these articles.  Although, I do not see grades returning to a 4-point scale as mentioned in the first article, the argument itself was persuasive and engaging.  There is definitely something to be said about simply giving students zeros and then brushing their incompletes under the rug.  It seems a failure to students to just accept when they haven’t attempted to do their work.  They are not learning anything from receiving those zeros, except for potentially failing the subject or even the school year.  Without having any work to evaluate, teachers are unable to determine where students are in their learning journeys.  Maybe a particular student needed a little extra help.  Maybe they had something stressful happen at home.  Students should be given a chance to finish their assignments, even if they have missed the deadline.  I understand that life has deadlines, but in this case, it is more important to leave students with content comprehension than life’s lessons.  They should be allowed a grade reduction up to a certain allotted time.   
The second article about creating instructional rubrics provided a more elaborate, more precise way of assessing students.  Although rubrics may just be the current trend in grading, they do provide informative feedback to students.  As I have learned, feedback is critical to a successful education and makes for better adjusted students.   When given with assignments, rubrics provide students with detailed descriptions of teacher expectations.  Students are more capable and more in control of their final grades.  They know what the teacher is looking for and do not have to guess; which is an earlier, backwards model of instruction.  Now…I would like to practice creating these rubrics.  I think there should be classes and workshops (which I’m sure there are and I’m not there yet) specifically dealing with ways to create accurate assessments.


Rubrics are very beneficial to both students and teachers.  They offer clear expectations about the assignment and how the work will be graded when turned in.  I also think this is great for cooperative earning based classrooms that are doing group projects and assessing other students, like our class.  If there are clear distinctive expectations for the work there are no excuses in not having the required criteria.  I did get the feeling in the article that there was a movement to rubrics and that may cause traditional teachers to have a hard time incorporating this in their teaching habits but I again think that they will find the students to better have a grasp on what they are required to do.  I understood that girl in the article that cried about her grade, I felt terrible for her and sometimes in college that is how I have felt when I have received grades on assignments.  If both sides know clearly what the rubric is like, I think that there would be less frustrated students and better grades!!!!

I enjoyed reading this article about rubrics. I especially liked the diagram of the instructional rubric Ms. Andrade offered. It was very easy to read and was more specific than general in criteria. This is definitely the type of rubric I would like to use as a teacher. Rubrics are about scoring and giving feedback, which are very important to students and teachers alike. The more specific feedback one can give, the better understanding it will have for the writer.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 23:30, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

Ruby on Rails, or often seen as RoR or just Rails, is an web application framework written in the programming language Ruby. Rails was created to be a project management tool for &quot;[http://www.37signals.com 37signals]&quot;. Quickly, it became one of the most popular frameworks on the web and its ideas and philosophies has inspired many frameworks in different languages.

__TOC__

'''Gradm''', the administration utility for the role-based access control system, is a powerful tool that parses your [[w:Access_control_list|ACL]]s (Access Control Lists), performs the enforcement of a secure base policy, optimizes the ACLs, as well as handles parsing of the learning logs, merges them with your ACL set and outputs the final ACLs.

Before you install &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt;, boot into your patched grsecurity kernel. You can compile &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; in any kernel you wish, but the installation will fail if the kernel does not support grsecurity.

== Installation ==

If your Linux distribution provides ready-made grsecurity kernel packages, they will very likely provide a package for &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; too. If that is the case you should consider using it before compiling &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; yourself.

Before compiling and installing &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt;, make sure you have the following applications installed in your system: [[w:Lex_programming_tool|lex]] or [[w:Flex_lexical_analyser|flex]] and [[w:Byacc|byacc]] or [[w:GNU_bison|bison]]. If you need [[w:Pluggable_Authentication_Modules|Pluggable Authentication Modules]] (PAM) support, install the header files for your system; The package containing them will very likely be called libpam-dev or similar.

A note should be added to say that if you are compiling gradm on your default linux kernel without grsecurity support the compile will fail and that you will only be able to compile after you reboot into your new grsecurity enabled kernel.

Change to the directory you downloaded &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; and grsecurity to earlier. In this document the name of the compressed package is ''gradm-gradm-2.9.1-201307031629.tar.gz''. Decompress the package and change to the ''gradm2'' directory by executing the following commands:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar xzf gradm-2.9.1-201307031629.tar.gz
$ cd gradm2
&lt;/pre&gt;

To install &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; with PAM support, as a non-root user run:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ make
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''NOTE:''' Look at the output from &lt;tt&gt;make&lt;/tt&gt;. Make sure you do not see a line near the end that says &quot;Unable to detect PAM headers, disabling PAM support.&quot; If you do, install the PAM header files and run the &lt;tt&gt;make&lt;/tt&gt; command again.

To install &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; without PAM support, run:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ make nopam
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, as root, run:
&lt;pre&gt;
# make install
&lt;/pre&gt;

The installation process does the following:
* Installs the &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;grlearn&lt;/tt&gt; programs to ''/sbin''.
* Creates a directory ''/etc/grsec'' and two files in it (if they are not already present): ''learn_config'' and ''policy''.
* Installs &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt;'s [[w:Man_page|man pages]] to ''/usr/share/man/man8''.
* (&lt;tt&gt;grlearn&lt;/tt&gt; does not come with a man page. It is used internally by &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt;.)
* Finally, and most importantly, if this is the first time you are installing &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; on your system you will be asked to provide the administrative password for the RBAC system. Choose a long password, but one that you will remember (especially if you start &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; from an initscript). '''Do not use''' the same password as your root password.

If you need to change any of the binary or man page locations, modify the ''Makefile''.

== Usage ==

        -v, --version   Display version information
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Learning Mode ==

The '''learning mode''' is different than anything found in other security systems. Grsecurity's learning mode can be used on a per-subject or per-role basis, as well as system-wide. When using the learning mode on a single process or role, the rest of the system remains protected as defined by the policy. The learning mode can learn all things that the RBAC system supports: files, capabilities, resources, what IP addresses make use of each role, and socket usage.  The learning system performs intelligent reduction of filesystem and network access to reduce policy size, increase readability, and reduce the amount of manual tweaking needed later.  Furthermore, the learning system enforces a secure base that is configurable.  The ''/etc/grsec/learn_config'' file gives the administrator the ability to specify files/directories that should be considered protected resources by the learning system.  The learning system will ensure that regardless of any rule reduction done, only the processes that access those protected resources through normal usage will be granted access through the generated policy.  Furthermore, it will create new subjects for the processes that access the protected resources, creating privilege boundaries that grant those processes additional protection.

=== Full System Learning ===

To enable full system learning, run &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; as [[w:Superuser|root]] with the following options:

&lt;pre&gt;
# gradm -F -L /etc/grsec/learning.logs
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will enable the [[../The RBAC System|Role-based Access Control]] (RBAC) system and initiate full system learning. That is, &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; will monitor and log what your system does. The log can then be used to build a least privilege policy for your system.

Run and use the application(s) that you normally do, several times. This is important, since the learning mode uses a threshold–based system to determine when access should be given to a file or whether it should be given to a directory. If four or more similar accesses are made in a single directory (such as writing to several files in ''/tmp''), access is granted to that directory instead of the individual files. This reduces the amount of rules you have and ensures that the application will work correctly after the final ACLs are compiled.

{{XWarning|Do not perform any administrative tasks outside of the admin role while full system learning is enabled.}}
To perform administrative tasks while full system learning is enabled, authenticate to the admin role with: 

&lt;pre&gt;
# gradm -a admin
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember to exit your shell or unauthenticate from the admin role with &lt;tt&gt;gradm -u&lt;/tt&gt; when you are done performing administrative tasks.

Once you feel you've given the system the normal usage it would see in real life, disable the RBAC system with &lt;tt&gt;gradm -D&lt;/tt&gt;, and execute:

&lt;pre&gt;
# gradm -F -L /etc/grsec/learning.logs -O /etc/grsec/policy
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will place the new learned ACLs at the end of your ruleset. You can test the policy by enabling grsecurity (run &lt;tt&gt;gradm -E&lt;/tt&gt;), and making sure all applications are functioning the way they're supposed to.

=== Process and Role-Based Learning ===

Using this learning mode is very simple. All you have to do is add &quot;l&quot; (the small letter L, not the number 1) to the subject mode of the process, you want to enable learning for. To learn on a given role, add &quot;l&quot; to the role mode. For both of these, to enable learning, enable the system by executing:

&lt;pre&gt;
# gradm -L /etc/grsec/learning.logs -E
&lt;/pre&gt;

When you are done, disable the ACL system with &lt;tt&gt;gradm -D&lt;/tt&gt; (or alternatively, go into admin mode with &lt;tt&gt;gradm -a&lt;/tt&gt;), and use:

&lt;pre&gt;
# gradm -L /etc/grsec/learning.logs -O /etc/grsec/policy
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will place the new learned ACLs at the end of your ruleset. Simply remove the old ACLs and you are ready to go.

=== /etc/grsec/learn_config ===
This configuration file aids the learning process by tweaking the learning algorithm for specific files and directories.  It accepts lines in the form of:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;command&gt; &lt;pathname&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Where &lt;tt&gt;&lt;command&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; can be ''inherit-learn'', ''no-learn'', ''inherit-no-learn'', ''high-reduce-path'', ''dont-reduce-path'', ''protected-path'', ''high-protected-path'', and ''always-reduce-path''.  ''inherit-learn'', ''no-learn'', and ''inherit-no-learn'' only affect full system learning, while the others work on all modes of learning.

'''inherit-learn''' changes the learning process for the specified path by throwing all learned accesses for every binary executed by the processes contained in the pathname into the subject specified by the pathname.  This is useful for &lt;tt&gt;cron&lt;/tt&gt; in the case of full system learning, so that scripts that eventually end up executing &lt;tt&gt;mv&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; with privilege don't cause the root policy to grant that privilege to &lt;tt&gt;mv&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; in all cases.

'''no-learn''' allows processes within the path to perform any operation that normal system usage would allow without restriction.  If a process is generating a huge number of learning logs, it may be best to use this command on that process and configure its policy manually.

'''inherit-no-learn''' combines the above two cases, such that processes within the specified path will be able to perform any normal system operation without restriction as will any binaries executed by these processes.

'''high-reduce-path''' modifies the heuristics of the learning process to weigh in favor of reducing accesses for this path.

'''dont-reduce-path''' modifies the heuristics of the learning process so that it will never reduce accesses for this path.

'''always-reduce-path''' modifies the heuristics of the learning process so that the path specified will always have all files and directories within it reduced to the path specified.

'''protected-path''' specifies a path on your system that is considered an important resource.  Any process that modifies one of these paths is given its own subject in the learning process, facilitating a secure policy.

'''high-protected-path''' specifies a path that should be hidden from all processes but those that access it directly.  It is recommended to use highly sensitive files for this command.

Note that regular expressions are not supported for pathnames in this configuration file.

==Don´t repeat yourself==
To help to maintain clean code, Rails follows the idea of DRY, an acronym for Don't Repeat Yourself. The idea behind it is simple: whenever possible, re-use as much code as possible rather than duplicating similar code in multiple places. This reduces errors, keeps your code clean and enforces the principle of writing code once and then reusing it. This also helps lead to an API driven structure whereby internal methods are hidden and changes are achieved through passing parameters in an API fashion.
For more information on DRY look at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself Wikipedia article]

==First Application==
=== Create a basic Rails Application ===
Creating your first Rails application is as simple as typing:
&lt;pre&gt;rails firstapplication&lt;/pre&gt;
in the console. This will create the Rails application in the current directory. If you need to use another database than the default (SQLite3) you can specify the database with the &lt;tt&gt;-d&lt;/tt&gt; parameter. If you need e.g MySQL support, create your app with
&lt;pre&gt;rails firstapplication -d mysql&lt;/pre&gt;

This sets up the basic files and folders you need. Let's have a look at the files and folders and what they are good for:

====The Application Structure====

After creating your Rails application, you will be presented with a directory structure. The following table should introduce you to the folders and their purpose:

{|  style=&quot;background:lightyellow;border:1px solid gray;&quot; cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5px width=80%
      |- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background:brown; color:white;&quot;
        ! width=20% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|File/Folder
        ! width=85% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|What is it good for
      |-
        | width=20% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|app/
        | width=80% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|This is the folder where you will work most of the time. It contains your model, view and the controller. 
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|app/[[Ruby_on_Rails/ActiveRecord|model]]
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Contains all your models for your project.
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|app/[[Ruby_on_Rails/ActionView|view]]
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Includes all HTML files inside a folder. These files are named after an corresponding action inside your controller. Aditionally, these files are grouped into folders with the controller name.
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|app/[[Ruby_on_Rails/ActionController|controller]]
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Holds the logic for your Rails application.
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|db/
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|All database related files go into this folder. If you are working with SQLite, then the database is likely to be in this folder as *.sqlite3 file.
      |-  
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|db/[[Ruby_on_Rails/ActiveRecord/Migrations|migrate]]
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Has all the migrations that you created.

==== Basic creation of different files ====
Most of Rails files can be created via the console by entering a simple command that tells Rails what you want. This way you can create database migrations, controllers, views and much more. All commands look like
&lt;pre&gt; rails generate generator generator-options&lt;/pre&gt;

To see what options are available, from your applications directory just enter
&lt;pre&gt;
cd firstapplication
rails generate&lt;/pre&gt;
and Rails will show you all available options and what generators are currently installed. By default, you can choose from the different generators. The most important are:

* controller
* helper
* mailer
* migration
* model
* scaffold

If you want more information on different generators, simply enter the generator command e.g. &lt;tt&gt;script/generate model&lt;/tt&gt; in the console and you will get information for this specific command and examples explaining what the generator does.

When working with generators, Rails will create and name all the necessary files in a proper way according to the conventions. This is especially important when working with Migrations (see later). Rails will never overwrite your files if they already exist (unless you tell Rails explicitly to do so).

A very good way to get you started with everything you need is to &lt;tt&gt;scaffold&lt;/tt&gt; your files. This will create a basic CRUD-structure for your files. (CRUD='''C'''reate '''R'''ead '''U'''pdate and '''D'''elete; this reflects SQL attributes create, insert, update and delete) Scaffolding creates not only your migrations but also a controller with the most basic syntax and a view-folder, that comes with templates for very basic displaying and editing of your data.
To use scaffolding, we will use our generators. The scaffolding generator expects the name of a &lt;tt&gt;MODEL/CONTROLLER&lt;/tt&gt; and the proper fields and types (in the format field:type).

Say, we want to create tags for different products, we can use:
&lt;pre&gt; rails generate scaffold Tag name:string popularity:integer &lt;/pre&gt;

Inside the console, Rails will give us information about the files it created:
&lt;pre&gt;
     exists  app/models/
     exists  app/controllers/
     exists  app/helpers/
     create  app/views/tags
     exists  app/views/layouts/
     exists  test/functional/
     exists  test/unit/
     exists  test/unit/helpers/
     exists  public/stylesheets/
     create  app/views/tags/index.html.erb
     create  app/views/tags/show.html.erb
     create  app/views/tags/new.html.erb
     create  app/views/tags/edit.html.erb
     create  app/views/layouts/tags.html.erb
     identical  public/stylesheets/scaffold.css
     create  app/controllers/tags_controller.rb
     create  test/functional/tags_controller_test.rb
     create  app/helpers/tags_helper.rb
     create  test/unit/helpers/tags_helper_test.rb
     route  map.resources :tags
     dependency  model
     exists    app/models/
     exists    test/unit/
     exists    test/fixtures/
     create    app/models/tag.rb
     create    test/unit/tag_test.rb
     create    test/fixtures/tags.yml
     exists    db/migrate
     create    db/migrate/20090420180053_create_tags.rb
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let's take a quick tour of the files we have now:
First Rails created a separate folder inside the view named &lt;tt&gt;tags&lt;/tt&gt;. Inside this folder we have some different templatefiles. Besides, we have a controller (&lt;tt&gt;tags_controller.rb&lt;/tt&gt;), files for tests (&lt;tt&gt;tags_controller_test.rb, tags_helper_test.rb, tags.yml, tag_test.rb&lt;/tt&gt;), helpers (&lt;tt&gt;tags_helper.rb&lt;/tt&gt;), a migration file (&lt;tt&gt;20090420180053_create_tags.rb&lt;/tt&gt;) and last but not least, a route was also added.
As you can see, scaffold does quite a lot of work for us. But remember, that the generated code is very basic and far from being &quot;good&quot; but it already gives you a good starting point.

__TOC__

This page lists applications that need specific settings to work with grsecurity and PaX. If you wish to add an application to the list, you are most welcome to do so. Please keep the list in alphabetical order and remember to update the table of contents on the [[Grsecurity#Application-specific_Settings|front page]].


== ATI Catalyst (fglrx) graphics driver ==

When using Xorg and the proprietary ATI Catalyst graphics driver, CONFIG_PAX_USERCOPY must not be set as PAX_USERCOPY prevents a real overflow from occurring in the ATI driver that is still unfixed. This is in addition to what's shown in the section on Xorg below.


As of 11.8, CONFIG_PAX_MEMORY_UDEREF must also be disabled.

== Firefox (or Iceweasel in Debian) ==

Mozilla Firefox and possibly all, if not some(?) of, the lib.so files in the folder (/usr/lib/firefox) with the Firefox binary (called /usr/lib/firefox/firefox) need &lt;tt&gt;mprotect&lt;/tt&gt; disabled for [[w:Adobe_Flash_Player|flash]] to function. Without the Firefox binary having disabled &lt;tt&gt;mprotect&lt;/tt&gt; Firefox will enter an infinite loop at startup or take minutes to load. Without the lib.so files having &lt;tt&gt;mprotect&lt;/tt&gt; disabled any page encountered with Flash will surely run an infinite loop and the Firefox process will have to be killed. 

The option must be disabled for just-in-time compilation of certain scripts for both ''xulrunner-stub'' and ''xulrunner-bin''. See Grsecurity forums for more details.
[http://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=2083]
The safest option would of course be denying &lt;tt&gt;mprotect&lt;/tt&gt; and boycot sites that use just-in-time (JIT) flash scripts. You may disable JIT compilation in the browser by initiating the address about:config, search for &quot;jit&quot; in the page's integrated search bar, and double-click the options &quot;javascript.options.methodjit.chrome&quot; and &quot;javascript.options.methodjit.content&quot; to set them to &quot;false&quot;.
&lt;!-- We need to tell every significant detail here, not to tell the user to visit the forum. /Meev0 --&gt;

Firefox &gt;= 3.5 may need &lt;tt&gt;RANDMMAP&lt;/tt&gt; to be disabled (), if not it will enter in an infinite loop during startup. To disable, execute &lt;tt&gt;paxctl -r /firefox_binary&lt;/tt&gt;. Usually the binary is somewhere in ''/usr/lib64/*firefox*''. See http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=278698 for more details. As of at least Firefox 13 on Ubuntu-based distros you can enable &lt;tt&gt;RANDMMAP&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Google Chrome 15.0.874.106 ==
On Google Chrome: 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;
$ paxctl -v /opt/google/chrome/chrome
PaX control v0.5
Copyright 2004,2005,2006,2007 PaX Team &lt;pageexec@freemail.hu&gt;
- PaX flags: P----m-x-eR- [/opt/google/chrome/chrome]
	PAGEEXEC is enabled
	MPROTECT is disabled
	RANDEXEC is disabled
	EMUTRAMP is disabled
	RANDMMAP is enabled

$ paxctl -v /opt/google/chrome/nacl_helper
PaX control v0.5
Copyright 2004,2005,2006,2007 PaX Team &lt;pageexec@freemail.hu&gt;
- PaX flags: -p---m-x-e-- [/opt/google/chrome/nacl_helper]
	PAGEEXEC is disabled
	MPROTECT is disabled
	RANDEXEC is disabled
	EMUTRAMP is disabled

$ paxctl -v /opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox 
PaX control v0.5
Copyright 2004,2005,2006,2007 PaX Team &lt;pageexec@freemail.hu&gt;
- PaX flags: -----m-x-e-- [/opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox]
	MPROTECT is disabled
	RANDEXEC is disabled
	EMUTRAMP is disabled&lt;/nowiki&gt;

These PaX flags work well on my system with flash. Chrome's nacl does throw this however:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[1:1:14105440733:ERROR:nacl_fork_delegate_linux.cc(78)] Bad NaCl helper startup ack (0 bytes)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Grub ==
Grub uses nested functions and thus needs either PAX_EMUTRAMP enabled in the kernel and EMUTRAMP enabled on affected binaries, or if PAX_EMUTRAMP is not enabled in the kernel, needs MPROTECT disabled on affected binaries.  Depending on the version of grub in use, some of the following files may not exist, but you should mark all those that exist.  To add EMUTRAMP, use the '-CE' argument to paxctl.  To remove MPROTECT, use '-Cm'.

 /usr/bin/grub-script-check
 /usr/sbin/grub-probe
 /usr/sbin/grub-mkdevicemap

== GUFW/UFW firewalls or Update Manager ==

GUFW is an optional graphical application interface for the Ubuntu firewall (UFW), both of which use Python. Update Manager is a Gnome application for updating packages that also depends on Python. Really, any application that uses Python try enabling EMUTRAMP for the version of Python that is the dependency of your affected program (GUFW or Update Manager). (Example: # paxctl -E /usr/bin/Python2.7).

== IOQuake3 ==
[[w:Ioquake3|Ioquake3]] requires disabling mprotect restrictions to run correctly.

== ISC DHCP Server ==

On some systems, after upgrading to a grsecurity-enabled kernel with GRKERNSEC_PROC_USERGROUP enabled, the kernel log may
be spammed with:
 init: isc-dhcp-server main process ended, respawning
 init: isc-dhcp-server main process (pid) terminated with status            1

This may be due to unprivileged users not having access to /proc/net/dev as this dhcpd requires.  You can confirm by
running ''dhcpd -f'' from the command-line, which should display the following error:
 Error opening '/proc/net/dev' to list interfaces

To fix this, grep your kernel config for CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PROC_GID, then
add a group for that gid to ''/etc/group'' if it doesn't already exist.  Then add dhcpd to that group.  The added line
will look similar to:
 procview:x:1001:dhcpd

As the DHCP server is continually attempting to respawn, upon making this change you should find it running properly.

== Java ==
With problems with an epoll stack trace lookup [http://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1983&amp;p=8168&amp;hilit=java#p8168e]. Also there is a problem with just-in-time compilation. Disable &lt;tt&gt;mprotect&lt;/tt&gt; for ''/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.10/jre/bin/java'' and ''/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.10/jre/bin/javaws''.
&lt;!-- The epoll situation needs to be explained a bit more. /Meev0 --&gt;

== Openoffice.org ==

[[w:Openoffice|Openoffice.org]] uses two binaries which need custom settings to work. Both ''/usr/lib/openoffice/program/soffice.bin'' and ''/usr/lib/openoffice/program/unopkg.bin'' need to have unrestricted &lt;tt&gt;mprotect&lt;/tt&gt;.
[http://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1817]
&lt;!-- Maybe the link to the forum post should be a reference? See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:References. The situation with OpenOffice is not clear to me (I read the forum post). This section needs further details. /Meev0--&gt;

== PHP and other applications that set their own resource limits ==

While Apache/PHP run very well with a grsec/PaX enabled kernel, you could feel like there are possible memory leaks or strange OOM (out of memory) errors with PHP using a PaX enabled kernel with the SEGMEXEC flag enabled.
There's no memory leak, and the OOM errors are normal, particularly if you didn't set high enough resource limits.

Concerning &quot;abnormal&quot; memory usage with PHP and SEGMEXEC flag enabled, see spender's answers on http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=49501 comments:
 &quot;Due to VMA mirroring, the SEGMEXEC option causes accounted vm usage to double.  So you weren't 
 experiencing a memory leak -- you were just being accounted for twice as much memory as you 
 thought you were using. The solution would be to double the resource limit or, if your system
 is NX-capable and PAE is enabled, use PAGEEXEC.&quot;

== X.org ==
X.org might need some specific kernel settings during configuration (depending on the hardware and the drivers used X won't run with non-executable pages (PAX_NOEXEC)). The problem manifested especially in XFree4. Although, recent versions of X.org are known to work with non-executable pages enabled. If you run into problems with X watch your non-executeble settings.

Some users experience mouse freezes when the system load is high. Typically the mouse pointer is reset, but stays in the upper left corner of the screen. This behaviour was found to occur with certain pre-emption settings [http://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=2114][http://home.coming.dk/index.php/2008/06/24/p815#comments]. It seems to be an interaction between forced-preemption and KERNEXEC. You should be able to re-enable KERNEXEC as long as you disable preemption or use voluntary preemption.

According to the Pax-Team KERNEXEC should work as is, since the changes should be only basic functions like open/close functions. If you should experience problems switch to voluntary or none pre-emption.

|description = Partridge Berry is a vine that does not climb, but rather creeps along the ground.  It is an evergreen, so if you venture into the woods when the snow is melting, you might see some greenery.  Melting snow can form pools of water which cover the Partridge Berries.  The Partridge Berry doesn't seem to mind though.

The leaves grow in pairs on the vine, one on each side.  The leaves are shiny with smooth edges.  Most of the leaf is a very dark green, but it has light green veins that run through it.  

Partridge Berries make flowers in pairs along the length of the vine.  The two flowers in each pair are joined to one another at their base.  Each flower has four petals and is covered with hair.

The berries have two little &quot;eyes&quot; on them, which leads some people to call it &quot;Two-eyed Berry.&quot;  You can eat these berries, but they are very bland, having almost no taste at all.  But that doesn't stop birds and animals from eating them – they seem to love them!
|facts = The two flowers eventually fuse together to form one berry.  The two eyes are from the two flowers.

'''''Epilobium''''' (willow-herbs) are a group of erect herbaceous plants in the evening primrose family. A few species are native wildflowers, and in the garden commonly present as weeds.

The plants pull easily, and can be cold-composted before flowers are produced, or heat composted after flowering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Maria Pia Ceccoli''' ==
(May, 2, 1936-?) MPC, ''Mea Patria Cognoscere'', is the CEO of the '''EUROPA MAGICA / MEDITHEATRE''' private library, with main settlement in Italy (Naxos, Cristoforo Colombo, 20).

'''THE PRIVATE LIBRARY ''' 

The private library has been structured following the several travel Maria Pia Ceccoli has been experienced during her life, especially through Mediterranean world and Europe.  Of course, the main part of this private library is made by Hebraic art scrolls of the Torah, of the Ancient and of the New Testament (in Hebrew, Greek and Latin), and of the Holy Quran (in Arabic).  All the mentioned texts are disposable also in English and in Italian.  A conspicuous number of commentaries (sometimes apocryphal) enlarges the number of the books, with special reference to the Qumran and Nag-Hammadi scrolls, and also to the archaelogical works of the British Museum, both in Egypt (among this the Papyrus of Ani) and in Mesopotamian lands.   

'''THE INDIE LABEL'''

The EUROPA MAGICA / MEDITHEATRE private library in recent times has become also an indie label both in traditional press and electronic book.  According his nature, Europa Magica is an expression of the new current which interprets knowledge as light into the sphere of being.  Open knowledge and give diffusion to light is the movement of freedom.   In our time, this way to interpret life and knowledge is the open source mentality: Enlightenment sharing connective Art.  The internet synchronicity, the anthropological path to theatre, all the forms of sharing values and thoughts and experiences are transforming the way to feel the internal dimension of collective unconscious and its continuity through centuries.  Today we have no more need for secret but we really have more and more need for sacred,  to recover the mystical sense of life and open the spiritual frontiers to each integral person, predisposed to natural enlightenment.

'''THE ETHIC WORK AS SYSTEM FOR CONNECTIVE ENLIGHTENMENT'''

In open source mentality, Enlightenment (Illuminatio, Bodhisattva) is perceived not as special privilege of predestinated, but as goal for each man and for each woman, as something that, in the right condition, each person can join.  The aim of EUROPA MAGICA as free foundation - with its publications (books and reviews) - is to contribute to the creation of the conditions for a new and more large and deep collective awareness which make possible life on earth as occasion for everybody to grow, progress and rise in material, psychological and spiritual path.  This has no difference in comparison to the great ideal inside the name Europa.  The magic is to draw on the way of Humanism and Renaissance – In hoc Signo - setting up the peace symbol, and love, and freedom.  Magic is therefore not yet superstition but positive education of the will.  Technological Enlightenment, Connectivism, Open Source are expressions which give the present time’s character of this thought marking it as responsible freedom, awareness, emancipation.

Won't you know why to publish with us is different?

      <comment>/* RESTful routes */ added missing word</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Because Routing is such an important part of Rails we dedicated a whole chapter to Routing (even though they are part of ActionView).

For example, if you want to display the product with the id 4, you will use a link similar to products/4. So Rails will figure out, that you want to show the information that belongs to the product with the id 4.

Routing also works when you want to link somewhere from one point of your application to another point. If you want to go back from the products view to the index overview that displays all products, you may place something like this in your view:
  &lt;%= link_to 'Back', products_path %&gt;

When writing your own routes inside &lt;tt&gt;routes.rb&lt;/tt&gt;, keep in mind, the lower the route is inside your file, the less priority it has.

==Understanding Routes and Routing==

===RESTful routes===

RESTful routes are the default routes in Rails. To get a more detailed technical view on REST, check out the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer Wikipedia] article.

Basically REST provides a way of communication inside your application and all requests that exist from external sources (just as a browser request). To understand these principles better, take a look the following table:

      {|  style=&quot;background:lightyellow;border:1px solid gray;&quot; cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5px width=70%
      |- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background:brown; color:white;&quot;
        ! width=10% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|HTTP Verb
        ! width=15% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|URL
        ! width=15% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Controller
        ! width=15% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Action
        ! width=45% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|used for
      |-
        | width=10% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|GET
        | width=15% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products 
        | width=15% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Product
        | width=15% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|index
        | width=45% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|display all products in an overview
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|GET
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/new 
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Product
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|new
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|return an HTML form for creating a new product
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|POST
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products 
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Product
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|create
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|create a new product
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|GET
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1 
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Product
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|show
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|display a specific product
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|GET
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1/edit 
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Product
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|edit
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|return an HTML form for editing a product
      |-  
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|PUT
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Product
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|update
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|update a specific product
      |- 
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|DELETE
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1/
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Product
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|destroy
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|delete a specific product
      |}


As you can see, all the actions of REST are already in our scaffolded controller. Keep in mind that RESTful routes reference a single object (products in this case). These 7 actions would result in a single route inside &lt;tt&gt;routes.rb&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
map.resources :products
&lt;/source&gt;

With a RESTful resource, it's easy to link the different views together or link to a specific view. With REST, Rails provides us some helpers to get to our desired location:

* products_url &amp; products_path =&gt; redirects us to the index overview and edit view for our products (note the plural)
* new_product_url &amp; new_product_path =&gt; will lead as to the form that creates a new product
* edit_product_url &amp; edit_photo_path =&gt; provides us with an edit-form for a specific product
* product_url &amp; product_path =&gt; is responsible for showing, deleting and updating a product


While *_path will create a relative path to, *_url provides the whole URL
*_path =&gt; /products
*_url =&gt; http://localhost/products


You will very likely need more than one REST route. You can easily write multiple REST routes into a single:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
map.resources :products, :categories, :customers
&lt;/source&gt;


You will come across many similar constructs like our products-category relation:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
class Category &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products
end

class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :categories
end
&lt;/source&gt;

{|  style=&quot;background:lightyellow;border:1px solid gray;&quot; cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5px width=85%
      |- style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background:brown; color:white;&quot;
        ! width=10% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|HTTP Verb
        ! width=20% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|URL
        ! width=10% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Controller
        ! width=10% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Action
        ! width=50% style=&quot; border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|used for
      |-
        | width=10% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|GET
        | width=20% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1/categories 
        | width=10% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Category
        | width=10% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|index
        | width=50% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|will show you an overview of the categories for product with the id 1
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|GET
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1/categories/new 
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Category
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|new
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|will give you an HTML form to create a new category for product with id 1
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|POST
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1/categories 
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Category
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|create
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|will create a new category for product with id 1
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|GET
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1/categories/1 
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Category
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|show
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|shows you the categories with id 1 that belongs to your product with id 1
      |-
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|GET
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1/categories/1/edit
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Category
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|edit
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|gives you an HTML form to edit your category with id 1 that belongs to product with id 1
      |-  
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|PUT
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1/categories/1
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Category
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|update
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|updates category with id 1 that belongs to product with id 1
      |- 
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|DELETE
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|/products/1/categories/1
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|Category
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|destroy
        | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|deletes category with id 1 that belongs to product with id 1
      |}


As with resources that are not nested, you will be able to access all *_url and *_path helpers e.g. &lt;tt&gt;products_categories_path&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;new_product_category_url&lt;/tt&gt;

These path need to be present in your &lt;tt&gt;routes.rb&lt;/tt&gt; in an similar maner to your model:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
map.resources :products, :has_many =&gt; :categories
&lt;/source&gt;
if you need to add more than one association, put these in []

which is the same as the following route, only shorter

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
map.resources :magazines do |magazine|
  magazine.resources :ads
end
&lt;/source&gt;

With this way, you can nest as many resources as you want, but you should try to keep the level of nesting as low as possible. So one nested resource is ok, but try to avoid 2 or more. To avoid these problems, we can use &quot;shallow nesting&quot;

If we want to add supplier for specific categories, we may end up with something like

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
map.resources :publishers, :shallow =&gt; true do |publisher|
  publisher.resources :magazines do |magazine|
    magazine.resources :photos
  end
end
&lt;/source&gt;

or in short:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
map.resources :products, :has_many =&gt; { :categories=&gt; :suppliers }, :shallow =&gt; true
&lt;/source&gt;

There are many more advanced features for routing. More infos and instructions can be found in the [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#controller-namespaces-and-routing official Rails guides].

===Regular Routes===

Even though RESTful routes are the encouraged way to go, you can also use regular routes inside your application. When working with regular routes, you give Rails some keywords and it will map the proper path for you.
One of these default routes is already inside your &lt;tt&gt;routes.rb&lt;/tt&gt; (this time we don't use &lt;tt&gt;.resources&lt;/tt&gt; but &lt;tt&gt;.connect&lt;/tt&gt;)

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'
&lt;/source&gt;

will for example be a browser request similar to &lt;tt&gt;products/show/2&lt;/tt&gt;

If you are familiar with other languages that focus an the web, you may wonder how query strings inside the URL are handles: Rails automatically provides these parameters inside the params hash

So if you take the example above and add &lt;tt&gt;products/show/2?category=3&lt;/tt&gt;, we would be able to access the category id with &lt;tt&gt;params[:category_id]&lt;/tt&gt;.

The original book was based on the source code of ruby 1.7.3 so there are a few small differences to the current version of ruby. However, these differences may make the source code simpler to understand and the Ruby Hacking Guide is a good starting point before looking into the ruby source code. The version of the source code used can be downloaded here: http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/ar/ruby-rhg.tar.gz.

This project is picking up from where Vincent Isambart and Clifford Escobar have left off [http://rhg.rubyforge.org/], with the aim to translate the outstanding chapters to English to help Ruby hackers understand the internals of the MRI interpreter.

Note also the existence of this translation: http://hawthorne-press.com

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rendering and Redirecting==
===Introduction===
already know how to manage your data with [[Ruby_on_Rails/ActiveRecord |ActiveRecord]]. Now it is time to display your data. All data the view displays comes from the controller. Most of the time, you will work with HTML but you can also use Javascript inside your views (which of course can again be Rails generated) or different CSS.

The &quot;Convention over Configuration&quot; is also an essential part of the view: as mentioned in the beginning of this book, Rails is able to know which file for the view belongs to which action inside in the controller:

&lt;pre&gt;app/controller/products_controller.rb&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;

def show
  @product= Product.find(params[:id])
end
&lt;/source&gt;

This action inside our products controller assumes that there is a view responding to the name:
&lt;pre&gt;app/views/products/show.html.erb&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see the file has 2 extensions: one is for the browser to display (HTML) and the other one tell Rails how to process it (erb= embedded ruby).

===Rendering and Redirecting===
You will come across 2 often used methods to display data &lt;tt&gt;render&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;redirect_to&lt;/tt&gt;.
A good example of how these two methods work can be seen in the example below:

This actions gets called when the user submitted updated data

As you can see both of our methods are used in this simple example. Whenever we successfully updated the name of a product, we get redirected to the index site of the products. If the update fails, we want to return to the edit view.
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;def update
    @product= Product.find(params[:id])

    if @product.update_attributes(params[:name])
      redirect_to :action =&gt; 'index'
    else
      render :edit
    end
end&lt;/source&gt;
There is an important difference between &lt;tt&gt;render&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;redirect_to&lt;/tt&gt;: render will tell Rails what view it should use (with the same parameters you may have already sent) but &lt;tt&gt;redirect_to&lt;/tt&gt; sends a new request to the browser.

====Render====
Remember the &quot;update&quot; action above? When the update fails, we want to render the edit view with the exact same parameters as we did before, in this case we look for the &quot;id&quot; inside the database and populate the page accordingly.
If you want to render another view use
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;render 'categories/show'&lt;/source&gt;


You can also display a file that is somewhere completely different on your web server
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;render :file =&gt; &quot;/u/apps/some_folder/app/views/offers/index&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

And of course, you can render simple text
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;render :text =&gt; &quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
You may have already noticed that there is a &quot;layout&quot; folder inside your view. Whenever you use scaffolding to create parts of your application a file inside layout gets created. If you scaffold &quot;Products&quot; the file inside [[Ruby_on_Rails/ActionView/Layout_Files|layout]] will be called &lt;tt&gt;products.html.erb&lt;/tt&gt;. This file is responsible for the basic display of your sites matching the common name (in this example, it's products). Whenever you want to redirect your user to another layout you can use
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;render :layout =&gt; 'another_layout'&lt;/source&gt;

Whenever there is no proper layout file, Rails will display the page only with the styling provided inside the requested view.
To use a specific layout inside your whole controller you can define the layout inside your Controller
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;class ProductsController &lt; ApplicationController
  layout &quot;my_layout&quot;
  #our actions
end&lt;/source&gt;
For more infos about layouts, see &quot;Layout Files&quot;

====redirect_to====
You can use &lt;tt&gt;redirect_to&lt;/tt&gt; in a similar manner as you do with render, but keep the big difference between &lt;tt&gt;render&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;redirect_to&lt;/tt&gt; in mind.

With &lt;tt&gt;redirect_to&lt;/tt&gt; you can easily send the user to a new resource, for example the index page of our products. To learn more about the paths and routing see the chapter on &quot;routing&quot;
&lt;source lang=rails&gt; redirect_to products_path&lt;/source&gt;

A very handy &lt;tt&gt;redirect_to&lt;/tt&gt; option is &lt;tt&gt;:back&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;source lang=rails&gt; redirect_to :back &lt;/source&gt;
will send the user back to the site that he came from

==== Templates ====

There are several templating systems included with Rails each designed to solve a different problem.

* [[Ruby_on_Rails/ActionView/ERb | ERb]] - Embedded Ruby is the default templating system for Rails apps. All files ending with &lt;tt&gt;.rhtml&lt;/tt&gt; are considered ERb templates.
* [[Ruby_on_Rails/ActionView/Builder | Builder]] - Builder templates are programmatic templates which are useful for rendering markup such as XML. All templates ending with &lt;tt&gt;.rxml&lt;/tt&gt; are treated as builder templates and include a variable called &lt;tt&gt;xml&lt;/tt&gt; which is an instance of XmlMarkup.

In addition to the built in template systems you can also register new template handlers using the &lt;tt&gt;ActionView::Base.register_template_handler(extension, class)&lt;/tt&gt; method. A template handler must implement the initialize(base) method which takes the &lt;tt&gt;ActionView::Base&lt;/tt&gt; instance and a &lt;tt&gt;render(text, locals)&lt;/tt&gt; method which takes the text to be rendered and the hash of local variables.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Now that you worked your way though [[Ruby_on_Rails/ActiveRecord|Models]] and [[Ruby_on_Rails/ActionView|Views]], it's time to get to the last part of MVC: the Controller. Your controller creates the proper data for the view and handles some logic structures. In order to fully understand the whole framework, you should also read about &quot;Routing&quot; to fully understand how things work together.

== Actions ==

Actions are methods of your controller which respond to requests. For example:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
class PeopleController &lt; ApplicationController
      def index
        @people = Person.find(:all)
      end
      def show
        @people= Person.find(params[:id])
      end
    end
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example the ''people'' controller has two actions: &lt;tt&gt;index&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;show&lt;/tt&gt;. The action called &lt;tt&gt;index&lt;/tt&gt; is the default action which is executed if no action is specified in the URL. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;http://localhost:3000/people&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;index&lt;/tt&gt; action can also be called explicitly:

&lt;pre&gt;http://localhost:3000/people/index&lt;/pre&gt;

The show action must be called explicitly unless a route has been set up (routing will be covered later):

&lt;pre&gt;http://localhost:3000/people/show/1&lt;/pre&gt;

In the example above the number 1 will be available in params[:id]. This is because the default route is:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;map.connect :controller/:action/:id&lt;/source&gt;

This indicates that the first part of the path is the controller name, the second part the action name and the third part is the ID. A detailed explanation of routes is provided in its [[Ruby_on_Rails/Routing|own chapter]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Parameters ==
Remember the &quot;[[Ruby_on_Rails/ActionView/Rendering_and_Redirecting#Rendering_and_Redirecting|rendering and redirecting]]&quot; example you've seen when learning about the view?

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
def update
    @product= Product.find(params[:id])

    if @product.update_attributes(params[:name])
      redirect_to :action =&gt; 'index'
    else
      render :edit
    end
end&lt;/source&gt;

You know what the differences between &lt;tt&gt;render&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;redirect_to is&lt;/tt&gt;. Now we want to take a look at WHAT gets updates. This is determined by given the &quot;update_attributes&quot; method what we want to update: &lt;tt&gt;params[:name]&lt;/tt&gt;. In this example, the data is likely to come from an HTML-Form (therefore a POST request). You can also work with GET requests in the same manner. Rails will handle both requests by using the params command.

When using e.g. check boxes you are likely to get more then one set of data for the same attribute. For example &lt;tt&gt;option[]=1&amp;option[]=2&amp;option[]=3&lt;/tt&gt;. As with the example above, you can work with &lt;tt&gt;params[:ids]&lt;/tt&gt; to get access to these settings. Your options will look like &lt;tt&gt;options =&gt; {'1','2','3'}&lt;/tt&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Session ==
For a technical explanation of a Session take a look at the wikipedia article about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science) Sessions]

In Rails you have some options to store the session. Most of the time you want to store the session on the server, but with security-relevant data, you might want to consider storing the session inside a database. To change the session storage, edit &lt;tt&gt;config/initializers/session_store.rb&lt;/tt&gt; and be sure to read on the [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html RoR Website] carefully.

===Work with your session===

As with the parameters, Rails provides a simple way of accessing your session. Consider following example:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;def show_details
  #we may use this inside a user-specific action
  User.find(session[:current_user_id])
end&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, you access the session in a similar way to the parameters. Storing a session isn't much more complicated:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;def index
  #we have some code here to get the user_id of a specific (logged-in) user
  session[:current_user_id] = id
end&lt;/source&gt;

To destroy the session, just assign it a nil-value
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;session[:current_user_id] = nil&lt;/source&gt;

===Displaying a Flash-message===

Flashes are very special and useful part of a session. You may have already found it in one of the [[Ruby on Rails/ActionView/Layout Files|view files]]. Here is how they work:
As said, Flashes are special. They exist only once and are destroyed after each request. Flashes are useful to display error messages or notices to the user (e.g. when he tries to log in or if his request resulted in an error)

Inside an action flashes can be used similar to:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;def check
  #code that does some validation
  flash[:notice] = &quot;Successfull logged in&quot;
end&lt;/source&gt;

Inside the view you can access it like:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;% if flash[:notice] -%&gt;
    &lt;%= flash[:notice] %&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;
&lt;!-- maybe some HTML-Code --&gt;
&lt;% if flash[:warning] -%&gt;
    &lt;%= flash[:warning] %&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see from the example above you are not limited to a single flash. You can access multiple flashes by their name you have defined inside the controller.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cookies==

Of course you can work with cookies inside your Rails application. This is, again very similar to working with [[Ruby on Rails/ActionController/Parameters|parameters]] or [[Ruby on Rails/ActionController/Sessions|sessions]]. Consider the following example:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
def index
  #here we want to store the user name, if the user checked the &quot;Remember me&quot; checkbox with HTML attribute name=&quot;remember_me&quot;
  #we have already looked up the user and stored its object inside the object-variable &quot;@user&quot;
 if params[:remember_me]
   cookies[:commenter_name] = @user.name
 else # Delete cookie for the commenter's name cookie, if any
  cookies.delete(:commenter_name)
 end
end
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Basic */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Forms==
===Basic===
Forms are an important part of every web site. We use them to contact the site owners to provide log in credentials or to submit data. Rails has vast support for forms and many build in tags to help you create forms quick and easily.

The most basic form you can get is a simple input field for your name:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;% form_tag do %&gt;
  &lt;%= label_tag(:my_name, &quot;My name is:&quot;) %&gt;
  &lt;%= text_field_tag(:my_name) %&gt;
  &lt;%= submit_tag(&quot;Process&quot;) %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

This will create a very basic form like
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;&lt;form action=&quot;/products/test/1&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding:0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;input name=&quot;authenticity_token&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;KBBEVzSZOkCi/s9LKhYvW/gdwyZzwH2n39py5FggaT4=&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;label for=&quot;my_name&quot;&gt;My name is:&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input id=&quot;my_name&quot; name=&quot;my_name&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;input name=&quot;commit&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/source&gt; 

This was achieved by creating a simple [[Ruby on Rails/ActionController/Actions|action]] called &lt;tt&gt;test.html.erb&lt;/tt&gt; inside our products view, 
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
def test
  #nothing here yet
end&lt;/source&gt;

An empty action inside the controller was added. The page was called inside the browser &lt;tt&gt;http://localhost:3000/products/test/1&lt;/tt&gt;. Because we haven't altered the routes we have to provide an id of a product. Additionaly Rails has created a &quot;authenticity_token&quot; to provide security features to our form. You also notice that there is an id for our input. Rails provides the id for every form element with the names you provided. Of course this can be altered by providing the proper option.

The following list should give you an overview of some form tags. As most of the tags work in a similar manner, it should be easy to figure out how much of them works. Also be sure to take a look at the [http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper.html#M001706 official API].

'''Radio Boxes:'''

To create radioboxes simply use
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= radio_button_tag :category, &quot;books&quot;, true %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
The above will create
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;&lt;input id=&quot;category_books&quot; name=&quot;category&quot; type=&quot;radio&quot; value=&quot;books&quot; /&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
If you want to change the id you can pass your own id to to tag &lt;tt&gt;(:id =&gt; &quot;someid&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;. To preselect an item the 3 option that the helper receives is supposed to be a boolean.

'''Submit Button:'''

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= submit_tag (&quot;Save products&quot;, :class =&gt; &quot;button&quot;) %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
will create a submit button
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;commit&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Save products&quot; /&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

'''Text fields:'''

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= text_field_tag ('rails') %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
will create an empty text field:
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;&lt;input id=&quot;rails&quot; name=&quot;rails&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

As usual you can add HTML options or specific values
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= text_field_tag ('price', nil, :maxlength =&gt; 10) %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

notice that we use &quot;&lt;tt&gt;nil&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; here. This is because we want to create a text field with no pre-defined value:

&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;&lt;input id=&quot;price&quot; name=&quot;price&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; maxlength=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
If we would have provided a name, Rails would add the HTML attribute &quot;value&quot;:
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;&lt;input id=&quot;price&quot; name=&quot;price&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; maxlength=&quot;10&quot; value=&quot;my predefined value instead of nil&quot; /&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

'''Select boxes:'''

A common task inside forms is to let the user select something from select boxes - or drop downs.
To display a simple select box we can combine some handy methods:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= select_tag (:name, options_for_select([['Peter','pete'],['Joseph', 'jo']]))%&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
would create
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;&lt;select id=&quot;name&quot; name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;
 &lt;option value=&quot;pete&quot;&gt;Peter&lt;/option&gt;
 &lt;option value=&quot;jo&quot;&gt;Joseph&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
 
Another nice helper of the &lt;tt&gt;select_*&lt;/tt&gt; family is &lt;tt&gt;select_year&lt;/tt&gt;. When you want the user to choose his year of birth, you may use something like:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= select_year Date.today, :start_year =&gt; 2009, :end_year =&gt; 1900  %&gt;&lt;/source&gt; 

This will create a select box with all years, starting from 2009 going to 1900 with the current year (&lt;tt&gt;Date.today&lt;/tt&gt; as the first argument) being pre-selected. Be sure to check out the other helpers for dates [http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html Datehelpers]

===Handling Errors===
Now that you know how to display forms correctly in Rails, we are looking for a way to give the user some feedback over his input.  Either if it is correct or if he needs to re-enter some values. You have already read about how to validate form data before it gets written into the database. Now you will see how to display the errors.
Basically there are two methods that allow us to display errors: &lt;tt&gt;error_messages&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;error_messages_for&lt;/tt&gt;. The name gives a pretty good idea of the difference between these two: &lt;tt&gt;error_messages&lt;/tt&gt; displays all errors for the form, while &lt;tt&gt;error_messages_for&lt;/tt&gt; displays the errors for a given model.

Using the methods is easy:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
&lt;% form_for(@product) do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.error_messages %&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;!-- different form tags --&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

will display all the error messages: either default ones or the ones you have specified inside your [[Ruby_on_Rails/ActiveRecord/Validations#validates_format_of|model]] (&lt;tt&gt;:message =&gt; &quot;Only integers allowed&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;).
&lt;tt&gt;error_messages_for&lt;/tt&gt; is used in a similar manner. Then it display the error message for the field that matches the given name (&lt;tt&gt;:name&lt;/tt&gt; in this case)
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= error_messages_for :name %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

You can also customize the error messages that are displayed in a box, even more:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%= f.error_messages :header_message =&gt; &quot;Invalid product!&quot;, :message =&gt; &quot;Correct your entries&quot;, :header_tag =&gt; :h6 %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

===Advanced Forms===
Until now we mainly worked with form elements that have a &lt;tt&gt;_tag&lt;/tt&gt; at the end of the name. When working with a model (e.g. you want to update your data or create a new data set) you want to use the form elements that are more suited for the job. There are no new elements to learn we just use the one we already know but do not add the _tag at the end (compare &lt;tt&gt;form_tag&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;form_for&lt;/tt&gt;).

Let's asume we want to create a new Product via a form:

We have a controller that has an action...
&lt;tt&gt;products_controller.rb&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;
#...
def new
  @product= Product.new
end
#...&lt;/source&gt;

... and a view (&lt;tt&gt;view/products/new.html.erb&lt;/tt&gt;) that works with our &lt;tt&gt;@product&lt;/tt&gt; instance:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;% form_for :product, @product, :url=&gt;{:action =&gt; &quot;create&quot;} do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :name %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :price %, :size =&gt; 10 &gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :amount%, :size =&gt;5 &gt;
  &lt;%= submit_tag &quot;New Product&quot; %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

will create HTML similar to:

&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;&lt;form action=&quot;/products&quot; class=&quot;new_product&quot; id=&quot;new_product&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding:0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;input name=&quot;authenticity_token&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;bgqa1sbwcC5J/tIpPtJjX/3slveFNJg3WZntSOyHT4g=&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;input id=&quot;product_name&quot; name=&quot;post[name]&quot; size=&quot;30&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;input id=&quot;product_price&quot; name=&quot;post[price]&quot; size=&quot;10&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;input id=&quot;product_amount&quot; name=&quot;post[amount]&quot; size=&quot;5&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;input id=&quot;product_submit&quot; name=&quot;commit&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Update&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Let's inspect the code: 
&lt;tt&gt;form_for&lt;/tt&gt; has some code on his side, &lt;tt&gt;:product&lt;/tt&gt; references the name of the model that we want to use and &lt;tt&gt;@product&lt;/tt&gt; is the instance of the object itself (in this case, it's going to be a new product). We loop or &quot;yield&quot; through the &lt;tt&gt;form_for&lt;/tt&gt; object with the variable ''f''. The rest uses code you are already familiar with. We use the action &quot;create&quot; to handle the creation of the file. 


===Restful Resources===
The methods shown above may not be exactly what you will see in other Rails applications. Most of them will use RESTful resources. This gives Rails the option to decide what to do with the data. This makes the &lt;tt&gt;form_for&lt;/tt&gt; method a lot easier and more readably:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;form_for :product, @product, :url=&gt;{:action =&gt; &quot;create&quot;}&lt;/source&gt;

turns into
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;form_for (@product)&lt;/source&gt;

That is a lot better, isn't it? Now the &lt;tt&gt;form_for&lt;/tt&gt; tag looks the same, no matter if you are creating a new product or if you update an existing one. Rails is smart enough to recognize the action and provides us with the correct HTML attributes (see &lt;tt&gt;&lt;form action=&quot;/products&quot; class=&quot;new_product&quot; id=&quot;new_product&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;)

To learn more about routing and REST be sure to take a look at Routing.

===Using select boxes with a model===
We already learnt how to create select boxes with built in helpers. But you may also want to display the contents of a model inside a select box. To show how this is done, we want to select categories from the database, so the user can select the according one:

&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;%=f.collection_select :category, :id, Category.all, :name, :name.downcase %&gt; &lt;/source&gt;
If you have some categories inside your database the HTML may look similar to
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;select id=&quot;category_id&quot; name=&quot;category[id]&quot;&gt;
 &lt;option value=&quot;cds&quot;&gt;CDs&lt;/option&gt;
 &lt;option value=&quot;books&quot;&gt;Books&lt;/option&gt;
 &lt;option value=&quot;dvds&quot;&gt;DVDs&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Notice the &lt;tt&gt;.downcase&lt;/tt&gt;: this will write the HTML values lowercase, if your database needs to work with it that way. This is just a starting point for your work. To see more examples and explanations, a good start is the [http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper.html official API]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Uploads==
The following paragraph should give you just a quick overview on the topic of uploading data with forms. For the more advanced purposes you might want to consider using widely known gems that handle the job. Take a look at the [[Ruby_on_Rails/Other_Resources#Plugins|Resources]] page to find good starting points for your search. Or take a look at the official Rails guide to see a [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#uploading-files sample action]

As with everything you want to upload via a form, you need to set the form to support &quot;&lt;tt&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. If you want to upload, e.g a picture for our products, you can use these ways:
Here, you will need to write an action inside the controller that handles the upload of the file on the server:
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;% form_tag({:action =&gt; :upload}, :multipart =&gt; true) do %&gt;
  &lt;%= file_field_tag 'picture' %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

For a form bound to a model we can use the already known &lt;tt&gt;form_for tag&lt;/tt&gt; (this allows you to save e.g. the image name inside your database)
&lt;source lang=rails&gt;&lt;% form_for @person, :html =&gt; {:multipart =&gt; true} do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.file_field :picture %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Custom Helpers ==

Rails comes with a wide variety of standard view helpers. Helpers provide a way of putting commonly used functionality into a method which can be called in the view. Helpers include functionality for rendering URLs, formatting text and numbers, building forms and much more. 

===Custom Helpers===
Custom helpers for your application should be located in the 
&lt;tt&gt;app/helpers&lt;/tt&gt; directory.

===Application Helper===
The file &lt;pre&gt;app/helpers/application.rb&lt;/pre&gt; contains helpers which are available to all views.

===Controller Helpers===
By default other helpers are mixed into the views for based on the controller name. For example, if you have a ProjectsController then you would have a corresponding ProjectsHelper in the file &lt;pre&gt;app/helpers/projects_helper.rb&lt;/pre&gt;

===Example===
The following is an example of an Application Helper. The method title will be available to all views in the application.
Methods added to this helper will be available to all templates in the application.

    &lt;source lang=rails&gt;module ApplicationHelper
    def title
      t = 'My Site'
      t &lt;&lt; &quot;: #{@title}&quot; if @title
      t
    end
  end&lt;/source&gt;

'''Thanks'''
Just wanted to thank all wikipedists for the amazing  work they perform. I'm studying at Warsaw next course, and thanks to your efforts I´m learning polish basics without having to assist some language courses.. If free culture diffusion were universally accepted, this world would be a better one. ( I know, not up to date english.. I´ll check that section later ;)

Format/Informal Address, 2nd person and 3rd person:
Something that would be really helpful here would be a note that, AFAICT, in formal address to another person you use &quot;pan&quot; or &quot;pani&quot; and the ''3rd person singular'' . (I hope that's right, I'm just a beginner...) [[User:Kgoess|Kgoess]] ([[User talk:Kgoess|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kgoess|contribs]]) 22:22, 12 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Anaphoric macros with Anaphora */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Binding with Metabang-Bind ==

Metabang-Bind combines several of the different lexical binding techniques into one facility.  The types of binds it currently supports are LET, DESTRUCTURING-BIND, MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND, binding on property lists, binding to structure slots, binding to class slots (with the option of using accessors), and destructuring arrays.  In addition, BIND is also extensible via CLOS, so you can introduce your own binding methods.

== Anaphoric macros with Anaphora ==

Anaphora is a library of macros that implement [[w:en:Anaphoric macro|anaphoric control structures]].  An anaphoric structure is one that implicitly binds a previous result.  The meaning of this binding is found by looking at the context of the expression.  As an example from the English language, consider the sentence, &quot;Pick up the ball and throw it.&quot;  It's quite clear that you would never say &quot;Pick up the ball and throw the ball,&quot; as that would be redundant.  However, most computer languages require you to express your thoughts in this redundant manner, as in:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(if (pseudo-p)
    (print (pseudo-p))
    (error &quot;It is not the case that pseudo-p.&quot;) )
&lt;/source&gt;

Now if the pseudo-predicate PSEUDO-P was really computationally intensive, you might not want to evaluate it twice.  In such a case, you would probably end up binding the original result and using it later, like this:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(let ((result (pseudo-p)))
  (if result
      (print result)
      (error &quot;It is not the case that pseudo-p.&quot;) ))
&lt;/source&gt;

This is basically all that anaphoric structures gain you, but it can be quite convenient and creates code that is closer to how you would explain the procedure to a friend rather than a computer.  With anaphora, one could write the example above as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(aif (pseudo-p)
     (print it)
     (error &quot;It is not the case that pseudo-p.&quot;) )
&lt;/source&gt;

Anaphora also includes anaphoric versions of WHEN, UNLESS, COND, CASE, TYPECASE and a few others.

Anaphora also offers the idea of symbolic anaphoric structures.  In these macros, the predicate form is saved, instead of its return value.  This means that IT can act as a place in a SETF expression.

}}

The te-form is often thought of as the conjunctive form.  This allows the combination of verbs, phrases, and sentences.  The verb and/or phrase may even have a different meaning when it follows after the conjunctive.  

== Uses ==
The following are some uses.  These are a sample of cases where the original verbial changes its meaning after it follows a te-form verb.  You shouldn't restrict your usage of the te-form to these few uses.  
==== ～ている ====
: Explained in detail  [[/iru/|here]].
==== ～ておく ====
When used as an auxiliary verb after the te-form, おく gives the sense of preparing a task or commiting to a task.  It roughly translates to the English version of &quot;I will do ...&quot;.
{{Japanese example|
:ビールを冷やしておきます。
:: I'll chill the beer.}}
==== ～てある ====
When used after the te-form, ある still has the same meaning as state-of-being, but it's more for the task being in a completed state.  So, a person performed the te-form verb, and ある means the action is finished and remains in the finished state.  There's no restriction for ある for inanimate and animate objects when following the te-form.  This auxiliary verb is restricted to transitivity verbs only.
{{Japanese example|
:ドアがしめてあります。
:: The door is closed.}}</text>

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:Transport engineering|transportation engineering]]''': the science of safe and efficient movement of people and goods. The planning aspects of transportation engineering usually involve an urban transportation model, requiring the estimation of trip generation (how many trips for what purpose), trip distribution (where is the traveler going), mode choice (what mode is being taken), and route assignment (which streets or routes are being used).

      <text xml:space="preserve">EDIT C
I edited this paragraph:
In many cases events can't be managed entirely by the organization that hosts them. This provides the opportunity for people to support organizations that they appreciate without committing to a long term engagement. Some organizations regularly ask for volunteers, such as non-profit aid organizations. While others may just need a hand here and there while hosting events. In some cases, groups can volunteer together, for example, a church group that builds houses in Mexico.

I changed it to: 
In many cases events can't be entirely managed by the organization that hosts them. By volunteering to help at these organization events it gives people the opportunity to support organizations that they appreciate and are interested in without committing to a long term engagement. Some organizations regularly ask for volunteers, such as non-profit aid organizations. Others may just need a hand here and there while hosting events. These volunteers are an important link between the organization and the rest of the community. Volunteering can be done on both the group level and the individual level. An example of people volunteering together is a church group that builds houses in Mexico. One does not need to volunteer with other people however. There is plenty that an individual can do to help.

I changed this paragraph because I thought it was important to have a smoother introduction and to better address the things mentioned below.

EDIT C 2
I was actually not signed in for my first edit I found out so I did another one

I changed a paragraph from:
I found that the Salsa club was very stuck up in a sense. Salsa dance is a very sexual dance and the members who were better than other new members liked to show this off. It's not ok to humiliate or make new members feel less important than those who have been in the club longer.

to:
Another problem that can sometimes arise is a rift between the new members and the old ones. This rift can come in many different forms. One is instead of making the new members feel welcome and trying to help them, the old members instead seem to like to emphasize the difference in skill level. An example of this is the Salsa club. Some have found its returning members rather stuck up. Salsa is a very sexual dance and the members who were better and at it seemed to like to show this off. While it is great to believe in yourself and your skill, it is not alright to humiliate or make new members feel less important. This hurts the clubs recruitment as less people will want to join, but even more importantly it hurts the new members itself. No organization is being efficient if it is hurting its members. 

I made this edit because I thought the subject needed to be elaborated on and made more general (so it could apply to more than just the Salsa Club). I also tried to make it sound a little less accusatory or the Salsa Club as not all the members are &quot;stuck up.&quot;</text>

The Erlang language was first written in [[Prolog]] by Joe Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;Audio interview with Joe Armstrong from (http://www.se-radio.net)&lt;/ref&gt; Joe is a known fan of Prolog and borrowed much syntax from Prolog in the design of Erlang. This first Prolog version of Erlang was slow and motivated the creation of a virtual machine. Later an emulator called the BEAM (Bogdans's Erlang Abstract Machine, [1]) was written in C and is about 200,000 lines of code. It is thought that Erlang is short for &quot;Ericsson Language&quot;, due to its place of birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Objects with Erlang 

Erlang is a functional programming language and a concurrency oriented programming languages (Armstrong, dissertation, 2005), but Erlang does not have explicit built-in object oriented language features. An object oriented programming style can be achieved by alternative means easily. It is particularly easy to do object oriented programming if we restrict ourselves to single inheritance. One can use processes to represent classes and messages to represent methods. To do so, each object when created can create a chain of processes that represent their ancestors in the inheritance chain. The methods(messages) can be passed up the chain until they reach a process that has a matching method. If the message reaches the top of the chain(the Object class or above that dev_nul) then we can generate an exception for a &quot;bad method name&quot;. Each class(process) will maintain its own attributes(variables) in its own recursive argument call list. These attributes can be accessed and updated with messages such as get and set. Attributes are stored in a dictionary called a Bundle, in each class process. 

Included is some example code that creates OOP using the described technique. In the program, we create an instance of the class integer. Its parent float, knows how to take the square root of reals. Its parent complex, knows how to take the square root of negative numbers. Its parent matrix, knows how to take the square root of a diagonal matrix. 

Logically, the traditional class relationship is held in the class diagram. An integer is a Real. A Real(float) is a (subset of) complex. An a complex number is a (subset of) complex matrices, if we think of a (1 by 1) matrix as a single number. 

A message(method) is sent to an instance of an object. If a process does not know how to do something, it passes a message(method) to its parent(process in this situation). If we tried to do something like take the sqrt(non-diag-matrix) it would be passed up to dev_nul and generate an error. 

The start function creates an instance of the integer class. Then it asks the instance to calculate the square_root of 4 numbers: 4, 0.04, -4 and the matrix [[4,0],[0,9]]. The answers are: 2, 0.2, {2, i} and [[2,0],[0,3]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:hydrogen|hydrogen]] atom is the simplest possible atom, comprising a single proton and a single electron.

To determine the wavefunction of the atom's electron, we must solve the 3D Schrödinger wave equation with the Coulomb potential of the single proton:

::&lt;math&gt;- \frac{\hbar}{2m} \left( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{d^2}{dy^2} + \frac{d^2}{dz^2} \right) \psi \left( x,y,z \right) + V \left( x,y,z \right)\psi \left( x,y,z \right) = E \psi \left( x,y,z \right)  &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; V \left( x,y,z \right) = V \left( r \right) = - \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r }&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Hydrogen atom energy.svg|thumb|300px|Energy of an electron near a proton, taking both kinetic and potential energy into account&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\,\quad T(r) + V(r) = E(r)\,&lt;/math&gt;]]
We re-express the wavefunction in spherical co-ordinates:
::&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,y,z) = \psi(r, \theta, \phi )\,&lt;/math&gt;

If there is no angular dependence, we can simple solve for the radial component, ''r''. 

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{d^2}{dy^2} + \frac{d^2}{dz^2} = \frac{d^2}{dr^2} +\frac{2}{r} \frac{d}{dr}&lt;/math&gt;

The Schrödinger equation for the radial solution of the hydrogen atom is then:
::&lt;math&gt;- \frac{\hbar}{2m} \left( \frac{d^2}{dr^2} + \frac{2}{r}\frac{d}{dr} \right) \psi \left( r\right) - \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r }\psi \left( r \right) = E \psi \left( r \right)  &lt;/math&gt;

==Ground State==

For the lowest energy state, this differential equation can be solved by the following trial solution:
::&lt;math&gt;\psi(r) = \psi_0 e^{-ar}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in, we get:

::&lt;math&gt;- \frac{\hbar}{2m} \left( a^2 e^{-ar} - \frac{2 a e^{-ar} }{r} \right)  - \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r } e^{-ar} = E e^{-ar}  &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;- \frac{\hbar}{2m} \left( a^2  - \frac{2 a }{r} \right)  - \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r }  = E   &lt;/math&gt;

The coefficents of ''r''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and ''r''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; must be separately satisfied:

::&lt;math&gt;- \frac{ \hbar^2 a^2 }{2m} = E&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;- \frac{ \hbar^2 a }{m} - \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore have values for ''a'' and ''E'':

::&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{e^2 m}{4 \pi \hbar^2 \epsilon_0} \approx \frac{1}{0.05 \mbox{ nm} } &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;E = - \frac{m e^4 } {32 \pi^2 \epsilon_0^2 \hbar^2} \approx 13.8 \mbox{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;

==Higher states==

Higher energy levels have a more complex wavefunction:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(r) = \psi_0 e^{-a_nr} L_n(r)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(r) is the [[w:Laguerre polynomial|Laguerre polynomial]] of order ''n''. It is no important here how this result was reached - for a more thorough explanation, see the [[Quantum Mechanics]] Wikibook. The associated energies are:

::&lt;math&gt;E_n = - \frac{m e^2} {32 n^2 \pi^2 \epsilon_0^2 \hbar^2} \approx - \frac{13.6}{n^2} \mbox{ eV}, \quad \quad n=1,2,3,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

The energy levels become closer and closer as ''n'' increases and the energy approaches zero. ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ corresponds to the vacuum level at which the electron is free of the proton. Electrons can move between the states by absorbing (to move up) or emitting (to move down) the correct amount of energy.

==Spherical orbitals==

For every ''n'', a spherical solution exists, in which the wavefunction is invariant with angle. These spherical orbitals are known as the ''s''-orbitals.

==Non-spherical orbitals==

The complete solution for the wavefunction has four quantum numbers:
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_{n,l,m,s}(r,\theta, \phi), \quad l = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1, \quad m = -l, \ldots, +l, \quad s = -\frac{1}{2} , +\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, when ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''l''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 there are three solutions corresponding to ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1,0,1. These are known as the ''p''-orbitals. Up to six electrons can be held in the ''p''-orbitals - two for each solution, one spin-up and one spin-down.

==Business Intelligence and Business Intelligence Systems==

Business intelligence focuses on making organizations more effectivce.  For profit maximizing organizations this means using BI to achieve continuous profitability.  For non-profit and governmental organizations this means efficiently and effectively serving their benefactors or constituents.  How is it that BI can serve the interests of any type of organization?

Regardless of their objectives all organization engages in two types of activities (Porter 1996 and Morgan et al. 2007):

#Strategic Effectiveness - Doing the right thing (projects and programs)
#Operational Effectiveness - Doing things right (right processes)

The most competitive and efficient organizations achieve superior performance over time.  They do this through both operational and strategic effectiveness.  Operational effectiveness means performing similar activities better than rivals perform them by better utilizing inputs.  It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for success.  Strategic effectiveness means performing different activities from rivals or performing similar activities in a different way (Porter 1996).  Only after achieving operational effectiveness can an organization focus on strategic effectiveness.  This is because it is possible (but not probable) for an organization to function effectively while doing the wrong thing right.  However, superior profitability or public service occurs when organizations do the right things right (Porter 1996 and Morgan et al. 2007).

BI systems help organizations make better-informed decisions.  They help middle management determine if their business unit is operationally effective.  Once the orgaization's leaders are certain that the company is operationally effective then executives can determine if the company is executing the strategy effectively.  In order to perform these tasks decision makers need intelligence in order to evaluate both strategic and operational effectiveness.   Business Intelligence systems deliver the intelligence necessary to both develop and evaluate strategy and implement the strategy (operations).  Thus an effective, organization-wide BI system allows decision makers to evaluate both strategic and operational effectiveness.  

This book outlines a way to think about BI and build a BI system using framework architecture.  Specifically, this book focuses on a specific type of BI system architecture.  Information systems have both an architecture and infrastructure (Poe et al. 1997).  An architecture is a set of rules providing a framework for the overall design of a system (blueprint).  A technical infrastructure (or just infrastructure) is closely related to architecture and includes technologies, platforms, databases, networks, and any other components necessary to make the architecture function (Poe et al. 1997).  This book defines a BI system by developing an architecture and infrastructure for both frames and frameworks.

The approach in this book assumes that:

#Company strategy can and should be embedded in the BI architecture (blueprint)
#BI architecture and infrastructure (technology) are related, with architecture driving infrastructure
#The basic unit of the BI system is a decision maker
#There are many ways to look at an organization.  Each view is a reference frame (or just frame)
#A BI system is the interconnection of frames (framework)
#The BI system allows decision makers to determine if they are doing things right and doing the right things (operational and strategic effectiveness)

==Book Approach==

This book demonstrates how to build a Business Intelligence (BI) system using a step-by-step approach.  We adopt the current view that BI is systemic and pervasive, not the application of information systems or products to isolated parts of a company.  Business Intelligence is also not just a module to be added to an ERP or data warehouse to produce reports.  Rather Business Intelligence, by empowering decision makers with organizational oversight, control and steering through information feedbacks, focuses on the operations, processes and strategic planning needed to run a company.  For this reason a solid methodology that guides the construction of a successful BI system must focus simultaneously on both strategic and operational efficiency. This requires a systems approach to organizational planning and control.  

This book demonstrates how to build a Business Intelligence system, step-by-step, using a framework approach.  This technique divides a BI system into a system (framework) and its parts (frame).  Each frame corresponds to the reference frame of a decision maker, such as a manager, vice president, director, etc.  A frame can reside at the highest level of an organization (CEO, CFO, CIO, etc.) at the middle (Director and Manager, for example), or at the lowest level (analyst, staff, etc.).  The framework is the interconnection of frames, both vertically (up and down the hierarchy) and horizontally (between business units or silos), that allows for the sharing and consolidation of information.  The structure of the framework allows for decision makers to centralize information, control and leadership of the firm while maintaining a degree of local autonomy.

The system creates a synergy of both architecture and infrastructure between multiple levels of the organization.  Each frame has an architecture and infrastructure.  The framework also contains an architecture and infrastructure.  The application of a systems approach to the framework architecture unites the parts into a system.  Information flows through the system, both horizontally and vertically.


==Book Structure==

We propose that the framework provides a systems approach methodology for building an organization's BI system.  The structure of the book takes the reader through the process of building this system.  The process of building a BI system is sequential and is best taught using a hierarchical structure.  The highest level are the sections corresponding to the knowledge needed to understand and create a BI system.  The sections are sequential and segmented.  The first section demonstrates how to build a frame.  An information system is composed of both an architecture (blueprint) and infrastructure (building).  One the reader understands both the architecture and infrastructure of a frame they move on to the section showing how to create a framework.  The section on framework outlines the architecture and infrastructure of the whole BI system.

The first step is to learn how build the architecture of a frame (section 1: stage 1).  We then show how to create the infrastructure for the frame (section 1: stages 2 and 3).  The next section shows how to build both the architecture (section 2: stage 1) and infrastructure of the framework (section 2: stages 2 and 3).  

===Hierarchy===
The definition of each is as follows:

*''Section'' is the highest division and corresponds to an important aspect of building a BI system.  The approach taken by this book presents a BI system as a framework with interconnected frames.  To build a BI system first requires knowledge of building a frame, both the architecture and infrastructure.  Next, it is necessary to understand how to connect the frames into a framework.  This requires understanding the framework architecture and infrastructure.

*''Stage'' divides a section into three parts.  The stages include Skunkworks, prototype development (Agile methodology) and finally production (SDLC).  Skunkworks means a group of individuals that produce innovative products that constitute the architecture.  The prototype (agile development) stage applies the agile software development methodology to produce the prototype (infrastructure) based on the frame (architecture).  Production refers to sending the prototype through a process designed to turn the prototype into a product that meets the rules and regulations of the company, including Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPPA, and rules regarding architecture and infrastructure.

*''Step'' is the smallest segment and is synonymous with a chapter.  Each chapter has a purpose and describes the activities that will achieve the purpose of the step.  Specifically, each step or chapter has a name, purpose, input, activities, output and documents.  

===Chapter Content===

* Step name: synonymous with chapter name.  This is a short descriptor of step purpose.
* Purpose: Explains the reason for engaging doing the step
* Input: the output from one step becomes the input for another.
* Activities: the activities take the inputs and create outputs and documentation.  
* Output: this is the product of the activities.
* Documents: describe the output and include written descriptions, user manuals, code, diagrams, etc.

==Book Objective==

The purpose of this book is to train the reader to become a Business Analyst for Business Intelligence systems.  Note that a business analyst and an analyst are not the same roles.

===Business Analyst===

The term [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst Business Analyst] is used to describe a person who practices the discipline of business analysis. A BA is responsible for analyzing the business needs of clients to help identify business problems and propose solutions.  This book assumes the BA performs the broadest role in helping to build the BI system.  They are involved in the creative stage or Skunkworks (&quot;A Skunkworks is a group of people who, in order to achieve unusual results, work on a project in a way that is outside the usual rules.&quot; - http://searchcio.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid182_gci214112,00.html), developing the prototype and putting the final product into production.  They are the architects of the BI system as well as the individuals that implement the infrastructure.  As such they are involved in many parts of the process:

* '''Business Requirements''' gather specifications of what the business wants, the purposes of initializing a specific project (Project Initialization Document), what the needed achievements will be, and the quality measures. They are usually expressed in terms of broad outcomes the business requires, rather than specific functions the system may perform. Specific design elements are usually outside the scope of this document, although design standards may be referenced.

* '''Functional Requirements''' describe what the system, process, or product/service must do in order to fulfill the business requirements. Note that the business requirements often can be broken up into sub-business requirements and many functional requirements. These are often referred to as System Requirements although some functionality could be manual and not system based, e.g., create notes or work instructions.

* '''User Requirements''' are a very important part of the deliverables, the needs of the stakeholders will have to be correctly interpreted. This deliverable can also reflect how the product will be designed, developed, and define how test cases must be formulated. The Business Analyst will record requirements in a Requirements Management Tool; this can be a simple spreadsheet or a complex application.

* '''Non Functional Requirements''' are requirements that do not perform a specific function for the business requirement but are needed to support the functionality. For example: performance, scalability, quality of service (QoS), security and usability. These are often included within the System Requirements, where applicable.

*  '''Infrastructure development''' this role requires the BA to develop the technical infrastructure for the BI system.  A BI system includes such items as a data mart, data warehouse, network and front-end tools.  The Business Analyst must be familiar with the workings of all parts of the infrastructure, if not an expert. 

===Analyst===
The analyst performs the day-to-day analytics for a company and is the main business intelligence worker. Analytics includes quantitative and qualitative analysis, explanatory data analysis, predictive modeling, querying, reporting, OLAP, and the &quot;alerts&quot; needed for decision making.  The analyst, by using the BI system, can answer such questions as:

*What happened?
*How many?
*How often?
*Where?
*Where exactly is the problem?
*What actions are needed?
*Why is this happening?
*What if these trends continue?
*What will happen next?
*What is the best that can happen?
*The goal is to understand how they use the system and how the system can help them deliver the intelligence needed for making decisions.</text>

|description = Wintergreen is an evergreen plant that stays close to the ground.  It grows in shady forests.  The white, bell-shaped flowers appear in early July.  They hang below the leaves.  As with many broad-leaf evergreens, the leaves are dark green and leathery.  They have smooth edges.
|facts =Wintergreen is used as a flavoring.  The berries and leaves are edible and have a refreshing, minty taste.  The berries stay on the plant until new flowers appear, meaning they are on the plant almost year-round.  Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about collecting wintergreen berries by digging them out of the snow in the early spring.

|description = Dewdrop is a plant that grows in the forests and stays low to the ground.  The flowers are white with five petals.  From the center of the flower spring several thread-like objects call ''stamens'' ('''stay'''-mins).  The leaves are shaped like hearts with scalloped edges.  Because of this, they are often confused with violets which also have heart-shaped leaves.  But once the flowers open, this plant looks nothing like a violet.
|facts =Dewdrop is something of a rare flower.  It is endangered in Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina and Rhode Island. It is threatened in Michigan and Ohio.  But it seems well established in Northern New England.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
In the Java programming language, the words '''field''' and '''variable''' are both one and the same thing. Variables are devices that are used to store data, such as a number, or a string of character data.

== Variables in Java programming ==
Java is considered as a '''strongly typed''' programming language. Thus all variables in the Java programming language ought to have a particular '''data type'''. This is either declared or inferred and the Java language only allows programs to run if they adhere to type constraints.

If you present a numeric type with data that is not numeric, say textual content, then such declarations would violate Java&amp;rsquo;s type system. This gives Java the unique ability of '''type safety'''. Java checks if an expression or data is encountered with an incorrect type or none at all. It then automatically flags this occurrence as an error at compile time. Most type-related errors are caught by the Java compiler, hence making a program more secure and safe once compiled completely and successfully. Some languages (such as C) define an interpretation of such a statement and use that interpretation without any warning; others (such as PL/I) define a conversion for almost all such statements and perform the conversion to complete the assignment. Some type errors can still occur at runtime because Java supports a cast operation which is a way of changing the type of one expression to another. However, Java performs run time type checking when doing such casts, so an incorrect type cast will cause a runtime exception rather than succeeding silently and allowing data corruption.

On the other hand, Java is also known as a '''hybrid language'''. While supporting [[Object Oriented Programming|object oriented programming]] (OOP), Java is not a pure OO language like [[Programming:Smalltalk|Smalltalk]] or [[Ruby Programming|Ruby]]. Instead, Java offers both object types and [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive types]]. Primitive types are used for boolean, character, and numeric values and operations. This allows relatively good performance when manipulating numeric data, at the expense of flexibility. For example, you cannot subclass the primitive types and add new operations to them.

== Kinds of variables ==
In the Java programming language, there are four kinds of variables.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-9&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.9: ClassWithVariables.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2, 3, 5, 6&quot;&gt;
public class ClassWithVariables {
    public int id = 0;
    public static boolean isClassUsed;

    public void processData(String parameter) {
      Object currentValue = null;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the [[#code-listing-9|code listing 3.9]], are examples of all four kinds of variables.
* '''Instance variables''': These are variables that are used to store the state of an object (for example, &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;). Every object created from a class definition would have its own copy of the variable. It is valid for and occupies storage for as long as the corresponding object is in memory.
* '''Class variables''': These variables are explicitly defined within the class-level scope with a {{Java:static}} modifier (for example, &lt;code&gt;isClassUsed&lt;/code&gt;). No other variables can have a &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; modifier attached to them. Because these variables are defined with the &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; modifier, there would always be a single copy of these variables no matter how many times the class has been instantiated. They live as long as the class is loaded in memory.
* '''Parameters''' or '''Arguments''': These are variables passed into a method signature (for example, &lt;code&gt;parameter&lt;/code&gt;). Recall the usage of the &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; variable in the main method. They are not attached to modifiers (i.e. &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;) and they can be used everywhere in the method. They are in memory during the execution of the method and can't be used after the method returns.
* '''Local variables''': These variables are defined and used specifically within the method-level scope (for example, &lt;code&gt;currentValue&lt;/code&gt;) but not in the method signature. They do not have any modifiers attached to it. They no longer exist after the method has returned.
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Test your knowledge}}
'''Question 3.5''': Consider the following code:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-5&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.5: SomeClass.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class SomeClass {
  public static int c = 1;
  public int a = c;
  private int b;

  public void someMethod(int d) {
    d = c;
    int e;
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the example above, we created five variables: &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;. All these variables have the same data type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (integer). However, can you tell what kind of variable each one is?
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
* &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are '''instance variables''';
* &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is a '''class variable''';
* &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is a '''parameter''' or '''argument'''; and,
* &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; is a '''local variable'''.

==Creating variables==
[[Image:Java Numeric Types Memory.png|thumb|300px|A graphical representation of computer memory]]
Variables and all the information they store are kept in the computer's memory for access. Think of a computer's memory as a table of data &amp;mdash; where each cell corresponds to a variable.

Upon creating a variable, we basically create a new address space and give it a unique name. Java goes one step further and lets you define what you can place within the variable &amp;mdash; in Java parlance you call this a ''data type''. So, you essentially have to do two things in order to create a variable:
* Create a variable by giving it a unique name; and,
* Define a data type for the variable.

The following code demonstrates how a simple variable can be created. This process is known as ''variable declaration''.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-40&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.40: A simple variable declaration.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

==Assigning values to variables==
Because we have provided a data type for the variable, we have a hint as to what the variable can and cannot hold. We know that &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (integer) data type supports numbers that are either positive or negative integers. Therefore once a variable is created, we can provide it with any integer value using the following syntax. This process is called an ''assignment operation''.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-41&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.41: Variable declaration and assignment operation (on different lines).'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a;
a = 10;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Java provides programmers with a simpler way of combining both variable declaration and assignment operation in one line. Consider the following code:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-42&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.42: Variable declaration and assignment operation (on the same line).'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a = 10;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Grouping variable declarations and assignment operations ==
Consider the following code:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-43&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.43: Ungrouped declarations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a;
int b;
String c;
a = 10;
b = 20;
c = &quot;some text&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

There are various ways by which you can streamline the writing of this code. You can group the declarations of similar data types in one statement, for instance:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-44&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.44: Grouped declarations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a, b;
String c;
a = 10;
b = 20;
c = &quot;some text&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Alternatively, you can further reduce the syntax by doing group declarations and assignments together, as such:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-45&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.45: Grouped declarations and assignments.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a = 10, b = 20;
String c = &quot;some text&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

==Identifiers==
Although [[w:Address space|memory spaces]] have their own addresses &amp;mdash; usually a hash number such as &lt;code&gt;0xCAD3&lt;/code&gt;, etc. &amp;mdash; it is much easier to remember a variable's location in the memory if we can give it a recognizable name. '''Identifiers''' are the names we give to our variables. You can name your variable anything like &lt;code&gt;aVariable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;someVariable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;age&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;someonesImportantData&lt;/code&gt;, etcetera. But notice: none of the names we described here has a space within it. Hence, it is pretty obvious that spaces aren't allowed in variable names. In fact, there are a lot of other things that are not allowed in variable names. The things that ''are'' allowed are:
* Characters &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; and their lower-case counterparts &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;.
* Numbers &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;. However, numbers should not come at the beginning of a variable's name.
* And finally, special characters that include only &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; (dollar sign) and &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; (underscore).

{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Test your knowledge}}
'''Question 3.6''': Which of the ones below are proper variable identifiers?
# &lt;code&gt;f_name&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;lastname&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;someones name&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;$SomeoneElsesName&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;7days&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;TheAnswerIs42&lt;/code&gt;
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
I can tell you that 3 and 5 are not the right way to do things around here, the rest are proper identifiers.
{{Hidden end}}
{{Hidden end}}

Any valid variable names might be correct but they are not always what you should be naming your variables for a few reasons as listed below:
* The name of the variable should reflect the value within them.
* The identifier should be named following the naming guidelines or conventions for doing so. We will explain that in a bit.
* The identifier shouldn't be a nonsense name like &lt;code&gt;lname&lt;/code&gt;, you should always name it properly: &lt;code&gt;lastName&lt;/code&gt; is the best way of naming a variable.

==Naming conventions for identifiers==
When naming identifiers, you need to use the following guidelines which ensure that your variables are named accurately. As we discussed earlier, we should always name our variables in a way that tells us what they hold. Consider this example:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-46&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.46: Unknown process.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a = 24;
int b = 365;
int c = a * b;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Do you know what this program does? Well, it multiplies two values. That much you guessed right. But, do you know what those values are? Exactly, you don't. Now consider this code:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-47&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.47: Time conversion.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int age = 24;
int daysInYear = 365;
int ageInDays = age * daysInYear;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Now you can tell what's happening, can't you? However, before we continue, notice the ''case'' of the variables. If a word contains CAPITAL LETTERS, it is in '''UPPER CASE'''. If a word has small letters, it is in '''lower case'''. Both cases in a word renders it as '''mIxEd CaSe'''.

The variables we studied so far had a mixed case. When there are two or more words making up the names of a variable, you need to use a special case called the ''camel-case''. Just like the humps of a camel, your words need to stand out. Using this technique, the words &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; could be written as either &lt;code&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FirstName&lt;/code&gt;.

The first instance, &lt;code&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; is what we use as the names of variables. Remember though, &lt;code&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; is not the same as &lt;code&gt;FirstName&lt;/code&gt; because Java is '''case-sensitive'''. Case-sensitive basically implies that the case in which you wrote one word is the case you have to call that word in when using them later on. Anything other than that is not the same as you intended. You'll know more as you progress. You can hopefully tell now why the variables you were asked to identify weren't proper.

==Literals (values)==
Now that we know how variables should be named, let us look at the values of those variables. Simple values like numbers are called ''literals''. This section shows you what literals are and how to use them. Consider the following code:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-48&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.48: Literals.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int age = 24;
long bankBalance = 20000005L;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

By now, we've only seen how numbers work in assignment statements. Let's look at data types other than numbers. Characters are basically letters of the English alphabet. When writing a single character, we use single quotes to encapsulate them. Take a look at the code below:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-49&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.49: Character.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
char c = 'a';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Why, you ask? Well, the explanation is simple. If written without quotes, the system would think it's a variable identifier. That's the very distinction you have to make when differentiating between variables and their literal values. Character data types are a bit unusual. First, they can only hold a single character. What if you had to store a complete name within them, say ''John'', would you write something like:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-50&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.50: Character list.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
char firstChar = 'J';
char secondChar = 'o';
char thirdChar = 'h';
char fourthChar = 'n';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Now, that's pathetic. Thankfully, there's a data type that handles large number of characters, it's called a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. A string can be initialized as follows:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-51&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.51: String.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String name = &quot;John&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Notice, the use of double quotation marks instead of single quotation marks. That's the only thing you need to worry about.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: often times → oftentimes using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Common Lisp has an extremely advanced condition system.  The condition system allows the program to deal with exceptional situations, or situations which are outside the normal operation of the program as defined by the programmer.  A common example of an exceptional situation is an error, however the Common Lisp condition system encompasses much more than error handling.

The condition system can be broken into three parts, signalling or raising conditions, handling conditions, and providing recovery from conditions.  Almost every modern programming language offers the first two protocols, but very few offer the last (or distinguish between the last two).  This last protocol, providing restarts, or ways for the program to recover, is in some ways the most important aspect of Common Lisp condition handling.

== Restarts ==

A restart is a way to recover from an exceptional situation.  Exceptional situations arise all the time, oftentimes as errors.  If you have been playing along in a REPL with this book, undoubtedly you have landed in a debugger session at least once.  The debugger is invoked when a serious condition is raised and the Lisp system has no recourse but to ask you what to do.  It gives you a list of options of ways it can recover from this condition.  These options are restarts.  Often the only restarts the debugger offers are to return to the top level REPL, but sometimes you are allowed to continue, or retry a computation.  In addition, other restarts can be defined by you.

For example, if you are attempting to read data from a file, there are quite a few things that can go wrong: the file might not exist, you might have insufficient permissions to read it, or it might be that the data inside the file is corrupted.  Each of these happenings are usually thought of as an exceptional situation and each could be dealt with in several ways.  In the case of the file not existing, you might want to specify a different file name; in the case of insufficient permissions, you may want to specify a different file name or alter the files permissions in order to make it readable; and in the case where the data is corrupt, you may want to specify a new file name, try to interpret the corrupt data in a meaningful way, or even try to repair the file and reread.

When you implement restarts, your job is to identify these possible recovery mechanisms and put them in place as restarts for the condition system.  To fill out our example, let's say you are reading a file that contains several lines, each containing a list of (x,y) coordinates just listed as pairs of numbers delimited by spaces.  As an example, the file might look like this:

&lt;source lang='lisp'&gt;
0 0 100 150 50 30
30 20 65 65 10 20
0 100 150 50 30 0
&lt;/source&gt;

As a first cut, we might write our function to read this file like
this:

&lt;source lang='lisp'&gt;
(defun read-points-file (filename)
  (iter (for line in-file filename using #'read-line)
        (collecting
         (iter (for val in-stream (make-string-input-stream line))
               (collect val) ))))
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, we see what happens (in SBCL) if we call the function on a file
that doesn't exist:

&lt;source lang='lisp'&gt;
(read-points-file #p&quot;does-not-exist.data&quot;)

error opening #P&quot;does-not-exist.data&quot;:
  No such file or directory
   [Condition of type SB-INT:SIMPLE-FILE-ERROR]

Restarts:
 0: [RETRY] Retry SLIME REPL evaluation request.
 1: [ABORT] Return to SLIME's top level.
 2: [TERMINATE-THREAD] Terminate this thread (#&lt;THREAD &quot;repl-thread&quot; RUNNING {BA80BC1}&gt;)

Backtrace:
  0: (SB-IMPL::SIMPLE-FILE-PERROR &quot;error opening ~S&quot; #P&quot;does-not-exist.data&quot; 2)
  1: ((LABELS SB-IMPL::VANILLA-OPEN-ERROR))
  2: (OPEN #P&quot;does-not-exist.data&quot;)[:EXTERNAL]
  3: (READ-POINTS-FILE #P&quot;does-not-exist.data&quot;)

...etc...
&lt;/source&gt;

We see that SBCL has raised an error, and since it didn't know what to do, it asks the user.  It gives a list of restarts, RETRY, ABORT, and TERMINATE-THREAD.  If you created a file called &lt;tt&gt;does-not-exist.data&lt;/tt&gt;, then you might restart with RETRY.  In the case where the file exists but cannot be read due to permissions, we get the nearly the same result, but the error message &lt;tt&gt;Permission denied&lt;/tt&gt; instead.  Again, you could fix the file and invoke the RETRY restart.

It seems prudent that if the file could not be opened for reading, the user may have entered an incorrect file name.  In light of this, let's provide a restart to change the file name we are trying to open.  We can do this using the form &lt;tt&gt;restart-case&lt;/tt&gt; or the more general &lt;tt&gt;restart-bind&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun prompt-for-new-file ()
  (list (prompt &quot;Input new file name: &quot;)) )

(defun read-points-file (filename)
  (restart-case
      (iter (for line in-file filename using #'read-line)
            (collecting
             (iter (for val in-stream (make-string-input-stream line))
                   (collect val) )))
    (try-different-file (filename)
      :interactive prompt-for-new-file
      (read-points-file filename) )))
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, if we enter the debugger because the file cannot be read, we get an extra option, TRY-DIFFERENT-FILE.

&lt;source lang='lisp'&gt;
(read-points-file #p&quot;does-not-exist.data&quot;)

error opening #P&quot;does-not-exist.data&quot;:
  No such file or directory
   [Condition of type SB-INT:SIMPLE-FILE-ERROR]

Restarts:
 0: [TRY-DIFFERENT-FILE] TRY-DIFFERENT-FILE
 1: [RETRY] Retry SLIME REPL evaluation request.
 2: [ABORT] Return to SLIME's top level.
 3: [TERMINATE-THREAD] Terminate this thread (#&lt;THREAD &quot;repl-thread&quot; RUNNING {BA80BC1}&gt;)

Backtrace:
  0: (SB-IMPL::SIMPLE-FILE-PERROR &quot;error opening ~S&quot; #P&quot;does-not-exist.data&quot; 2)
  1: ((LABELS SB-IMPL::VANILLA-OPEN-ERROR))
  2: (OPEN #P&quot;does-not-exist.data&quot;)[:EXTERNAL]
  3: (READ-POINTS-FILE #P&quot;does-not-exist.data&quot;)
...etc...

Input new file name: #p&quot;does-exist.data&quot;

==&gt; ((0 0 100 150 50 30) (30 20 65 65 10 20) (0 100 150 50 30 0))

&lt;/source&gt;

The form &lt;tt&gt;restart-case&lt;/tt&gt; runs its first argument in an environment where restarts are in effect.  This means that the specified restart, TRY-DIFFERENT-FILE, can be invoked at any time during the execution of that first form.  In our example, during the execution of the form the debugger was invoked, which means that restart is included in the list of actions it can take.

== Conditions ==

Conditions are used to describe situations that the programmer doesn't want to handle in the main program flow.  We haven't defined any conditions yet in our little example, however, a condition was signalled.  This condition was an error that &lt;tt&gt;open&lt;/tt&gt; raised when trying to open files that it cannot.  The error is of type &lt;tt&gt;sb-int:simple-file-error&lt;/tt&gt; which is built into the Lisp system.

You can define your own conditions via the &lt;tt&gt;define-condition&lt;/tt&gt; macro which is very similar to the &lt;tt&gt;defclass&lt;/tt&gt; macro.

== Handlers ==

A handler serves the simple purpose of tying a condition to a restart.  This means that if that condition is raised, that restart will automatically be chosen, meaning that we don't get dumped into the debugger.

The forms that instantiate handlers are &lt;tt&gt;handler-case&lt;/tt&gt; and the more general &lt;tt&gt;handler-bind&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Pedestrian Error Handling ==

Common Lisp also provides a set of error handling mechanisms built that mimic the behavior found in most other languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note:''' Based on the [[Java Programming/Java Overview|Java Overview chapter]] of the [[Java Programming|Java Programming book]].

Before Java emerged as a programming language, C++ was the dominant player in the trade. The primary goals that the [[Java Programming/History|developers of Java]] faced was to create a language that could tackle most of the things that C++ offered while getting rid of some of the more tedious tasks that came with the earlier languages.

The new features and upgrades included into Java changed the face of programming environment and gave a new definition to [[Object Oriented Programming]]. But unlike its predecessors, Java needed to be bundled with standard functionality and be independent of the host platform. This is further explained in this section.

The primary goals in the creation of the Java language:
* It is simple.
* It is object-oriented.
* It is independent of the host platform 
* It contains language facilities and libraries for networking.
* It is designed to execute code from remote sources securely.
The Java language introduces some new features that did not exist in other languages like C and C++. 

The introduction of those features are the subject of this page.

==Earlier programming languages==
Computer hardware went through a performance and price revolution in the 1980s and 1990s. Better, faster hardware was available at lesser price and the demand for big and complex software exponentially increased. To accommodate the demand, new development technologies were invented.

The C language developed in 1972 by [[w:Dennis Ritchie|Dennis Ritchie]] had taken a decade to become the most popular language amongst programmers. But, with time programmers found that programming in C became tedious with its structural syntax. &lt;ref&gt;Structural syntax is a linear way of writing code. A program is interpreted usually at the first line of the program's code until it reaches the end. One can not hook a later part of the program to an earlier one. The flow follows a linear top-to-bottom approach.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, people attempted solving this problem, it would be later that a new development philosophy was introduced, one named ''Object-Oriented Programming'' (''OOP'' in short). With OOP, a person may write a certain code which may be reused later without rewriting the code over and over again. In 1979, [[w:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup]] developed [[w:C++|C++]], an enhancement to the C language with included OOP fundamentals and features.

===Platform dependence and zero-modularity===
However, over time, people began to realize the problems with the architecture of the language. For one, the language produced different results/output for different platforms. C/C++ applications only adhered to platforms they were targeting and would not work on others. A certain program built for a certain platform would only target that specific platform or hardware. This close-knitted integration with the hardware posed greater vulnerability risks.
[[Image:C_cplusplus_compilation_process.svg|center]]
Note here that when a certain code is compiled into an executable format. The executable can not be changed dynamically. It would need to be recompiled from the changed code for the changes to be reflected in the finished executable. '''Modularity''' (dividing code into modules) is evidently ''not'' present in Java's predecessors. If instead of a single executable, the output application was in the form of modules, one can easily change a single module and review changes in the application, but rather in C/C++, a slight change in code required the whole application to be recompiled.

===Unsafe code===
With the high-level of control built into the language to manipulate hardware, a programmer could access almost any resource, either hardware or software on the system. This was to be one of the languages' strong points, but this very flexibility led to confusion and complex programming practices. Memory leaks became a regular nuisance in instances where the programmers had to manually attempt at using the system's memory resources.

Now memory resources or buffers have a peculiar way of working. Once a buffer is filled with data, it needs to be cleaned up after there is no use for its content. If a programmer forgets to clean it in his/her code, the memory is easily overloaded. Programming in C/C++ languages became tedious and unsafe because of these very quirks and programs built in the languages were prone to memory leakages and sudden system crashes, sometimes even harming the hardware itself.

===Non-standardization and complexity===
C++ was built atop the C language and as a result different ways doing the same thing became evident in the language. For instance, creating an object could be done in three different ways in C++. Furthermore, the language did not come with a standard library bundled with its compilers and rather relied on resources created by other programmers with code which rarely fit together.

===Networking capabilities===
However powerful, the predecessors of Java lacked a standard feature to network with other computers, and usually relied on the platforms intricate networking capabilities. With almost all network protocols being standardized, the creators of Java technology wanted this to be a flagship feature of the language while keeping true to the spirit of earlier advances made towards standardizing [[w:Remote procedure call|Remote Procedure Call]]. Another feature that the Java team focused on was its integration in the World Wide Web and the Internet.

===Agenda for the new language===
Keeping all of the above in mind, the developers of Java created a list of features tackling these problems. In their opinion, Java should&amp;nbsp;...

* ..&amp;nbsp;be simple and gather tested fundamentals and features from the earlier languages in it,
* ..&amp;nbsp;have standard sets of APIs with basic and advanced features bundled with the language,
* ..&amp;nbsp;get rid of concepts requiring direct manipulation of hardware (in this case, memory) to make the language safe,
* ..&amp;nbsp;be platform independent and may written for every platform once (giving birth to the [[w:Write once, run anywhere|WORA]] idiom),
* ..&amp;nbsp;be able to manipulate network programming out-of-the-box,
* ..&amp;nbsp;be embeddable in web browsers, and&amp;nbsp;...
* ..&amp;nbsp;have the ability for a single program to multi-task and do multiple things at the same time.
* Simple syntax, simple features. Those features that could be abused, by a programmer, were not added to the language. Those are:
** Operator overloading
** Multiple inheritance
** Memory allocation (use of automatic garbage collection)
** Friend classes (access an other object private members)
** Force exception handling (programmer must handle exception or declare that the user must handle it, someone must handle it)
** Automatic initializations (to give consistent behavior)
** Restrictions of explicit type casting (related to memory management)
* Platform Independence (run everywhere concept)
** Compile to intermediate byte code that executed by a Java Virtual Machine
* Network programming
** Be able to download code from remote server and execute that code during runtime
** Creates of the Applet concept (Applets can run in the client browser program)
* Built in thread, multitasking capabilities to the language
** Ease of multitasking (other languages needed third party libraries to do that)
* Platform independent Graphical User Interface (GUI)
** AWT (Contains widgets that most Operating system supports)
** Swing (Added later)

Java was released in 1995, the time when the Internet started became available to the public. The promise of Java was in the client browser-side. The Java code would be downloaded and executed as Java applets in the client browser program.

Then the focus was moved to the server side. Java extensions were added to the JDK, it is called J2EE:
* Servlet execution - (Alternative to CGI programs)
* JSP, Java Server Pages - (Embed Java Code in HTML)
* EJB - (Distributed object execution)

== Dynamic class loading ==
In conventional languages like C and C++, all code had to be compiled and linked to one executable program, before execution. In Java, classes are compiled as needed. If a class is not needed during an execution phase, that class is not even compiled into byte code.

This feature comes in handy especially in network programming when we do not know, beforehand, what code will be executed. A running program could load classes from the file system or from a remote server.

Also this feature makes it possible that a Java program could in theory alter their own code during execution, to do some self learning behavior. It would be more realistic to image however, that a Java program which generate Java code, before execution, then that code would be executed. With some feedback mechanism, next time the generated code could differ, thus it could improve in time.

== Automatic memory garbage collection ==

In conventional languages like C and C++, the programmer has to make sure that all memory that was allocated are freed. Freeing memory is particularly important in servers, since it has to run without stopping for days. If a piece of memory is not freed after use, and the server just keeps allocating memory, that memory leak can take down the server.

In Java, freeing up memory is taken out from the programmers hand. The Java Virtual Machine keeps track all of the used memory. When the memory is not used any more, it is automatically freed up. A separate task is running at the background by the JVM, freeing up unreferenced, unused memory. That task is called the &quot;Garbage Collector&quot;.

The &quot;Garbage Collector&quot; is always running. This automatic memory garbage collection feature makes it easy to write robust server side programs in Java. The only thing the programmer has to watch for is the speed of object creation. If the application is creating objects faster then the &quot;Garbage Collector&quot; can free them, then that can cause memory problems. Depending on how the JVM is configured, the application either can run out of memory by throwing the &lt;code&gt;NotEnoughMemoryException&lt;/code&gt;, or can halt to give time for the &quot;Garbage Collector&quot; to do its job.

== Error handling ==

''For more info. see:'' [[Java Programming/Exceptions]]

The old way of error handling was to let each function return an error code then let the caller check what was returned. The problem with this method was that if the return code was full of error-checking codes, this got in the way of the original one that was doing the actual work, which in turn did not make it very readable. 

The new way of error handling is when functions/methods do not return error codes. When there is an error an exception is thrown. The exceptions can be handled by the {{java:catch}} keyword at the end of a {{java:try}} block.  This way, the code that is doing the actual work does not need to be mangled with error checking codes, thus making the code more readable. This new way of error handling is called Exception handling.

Exception handling was also added to C++. However, there are two differences between Java and C++ Exception handling.
* In Java, the exception that is thrown is a Java object like any other object in Java. It only has to implement &lt;code&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt; interface.
* The compiler checks whether an exception was caught or not. The compiler gives an error if a there is no catch block for a thrown exception.

== Platform independence ==
Platform independence means that programs written in the Java language must run similarly on diverse hardware. One should be able to write a program once and run it anywhere. This is achieved by compiling Java language code &quot;halfway&quot; to bytecode--simplified virtual machine instructions that conform to a set standard. The code is then run on a [[w:Java virtual machine|Java virtual machine]], a program written in native code on the host hardware that translates generic Java bytecode into usable code on the hardware. Further, standardized libraries are provided to allow access to features of the host machines (such as graphics and networking) in unified ways. The Java language also includes support for multi-threaded programs--a necessity for many networking applications.

The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.

The first of these is to simply compile directly into native code like a more traditional compiler, skipping bytecode entirely. This achieves great performance, but at the expense of portability. This is not really used any more. 

Another technique, the ''just-in-time'' compiler or &quot;JIT&quot;, compiles the Java bytecode into native code at the time the program is run, and keep the compiled code to be used again and again.  More sophisticated VMs even use ''dynamic recompilation'', in which the VM can analyze the behavior of the running program and selectively recompile and optimize critical parts of the program.  Both of these techniques allow the program to take advantage of the speed of native code without losing portability.

Portability is a technically difficult goal to achieve, and Java's success at that goal is a matter of some controversy.  Although it is indeed possible to write programs for the Java platform that behave consistently across many host platforms, the large number of available platforms with small errors or inconsistencies led some to parody Sun's &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot; slogan as &quot;Write once, debug everywhere&quot;.  

Platform independent Java is, however, very successful with server side applications, such as web services, servlets, or Enterprise Java Beans.

Java also made progress on the client side, first it had [[w:Abstract Window Toolkit|Abstract Window Toolkit(AWT)]], then [[w:Swing (Java)|Swing]], and the most recent client side library is the [[w:Standard Widget Toolkit|Standard Widget Toolkit(SWT)]].
It is interesting to see how they tried to handle the two opposing consuming forces. Those are :

; Efficient, fast code; port to most popular hardware (write once, test anywhere) : Use the underlying native subroutine to create a GUI component. This approach was taken by [[w:Abstract Window Toolkit|AWT]], and [[w:Standard Widget Toolkit|SWT]].

; Portability to any hardware where JVM ported(write once, run anywhere) : To achieve this to the latter, the Java toolkit should not rely on the underlying native user interface. [[w:Swing (Java)|Swing]] took this approach.

It is interesting to see how the approach was switched back and forth. AWT - Swing - SWT.

== Secure execution of remote code ==
The Java platform was one of the first systems to provide wide support for the execution of code from remote sources. The Java language was designed with [[w:Network computing|network computing]] in mind. 

An applet could run within a user's browser, executing code downloaded from a remote HTTP server. The remote code runs in a highly restricted &quot;sandbox&quot;, which protects the user from misbehaving or malicious code; publishers could apply for a certificate that they could use to digitally sign applets as &quot;safe&quot;, giving them permission to break out of the sandbox and access the local file system and network, presumably under user control.

== Object orientation ==
[[Object Oriented Programming|Object orientation]] (&quot;OO&quot;), refers to a method of programming and language technique. The main idea of OO is to design software around the &quot;things&quot; (i.e. objects) it manipulates, rather than the actions it performs. 

As the hardware of the computer advanced, it brought about the need to create better software techniques to be able to create ever increasing complex applications. 
The intent is to make large software projects easier to manage, thus improving quality and reducing the number of failed projects.
Object oriented solution is the latest software technique.

; Assembly languages : Software techniques started with the assembly languages, that was close to machine instruction and was easy to convert executable code. Each hardware had its own assembly language. Assembly language contains low level instructions like move data from memory to hardware registers, do arithmetic operations, and move data back to memory. Programmers had to know the detailed architecture of the computer in order to write programs.

; Procedural languages : After the assembly languages, high level languages were developed. Here the language compiler is used to convert the high level program to machine instructions, freeing up the programmers the burden of knowing the computer hardware architecture. To promote the re-use of code, and to minimize the use of GOTO instruction, &quot;procedural&quot; techniques were introduced. This simplified the creation and maintenance of software control flow, but they left out the organization of data. It became a nightmare to debug and maintain programs having many global variables.  Global variables contain data that can be modified anywhere in the application.

; Object oriented languages : In OO languages, data is taken seriously with information hiding. Procedures were replaced by Objects. Objects contain data as well as control flow. Our thinking has to shift from procedures to interaction between objects.

== Evaluation ==
''''''In most people's opinions, Java technology delivers reasonably well on all''' these goals. The language is not, however, without drawbacks.''' 
Java tends to be more high-level than similar languages (such as C++), which means that the Java language lacks features such as hardware-specific data types, low-level pointers to arbitrary memory addresses, or programming methods like operator overloading. Although these features are frequently abused or misused by programmers, they are also powerful tools. However, Java technology includes Java Native Interface (JNI), a way to call native code from Java language code. With JNI, it is still possible to use some of these features.

Some programmers also complain about its lack of multiple inheritance, a powerful feature of several object-oriented languages, among others C++. The Java language separates inheritance of type and implementation, allowing inheritance of multiple type definitions through interfaces, but only single inheritance of type implementation via class hierarchies. This allows most of the benefits of multiple inheritance while avoiding many of its dangers. In addition, through the use of concrete classes, abstract classes, as well as interfaces, a Java language programmer has the option of choosing full, partial, or zero implementation for the object type he defines, thus ensuring maximum flexibility in application design.

There are some who believe that for certain projects, object orientation makes work harder instead of easier. This particular complaint is not unique to the Java language but applies to other object-oriented languages as well.

== Note for C programmers ==

Tools exist to aid the migration of existing projects from C to Java. In general, automated translator tools fall into one of two distinct kinds:
* One kind converts C code to Java byte code. It is basically a compiler that creates byte code. It has the same steps as any other C compiler. See also [[w:C to Java Virtual Machine compilers|C to Java JVM compilers]].
* The other kind translates C code to Java source code. This type is more complicated and uses various syntax rules to create readable Java source code. This option is best for those who want to move their C code to Java and stay in Java. [example needed]

===Invoking C programs from Java applications===

You can use Runtime.exec  method to invoke a program from within a running Java application. Runtime.exec also allows you to perform operations related to the program, such as control the program's standard input and output, wait until it completes execution, and get its exit status. 

Here's a simple C application that illustrates these features. This C program will be called from Java: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf(&quot;testing\n&quot;);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This application writes a string &quot;testing&quot; to standard output, and then terminates with an exit status of 0. 
To execute this simple program within a Java application, compile the C application: 
 $ cc test.c -o test

Then invoke the C program using this Java code: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ExecDemo 
{
    static public String[] runCommand(String cmd) throws IOException 
    {
        // --- set up list to capture command output lines ---
        ArrayList list = new ArrayList();

        // --- start command running
        Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);

        // --- get command's output stream and
        // put a buffered reader input stream on it ---
        InputStream istr = proc.getInputStream();
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(istr));

        // --- read output lines from command
        String str;
        while ((str = br.readLine()) != null)
            list.add(str);

        // wait for command to terminate
        try {
            proc.waitFor();
        }
        catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.err.println(&quot;process was interrupted&quot;);
        }

        // check its exit value
        if (proc.exitValue() != 0)
            System.err.println(&quot;exit value was non-zero&quot;);

        // close stream
        br.close();

        // return list of strings to caller
        return (String[])list.toArray(new String[0]);
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
        try {

            // run a command
            String outlist[] = runCommand(&quot;test&quot;);

            // display its output
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; outlist.length; i++)
                System.out.println(outlist[i]);
        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println(e);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The demo calls a method runCommand to actually run the program. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
 String outlist[] = runCommand(&quot;test&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

This method hooks an input stream to the program's output stream, so that it can read the program's output, and save it into a list of strings.
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt; 
 InputStream istr = proc.getInputStream();
 BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(istr));  
                
 String str;
 while ((str = br.readLine()) != null)
     list.add(str);
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note:''' Based on the [[History of Computers|History of Computers book]]

From the dawn of time, human beings have always tried to find new ways to solve problems, be more productive, work with numbers faster, and have better ways of storing information. Possibly early humans used stones to count items, which lead to the abacus, then to the slide-rule, and then later calculators. These machines allowed human beings to do these things faster and better than they could do them in their minds.

== Early Computers ==
=== The Mechanical Age ===

Since the early ages of computer history there has been innovations that have led to the advancement of technology. The first computers were mechanical, and sometimes prone to errors. They were calculating machines. Blaise Pascal built a numerical wheel adding machine in 1642 in order to help out his father, who was a tax collector. It was a heavy burden to add numbers by hand, and Pascal had seen it as a chance to relieve that burden.

In 1673 Gothfried Willhelm von Leibniz, a German mathematician, built a calculator device that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It provided more functions than Pascal's machine and allowed users of it to solve more problems. Yet both Pascal's and Leibniz's machines were not totally dependable and suffered from flaws.

=== Mechanical Innovations ===
Joseph Jacquard, a French weaver, designed a punch card loom in 1805. A chain of punch cards in an certain order, provided instructions for the loom to control it. This allowed patterns in the weave as the machine weaved threads. The pattern could be changed by changing the cards used to different cards. This later lead to storing computer instructions on these cards.

Charles Xavier Thomas, another Frenchman, worked on a new mechanical computer. He called it the four-function machine and it was more reliable than Pascal's or Leibniz's machines. This was in 1820 as technology had progressed, and Thomas learned from Pascal's and Leibniz's works and flaws.

=== Larger Scale Mechanical Computers and Logic ===
Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace made contributions since 1842. The Difference Engine, the machine that became the template for the Analytic Engine, was an automatic logarithm tabulator and printer. It had a memory unit, automatic printout, sequential program control and punch-card input. The punch card idea was borrowed from Jacquard's loom.

Babbage had worked with computers for 20 years with the British government, and the government was threatening to withdraw funds because it had nothing to show for its investments. The project needed someone new to help out, and enter Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron and Lady Annabella Milbanke. Lovelace corrected some of Babbage's mistakes in the instructions and became the world's first debugger. It was a milestone for women in computer history. Lovelace suggested a binary system of numbers be used, which set the standard of future computers to use.

Sadly the Difference Engine did not function properly. The technology to create proper gears and shafts was not good enough to provide accuracy. Yet it helped pave the way for future computers. Later the IBM Corporation was able to build a working model of the Difference Engine using more modernized parts.

== Early Electronic Computers ==

== Early Programming Languages ==

The first version of a programming language arose from work by [[wikipedia:Ada_Lovelace|Ada Lovelace]], the benefactor and business partner of [[wikipedia:Charles_Babbage|Charles Babbage]]. Unfortunately her work went mostly ignored since Babbage never built a completed Analytical Engine so there was no public deployment. She is remembered in the programming language still in use on military-grade projects, [[Ada]].

=== Wiring and Raw Binary ===

Early work with analog and electromechanical computers did not involve programming languages the way we know them. Since early computers needed to be wired directly for each problem set, the process of setting plugs took the place of having a text-based distillation of an algorithm.

As electromechanical machinery gave way to mercury delay lines and drum memory, it became possible to write directly to addresses in memory and provide instructions without rewiring. This typically meant writing what we would call &quot;machine code&quot;. This often gets called &quot;hex&quot; today, as modern 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessor systems read binary data in 8 or 16 hexadecimal chunks per clock cycle.

Writing code at the machine level is difficult: it requires that the programmer know the specific locations for registers in hardware and the instruction set for the processor. Reading machine code is often more difficult than writing it, thus tracking code changes is nearly impossible for a human.

=== Assembly ===

The first upgrade to the machine code level of programming was [[wikipedia:assembly_language|assembly language]]. This provided a way to write machine code with string manipulators and names for instructions instead of the raw binary versions. It can still be difficult to read and still requires knowing which instructions and register locations exist, but it can be read on paper or screen and assembled into machine code cycle by cycle.

Assembly programming has not gone away. Most device drivers for computer peripherals are written in C code, but some real-time glitches are best resolved by hand optimizing the mid-step assembly output from the C compiler. This is becoming increasingly rare. 

=== FORTRAN ===
[[wikipedia:fortran|FORTRAN]] Stands for FORmula TRANslation. This language was invented at IBM in the mid-1950s for the IBM 704 series computer.

=== BASIC ===
BASIC stands for Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code

In computer programming, [[BASIC]] (an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code[1]) refers to a family of high-level programming languages. It was originally designed in 1963, by John George Kemeny and Thomas Eugene Kurtz at Dartmouth College, to allow students not in science fields to use computers. At the time all computer use required writing custom software, which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to do. It became widespread on home microcomputers in the 1980s, and remains popular to this day in a handful of heavily evolved dialects.

=== COBOL ===
COBOL, an acronym that stands for '''COmmon Business Oriented Language''', is a high-level programming language developed in the 1960s and still used in business applications. It is used extensively in the financial services industry for large scale mainframe based applications. It uses instructions resembling English statements and imposes an overall framework for a program. The design goal for COBOL was a language that self-documented so that it could be revised and maintained easily.

=== PL/1 ===
'''Programming Language 1''' is a high-level programming language designed for scientific, engineering, and business applications. It is one of the most feature-rich programming languages and one of the very first in the highly-feature-rich category. It has been used by various academic, commercial and industrial users since it was introduced in the early 1960s, and is still actively used today. It supports recursion and structured programming. The language syntax is English-like and suited for describing complex data formats, with a wide set of functions available to verify and manipulate them.

=== Operating system 'wars' ===
When the PC was introduced, it needed an operating system. IBM approached a company named Digital Research, which was owned by Gary Kildall. IBM sought the use of Digital Research's CP/M, a popular operating system in earlier systems. (It was, in fact, the first operating system that wasn't hardware-specific.) IBM did not want to pay royalties, however, but sought a one time purchase, which included a rename. Digital Research refused, and IBM withdrew. They then approached Microsoft and Bill Gates, who purchased an existing operating system (Seattle Computer Company's 86-DOS) and renamed it MS-DOS. This name was later used on non-IBM models; Microsoft agreed to IBM's desire to use their own name, and the operating system was sold as PC-DOS on the PC.

86-DOS was modeled after CP/M, and Digital Research filed legal action for patent infringement. IBM settled by offering computer buyers a choice of either; however, CP/M-86 (as the PC version was named) cost almost $200 more than PC-DOS, and it did not sell well.

MS/PC-DOS quickly became the standard for the PC-compatible market. Digital Research would attempt to regain the market, eventually settling on an MS-DOS clone, DR-DOS. DR DOS was sold off the shelf (while MS/PC-DOS was only sold bundled with new computers), and would later gain a large market share with version 5, which had new memory management that broke down an early limitiation of DOS, a maximum usable memory of 640 kB.

By this time, Microsoft was holding the market not only with MS-DOS, but Microsoft Windows, a graphical shell program for DOS. Windows was based on the Macintosh, and Apple filed suit. Complicating the matter was a suit against Apple by Xerox, claiming that ''Xerox'' was the rightful owner of the design. Eventually, it was ruled that the design factors in question could not be copyrighted, and Macintosh and Windows continued to coexist.

In 1995, Windows was re-worked to be a self contained operating system, Windows 95. By this time, DR-DOS had been sold twice, becoming Novell DOS 7, then Caldera DR-DOS 7. IBM had also split from Microsoft and was developing PC-DOS 6 separately. The new version of Windows that didn't coexist with DOS was ultimately the focus of an anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft. Despite this, Microsoft was able to continue developing Windows.

Today, the market is dominated by the IBM PC-compatible computer, the majority of which run Microsoft Windows. Also present is an up-and-coming system, Linux, which is an [[open source]] system based on UNIX (an alternate PC-compatible system dating to the late 1970s; it was more complex and used for industrial, rather than home, use). On a separate platform, the Apple Macintosh also exists, running the newest Apple operating system, Mac OS X.

== Early Innovations ==
=== The Vacuum Tube ===
The vacuum tube, also known as a valve because it controls electron flow the way a washer valve controls water direction, was originally developed to amplify radio signals. Its use as a logic gate, which practical, required massive power consumption and a steady supply of replacements.

Tubes were not meant to be turned on and off rapidly, thus they would burn out regularly on computers but can last decades on stereo and musical instrument amplifiers.

Vaccum tubes need a lot of electricity and also produce a lot of heat so they need plenty of ventilation or air conditioning.

=== The Transistor ===
[[wikipedia:William_Shockley|Shockley]], Bardeen and Brattain's invention of the [[wikipedia:bipolar_junction_transistor|junction transistor]] resolved the vacuum tube limitations and in the process started the shrinking of computers.

The transistor is a solid-state logic gate switch: it does not need to heat a filament nor make a change in physical contacts to cause a change in electron flow. Its centerpiece is a semiconductor, a solid material that can be a conductor or resistor depending on the adulteration of the substrate.

The original substrate for transistors was germanium. The move to silicon, one of the most readily available chemicals on Earth, made transistors cheap to manufacture and eventually made computers ubiquitous.

=== The Integrated Circuit ===

There are several types of transistors which combine to make full logic circuits.

=== The Microchip ===
Vaccum tubes were replaced by the transistors and a number of 1000 transistor were replaced by 1 microchip.
Thus microchip were discovered.

== The Early Microcomputer ==
=== Altair ===

The MITS Altair 8800 was designed around a new microprocessor, the Intel 8080, and debuted in 1975. Its announcement on the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine led the Albuquerque-based manufacturer to a four-month backlog attempting to fill orders.

The Altair is considered the first home computer. Its only input was a series of front-panel switches. However, it had a motherboard with a bus, which allowed other companies to provide keyboards, tape readers and other devices to access the registers.

A group of Harvard students wrote a BASIC interpreter for the MITS. These students -- Steve Ballmer, Paul Allen, and Bill Gates -- left school to focus on code development and not long afterward created MicroSoft.

=== Apple II ===
The Apple II was produced by Apple Computer. It used a BASIC-type operating system and was marketed toward home use.

==== Commodore 64 ====
The Commodore 64 was a revolution at the time it was released in 1981, expanding on the Vic 20's 8 colors to an amazing 16 colors and increasing the screen resolution to 40 columns and 25 lines. A 3 voice synthesizer topped off the features of this amazing computer.

In its time. the Commodore 64 was one of the most popular home computers in the market with thousands of games and business applications available. (''I still have a copy of Microsoft Multiplan for the C64'')

Its built-in BASIC and a plethora of magazines (''ZZap64'', ''Commodore'') with programs for readers to enter, enabled many people to learn BASIC and even Machine Code.

In 1986, the C64C was introduced, its changes (a lighter colored case and a different shape) were mainly cosmetic but still compatible with all previous add-ons and software.

Another version of the C64 was the SX-64. This was a &quot;portable&quot; version of the Commodore 64. I use the term portable very loosely, this thing was ''heavy''. It contained a 5-inch color Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor and a built-in disk drive. The keyboard doubled as the lid of the unit.

Commodore64 was a must for its time.

This computer offered:
:* An amazing 64K of RAM
:* Built-in BASIC
:* Built-in TV adapter
:* A cartridge expansion port
:* 3-channel audio (via the SID chip)
:* 2 x D 9-pin input ports
:* Serial port
:* Optional external floppy drive (the 1541)
:* Optional tape drive (normally supplied with the computer)

=== Amiga ===

The Amiga microcomputer, compared to other computers of its age, was much more advanced in the areas of graphical processing, display, and manipulation. At the release of the original Amiga computer, the Amiga 1000, it was the only machine capable of displaying 12 bit color, using a format known as HAM-12, or Hold And Modify-12. This made it the only machine, for several years, to have as many as 4096 colors on screen at a time. The machine was replaced by the Amiga 500, a slightly enhanced and stripped down version of the Amiga 1000, with some of the same capabilities, as well as some different expansion ports. After the Amiga 500, the Amiga 2000, 3000, 600, 4000 and 1200 machines were released, each having minor enhancements over the previous. Currently, the Amiga corporation has handed off development of a new model, titled the Amiga One, to a separate company. This new machine would support speeds of up to 800 MHz, as opposed to the Amiga 4000, which had a top speed of 60 MHz, not counting the PPC enhancements which were released near the end of the Amiga 4000 lifecycle, which did not do well, due to lack of support from programming companies.

=== Atari ===
=== IBM ===
The IBM PC was a personal computer built around the Intel 8088 microprocessor (which was modeled after the Intel 8086). It became standardized, and today, the majority of personal computers are IBM compatible.

=== Apple Lisa &amp; Macintosh ===
Apple Computer followed the Apple II with the Apple Lisa, and after that, the Apple Macintosh. These computers were unique due to their graphical user interface (GUI), introducing the concept of icons, windows, pull down menus, and mice. (The GUI concept was actually taken from Xerox, via two of their computers, the Xerox Star and Xerox Alto).

== Character Links ==

Would adding appropriately formatted links to the page add value to the final product?

Idea: Include links to wikis that explain the character's idea and history.  When reading the chart some characters seem unfamiliar.  It would be helpful to see what the character is.

I'd be willing to put significant time into this if a proper formatting suggestion could be made.

Simply adding a hyperlink adds the link symbol after the character and changes the color to blue.

There should be a note telling about the link but the color should probably stay black for ease of reading.

Any suggestions or ideas?

: Books should be self contained. External links should be used sparingly at Wikibooks, and not used as a substitute for missing material. If you think understanding the history of each character would benefit people wanting to learn Unicode, any links should be for new pages to be added to the book where the history for each character can be provided. Otherwise I suggest you find a website that already provides the history for all characters and include just one link under [[Unicode#Links]] to where the history for all characters can easily be found. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:25, 20 January 2011 (UTC)

'''NetBeans IDE
An Introduction to NetBeans'''

Most developers recognize NetBeans as the original free Java IDE. It is that, and so much more. The NetBeans IDE provides support for several languages (C, C++, JavaScript, etc.) and frameworks. NetBeans is an open-source project dedicated to providing rock solid software development products (such as NetBeans IDE and NetBeans Platform) that address the needs of developers, users and the businesses who rely on NetBeans as a basis for their products. The NetBeans project is also a vibrant community where people from just about any country you can think of, have the ability to ask questions, give advice, make a wide variety of contributions and ultimately share in the success of our products. On our mailing list, you will find posts from students, developers from top companies, and individuals looking to sharpen their skills.
 
The startup screen of the NetBeans IDE
 
The NetBeans IDE
In June 2000 NetBeans was made open source by Sun Microsystems, which remains the project sponsor. Please see our History section for a more detailed information.
The two base products are NetBeans IDE and NetBeans Platform. Both products are free for commercial and non-commercial use. The source code to both is available to anyone to reuse as they see fit within the terms of use. The legal section contains all information regarding licensings, copyright issues, privacy policy and terms of use. Complete product information can be found under in the Products section.
The NetBeans community is healthy and growing thanks to the individuals, companies and complementing products (see the Partners page) that are making NetBeans a success. If you want to join, you may register for free.
With over 18 million downloads of the NetBeans IDE to date, and over 500,000 developers participating, the netbeans.org project is thriving. Each month visitors from over 130 identifiable countries use and contribute to NetBeans.
In Press Center you can find and review NetBeans press releases and articles where NetBeans' name has appeared in the media. If we have missed something let us know and we will add it to our news section.
Vision Statement of the NetBeans Open Source Project
A look back

Let's look a little into the past. NetBeans started as a Java IDE. At the beginning it was like every other IDE with an editor, GUI designer, debugger, etc. The IDE was written in Java and it ran on any platform. The people writing it were developing NetBeans using NetBeans (they still are). After a while the IDE began to evolve in some interesting ways: 
Open APIs were introduced to make the IDE extensible. The team developing it grew. NetBeans was open sourced. Developers began to use various tools to manage the code. In each case, it proved worthwhile to integrate the tools used to develop the IDE into the IDE itself. The result is that NetBeans contains things like version control support, building using ANT, Javadoc search and generation and more. 
Each new integration showed the strengths and weaknesses of the APIs. As a result, the APIs were evolved to be increasingly generic, to accommodate the maximum number of use cases, while making the minimum assumptions about those use cases. More and more the developers worked to make NetBeans not just a Java IDE, but a platform for tools no matter what language or technology was being used. NetBeans became more of a platform, integrating a huge variety of tools into a seamless environment, enhancing, not compromising, the usefulness of those tools by themselves. 
This turned out to be even more valuable than it seemed. For example, when you integrate a debugger from one place, source control system from another, and a code browser from a third into the same environment, you end up with something greater than the sum of its parts. And so the concept of a &quot;tools platform&quot; was born. 
IDEs and Platform

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. Integration in old-fashioned, monolithic IDEs meant a set of tools are available as part of a single program. Yet development today needs more than this kind of integration. A better meaning for integration can be had by looking at the modern software development process. Applications and application development 
•	Are multiplatform and distributed - various OS's, servers, workstations, handheld devices, etc.
•	Are multi-language - Java, HTML, C/C++, Perl, Python, etc.
•	Use various technologies and standards - databases, XML, Servlets, JSP, UML, ...
•	Go through many stages - such as design, modelling, implementation, documentation, deployment and support.
•	Are developed in a variety of styles - from individuals, to small teams, to large distributed teams, to open source.
A really good, useful IDE should work with the tools used by people playing different roles in a project, integrate them and make them available as a part of one environment. An IDE should cover all aspects of the application and stages of the development cycle, and which can be used by all members of the development team. 
Providing tools for all the aspects of development, and integrating them in the deeper sense of the word is not an easy task. Therefore, our goal is to create a Platform which achieves these goals, and let everyone add their own tools to it. We know that there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; IDE - so it is better to empower developers and teams to customize the IDE to meet their unique needs. 
Where we are going
We must ensure the NetBeans Platform is solid, stable, performant and backward compatible, since it is the foundation of other projects. At the same time we have to work toward maximum extensibility and the most generic and flexible framework possible. We will continue to develop and release NetBeans IDE and focus on making it a powerful and popular IDE for developing in Java and other languages.
We will improve NetBeans simultaneously in all areas in an iterative way. There will be times when the above goals contradict each other, e.g. purity of the APIs vs. backward compatibility vs. performance vs. genericity - these are not always compatible. Especially in such cases the community should determine the right course of action in broad discussion, preserving backward compatibility where possible, and providing workarounds to keep existing integrations effective.
We will to encourage use of NetBeans IDE for development with any language or technology. Addition of support for new languages and technologies will continue.
We will continue to make the sources public under a very liberal license which will allow both individuals and companies to benefit from participating in the project. By providing a safety blanket - the source code is always available, and the license does not prohibit modifications to it - those who integrate with it can feel comfortable because they are not at risk of vendor lock-in.
We will continue to grow the NetBeans community We believe that it is not possible to achieve these goals without a thriving community. NetBeans is developed as an open source project. We believe that this development model is ideal for building such a platform. Every piece of information, every special case, every experience integrating something new reveals new paths and new possibilities. Community-based, public development allows everyone to benefit from each other's experiences. Something that develops from this process is &quot;institutional memory&quot;. We need to learn from our experiences, and incorporate the lessons learned into what we do next. Community makes that happen.

Using NetBeans
Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing applications saves you time by managing windows, settings, and data. In addition, an IDE can store repetitive tasks through macros and abbreviations. Drag-and-drop features make creating graphical user interface (GUI) components or accessing databases easy, and highlighted code and debugging features alert you to errors in your code.
The NetBeans IDE is open source and is written in the Java programming language. It provides the services common to creating desktop applications -- such as window and menu management, settings storage -- and is also the first IDE to fully support JDK 6.0 features. The NetBeans platform and IDE are free for commercial and noncommercial use, and they are supported by Sun Microsystems.
This tutorial is aimed at those who are new to using IDEs, fairly new to programming, and new to the Java platform. You'll learn to create a simple desktop application with a GUI interface and functionality that calculates overtime pay using basic features of the NetBeans IDE. This tutorial provides explanations for the code where appropriate, as well as links to the Java API and information about objects as they are introduced. Though the NetBeans environment also provides many rich features for the various Java platforms, such as Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME), this article covers only Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) technology, which is generally the entry point for new developers and programmers. Future tutorials will discuss more advanced features.
To follow this tutorial, you need to have downloaded and installed the JDK and the NetBeans IDE. Or you can download JDK 6 and NetBeans 6.1 separately to ensure that you have the latest versions.
NetBeans IDE Nuts and Bolts
 
Because the NetBeans IDE is open source is undergoing continual improvement, you may notice slight differences between the screen captures in this article and the latest download. This tutorial is based on NetBeans 6.1 and may vary slightly from later versions as they become available.

The NetBeans IDE also provides full-featured refactoring tools, which allow you to rename and move classes, fields, and methods, as well as change method parameters. In addition, you get a debugger and an Ant-based project system.
Getting Familiar With NetBeans
 
To get started, download the latest stable version from the NetBeans.org web site and install it on whatever platform you use for programming and development. The NetBeans.org web site lists the computer requirements needed to run the IDE.
NetBeans can automatically upgrade its core and extension modules over the Internet, and it has a module that runs periodically on your behalf to check for updates to the version of NetBeans you're using. In addition, the Update Center can update and install any modules you okay or request.
When you start the application, you should get a welcome screen similar to Figure 1.
You'll notice that this welcome screen makes getting started right away an easy process by displaying a Quick Start Guide up front, as well as the options to begin a project or open one. In addition, you can select the Sample Project for a quick example of how code is set up in this IDE. NetBeans is fairly intuitive to use, especially if you've used IDE software in the past.
You'll get familiar with three concepts right away: projects, nodes, and workspaces.
Within NetBeans, you work within the context of a project, which consists of an organized group of source files and associated metadata; project-specific properties files; an Ant build script and run settings; and all the tools you'll need to write, compile, test, and debug your application. You can create a main project with subprojects, and you can link projects through dependencies. So getting started is as easy as giving your project a name.
 
Figure 1. Welcome Screen

Once you tell NetBeans the name of a new project, it then:
•	Creates a source tree with an optional skeleton class inside
•	Creates a folder for unit tests
•	Sets classpaths for compiling, running, and testing
•	Sets the Java platform the project is to run on
•	Creates an Ant build script (build.xml), which contains instructions that the IDE uses when you perform commands on your project, such as compile or run
Click File from the main menu and select New Project. The New Project wizard pops up and looks similar to Figure 2.
 
Figure 2. New Project Wizard

 

 
Figure 3. Files Window
From there, you can choose the type of application you want to create by selecting a category such as Java, Web, or Enterprise. Notice that within the Java category, you can create a project containing an empty application. Choose Java and select Java Application. Next, name the project and select a location within your file system. Note that the IDE automatically creates a main class for your application if you want it to. Click Finish.
The Projects window displays only the files that are likely to be regularly edited, such as source files and tests. To see more details about your project, click on the Files tab. The Files tab shows a directory-based view of your project, as shown in Figure 3 above. If you click on the project folder you created, you'll see that the folder contains the Ant script and properties files that control how your project is built and run:
•	nbproject/build-impl.xml -- Contains the instructions for handling your project. The IDE generates this file, which you should not edit.
•	build.xml -- Imports targets from build-impl.xml. You can edit this file to override existing targets or create new targets.
Tip: 
Many menu commands such as Run and Build have keyboard shortcuts to the main project. You can also access all commands for individual projects by right-clicking their project nodes in the Projects window.
The Files folder also contains the output folder for compiled classes, JAR files (for Java SE projects) or WAR files (for web projects), and Javadoc. This displays as a build folder after you compile the application.
NetBeans allows you to see all your objects in a project represented as nodes of a tree, each having its own icon to represent the type of object the node represents. Within the Files tab, you can easily view the trees and representative nodes. If you double-click on a node, it opens up into a subtree that contains more detail. You can collapse or expand trees as necessary. Right-clicking on any node provides easy access to specific functions that you can perform and tools that you can use on that object. Expand the subtrees of the project node that you just created, and you will notice that the fields, constructors, methods, and bean patterns appear as node branches.
The Services window lists various facilities available to your project, such as servers, databases, enterprise beans, and web services. In addition, you can see what operations have been performed and troubleshoot some types of runtime errors, such as when a remote method invocation (RMI) connection is causing a problem. You'll get more familiar with this window after you have written, compiled, run, tested and debugged your applications.
 
Figure 4. Source Editor
 
Return to the Projects window. Notice the file system that has been created. Files and directories associated with an application project are organized in a logical fashion. Double-clicking a source file automatically opens the file in the workspace to the right, bringing up the appropriate Source Editor.
Double-click the Main.java source file to see the Source Editor similar to the one in Figure 4.
When your application is organized into several projects, the main project serves as the entry point to the application. Usually, the main project contains the main class that starts the application. To make a project the main project, right-click the project's node in the Projects window and choose Set Main Project.
Using the Source Editor
 
You can click right into the Source Editor and write code. When you write code this way, you'll notice that the editor automatically highlights code in color as appropriate and provides suggestions for code-completion as you type.
You can customize colors in the highlighting by going to Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences on a Mac) &gt; Fonts and Colors.
Code completion finishes package names, classes, interfaces, and common methods. As handy as code completion can be, you may sometimes not want it. You can easily turn off this feature by pressing Esc. Or you can deactivate it more permanently by going to Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences on a Mac) &gt; Editor &gt; General, and under Code Completion, deselecting the Auto Popup Completion Window checkbox.
You can also save time by assigning abbreviations that the Source Editor expands for you. To set abbreviations, go to Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences on a Mac) &gt; Editor &gt; Code Templates. Type the first few letters of an abbreviation and press the spacebar. The Source Editor then expands the abbreviation.
Turn on line numbering easily by right-clicking in the Source Editor's left sidebar and selecting Show Line Numbers.
When programming in Java, you can add to your source code by making use of commonly-used code templates. Press Ctrl-I in the Source Editor to view the Insert Code pop-up menu. Add properties to classes, create constructors, generate accessor methods, and override methods from superclasses. When adding properties, the IDE provides you with a dialog as in Figure 5.
For more information on editing features in the IDE, see Java Editing Enhancements in NetBeans IDE 6.0
 
Figure 5. Add Property Dialog
 

Refactoring
 
The refactoring tool goes to work and makes all the necessary changes based on your single entry. Refactoring is the restructuring of code, using small transformations, where the result does not change any program behavior. Just as you factor an expression to make it easier to understand or modify, you refactor code to make it easier to read, simpler to understand, and faster to update. A refactored expression must produce the same result, and the refactored program must be functionally equivalent with the original source.
Some common reasons for refactoring code include the following:
•	To make the code easier to change or easier to add a new feature
•	To reduce complexity for better understanding
•	To remove unnecessary repetition
•	To enable use of the code for other needs or more general needs
NetBeans provides the following features for refactoring:
•	Finds where classes, variables, and methods are used throughout the source code in your project.
•	Enables you to move a class to another package or into another class and enables you to move a static field or a static method from one class to another. In addition, it updates all source code in your project to reference the element in its new location.
•	Enables you to change the name of a class, variable, or method to something more meaningful. In addition, it updates all source code in your project to reference the element by its new name.
•	Generates a getter method and a setter method for a field and optionally updates all referencing code to access the field using the getter and setter methods.
•	Enables you to add parameters to a method and change the access modifier.
•	Enables you to roll back all the changes in all the files that were affected by the refactoring.
To view the Refactor menu, right-click and choose Refactor from an item in the Projects window, or right-click and choose Refactor of an opened file in the Source Editor.
Debugging
 
Within the NetBeans IDE, you can debug by setting breakpoints and watches in your code, then running your application in the debugger. You can execute your code one line at a time and examine the state of your application in order to discover any problems. When you start a debugging session, all of the relevant debugger windows appear automatically at the bottom of your screen. You can debug an entire project, any executable class, and any JUnit tests. The IDE also lets you debug applications that are running on a remote machine by attaching the debugger to the application process.
A breakpoint is a flag in the source code that tells the debugger to stop execution of the program. When your program stops on a breakpoint, you can perform actions like examining the value of variables and single-stepping through your program. The Source Editor indicates a breakpoint by highlighting the line in red and placing an annotation in the left margin.
Except for line breakpoints, all Java breakpoints are defined globally for all IDE projects. For example, if you set a breakpoint on a class, the IDE will stop execution every time it encounters that class during a debugging session regardless of what project you are debugging.
To set a line breakpoint, click on the left margin of the line in the Source Editor. Figure 6 shows two breakpoints; a line breakpoint is denoted by a red square, and a field breakpoint is displayed as a triangle.
 
Figure 6. Breakpoints in Source Editor
You can customize a breakpoint by right-clicking on the breakpoint icon and choosing Breakpoint &gt; Customize. The Customizer dialog enables you to set conditions and actions on the breakpoint. You can set other types of breakpoints as well, such as the following:
•	Method -- Program execution stops every time the method is executed.
•	Exception -- You can break whenever a specific exception is caught, whenever a specific exception is not handled in the source code or whenever any exception is encountered regardless of whether the program handles the exception or not.
•	Variable -- You can stop execution of your program whenever a variable in a specific class is accessed (for example, the method was called with the variable as an argument) or modified.
•	Thread -- You can break program execution whenever a thread starts, stops, or both.
•	Class -- You can break when the class is loaded into the virtual machine, unloaded from the virtual machine, or both.
To run the debugger tool, click the Debug Main Project icon (  ) in the main tool bar, or choose Run &gt; Debug Main Project from the main menu. For a quick demonstration of the debugger tool in action, see Demo of JDK Debugging.
Importing Existing Java Source Code Into NetBeans
 
You can use two project templates to import your existing source code:
•	Java Project With Existing Sources -- Use this project template to create a standard Java project. A standard Java project uses the IDE to compile, run, and debug your application.
•	Java Free-From Project -- Use this project template if you want to use your own Ant script to compile, run, and debug your application.
The following steps cover use of the first template to create a standard Java project without the use of existing Ant scripts.
1.	Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N).
2.	Choose Java &gt; Java Project With Existing Sources.
3.	Click Next.
4.	In the Project Name field, type a name for your project. Notice that the IDE automatically suggests a name for the project folder.
5.	Click the Browse button next to the Project Folder field and create a folder somewhere on your system for your NetBeans projects. Then select the newly created NetBeans projects folder. Be sure to select the Set as Main Project box, then click Next.
6.	In the Existing Sources pane, click Add Folder, navigate to the directory of source files, and select the resources and src folders.
7.	(Optional) In the Test Packages Folder pane, click Browse to select the folder containing the JUnit package folders.
8.	Click Finish.
Your project will now be displayed in the Projects and Files windows.	Managing the Classpath 
NetBeans automatically adds everything on your project's compilation classpath to the project's runtime classpath. To manage a project's classpath:
1.	In the Projects window, right-click the project's node and choose Properties.
2.	In the Project Properties dialog box, click the Libraries node in the left pane.
3.	Select the Compile tab in the dialog box's right pane.
4.	Add the necessary elements to the project's compilation classpath by clicking the appropriate button. You can add any of the following: 
o	Project. The JAR file or WAR file produced by another project, as well as the associated source files and Javadoc documentation
o	Library. A collection of JAR files or folders with compiled classes, which can optionally have associated source files and Javadoc documentation
o	JAR file. A JAR file somewhere on your system

 
Creating, Compiling, and Running an Application
 
Now that you're familiar with the nuts and bolts of the NetBeans IDE, the next sections will step you through creating, compiling, and running an application that uses a simple GUI interface with some background functionality that calculates the rate of regular and overtime pay.
 
Figure 7. Pay Calculator application
Your finished application will look something like Figure 7.
In creating this application, you will learn how to:
•	Use the Form Editor
•	Use the Source Editor
•	Use the Palette, Inspector, and Properties features
•	Add event handlers
•	Compile and run your application
Though you can do a great deal through wizards, forms, and drag-and-drop features, you still need to write some lines of code for the functionality of the application. The following sections explain some of these lines of code.
Creating the Pay Calculator Application
 
Start by creating a new project for the application.
1.	Click File from the main menu and select New Project. The Project wizard starts.
2.	Select Java in the Categories pane and select Java Application in the Projects pane, as shown in Figure 2 above. Click Next.
3.	In the next window, you can leave the suggested project name or specify another name. Choose a Location and Folder for this application. Deselect the Create Main Class box.
4.	Click Finish. The IDE creates the new project and displays it in the Projects and Files windows.
To begin creating the GUI, you are going to start the Form Editor by creating a top container for your application using a specific form. The Java API provides GUI components, often referred to as Swing, and provides three useful top-level container classes: JFrame, JDialog, and JApplet. Every GUI component must be part of a containment hierarchy. A containment hierarchy is a tree of components that has a top-level container as its root. Each GUI component can be contained only once. If a component is already in a container and you try to add it to another container, the component will be removed from the first container and added to the second. Each top-level container has a content pane that, generally speaking, contains (directly or indirectly) the visible components in that top-level container's GUI. You have the option to add a menu bar to a top-level container.
Start by using the File wizard to create a JFrame component.
1.	From the File menu select New File. The File wizard displays.
2.	From Categories select Swing GUI Forms. Notice the File Types that appear to the right. For this application, you will use a JFrame Form. Select JFrame Form, then click Next.
3.	Name the JFrame SamplesJFrame, and click Finish.
To see what the wizard has created, click on the Files tab and expand the nodes listed under the new project. Double-click SamplesJFrame to view the file in the Source Editor on the right.
Above the Source Editor, you should see two buttons that allow you to toggle between the Design view, which gives you a visual view of your application, and Source view, which allows you to work with the raw code. In other words, you can switch from the GUI drag-and-drop editor to the code editor. Each editor gives you slightly different options in the tool bar, as shown in Figures 8 and 9.
 
Figure 8. GUI Design Editor tool bar
 

 
Figure 9. Source Editor tool bar
 
Click into the Source view to see the code that has been generated for the class. Then click back into the Design view to use the Design Editor. You can now begin the process of building the GUI interface.
You started this application with the JFrame container. Now you can easily add other components to it by selecting a component from the Palette and placing it in the Design Editor. Changing component properties is just as easy.
 
Figure 10. NetBeans IDE Work Environment
From this editor, you will add and edit components by using three panes that are docked at the sides of the IDE (see Figure 10 above):
•	Palette -- Contains JFC/Swing, AWT, layout managers, and JavaBeans components.
•	Inspector -- Displays a tree hierarchy of all components contained in the currently selected file, including visual components and containers, such as buttons, labels, menus, and panels. It can also include nonvisual components, such as timers and data sources.
•	Properties -- Displays the properties of the component currently selected in the Inspector, Editor, Projects, or Files windows. You can also right-click a component to pop up a properties box for that component.
As you use components from the Palette, NetBeans automatically generates code, instantiating those objects. If you change the components' properties by using the Properties pane, that code is also generated. You'll notice as you look at the Source Editor that this generated code appears as blue guarded blocks. It is recommended that you not change this code. However, you can modify the way initialization code is generated and even write custom code to be placed within the initialization code. For this tutorial, do not change the generated code.
So far, you have created a project and a JFrame class called SamplesJFrame. Next, you'll build on the JFrame component and add other components.
1.	Click on Tabbed Pane in the Palette, then click on the blank square in the design form. This creates a JTabbedPane. Notice that all the components you've created are listed in the Inspector window.
2.	Click on Panel in the Palette, then click inside the JTabbedPane in the editor (you may need to resize the JTabbedPane so it is larger. A JPanel is created. Note that a new tabbed pane has been added to JTabbedPane.
3.	Add another JPanel to the JTabbedPane in the Design Editor. Another tab appears. You can add as many tabs as you like, but this tutorial covers only two.
Your Inspector window should now look similar to Figure 11, and the components in your Design Editor should look like Figure 12 below.
 
Figure 11. Inspector Window
 

 
Figure 12. Design Editor displaying a Tabbed Pane
 
Click on any of the objects in the Inspector pane, and you'll see that the properties for each component appear in the Properties pane. In addition, you can right-click the components in the Inspector window and select Properties from the menu to make the Properties window display.
To change the text for each tab, click on the corresponding JPanel in the Inspector window. For instance, click on jPane11 to select it. Next, go to the Properties window on the right and scroll down until you see the Tab Title listed. Click on the ellipsis button (...) at the right, and a window pops up that allows you to replace the current text. Type in Pay Calculator and click OK. Notice that the text instantly appears in the Design view on the tab. Now change the text for jPanel2; select it in the Inspector window, then in the Properties window enter Images in the Tab Title field.
To see the code generated for your application so far, click on Source in the tool bar above the Editor, as shown in Figure 9 above. The Source Editor reveals guarded code, which by default is shaded in grey background, as well as code that you can add to or change. As you examine the code, you may notice that you can collapse or expand segments of code as you add to this file.
 
Figure 13. Guarded Generated Code
 
You may have observed that a layout manager also has been added just beneath each JPanel you added. You can easily change the layout manager for components from the Inspector. For example, right-click on jPanel1, and note the options listed from Set Layout. The IDE's GUI builder, named Matisse, uses the Free Design layout manager by default. This layout manager uses simple layout rules that are easy to work with.
What's a Layout Manager?

A layout manager is an object that implements the LayoutManager interface and determines the size and position of the components within a container. Although components can provide size and alignment hints, a container's layout manager has the final say on the size and position of the components within the container. See A Visual Guide to Layout Managers. 

Return to the Design view, and you should now have an application that reveals two tabs with the titles that you input in the Properties box for the JPanel objects. If necessary, resize the jTabbedPanel so that it fills the entire JFrame that contains it.
For this application, you'll need to add eight labels, two text fields, and a button. The labels contain information for what the user should enter and for what will appear when the user clicks the button. The text fields are editable for user input. The components need to be arranged on this panel in a way that makes sense. While the usual layout managers are available to you, the Free Design layout is ideal for this scenario. This layout manager allows you to arrange components in a number of ways, and the Matisse GUI builder makes this really easy to do.
To begin adding the components to the first jPanel, select jPanel1 in the Inspector or click on the Pay Calculator tab in the Design Editor, then do the following:
In the Palette, click on Label, then click inside the jPanel1 area in the Design Editor. This adds a JLabel to the form.
Repeat this procedure seven more times, so there are eight new labels in total. Don't worry about where the components appear in the workspace for now or what variable names they've been given. You are going to work on those in a moment.
Click on Text Field in the Palette, then click inside the jPanel1 area in the Design Editor. Do this again, so there are two JTextFields in total.
Add a JButton to the form by selecting Button in the Palette, then clicking inside the jPanel1 area in the Design Editor.
Once you've added the components, you'll need to rename them, change the default text that each displays, and arrange them on the panel. You can change the default text for components by either double-clicking on the component directly in the Design Editor, or right-clicking a component in either the Design Editor or the Inspector, and choosing Edit Text.
Change the default text for the following components:
Variable	Text
jLabel1	Hours Worked:
jLabel2	Rate/ Hour ($):
jLabel3	Regular Pay:
jLabel4	Overtime Pay:
jLabel5	Total:
jButton1	Compute

To rename a component, right-click it in either the Design Editor or the Inspector and choose Change Variable Name. Change names for the following components:
Variable	Text
jLabel6	**********
jLabel7	**********
jLabel8	**********
jTextField1	[blank]
jTextField2	[blank]
 

 
Figure 14. Design Editor Displaying Renamed Components
 
In order to arrange the components the way you want, simply drag the components to their positions in the Editor. Make use of the guidelines that display to align components vertically and horizontally. You can also resize components manually by clicking on their edges or corners. Arrange your components so that they appear similar to Figure 14.
To edit a component's properties, first select that property, either in the Editor or in the Inspector window. That component's properties automatically appear in the Properties pane. Scroll through the items, changing the text, changing the background or foreground colors as you like, setting column width, and changing any other properties you feel appropriate. Experiment with various properties, changing back to the default whenever you need to.
Because the user will enter information into the two text fields, it would be better to give those objects variable names that reflect the information being entered. Go to the Inspector window, right-click on the first JTextField object and select Change Variable Name. Type in the name hoursWorked. Then rename the second JTextField object rate.
Checking Your GUI
 
When writing code in a simple text editor, you would have to compile the code frequently to see what your GUI looks like. NetBeans has a preview feature that allows you to see how your application looks with a simple click of the Preview Design (  ) located in the Design Editor tool bar, as shown in Figure 8. Click the Test Form button, and a test application pops up, showing your creation. You can see from this test whether you need to readjust any of the objects in the Design Editor.
If you would like to compile and run the application, that is also a simple process. You can make use of the icons displayed in the IDE's main tool bar; click Build (  ) to compile the application, and Run (  ) to run it. Note that you can also build and run an application using the options in the Build and Run menus from the IDE's main menu.
Compile your application now. Notice the output that displays in the Output window at the bottom of the IDE. Once the build is complete, you can try running the application. The application will run and pop up on the screen. A quick way to build is to press F11. You can also press F6 to run the application.
Adding Menus and Images
 
So far, this application is a simple GUI and no more. It doesn't yet have functionality. You will add an event handler for the button soon, but first create a top menu for the application.
Though menus are often one of the first objects created in an application, you're creating the menuing system now to demonstrate how easy it is to move around within your application, creating in whatever order you need, without messing up code. This is one of the big advantages of the Inspector window: the way you can click on any object within your application, add to it, or move around within it.
In the Inspector pane, right-click the JFrame listed and choose Add From Palette &gt; Swing Menus &gt; Menu Bar. This adds a JMenuBar.
Expand the JMenuBar that has been added to the Inspector window and notice that two JMenu objects have been added by default. In the Design Editor, note that the text of the two JMenu items is File and Edit, respectively. While you can use the Properties window to change the values of all properties of a given object, you can often change text directly in the Design Editor. Change the text of the second menu item from Edit to Help. You can do so by double-clicking directly on the text in the editor.
In the Inspector, right-click jMenu1 and choose Add From Palette &gt; Menu Item. This creates a JMenuItem.
Rename the component to OpenItem. You can do so by right-clicking the component either in the Design Editor or the Inspector and choosing Change Variable Name. If for any reason you have difficulty viewing the menu item in the Design Editor, you can double-click on jMenuBar1 in the Inspector, then click on the first jMenu component (i.e., with File text).
Change the default text for OpenItem to Open. Right-click on the item in the Inspector and choose Edit Text. Otherwise, simply double-click on the default text in the Design Editor and type in Open.
Create another menu item by following the previous three steps. Change the component name to ExitItem, and change the default text to Exit.
In the Inspector, double-click on JFrame, then click on jMenuBar1. Your menu bar should now look like the one in Figure 15.
The last item to complete in the GUI portion of this application is the Images pane (see Figure 17), so that you learn how to add images easily. One way to display images is by decorating Swing components, such as labels, buttons, and tabbed panes, with an icon -- a fixed-sized picture. An icon is an object that adheres to the Icon interface. Swing provides a particularly useful implementation of the Icon interface: ImageIcon, which paints an icon from a GIF, JPEG, or (as of version 1.3) PNG image.
 
Figure 15. Menu Bar
 
To add an image to the Images panel in your GUI, you can use a JLabel, and change the icon property of that object to display the image.
Click on the JPanel object for the Images tab in the Inspector (or click on the Images tab in the Design Editor).
Add a JLabel to the Images panel by clicking on Label in the Palette, then clicking inside the Images JPanel area in the Design Editor.
Download this sample image and save it to a location on your computer.
In the Properties window, click the ellipsis button (...) for the icon property. A dialog displays, allowing you to locate and set the image to the property.
Make sure Image chooser is selected in the top drop-down box, then select the External Image option. Click the ellipsis button next to the File or URL field and navigate to the image you saved on your computer. You should see an image appear in the preview pane at the bottom of the dialog (Figure 16). Click OK.
In the Design Editor, click on the JLabel's default text that now appears next to the image. Delete it.


 
Figure 16. Inspector window
Click here for a larger image.

 

 
Figure 17. Images Pane
 
When you click on Preview Design (  ), your GUI should now look similar to Figure 17 above. To see the code that was generated when you added the JLabel and accompanying image, click into the Source view for SamplesJFrame.java, and you will see the following lines: 
jLabel9 = new javax.swing.JLabel();
...
jLabel9.setIcon(new javax.swing.ImageIcon(&quot;/Users/nbuser/Desktop/newjava.gif&quot;));
 

The first statement creates the JLabel, and the second creates a new ImageIcon object and attaches the image to it. It then sets the ImageIcon to the JLabel.
Adding Event Handlers
 
Now the GUI is complete, but the application still doesn't do anything. Next, you need to give it functionality.
Java technology programs rely on events that describe user actions. These events are represented by objects that a user initiates, such as text entered, a button pushed, or a mouse moved over a component. The component must listen for an event if you want to handle the event with an action, such as displaying text or writing to a database. Without an IDE, you'd have to follow these steps to create event handlers:
Decide which type of event is fired by a component and implement the right interface
Register the component as a listener for that type of event
Implement handler methods from the interface
 
Figure 18. How Events Work
 
When a user fires an event through a GUI component, a method call is made to any objects that have been registered with the component as listeners for the type of event that took place. An event listener is an object that is notified when an event occurs. Events generated from buttons and text fields need the class to implement the ActionListener interface. When implementing this interface, you must also implement a listener method.
NetBeans simplifies creating event handlers by creating much of the code for you. You need to know which interface you'll need to implement, and then you'll need to write the code for the logic that goes into the listener method.
Go to Design view and in the editor click the button you created, then right-click and choose Events &gt; Action &gt; Action Performed. You are then taken to the Source view and shown the following:
private void jButton1ActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {
// TODO add your handling code here:
}
 

Also, the following lines of code have been added to register the button with a listener:
jButton1.addActionListener(new java.awt.event.ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {
        jButton1ActionPerformed(evt);
    }
});
 

Because the user is entering the information into the text field, that data comes in as a String. You'll need to parse these strings into workable types, such as int or double. You'll then need to perform the calculations to determine how many hours are regular and how many are overtime. Once those amounts are determined, you can calculate regular pay and overtime pay, then total those two amounts. Lastly, you'll need to convert the numbers to dollar amounts.
The classes you'll need to be familiar with are Integer, Double, and NumberFormat.
A common need is to convert strings to numerical values. Once these are converted, you can manipulate that value like any other data primitive (for instance, an int, float, or double). The problem is that when you read from a file, get a command line argument, get an applet parameter, or just prompt for input from a text field on a form, you always start with a String object. Treating that String as a primitive requires an extra step, the conversion.
To convert a String you use a wrapper class. Every primitive has an associated wrapper class. These wrapper classes allow you to treat primitives as objects. In addition, these classes contain methods that permit manipulation of these objects, appropriate for the data type.
The following list shows the mapping from primitive type to wrapper class. In almost all cases, the wrapper class has the same name as the primitive data type, with the first letter capitalized:
byte - Byte
short - Short
int - Integer
long - Long
char - Character
float - Float
double - Double
boolean - Boolean
 

Each of these wrapper classes, except the Character class, has a method that allows you to convert from a String to the specific primitive type. Simply call the method from the appropriate wrapper class, and your String is converted to a primitive type:
String myString = &quot;12345&quot;;
int myInt = Integer.parseInt(myString);
 

This converts the contents of the String variable myString to an int named myInt. The conversion is that easy. The only trick is that the conversion for each data type involves a uniquely named method in each wrapper class. All conversions are done by similarly named methods, but still all the method names are different:
byte - Byte.parseByte(aString)
short - Short.parseShort(aString)
int - Integer.parseInt(aString)
long - Long.parseLong(aString)
float - Float.parseFloat(aString)
double - Double.parseDouble(aString)
boolean - Boolean.parseBoolean(aString); // the Boolean method is only available in Java 5+
 

There is one exception: The Character class has no such method, so you have to ask String for the character with the charAt() method:
// The variable e is the character e in the string Hello
String hello = &quot;Hello&quot;;
char e = hello.charAt(1);
 

If the String contents cannot be converted to the requested primitive type, then a NumberFormatException is thrown. This is a runtime exception, so the conversion code does not have to be in a try-catch block.
The NumberFormat class is used to print the numbers correctly. Printing numbers to the screen can produce some odd or undesired results. For instance:
public class PrintNum {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        double amount = 400000.00;
        System.out.println(&quot;She paid &quot; + amount + &quot; for the house.&quot;);
    }
}
 

results in:
She paid 400000.0 for the house.
 

You can control the display format and arrange input into the needed output format by using the NumberFormat abstract class in the java.text package. This class provides the interface to format and parse numbers, and it includes methods to determine which locales have number formats and what their names are.
The class has methods for three standard formats:
getInstance or getNumberInstance gets a format for the normal number format, such as 600,000.
getCurrencyInstance gets a format for the currency number format, such as $600,000.00.
getPercentInstance gets a format for displaying percentages, such as 56%.
To format a primitive, start by returning an object of type NumberFormat by calling on one of the above methods.
NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
 

To be certain the amount is formatting correctly for a specific country, you specify the locale this way:
NumberFormat nf = 
NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.US);
 

The result is:
She paid $400,000.00 for the house.
 

To compile these, you'll need to import the following packages and add them to the top of the file:
import java.text.NumberFormat;
import java.util.Locale;
 

Now, back to the application you are building: Add the following code to the jButton1ActionPerformed() event handler method. Read the comments in the code, which provide some explanation. If you are new to using if/else statements, read Java Programming Language Basics: if/else and switch statements, which is a part of the Java Technology Fundamentals newsletter.
//Gets how many hours worked from the text field, and then parses it to type int.
int hw = Integer.parseInt(hoursWorked.getText());

//Gets the pay rate entered in the text field, and parses it to type double.
double rateEntered = Double.parseDouble(rate.getText());

//Creates two variables of type double for later use.
double regularPay = 0;
double overTimePay = 0;

//Simple if statement for calculations
if (hw &gt; 40) {
    regularPay = 40 * rateEntered;
    overTimePay = (hw - 40) * 1.5 * rateEntered;
} else {
      regularPay = hw * rateEntered;
      overTimePay = 0.0;
}

//Creates a variable of both types of pay combined.
double total = regularPay + overTimePay;

//Creates variables for number formatting
NumberFormat nfRegular = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.US);
NumberFormat nfOverTime = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.US);
NumberFormat nfTotal = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale.US);

//Writes the totals in the correct format to the labels
regularPayField.setText(&quot; &quot; + nfRegular.format(regularPay));
overtimePayField.setText(&quot; &quot; + nfOverTime.format(overTimePay));
totalField.setText(&quot; &quot; + nfTotal.format(total));
 
 
After entering the above code, make sure to add imports for NumberFormat and Locale. You can do this by right-clicking in the Source Editor and choosing Fix Imports. A dialog displays (Figure 19), showing you the fully qualified class names that match the unrecognized classes used in the file.
Compile and run the application. Test it out by entering hours worked and pay rate. Your application should look similar to Figure 7 above.
 
Figure 19. Fix All Imports Dialog
 
You'll notice that the menus are still nonfunctional. You can follow the same procedure to add events to your menu items. In the Inspector, right-click ExitItem and choose Events &gt; Action &gt; actionPerformed. You'll be sent to the Source Editor, where you can see the following code:
private void ExitItemActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {
// TODO add your handling code here:
}
 

Type in the following code (changes in bold):
private void ExitItemActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {
// TODO add your handling code here:
    System.exit(1);
}
Select Clean and Build Project, then run your application, closing it with the Exit menu. Follow the same procedure for each menu item and any other objects that require functionality.
If there are any objects you don't want in your application, select the object in the Inspector. Right-click and select Delete. The item immediately disappears from the view. You can then Clean and Build (  ) the application, and run it to verify changes. Try this by deleting OpenItem. You'll see that cleanup is an easy process.
Documenting Your Work
 
Documenting your application is always a good idea, especially if many people are working on one project. This sample application is a bit small for a good demonstration of the Javadoc tool feature, but the following steps provide you with an idea of the kind of information that goes into the documentation and see how NetBeans does all the hard work for you.
Click into the Files window, then click your project node. Go to the Build Menu and select Generate Javadoc for JavaApplication (or whatever name you gave your project). The IDE generates the Javadoc in the dist &gt; javadoc folder, and you'll see output provided in the Output window. Then a browser window pops up with the documentation formatted in HTML. Click on SamplesJFrame, and scroll down to see the documentation. This application would not require much documentation, but if you continue building in this project or move on to other larger projects, Javadoc will come in handy.
Summary
 
You have completed a small desktop application and learned some of the basics of the NetBeans IDE. A big advantage of using the NetBeans IDE platform is that you won't outgrow it. As your development knowledge and skills build, you can delve into other technologies and platforms, such as web development, including EJB and web service applications, or mobile applications using the Java Micro Edition (Java ME) platform. In addition, NetBeans is extensible, meaning that many of the extensions, or modules, that work in NetBeans also work seamlessly within other products. The IDE evolves with your needs and experience, and you build on the experience you gain using a common IDE platform, rather than having to learn an entirely new toolset as your needs change.

I stumble over an instance variable, which is transient, but should be neither variable nor of different value across instances.

So what about those objects on the other side of the network. What values they have? Yes, I would probably check by my self, but I am not too much interesting in it... - Just a little ;)

==Business Intelligence System: Architecture and Infrastructure==

Why build a BI system one frame at a time?  This chapter will answer this question by first defining a frame as an information system.  The next section will discuss a few approaches to building BI systems.  After discussing other approaches the chapter explains the framework approach to build a BI system.  The next section notes that this approach is compatible with other approaches.  Finally, the chapter ends by demonstrating the benefits of the step-by-step approach to building a BI system offered by the framework.

==How do decision makers view the world?==

Herbert Simon wrote on the cognitive aspects of decision making.  For him a decision involves a rational choice selected from a number of alternatives towards the achievement of a goal.  Rational choice means the decision maker can list the outcomes and order them in terms of preference.  The individual then chooses the action he/she believes will deliver the preferred consequence or set of all the possible consequences.  Formally, Simon argued that decision making is a process that can be divided into three required steps (1976): 

#Identify and list all alternatives
#Determination all the consequences resulting from each of the alternatives
#Compare the accuracy and efficiency of each of these sets of consequences 

This describes an ideal situation.  However, there are many reasons that decision makers cannot fully engage all three steps.  Simon argues that the rationality of individuals is limited by such factors as the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite amount of time they have to make decisions (to name just a few).  The key argument is that the decision maker rarely has the time necessary to identify all the possible choices, determine the outcome of each choice, collect information on the relationship between choices and outcomes, and then analyze the situation to determine how each choice relates to each outcome.   

To explain this limitation he introduces the concept of bounded rationality.  Bounded rationality means that decision makers would like to engage in all three steps listed above but limitations beyond their control require them to make shortcuts.  Instead of engaging fully in all these three steps the decision maker satisfices.   Simon defined satisficing as the situation where a decision maker focuses on adequate solutions rather than optimal solutions.  In order to understand decision makers we need to first understand decision making.

Given bounded rationality how do decision makers satisfice?  Decision makers (or organizations) use cognitive processes.  Simon argued that 
{{cquote |The human being striving for rationality and restricted within the limits of his knowledge has developed some working procedures that partially overcome these difficulties. These procedures consist in assuming that he can isolate from the rest of the world a closed system containing a limited number of variables and a limited range of consequences. |||Simon 1976}}

The decision maker or organization narrows down the number of variables using values.   &quot;Decisions can be complex admixtures of facts and values.&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Simon] The fundamental assumption here is people and groups have values and experiences that shape how they make choices.

Graham Allison provides an important explanation of the internal influences on behavior by talking about reference frames and how these frames influence behavior.

{{cquote |...if one carefully examines explanations produced by analysts, a number of fundamental similarities emerge.  Explanations produced by particular analysts display quite regular, predictable features. This predictability suggests a substructure.  These regularities reflect an analyst's assumptions about the character of puzzles, the categories in which problems should be considered, the types of evidence that are relevant, and the determinants of occurrences. The first proposition is that clusters of such related assumptions constitute basic frames of reference (our emphasis) or conceptual models in terms of which analysts both ask and answer the questions: What happened? Why did the event happen? What will happen? Such assumptions are central to the activities of explanation and prediction, for in attempting to explain a particular event, the analyst cannot simply describe the full state of the world leading up to that event. The logic of explanation requires that he single out the relevant, important determinants of the occurrence. Moreover, as the logic of prediction underscores, the analyst must summarize the various determinants as they bear on the event in question. Conceptual models both fix the mesh of the nets that the analyst drags through the material in order to explain a particular action or decision and direct him to cast his net in select ponds, at certain depths, in order to catch the fish he is after. ||| Allison 1969}}

The approach to building business intelligence systems presented in this book assumes that implicit conceptual models influence our thoughts and behavior.  Given bounded rationality every individual must apply a method to filter the flood of information that bombards them daily.  They do this using their frames of reference, used both to filter data and make sense of the data.  What the decision maker sees and judges as important is based on information that passes through &quot;conceptual lenses&quot; that all individuals use to make sense of information.  Decision makers frame policies in terms of what Allison explains as conceptual models that have significant consequences for the content of their thought (1969).  In sum, what each decision maker sees and judges to be important is a function not only of the evidence but also of conceptual lenses through which we look at evidence.  

At the heart of a Business Intelligence system is a process that filters and then organizes vast amounts of data into information and knowledge.  Explicit strategic models that capture reference frames are an important part of a Business Intelligence system.  The system filters out data the decision maker deems unnecessary and organizes useful data into information based on a frame of reference.  Decision makers hold certain information and events as critical for gauging strategic and operational efficiency.  Building a Business Intelligence system that applies this frame to incoming data helps the decision maker make sense of the world.

==Capturing the decision maker's reference frame==

We capture the strategy of decision makers by modeling their reference frame.  The process for modeling strategy is based on developing strategy diagrams.  We propose that the first step in framing a strategy is to develop strategy diagrams based on frames of reference.  There are four types of strategy diagrams.  The term strategy diagrams is used instead of strategy maps because Kaplan and Norton developed the Strategy Map.  Further, Porter develops the Activity Diagram. To avoid confusion strategy diagrams refers to the collection of maps.  Any one is called a strategy diagram.  Strategy Map refers specifically to the approach to strategy developed by Kaplan and Norton.  Note that a map and diagram are generally the same thing.

The strategy diagrams are as follows (authors in paretheses):
# Activity Map - (Porter 1996)
# Chatterjee Map - (Chatterjee 2005)
# Strategy Map - (Kaplan and Norton 2001)
# Causal Link Map - implicit or explicit part of the previous three maps

This paper asserts that the Kaplan and Norton's Strategy Map and Balanced Scorecards can be used to support two distinct management activities – management control and strategic control.  The paper describes characteristics of Balanced Scorecards appropriate for each purpose, and suggests a framework to help select between them.

==Approaches to building Business Intelligence Systems==

In developing a Business Intelligence system ther is a huge gap between the multitude of fragmented data sources and executives that need access to the information that these data sources can provide (see [http://www.businessintelligence.com/print.asp?id=88&amp;type=article&amp;page=PAGE5 Barberg]).  Most approaches to building BI systems must address these problems.  Further, the choice is even more extreme when builiding a BI system from scratch.

To this end there are two approaches to building BI systems.  Each focuses on the link between data and decision makers.

*Bottom Up - Enterprise Data Warehouse Approach
*Top Down - Executive Dashboard Approach

===Enterprise Data Warehouse Approach===

This approach begins after the creation of an enterprise data warehouse.  While the data warehouse is complete there are still users that do not have access to the data they need.  Further, they are often exposed to data and reports that they do not want.  Finally, many argue that the data warehouse is a resource to be tapped by a BI system (as easy as stacking Legos).

&quot;Even if, after many months (or years) of effort, the enterprise data warehouse is a technical masterpiece, there still may be a big gap between the data warehouse and the end users. Many companies have spent many millions in building a solid data warehouse foundation only to have the business users fail to embrace it. Part of the gap was filled, but a bridge half-way across a wide river is of very limited value.&quot; [http://www.businessintelligence.com/print.asp?id=88&amp;type=article&amp;page=PAGE5]

&quot;Vendors like SAP and Oracle are finally building in what users thought they were going to get when they invested millions in an ERP, which is great reporting and great business management tools. But the problem is that [the ERP vendors] are building from the bottom up. They built a data model for business applications, with a layer of analytic applications on top of it.

With Oracle's acquisition of Hyperion and SAP's acquisition of Business Objects, they both recognized that that approach of building it from bottom up and adding it onto the ERP was not really getting onto the broader BI market.&quot;[http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid183_gci1351167,00.html]

The bottom up approach is often driven by the notion of tapping the Enterprise data warehouse as a new resource without any thought regarding how to use this new resource to deliver information.

===Top Down===

A purely “top down” effort that focuses on delivering executive dashboards and scorecards can also prove to be a costly disappointment. There are many different approaches, ranging from manual spreadsheets of performance metrics to sophisticated Business Performance Management (BPM) software packages that promise to deliver key insights on a vast number of performance indicators.  Simple scorecarding or dashboard packages may provide some executive-friendly briefing books, gauges and charts, but they often lack the ability to evolve into a richer analytical platform.[http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid183_gci1351167,00.html]

==Framework Approach to build a BI System==
A framework approach to a BI system includes both an architecture and infrastructure for each frame and an architecture and infrastructure for the framework.  These are outlined below.

===Frame Architecture===

This book focuses on building Business Intelligence systems from a framework approach.  This is a top-down approach.  The framework approach starts with building frames for individual decision makers.  The frame is developed from strategy diagrams.  The strategy diagrams model strategy from all the decision makers' combined reference frames.  Each frame is a slice of the whole corporate strategy and corresponds to the frame of one decision maker (see [http://www.businessintelligence.com/print.asp?id=88&amp;type=article&amp;page=PAGE5 Barberg]).

To build the frame the Strategy Map (Norton and Kaplan's) is cascaded down to the department level in the form of a scorecard (see [http://www.businessintelligence.com/print.asp?id=88&amp;type=article&amp;page=PAGE5 Barberg]).  This is the first step in building the frame architecture.  This is because the frame architecture must be based on the overall company strategy.  In fact, at the heart of the architecture for the frame is the decision maker's view of the strategy, cascaded from the strategy map.

This creates a connection between the overall company strategy and the individual frames.  At the operational level this means that the frame focuses on the processes and activities outlines in the Strategy Map.  The frame owner focuses on the operations within his/her control.  The scorecard allows the owner to identify the important objectives that will bring the strategy into fruition.  

===Frame Infrastructure===

To determine if the business unit is making progress towards achieving its objective the frame owner focuses on the KPI's and targets on the dashboard.  The dashboard is at the heart of the decision maker's frame.  The dashboard contains the most important information needed to determine if the business unit is making progress towards the achievement of its goals.  The specific goals cascade down from the Strategy Map.  The KPI's and targets in the dashboard instantiate the corporate strategy.  

The reporting system has a hub and spoke architecture.  The center of the reporting system is the dashboard.  Each spoke is a report on an element of the dashboard, such as a report on a specific KPI.  The frame owner can gain further information on any dashboard item by examining the associated report.  The details helps the owner understand how his/her business unit is meeting its goals or why it is not.

In order to feed data into the reports the frame architecture includes a data mart.  This data mart contains all of the data necessary to feed the reports and dashboard.  The data mart can receive data from multiple sources but the data warehouse is the optimal feed.  

===Framework Architecture===


Strategy maps allow for the creation of a control system that acts as the central nervous system for a BI system.  A control system is a management tool used to intervene in organizational behavior when there is variations between actual and expected results (Cobbold and Lawrie 2000b). 

Managing an organization requires:
#Planning - a process of creating a statement of intent 
#Control - assuring that desired results are obtained by  having a mechanism &quot;by which execution against the plan can be controlled.&quot; (quote from Cobbold and Lawrie 2000b; also see Anthony 1965)

Before going into detail on a control system it is first necessary to define planning, control and control system.

''Planning''

Planning is the activity where the business leaders decide which goals are the most important and how much activities and resources to direct towards the business processes that will attain these goals.  Leaders must make choices about which outcomes to pursue and how to achieve these outcomes.  

''Control''
defined as “assuring that desired results are obtained” (Anthony, 1965). mechanism by which execution against the plan can be controlled.  a set of tools and skills that will support the communication and implementation of the decisions made
(‘control’).  

''Control system''

A control system combines both planning and control.  It includes management methods of creating and disseminating plans and alterations in organizational behavior needed to respond to such variations between actual and expected/standard results.

For a control system to be effective Cobbold and Lawrie argue that it needs to be informed about the activities and results of organizational processes in a manner that allows a comparison to prior expectations or standards (2000b).  Vickers writes that a control system needs “a means of comparing any state, actual or hypothetical with a standard” (1958).  In BI systems these are measures and targets.

To ascertain whether or not the destination state is being obtained, the organization needs some form of feedback on activities being undertaken, and the outcomes arising from these activities. As noted above, without measurement it is difficult to track delivery of plans, and so a key task here is the selection of the right measures to inform managers about activity and outcome.

Finally, the framework develops with the development of frames.  Frames can be linked horozontally or vertially.  For instance, operational frames can feed into tactical frames.  Tactical frames can feed into strategic frames.  Further, horizontal integration allows knowledge to be passed between business silos.  The BI framework is greater than the sum of its parts.

Finally, the framework approach allows for the connection of strategy and control through the firm by cascading scorecards.  &quot;The BSC also provides a consistent language and best practices for things like cascading the top scorecard down through the organization to make sure that the scorecard measures help align scarce resources to accomplishing the strategy (see [http://www.businessintelligence.com/print.asp?id=88&amp;type=article&amp;page=PAGE5 Barberg]).&quot;  A key feature of the framework approach presented in this book is the ability to align measures at each level of the organization with the strategy.  This ensures that all resources go towards making the company as efficient as possible.

===Bounded Rationality and the Control System===

Cobbold and Lawrie argue that how the organization chooses measures and targets a key element to whether or not a good control system is effective (2000b).  One method is to use outside experience or benchmarks.  Another way to select these measures is based on ‘desired outcomes’ (Anthony, 1965, Kaplan and Norton, 1992; 1996).  A refinement of this method focuses on the need for the organization to ensure that the control system adopts measures and targets based on desired outcomes but adds they should restrict &quot;measure selection to those that are relevant to these outcomes&quot; (Cobbold and Lawrie 2000b).

Why should they restrict measure selection?  Based on principles of bounded rationality.  Decision making based on bounded rationality assume that decision makers have access to limited information, cognitive limitations minds, and limited time in which to make decisions[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality].  Gathering all information would cause overload.  It would also make the organization slow to react to environmental changes or operational problems.  Decision makers do not have the ability to consider all options and therefore must simplify the number of choices by reducing alternatives.  In other words, they satisfice, meaning that they look for adequate rather than optimal solutions [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficer].

Given these limitations how do leaders make decisions?  What the decision maker sees and judges as important is based on information that passes through &quot;conceptual lenses&quot; that all individuals use to make sense of information.   The framework approach to building Business Intelligence systems assumes that implicit conceptual models influence our thoughts and behavior.  Decision makers filter the flood of information that bombards them daily using their frames of reference.  Frames not only filter data but are also used to make sense of the data. Decision makers frame policies in terms of what Allison explains as conceptual models that have significant consequences for the content of their thought (1969).

The framework approach to Business Intelligence (BI) creates an infrastructure that filters and then organizes vast amounts of data into information and knowledge.  The filters are based on the decision makers frames of reference, captured in strategy diagrams.  These explicit strategic models capture reference frames and therefore form the heart of this Business Intelligence system.  The system filters out data the decision maker deems unnecessary and organizes useful data into information based on a frame of reference. Decision makers hold certain information and events as critical for gauging strategic and operational efficiency. Building a Business Intelligence system that applies this frame to incoming data helps the decision maker make sense of the world.

A control system must take into consideration the limitations of the organization.  A framework approach, applying the principles of bounded rationality, satisficing and frame of references, allows the organization to both account for its weaknesses and take advantage of knowledge (strategy diagrams).

===Framework Infrastructure===
The framework infrastructure includes all the technology needed to implement a BI framework architecture.  These include the data warehouse (which develops naturally from the data marts), technology to capture feedback (success towards completion of goals), tools for dashboarding and reporting system, etc.  

This is a short introduction to the frame approach.  However, it does provide a rough outline of the benefits of building a BI system, step-by-step, one frame at a time.

==Framework approach and its compatibility with other approaches==

Bill Barberg focuses on an approach that allows the firm to start small and build.  This approach is a much more orderly method than would be the case if efforts were made without starting small.  In building part of the BI system each builder benefits from the lessons learned by other builders rather than having to learn them through the school of hard knocks — which can be both expensive and time consuming.  In building a part of the BI system, the data warehouse, he uses Ralph Kimball.  Kimball's approach to data warehouse development focuses on a dimensional data mart architecture that facilitates the addition of data marts over time with a high degree of consistency.  Similarly, Poe et al. argue that the first data mart is also a data warehouse with the ease of adding new data marts to the initial data warehouse (1997).   The first data mart becomes the initial phase in a small scale data warehouse.  

This is consistent with the framework approach in that each successive frame contains one data mart.  As the number of frames grows it is possible to integrate these data marts into one central data warehouse.  Further, in a company that already has a data warehouse, the framework approach allows the BI system architect to integrate the frames with the data warehouse.

The framework approach is a helpful methodology for building a Business Intelligence system because it addresses an important problem with building a BI system.  Executives can become overwhelmed with measures, objectives, data and tools.  The framework approach, with its application of the balanced scorecard methodology and step-by-step approach, provides a way to focus on the most important measures that drive the organization's strategy.  Strategy Maps and Balanced Scorecards are an established tool for developing and disseminating strategy.  Executives need only focus on helping the business analyst develop the strategy diagrams.  They do not need to focus on helping develop the whole architecture.  Further, the growth of the system is incremental.  This piecemeal, top-down approach to building the BI system using a divide-and-conquer strategy makes the system easier to manage.

==Conclusion==

The application of a framework approach to building Business Intelligence systems aligns measures at all levels of the organization with the overall strategy by first developing strategy diagrams (culminating in the Strategy Map).  The next step is to cascade the scorecards to each frame.  This serves as the basis for the frame architecture.  One the frame infrastructure is completed the business analyst turns his/her attention towards the BI framework architecture.  This develops naturally from the Strategy Map and Balanced Scorecard tools.  Then the framework infrastructure combines all the frames.  Most importantly, the divide and conquer method allows the firm to start building a BI system without becoming overwhelmed with details.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The code on the previous page, whilst usable, is lumpy and more procedural than object-oriented. Typically in a real world situation the database specific code would be located in a class of its own, and then created and used as  necessary as a discrete object.

Let's have a look at how we might think about doing this.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.sql.ResultSet;

public class BetterHelloDatabase
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        String sDropTable = &quot;DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dummy&quot;;
        String sMakeTable = &quot;CREATE TABLE dummy (id numeric, response text)&quot;;
        String sMakeInsert = &quot;INSERT INTO dummy VALUES(1,'Hello from the database')&quot;;
        String sMakeSelect = &quot;SELECT response from dummy&quot;;

        String sDriver = &quot;jdbc:sqlite&quot;;
        String sDatabaseToUse = &quot;hello.db&quot;;
        String sDbUrl = sDriverName + &quot;:&quot; + sDatabaseToUse;

        DbClass db = new DbClass(sDbUrl);
        try {

        db.execute(sDropTable);
        db.execute(sMakeTable);
        db.execute(sMakeInsert);

        ResultSet rs = db.executeQuery(sMakeSelect);
        try {
            while(rs.next())
            {
                String sResult = rs.getString(&quot;response&quot;);
                System.out.println(sResult);
            }
            } finally {
                try { rs.close(); } catch (Exception ignore) {}
            }
        } finally {
            try { db.close(); } catch (Exception ignore) {}
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It's an improvement on the previous cut since we have now the possibility to have more than one database connection in play by use of the instantiation of the proposed new class DbClass. Moreover since the constructor takes a database URL as an argument it would be feasible to make this proposed class service more than one SqLite database, (and, in fact, service a completely different database type using a different JDBC provider if one is available). If you consider this carefully, what this should be suggesting to you is that in fact what we will ultimately need is an abstract base class of generalised database methods, from which we can then inherit to provide a concrete class which is database type specific, e.g. we have an abstract base class called something like DbBaseClass from which we can derive such classes as SqLiteDbClass, OracleDbClass, MySQlDbClass.

You will note that only java.sql.ResultSet is now needed for import into main as the database logic will be encapsulated elsewhere. Ultimately again we should be thinking about encapsulating that untidy ResultSet for loop block as a method in yet another class which is specific to handling outcomes of queries, with a view to providing its methods to an Interface class which bridges the concrete implementation of the database logic and the way that the data is returned etc. However, this is somewhat of a digression at the moment since what we really are interested in for now are the practicalities of getting our database to do what we want it to do.

The main method anticipates there being (at least) three publicly available methods, as well as having (at least) one  constructor which takes the URL as an argument: 

* void execute(String)
* ResultSet executeQuery(String)
* void close()

It will inevitably also need a number of private methods and fields to satisfy this encapsulation. Let's start with the constructor and the obvious methods which it will need to provide a viable database class.
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
{imports}

public class DbClass {
    public String sUrl; // for advertising and debug purposes
    private String sDriverName = &quot;org.sqlite.JDBC&quot;; 
    private String sDriver; 
    private Connection conn = null;
    private Statement stmt = null;

    public DbClass(String sDbUrl) {
        sUrl = sDbUrl;
        sDriverName = getDriverString(sDbUrl); // i.e. we will need a
                                                // function to split the
                                                // driver string from the
                                                // passed URL
        /*
         * which in itself suggests we may provide a constructor overload
         * which takes the full URL and the DriverName....
         */
        setConnection();
    }

    private void setConnection() throws Exception {
        try {
            Class.forName(sDriverName);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // connection failed.
            System.out.println(&quot;DriverName: &quot; + sDriver
                    + &quot; was not available&quot;);
            System.err.println(e);
            throw e;
        }
            // create a database connection
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection(sUrl);
            try {
                stmt = conn.createStatement();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                try { conn.close(); } catch (Exception ignore) {}
                conn = null;
            }
    }

    // this method should undoubtedly be public as we'll want to call this
    // to close connections externally to the class
    public void closeConnection() {
        if (stmt!=null) { try { stmt.close(); } catch (Exception ignore) {} }
        if (conn!=null) { try { conn.close(); } catch (Exception ignore) {} }
    }

    // and we will definitely want to be able to call the following two
    // functions externally since they expose the database
    // behaviour which we are trying to access
    public ResultSet executeQuery(String instruction) throws SQLException {
        return stmt.executeQuery(instruction);
    }

    public void execute(String instruction) throws SQLException {
        stmt.executeUpdate(instruction);
    }

}
&lt;/source&gt;

Obviously this is a very pared down implementation of a putative database class, and it really isn't all that object oriented. However it does represent a considerable step forward from the initial HelloDatabase.java which we began  with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note:''' This article requires basic knowledge of PL/I which can be found in [[Software Engineers Handbook/Language Dictionary/PLI]].

=== Bit Strings &quot;as Strings&quot; ===
In PL/I bit strings formally are declared as strings of &quot;1-bit-letters&quot;, i.e. all builtin string functions may be used for it,
 dcl   my_chars   char (8) varying   init ( 'ABCDCD' );
 dcl   my_bits    bit  (8) varying   init ( '01010'B );
    put skip list ( length ( my_chars ) );   /* output is 6, the current length of the varying string */
    put skip list ( length ( my_bits  ) );   /* output is 5, the current length of the varying string */
    put skip list ( index ( my_chars , 'CD'  ) );   /* output is 3, the first position of substring 'CD'  */
    put skip list ( index ( my_bits  , '10'B ) );   /* output is 2, the first position of substring '10'B */

=== Bit Strings as Boolean Values ===
The common use of bit strings is to employ them as bit vectors, especially bit (1) strings represents single boolean values:
* '1'B is interpreted as True
* '0'B is interpreted as False
Bit (1) strings may be used as boolean expressions in conditional and loop statements.
 dcl   one_bit   bit (1);
    one_bit = ( 1 &lt; 2 );   /* now one_bit has the value '1'B */
    one_bit = ( 2 &lt; 1 );   /* now one_bit has the value '0'B */
    if one_bit then
       put skip list ( 'value of one_bit is true' );
    else
       put skip list ( 'value of one_bit is false' );
    do while ( one_bit );
       .....
    end;

Bit strings used in an expression expecting a bit (1) value are interpreted as '1'B = True if and only if at least one bit has then value '1'B.
 dcl   many_bits   bit (99);
    if many_bits then
       put skip list ( 'at least one of the bits has value ''1'''B' );
    else
       put skip list ( 'none of the bits has value ''1'''B' );
    do while ( many_bits );   /* do while at least one bit is set */
       .....
    end;

=== Fundamental Boolean Operators ===
Boolean operators may be used for calculating new bit (1) values:
* The prefix operator '''¬''' is used as logical NOT.
* The  infix operator '''&amp;''' is used as logical AND.
* The  infix operator '''|''' is used as logical OR.
 dcl   bit_a    bit (1);
 dcl   bit_b    bit (1);
 dcl   result   bit (1);
    result = ¬ bit_a;           /* result = '1'B if and only if bit_a is '0'B */
    result =   bit_a &amp; bit_b;   /* result = '1'B if and only if both bit_a and bit_b are '1'B */
    result =   bit_a | bit_b;   /* result = '0'B if and only if both bit_a and bit_b are '0'B */
Note: Using compile-time options NOT operator and OR operator may be replaced by other symbols,&lt;br&gt;
for being compatible with existing PL/I programs often '''^''' is used as NOT, '''!''' is used as OR.&lt;br&gt;
Note: In ''Enterprise PL/I for z/OS'' '''¬''' may also by used as an infix operator, A ¬ B means A XOR B (exclusive-or).

Boolean operators may also be used for bit (n) strings with n &gt; 1,&lt;br&gt;
in this case calculation is done in a bit-by-bit way, i.e.
* 1st bit of ( A &amp; B ) = ( 1st bit of A ) &amp; ( 1st bit of B )
* 2nd bit of ( A &amp; B ) = ( 2nd bit of A ) &amp; ( 2nd bit of B )
* and so on ...
If A and B have different length the shorter of them is padded on the right with '0'B.
 dcl   bit_a   bit (3)   init ( '101'B  );
 dcl   bit_b   bit (4)   init ( '1100'B  );
    put skip list ( ¬ bit_a );         /* '010'B  */
    put skip list ( ¬ bit_b );         /* '0011'B */
    put skip list ( bit_a &amp; bit_b );   /* '1000'B */
    put skip list ( bit_a | bit_b );   /* '1110'B */

=== Builtin Function BOOL ===
All of the 16 possible binary boolean operations can be done with the BOOL function.
 BOOL ( A , B , pattern_4 )
where A and B are bit strings and pattern_4 is a bit (4) string.

Let us as first assume A and B would be bit (1), then the function of pattern_4 is:
* 1st bit of pattern_4 defines the result of bool if A = '0'B and B = '0'B
* 2nd bit of pattern_4 defines the result of bool if A = '0'B and B = '1'B
* 3rd bit of pattern_4 defines the result of bool if A = '1'B and B = '0'B
* 4th bit of pattern_4 defines the result of bool if A = '1'B and B = '1'B

If A or B is bit (n) with n &gt; 1 then calculation is done in a bit-by-bit way, see above.

Some possible values of pattern_4:
                            alternative      meaning
 bool ( A , B , '0001'B )       A  &amp;  B      A AND  B    logical AND
 bool ( A , B , '0111'B )       A  |  B      A OR   B    logical OR
 bool ( A , B , '0110'B )       A ¬=  B      A XOR  B    exclusive-OR
 bool ( A , B , '1110'B )   ¬ ( A  &amp;  B )    A NAND B    NOT AND
 bool ( A , B , '1000'B )   ¬ ( A  |  B )    A NOR  B    NOT OR
 bool ( A , B , '1001'B )       A  =  B      A IFF  B    equivalence
 bool ( A , B , '1101'B )      ¬A  |  B      A  -&amp;gt;  B    implication: if A then B
 bool ( A , B , '1011'B )       A  | ¬B      a  &amp;lt;-  B    implication: if B then A

=== Array Operations ===
The builtin function ALL and ANY expects an array as argument.

Let us as first assume the argument ARRAY would be an array of bit (1), then
* '''ALL''' returns '1'B = True if and only if all elements of ARRAY are '1'B.
* '''ANY''' returns '1'B = True if and only if at least 1 element of ARRAY is '1'B.

If argument ARRAY is an array of bit (n) with n &gt; 1 then calculation is done in a bit-by-bit way, see above.

 dcl   array (3)     bit (8)   init ( '11110000'B ,
                                      '11001100'B ,
                                      '10101010'B   );
 dcl   number (42)   bin fixed (15);
    put skip list ( ALL ( array ) );   /* output is '10000000'B */
    put skip list ( ANY ( array ) );   /* output is '11111110'B */
    if ANY ( number &lt; 0 ) then         /* expression &quot;number &lt; 0&quot; returns an array of 42 bit (1) strings */
       put skip list ( 'at least 1 number is negative' );

:T'''his Wikibook''' is an introduction to information security aimed primarily at K-12 administrators, educators, and (to a lesser extent) technology staff. Security is an important issue for many reasons, but security professionals have found that actions taken to increase security often have a minimal, or even opposite, effect (Schneier, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Schneier, B. (2004). ''Secrets and Lies''. Indianapolis, Indiana: Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''While many products''' and marketing representatives may be found to provide information to school leaders on information security, it may be difficult to find unbiased information that addresses many of the issues. Two books used in the research for this wikibook stand out for their authority and point-of-view. The first is ''Secrets and Lies'' by Bruce Schneier, one of the world's best know security experts (see ref list below). The second is ''Little Brother'' by Cory Doctorow, a respected authority on Internet privacy and policy issues (especially those related to young people)(Doctorow, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;http://craphound.com/littlebrother/&lt;/ref&gt;.

:'''''Secrets and Lies''''' provides a broad overview of how to think about and plan for security issues. It includes countless information security examples from the real world. This is the book to provide a contextual framework on information security to educational leaders. ''Little Brother'' has been acclaimed as a modern-day version of George Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' Like Orwell's work, it provides a vivid warning about ways that excessive security may have long-reaching unanticipated undesirable effects. ''Little Brother'' takes place partly in an American high school, and it is written from the perspective of today's youth culture. This is the book to provide the human side of information security for educational leaders. (note: ''Little Brother'' is also available for free download from the author's website.&lt;ref&gt;http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Disclaimer==
This page was not written to encourage hacking, but to show educators what type of control students can take over computers and how to identify these hacks.

==Introduction==
The term[[w:Hacker| hack]] has several related meanings in the technology and computer science fields. It may refer to a clever or quick fix to a computer program problem, or to what may be perceived to be a clumsy or inelegant (but usually relatively quick) solution to a problem. The term is also used to refer to a modification of a program or [[w:Human_interface_device| device]] to give the user access to features that were otherwise unavailable. 

[[File:Computer-eat.svg‎|frame|left|thumb]]Most networks start off with poor security. But over time, with [[w:Patch_(computing)| patches]], network security does increase. At this point, a  hacker that has gotten use of a certain system may be lose their additional access for a while. But usual the hacker goes on to find new holes. There is only so much an admin can
disable on your computer before it becomes no use to anyone. &lt;ref name=&quot;rahul&quot;&gt;[http://rahulhackingarticles.wetpaint.com/page/Novell+security+hacking Rahul Hacking]&lt;/ref&gt;

To get access to a network, a hacker can use whatever programs are on a computer.. If you are a student then you
will undoubtedly have programs that aid in study, such as Notepad, MS Word, PowerPoint and others. All these programs can be used to the hackers advantage. &lt;ref name=&quot;rahul&quot;/&gt;

On this page of the book we will discuss how educational computers are hacked to take access of student files and data.

By knowing these hacks, administrators and teachers will be better able to spot when students are hacking into networks.

==Microsoft Windows==
[[File:WindowNT.png‎‎|thumb|right|]]With Microsoft Windows based computers, the first line of security is to lock out the control panels and the [[w:MS-DOS| MS-DOS]] prompt. Most administrators stop MS-DOS prompt from working, because it's the best way to get administrative privileges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tipstrs.com/tip/8296/Hack-Your-School-(Work)-Computer-And-Get-Administrative-Privileges Tipstrs: Tips for hacking your school]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these two items are locked down, by searching the internet you can find a number of hacks to get around many of these. 

By opening up a Notepad document, it it is easy to make a [[w:COM_file|.com]] and [[w:Batch_file| .bat]] file that can be used to run locked down parts of the machine. [http://hackspc.com/hack-your-school-work-computer-and-get-administrative-privileges/]

==Novell==
Novell NetWare software  is a suite of software products developed and maintained by Novell, Inc. for computer [[w:systems management|systems management]].

NetWare allows administrators to install software on, configure, put a hard-disk image on, inventory and remotely troubleshoot Windows-based workstations and laptops from a central location, through use of policy-driven automation. 

As with most security software that is placed in schools, students will quickly find ways to get around the system.


For Netware there are a variety of hacks that can be found on the internet. A Google search for Novell Netware hacks shows 286,000 results. some of these hacks can be seen below.

===Novell Windows NT Hacks===
These hacks are referenced from [http://rahulhackingarticles.wetpaint.com/page/Novell+security+hacking Rahul Hacking]
====Gain C: Access====
This operation has been canceled by the Administrator&quot; / &quot;You have insufficient rights to execute this command
# Open Internet Explorer 
# Go File &gt; Open then Browse...
# At this point you should be able to see the entire C: drive of the computer.

====Gain Program Access on C:====
If you know what files are on the C: drive based on the above hack you can then open most of the programs that are on the computer.
# Open Internet Explorer
# click Browse...
# Pick a useful file like &quot;command.com&quot;
# When you find the file, click ok and you will have a little box with the full pathname of the file. 
# At this point you can either OK, Cancel or Browse... Do neither. 
# Copy the pathname. 
# Now open MS Word. 
# Go to View
# Select Toolbars
# Chose Visual Basic. A toolbox will pop up. 
# Click &quot;Design Mode&quot;. A new toolbox should pop up
# Click the &quot;Command Button&quot; which just looks like a small rectangle. 
# When the button pops up, double click it. You should be taken to a VB screen with the following in the middle:
#:::Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
#:::End Sub
# Now type in...
#:::SHELL(&quot;C:\winnt\system32\command.com&quot;)
# hit F5 (Debug)your screen should read:
#:::Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
#:::SHELL(&quot;C:\winnt\system32\command.com&quot;)
#:::End Sub
# If a minimized does not come up, try this:
#:::Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
#:::a = SHELL(&quot;C:\winnt\system32\command.com&quot;,vbNormalFocus)
#:::End Sub
# Hit F5 again. 


* If this doesn't work there could be a number of things wrong: 
**If a screen came up
saying macros have been disabled
**go back to your first Visual Basic toolbar
**Click the button says &quot;Security...&quot;. 
**Now select the option that says &quot;Low&quot;. 
**Try again. 
*If it still doesn't work, read on. 
**If it says &quot;Run-time error:'53'--- File not found&quot; you are in trouble. 
***It means you either typed the pathname incorrectly
***Or it means the file does not exist
*If your computer is running win2k or xp you will have to slightly adjust your
pathname.

It is recommend you use command.com as apposed to cmd.exe. The main reason is that cmd.exe
can be blocked off by your administrator, so as soon as you open it you will get something that
says &quot;CMD has been restricted by your administrator. Press any key to continue...&quot;. If this
happens, cmd is useless. &lt;ref name=&quot;rahul&quot;/&gt;

====Using PowerPoint to run applications====
#Create new PowerPoint Slide
#Insert Hyperlink
##The hyperlink should be pointed at the file you want to open
#View the slide
#click the hyperlink
#Your file or program should open.

====Using Notepad run applications====
#Open a Notepad
#Type:
#:&lt;a href=&quot;C:\winnt\system32\command.com&quot;&gt;click&lt;/a&gt;
#Go to File &gt; Save as... 
#type in &quot;link.html&quot; with the quotes
#Save the file in the drive you have access to. Sometimes also called My Documents. 
#When you refresh the drive, you should be able to see an IE icon called &quot;link.html&quot;
#Double click it, then click the hyperlink.
#Your file or program should open.

====Getting Access to invisible drives====
Frequently CD, Floppy, or Flash Drives are locked down. To gain access to them

#In your private drive, try creating a shortcut to a:. 
##This will almost definitely not work but is worth a try. 
#Try going to File &gt; Winzip &gt; Zip to file. This may allow you to transfer files to your floppy.
#:Lastly, we can use DOS. This usually works because it is hard to disable items in DOS effectively so there are a number of ways around it. 
#In DOS type:
#:C:\&gt;a:
#:A:\&gt;dir
#::Volume in A has no label
#::Volume Serial Number is 0001-0AA0
#::Directory of A:
#::BO2k.zip 111,111 1/1/04
#::Netbus.zip 111,111 1/1/04
#:C:\&gt;
#:So now we can see what's on the disk. If you wanna run it you can type:
#::A:\&gt;Netbus.zip

However, a more efficient way of opening it would be to first copy it to your private drive. We
do this by typing:

A:\&gt;copy a:\*.zip h:

====Getting Passwords====
NOTE: This only works on poorly secured networks
From a Dos Prompt type:
:C:\&gt;copy c:\winnt\*.pwl a:

This command copies all the .pwl (password) files that are stored in the Windows NT directory. You can
now take the disk home and crack the password files in our own time at our own leisure. 

Most reasonably secure or just new networks no longer store their passwords in .pwl files. 
In Windows 2000, there's a new thing called SAM (Security Accounts Manager). Which is harder to crack.



===Advanced Novell Hacking===
Advanced hacking of Novell is easy to find too. These involve using
programs such as [[w:Port_scanner| port scanners]], [[w:Keystroke_logging| keyloggers]], [[w:Trojan_horse_(computing)| Trojan horses]] and [[w:Password_cracking| password crackers]]. For information on this you can go to 
[http://rahulhackingarticles.wetpaint.com/page/Novell+security+hacking Rahul Hacking] or [http://www.google.com Google] what you are trying to do.

{{TOCright}}

The primary target audience for this topic are building level, K-12 administrators. Although K-12, central office, and higher education administrators are not the intended target audience, they may glean some insight from the information presented here.

== Threats to Schools ==

Conducting research on the role of K-12 administrators in dealing with their schools’ information security will most likely yield very few, if any, results. The reason for the lack of information is most likely that most K-12 administrators simply do not view information security as a top priority. This is not surprising since the job descriptions of K-12 administrators typically do not including monitoring computer network traffic for potential threats or security breeches. Furthermore, this type of training is usually not in the curriculum of principal’s certification programs. Although information security is not a top priority to principals, nor a part of their education, there are ways that principal’s can assist in securing their school’s network. 

In order for administrators to make informed decisions, it is necessary to know not only the problem, but its origin. In terms of information security, the origin of the problem(s) can be multifaceted. Most likely, though, the problem is people. According to Schneier (2004), “people often represent the weakest link in the security chain and are chronically responsible for the failure of the security system (p.255).” For the K-12 administrator, this means that the leading prevention for information security concerns is staff development. Although the term staff development typically refers to teacher training, in this case it refers to all staff (secretaries, custodians, aides, etc.) that has access to the schools network. School staff needs to recognize that they play one of the most significant roles in information security. 

Among the biggest external threats that involve school personnel are social engineering threats.  Social engineering is the act of manipulating people into divulging confidential information.This type of threat can be used quite easily in a public school since most public school employees, while cognizant of student confidentiality, are very willing to assist other school personnel in solving their problems. There are three main types of social engineer schemes pretexting, phishing, and baiting. Each of these types of social engineering can cause major problems for schools. 

== Threats Defined ==
=== External ===

Pretexting is the act of creating and using an invented scenario (the pretext) to persuade a targeted victim to release information or perform an action and is typically done over the telephone. It is more than a simple lie as it most often involves some prior research or set up and the use of pieces of known information. In the case of a school, a call from someone pretending to be in the technology department would be an easy sell to most personnel, especially if at the time of the call the network was not properly functioning. 

Phishing is a technique of fraudulently obtaining private information. Typically, the phisher sends an e-mail that appears to come from a legitimate business, in the case of a school a fake email from the technology department or administration, requesting &quot;verification&quot; of information and warning of some dire consequence if it is not provided. The fictitious email could ask for passwords or student or personnel information. A teacher could receive an email from the “business manager” requesting updated banking information for direct deposit, or for a social security number. Since school records and software are updated regularly, this type email from a fake business manager would probably not seem strange to an employee.

Baiting is an attack that uses physical media and relies on the curiosity or greed of the victim. In this attack, the attacker leaves a malware infected CD ROM or USB flash drive in a location sure to be found (bathroom, elevator, sidewalk, parking lot), gives it a legitimate looking and curiosity-piquing label, and simply waits for the victim to use the device. In either case as a consequence of merely inserting the disk into a computer to see the contents, the user would unknowingly install malware on it, likely giving an attacker unfettered access to the victim's PC and perhaps, the targeted school’s internal computer network. Unless computer controls block the infection, PCs set to &quot;auto-run&quot; inserted media may be compromised as soon as a rogue disk is inserted. In order for this attack to be successful at school, the attacker would not need to go to much trouble. Any school employee would be subject to this type of attack since the goal would be to return the “lost” device to its owner, who would be assumed to be a student.

It should be mentioned, however, that social engineering attacks are not the only types of external attacks which could be committed against a school district. Password hacks, port scans, and other attacks are possible, but these would never be seen by a building administrator since (s)he is usually never involved in dealing with these attacks.

=== Internal ===
Internal attacks against a school's network are far more common than external attacks. Most often, internal attacks are committed by students. There are a variety of reasons that students attack their school's network. The most prevalent reason that students give for attacking their school's network is fun. They just want to see if they could do it, and they also want to see what will happen if they do. These students typically do not cause damage to the network. Students who have malicious intent, however, are capable of causing extensive damage to a school's network. On any given day, a student could easily use a Flash Drive, or other device as described above, to plant all types of viruses, malware, spyware, or other dangerous programs on a school's network. Some of these programs have the capabilities of wiping out an entire district's network let alone a single school. The same applies to disgruntled staff who have even more access and more network permissions. 

== What Administrators Can Do ==
There are several ways that administrators can help prevent their schools from being the target of information security attacks. The first step that administrators can take is to do what the title of this Wikibook suggests, be aware. Building level administrators go to work each day with a full plate of responsibilities. Dealing with technology issues is usually not at the top of an administrators &quot;to do&quot; list. This does not mean that they should be in the dark about technology issues. Knowing some of the terminology and taking a proactive role in prevention goes a long way. The same diligence that is given to physical security, should be given to network security. 

As mentioned earlier, staff training is the key to prevention. It is absurd to think that staff training will prevent all attacks against a network. Much like the administration, staff need to be aware. Relying on a common sense approach is not enough. Most staff can turn a computer on and off, type a document or make a speadsheet, and surf the Internet. Most are not computer experts and lack the knowledge to see an impending attack or know that they are about to fall victim to a social engineering scam.

Using classroom management software such as Sychroneyes is also a step toward ensuring information security. This type of software allows teachers to view every students' computer screen simultaneously on their computer. The software also allows teachers to disable a student's computer remotely, send instant messages to them, and capture screenshots of what each student is doing. This software, while a very worthwhile tool, is not intended to be a substitute for the teacher. It is still vitally important that teachers circulate the room while the students are using the computers and educate their students on proper comuputer use and safety.

Lastly, a comprehensive student handbook, which includes consequences for computer misuse, and an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) are essential. Both the student handbook and also the AUP must contain language which specifies how the district's computers and network may be used, who may use them, and when they may be used. As mentioned, the penalties for misuse should be clearly outlined.

[[Image:Pavlova.png|350px|right]]

'''Pavlova''' is a light and fluffy [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]] dessert named after the ballet dancer Anna Pavlova.  Both Wellington, New Zealand and Perth, Australia claim to be the home of the dish. The earliest record of the recipe is a cookbook published in New Zealand in 1933, two years before claims made in Perth.

Pavlova is traditionally decorated with fresh [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] and whipped [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], and is especially popular in Australia and New Zealand. Factory-made pavlovas can be purchased at supermarkets in those countries and decorated as desired. 

Leftover pavlova can be stored in the fridge overnight, but will absorb moisture from the air and lose its crispness. Undecorated pavlova can safely be left overnight in the oven in which it was baked, to be decorated in the morning.

A popular tried and true recipe contains the following:

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg whites]]
*3 tablespoons water
*250g (9 oz.) [[Cookbook:Caster Sugar|caster sugar]]
*pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*5 ml or 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*5 ml or 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] (optional)

==Procedure==
#Beat the egg whites and salt to a very stiff consistency. Add water and beat again before folding in caster sugar, vanilla and vinegar. Beat until the mixture holds its shape and stands in sharp peaks.
#Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Slow-bake the mixture at 150°C (300°F) to dry all the moisture and create the meringue, approximately 45 minutes. This leaves the outside of the pavlova a crisp crunchy shell, while the interior remains soft and moist.
#A top tip (but not traditional) is to turn the pavlova upside down before decorating with cream and fruit because the bottom is less crispy than the top after cooking and unless you serve it immediately after decorating the &quot;top&quot; absorbs moisture from the cream. Another tip is to leave the pavlova in the oven after turning off the heat - this helps to prevent the middle of the pavlova from collapsing (although if it does collapse, generous application of cream can hide any mistakes!)

==Introduction==
: In 2006 alone, approximately 161 billion gigabytes of digital content were created, stored, and shared around the world. This is equivalent to twelve stacks of books extending as high as the sun, or approximately six tons of books for every person on the earth (Gantz, 2008) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.emc.com/collateral/analyst-reports/expanding-digital-idc-white-paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of digital content occurring at these rates, educators need to think about digital media's impact not only on student learning but also the legal issues that are connected with it.  The goal of this wikibook is to provide school administrators and educators an overview of some of the legal issues relating to technology in K-12 school systems.  In particular, an overview of some of the most common laws as well as some case studies will be provided.  


== The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA)==
:The Children’s Internet Protection Act, known as CIPA &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cipa.html&lt;/ref&gt;,is a federal law enacted by Congress.  The law was enacted to address concerns about minors having access to and being exposed to offensive content over the Internet. 


:The Neighborhood Children’s Internet Protection Act (N–CIPA), Sec. 1732 of CIPA, imposes certain types of requirements on any K-12 school or library receiving funding from the E-rate&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oii/nonpublic/erate.html&lt;/ref&gt;program. Specifically, N-CIPA requires that any public school or library receiving E-rate discounts to develop and enforce an Internet Safety Policy (ISP).  The policy must address harmful or inappropriate online activities.  In particular, schools and libraries must have the following in place in order to receive discounts offered by the E-rate program:


::~Technology protection measures to block or filter Internet access to pictures that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors.

::~An education program informing minors about appropriate online behavior.  This must include information on cyber bullying as well as information about interacting with other individuals on social networking sites and in chat rooms. 

::~A policy in place to monitor online activities of minors. 

::~A policy that addresses the following: access by minors to inappropriate matter on the Internet; the safety and security of minors when using electronic mail, chat rooms, and other forms of direct electronic communications; unauthorized access, including so-called “hacking,” and other unlawful activities by minors online; unauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of personal information regarding minors; and restricting minors’ access to materials harmful to them. This policy is commonly referred to as an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).

==Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)==
:An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is a written agreement signed by students, their guardians, and their teachers.  An AUP typically identifies the types of tools students will use on the network, defines boundaries of behavior along with the consequences of violating those boundaries, and informs students and parents of the actions that could be taken by the administration in order to maintain the school's network. 


:If a school receives federal funding for their communication technology (see CIPA), then the school is required to develop an Internet Safety Policy (ISP), which is more commonly known as an AUP. Because AUP's tend to be approved by the school board, they are a legal binding document.  More information about a district's AUP can be accessed on the school's Web site.  General information on AUP's can be found at the Virginia Department of Education's Web site&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/Technology/AUP/home.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;.  


== Privacy Rights ==

:'''Privacy Concerns on a School's Network'''
[[File:computer_locked.jpg|left|thumbnail]]Merriam-Webster&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privacy&lt;/ref&gt; defines ''privacy'' as the quality or state of being apart from company or observation. Unfortunately, many experts in the field of Internet security will tell you that privacy over the Internet does not exist. For example, in Bruce Schneier's 2000 book, ''Secrets &amp; Lies'', he elaborates on how privacy is almost non-existent with the Internet and that erasing digital information is, if not impossible, then extremely difficult to do.  Steve Rambam speaks to issue of privacy being non-existent in his presentation entitled ''Privacy is Dead-Get Over it!''&lt;ref&gt;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-383709537384528624&lt;/ref&gt; And CIPA clearly states that in order to protect children on the Internet, schools need to adopt a policy that monitors online activities of minors. In addition to this, most AUP's have a clause stating something similar to the following: &quot;It is often necessary to access user accounts in order to perform routine maintenance and security tasks; Because of this, system administrators have the right to access user accounts, including stored information, in order to uphold this policy and to maintain the system.&quot;


:Fortunately, although it appears pretty much any computer/Internet activity that is conducted in a public educational entity can be monitored, there are some laws that protect a person's privacy.  The following federal laws are the most common ones referred to regarding privacy rights: 

::::::::::~Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 20 USC 1232g (1974)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

::::::::::~Protection of Pupil's Rights Amendments  (PPRA) 20 USC 1232h (1978)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ppra/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

::::::::::~USA Patriot Act, P.L. 107-56 (October 26, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.american.edu/counsel/pages/pdf/patriot_act_summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

::::::::::~Privacy Act of 1974, 5 USC Part I, Ch. 5, Subch. 11, Sec. 552 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/foia/privacy_act.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

::::::::::~Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hipaa.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

::::::::::~The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)&lt;ref&gt;http://legal.web.aol.com/resources/legislation/ecpa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

:Most of these laws protect both students' and adults' privacy.  However, The Patriot Act actually amends the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to allow educational institutions to disclose personal information to the Attorney General if the person is believed to be connected to a terroristic crime. More information on the Privacy Act can be accessed by clicking on the link above. 


:'''Privacy Concerns outside the School's Network'''
:With the onset of social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace, concerns arise as to how private one's personal life is, especially for educators.  An example of this is seen in the case of Stacy Snyder vs. Millersville University&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scribd.com/doc/3352122/SNYDER-v-MILLERSVILLE-UNIVERSITY-et-al-Document-No-46&lt;/ref&gt;.  Ms. Snyder was denied her teaching degree by the University due to a controversial picture that Ms. Snyder posted on her MySpace page. This case is one example of teachers posting questionable content on their personal sites.  Many school districts are now warning teachers to be cautious about their online activities.  Some districts have gone as to create policies to regulate the virtual lives of their employees. Whether or not this violates any privacy concerns or First Amendment Rights has yet to be determined.   


:'''Web Profiling &amp; Search Engines'''
:Web Profiling occurs when an organization monitors your movement on the Internet, collecting information on the sites you travel to, how long you stay on each page, and what you do on these sites. This information is then entered into a database to create a ''Web profile''.  This information can be utilized by marketing firms for advertising. Is this legal? Unfortunately, in most cases, the answer to this is yes.  An interesting example of this pertains to search engines.  When it comes to search engines, ALL information entered into a search engine is saved.  And according to Andrew Brown&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/aug/28/usa.searchengines&lt;/ref&gt;, it is not just information entered in on the search engine that is saved; E-mails, mapquests, account information, etc. So as mentioned in the opening paragraph, most of what we do on the Internet is not private, and there appears at this time, no laws to truly protect one's privacy on the Internet.

==Web Publishing Issues==
:Many schools have Web sites. Some schools post pictures of their students, students' accomplishments, school newsletters, and other samples of student work on their site.  Some districts restrict publishing these documents on their sites. Personal student information that is posted on a school's Web site needs to be explained in a school policy manual such as the student manual policy, the AUP, or some other policy.  And any information identifying a student on a school's Web page should not be done without the student and guardian's permission.  Information about what one can publish on the school's Web site can be retrieved from a school administrator or technology coordinator in one's district&lt;ref&gt;http://teachingtoday.glencoe.com/howtoarticles/internet-safety-and-security-what-teachers-need-to-know&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Copyright Infringement and Plagiarism ==
:With access to the Internet, both copyright infringement and plagiarism are common concerns that need to be addressed with all persons, including students and adults. 


:Copyright Infringement occurs when a person inappropriately reproduces a work that is copyright protected. An example of this is installing a single user software program onto multiple computers. Most work that is copyright protected will identify what may be considered appropriate use of that work.  If it doesn't, it is best to either receive permission from the owner of the copyright or not use the work at all.&lt;ref&gt;http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/FinanceandAdministration/DIIT/WebServices/iaup/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


:Plagiarism involves stealing the work of someone else and passing it off as your own.  &lt;ref&gt;http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/FinanceandAdministration/DIIT/WebServices/iaup/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


:Copyright infringement is illegal.  Although plagiarism is technically not illegal, if it is addressed in a school's AUP, then it technocally is illegal at the local organization Since most AUP's outline information pertaining to copyright infringement and plagiarism, it is critical that both students and adults are aware of the legalities pertaining to both, as well as the consequences at both the school level and court level.


:'''Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization (TEACH) Act&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.com/media/pdfs/CR-Teach-Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;'''
:Although copyright law generally treats digital and non-digital copyright-protected works in a similar manner,special digital uses, such as online distance learning and course management systems, have some exceptions applied to them. These exceptions are addressed in the TEACH Act.


:Under the TEACH Act:
::• Instructors may use a wider range of works in distance learning environments.
::• Students may participate in distance learning sessions from virtually any location.
::• Participants have more latitude when it comes to storing, copying and digitizing materials.

==Computer Fraud and Abuse Act==
:The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act&lt;/ref&gt; is a law passed by the United States Congress that was designed to reduce cracking of computer systems.  It involves instances when a person or persons who commit the following acts:
::~Access a computer without authorization in order to obtain national security data 
::~Intentionally access a computer without authorization to obtain financial records, including consumer records from financial or consumer reporting agencies
::~Obtain information from any department or agency of the United States
::~Obtain information from any protected computer involving interstate or foreign communication
::~Access without authorization a government computer and affect the use of the government's operation of the computer. 
::~Access a protected computer with the intent to defraud and there by obtaining anything of value. 
::~Cause the transmission of a program, information, code, or command that causes damage or intentionally accesses a computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, causes damage. 
::~Knowingly and with the intent to defraud,traffic a password or similar information through which a computer may be accessed without authorization.

{{DEFAULTSORT:&lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/gallery&gt;}}&lt;h1&gt;Finding Educational Technology Grants&lt;/h1&gt;
[[Image:Magnifying_Glass_Photo.jpg|200px|thumbnail]]



As of June 2009 a search for 'finding technology grants' on Google returns over thirty four '''million''' search results!  A search for the exact phrase &quot;technology grants&quot; + education returns over one hundred thousand search results.  It is difficult to know where to begin.  

The goal of this section of the wikibook is to get you started in your search for grants by discussing reliable sources of grants available on the internet and to help you write '''your'''  grant applications well.


[[Image:ImportantGrantTerms.jpg‎|left|frame|&lt;ref name=&quot;grantLecture&quot;&gt;Garrigan, S. (2009, May 28). Lecture presented in TLT 474. Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The focus of this chapter will be on competitive grants.  Competitive grants are typically decided based on how well the applicants project design matches with the purpose of the grant.  The grant will often explain in detail exactly how an application will be scored (and ultimately awarded) based on points for each criteria they are looking for &lt;ref name=&quot;grantLecture&quot;&gt;Garrigan, S. (2009, May 28). Lecture presented in TLT 474. Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA&lt;/ref&gt;.

===www.edu.gov===
As you begin your search for technology grants, a good place to begin is on the U.S. Department of Education Website specifically on the [http://www.ed.gov/fund/grants-apply.html?src=rt 'Apply for a Grant page'].  This website attempts to guide the grant novice by providing numerous links to some of their most frequently asked navigation questions such as [http://www.ed.gov/fund/grants-apply.html?src=rt 'How do I Find Grants to Apply For?']. The site also has a useful help section which features their most commonly asked questions such as [http://www.ed.gov/help/search/tips/index.html how to best target your grant searches].  In addition there is a [http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/os/technology/edgrants.html Web page on the site that lists grants specifically for '''Technology in Education'''].

Another useful page to monitor regularly on the '''www.edu.gov''' is the [http://www.ed.gov/news/fedregister/announce/index.html Federal Register Announcements page].  This page is updated daily to display the most recently made available grants.  It is also searchable.

Edu.gov also offers a subscription to a weekly email notification of federal teaching and learning resources and Department of Education funding opportunities.  More about this weekly email can be found [http://www.ed.gov/news/newsletters/edinfo/index.html here].

Grants.gov was established in 2002 as part of the presidents 2002 Fiscal Year Management Agenda with a goal to improve government services to the public &lt;ref&gt;About Grants.gov. (n.d.). Retrieved June 20, 2009, from http://www07.grants.gov/aboutgrants/about_grants_gov.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;. In recent years this website has established itself as '''the''' one-stop-shop for finding federal grants &lt;ref name=&quot;findingFunding&quot;&gt;Brewer, E.W., &amp; Achilles, C. (2007). Finding funding: Grantwriting from start to finish, including project management and internet use. Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press&lt;/ref&gt;.

This Website offers several ways to [http://www07.grants.gov/search/basic.do search for or browse grants].  Options include:
*'''Basic Search by Keyword, Funding Opportunity Number or CFDA number'''&lt;br&gt;The ''Funding Opportunity Number'' is a unique identifier for each grant in the grants.gov system.  It maybe be useful to organize your grant information by Funding Opportunity Number  &lt;ref name=&quot;findingFunding&quot;&gt;Brewer, E.W., &amp; Achilles, C. (2007). Finding Funding: Grantwriting From Start to Finish, Including Project Management and Internet Use. Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press&lt;/ref&gt;.  CFDA stands for Catolog of Federal Domestic Assistance &lt;ref&gt;Home - CFDA. (n.d.). Retrieved June 24, 2009, from https://www.cfda.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;.

*'''Browse by Category'''&lt;br&gt; This page allows the grant researcher to look at available grants by category.  Available categories include Education, Energy, Arts, Food &amp; Nutrition and many more.  This capability makes it possible to search for one type of grant (e.g. Education) across many agencies &lt;ref name=&quot;findingFunding&quot;&gt;Brewer, E.W., &amp; Achilles, C. (2007). Finding Funding: Grantwriting From Start to Finish, Including Project Management and Internet Use. Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press&lt;/ref&gt;.

*'''Browse by Agency'''&lt;br&gt; Agencies in this section include the Department of Education*

*'''Advanced Search'''&lt;br&gt;The Advanced Search allows you to get very granular in your search for specific types of grants.  Search criteria includes grant status (e.g. closed or open), date, eligibility (e.g. school districts, Native American Tribes, nonprofits) and category.

Grants.gov also offers a mailing list '''and''' an RSS feed so you can easily monitor newly available grants.  See their [http://www07.grants.gov/applicants/email_subscription.jsp subscriptions] page for more information.   

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;It appears as though grants.gov and edu.gov list the same grant opportunities.  It is unclear why one would chose to use the edu.gov site over the grants.gov site.

===Foundations===
Aside from the government, private foundations are another source for grants.  There are several types of foundations such as private, federated funds (pools donations to benefit the community), corporate, community and financial institutions.  [http://foundationcenter.org/ The Foundation Center] is one place to start when searching for foundation funding activities.  This Website charges annual subscription rates of between $195 and $1,295 per year.  The higher the subscription price, the more features made available to you on their Website.  Their basic subscription allows you to search their foundation database by location, type of grant a foundation makes and the foundation area of interest. 

Some of their information is available for '''free offline''' in what they call &quot;cooperating collections&quot; which are primary located in libraries and other nonprofit resource centers.  Learn more about cooperating collections [http://foundationcenter.org/collections/ here].

&lt;h1&gt;Understanding Grants&lt;/h1&gt;

===Important Terms===
*'''In-Kind''': The grant money received must be matched by your organization.  These funds do not always have to be matched with money.  It is possible to demonstrate matching with the value of the use of existing computer while executing the grant for example&lt;ref name=&quot;grantLecture&quot;&gt;Garrigan, S. (2009, May 28). Lecture presented in TLT 474. Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*'''LEA''': (''Local Educational Agency'') A grant indicated as LEA means the grant is only available to public schools &lt;ref name=&quot;onlyBook&quot;&gt;Karsh, E., &amp; Fox, A.S. (2006). The only grant-writing book you'll ever need. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;.
*'''Direct Grants''': A direct grant is a grant you apply for directly through the federal government&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;Browning, Beverly (2009). Grant writing for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*'''Pass-through grants''': A pass-through grant is federal money distributed through your state&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;Browning, Beverly (2009). Grant writing for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===How to quickly evaluate a grant: Is it right for your organization?===
When you find a grant announcement that matches your basic criteria, use the following four steps to quickly prequalify the grant for further investigation&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;Browning, Beverly (2009). Grant writing for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*'''Eligible Applicants'''&lt;br&gt;A Good first step is too take a look at who is eligible for the grant &lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;Browning, Beverly (2009). Grant writing for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*'''Deadline'''&lt;br&gt;A grants deadline may also influence your decision as to whether this grant is right for your organization.  The deadline is typically listed in the first few pages of the grant announcement &lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;Browning, Beverly (2009). Grant writing for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;.
*'''Estimated Average Award Size'''&lt;br&gt;Is the size of the grant enough to fund your project?  If not, where will the rest of the funds come from &lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;Browning, Beverly (2009). Grant writing for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;?
*'''Estimated Number of Awards'''&lt;br&gt;This number will help to give you an idea of how good your chances are at being awarded this grant&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;Browning, Beverly (2009). Grant writing for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;.



&lt;h1&gt;How to Write Effective Grant Applications&lt;/h1&gt;
Writing a grant application is a very difficult and time consuming process. The following are some general tips for writing a grant application. 





&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;''' Helpful Hints for Grant Application Writing'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
*Make sure to have the approval and commitment from the administration within your school district before carrying out the process of applying for a grant.
* Read the guidelines carefully and make sure that the grant you're applying for fits your needs.
* Read ''ALL'' of the directions and follow them carefully.
* Make sure you have a solid idea and plenty of supporting details.
* Involve others to build a commitment to the project so that there is plenty of support to carry out the project ''if'' it does get funded.
* Before jumping into this process, make sure the funding will be sufficient for the project.&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, Max, Gerald D. Bailey (2004). The technology coordinator's handbook. International Society for Technology in Education.&lt;/ref&gt; 


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Helpful Tips for Your Request to Proposal'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The funder ALWAYS has a set of guidelines telling you what they want to see in a funding request. As you read through the request for proposal, you need to make sure that you understand completely how the funders define their terms. You also need to consider whether there's more than one way to interpret what they're asking for.
*If you don't understand what they're asking for, call or e-mail them!&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;Browning, Beverly (2009). Grant writing for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''All funders basicially ALWAYS ask for the following three blocks of information.'''
*Information about your organization and its qualifications.
*Information about the specific project for which you're seeking funding.
*A narrative about what you intend to do with the money if you receive it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;Browning, Beverly (2009). Grant writing for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Helpful Hints (Information about your organization and its qualifications)'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

'''*The funder will ask for the legal name of the organization applying:''' Make sure to list your organization's '''legal''' name in this section. For public schools or school districts, the legal name is the incorporated name.

'''*Type of applicant''': For this part of the request, you just check the box that best describes your organization.

'''*Year founde'''d: Enter the year that your organization was created.

'''*Current operating budget''': For the budget, make sure to supply the funder with your operating budget total for the current fiscal year.

'''*Employer identification number and DUNS number''': This portion of the form is asking you for the seven- digit employer identification number assigned to your organization by the Internal Revenue Service.

'''*Organization's fiscal year:''' This is the twelve month time frame that your organization considers to be its operating, or fiscal year.

'''*Congressional districts:''' This is where you list all of the congressional districts in which your organization is located. *If you don't know this information, you can contact the public library*

'''*Contact person information:''' The individual who takes care of grant or cooperative agreement negotiations should be the contact person when applying for a grant.

'''*Telephone/fax/e-mail information''': Make sure to list the contact person's telephone, fax numbers *with area code* as well as an e-mail address.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;Browning, Beverly (2009). Grant writing for dummies. Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''The following are helpful hints below about the five most important parts of a grant application; specific aims, background and significance, preliminary studies and progress reports, research designs and methods, and proofreading your application.''' 




&lt;u&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'''Specific aims:'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
This is what you intend to do; a strong grant application has a strong and solid hypothesis with clear research objectives. Basically specific aims is a formal statement of the objectives and milestones of the research project towards testing the hypothesis. Specific aims should include the following:
*specific research objectives
*be hypothesis based
*be obtainable within the proposed timeframe
*fit together in an overall framework
*be well focused rather than broad
*limited to '''ONE''' page&lt;ref name=&quot;nih&quot;&gt;http://grants.nih.gov/grants/writing_application.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Background and Significance:'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
This portrays why the work is important; this section states the research problem, including the rationale, current state of knowledge, and potential contributions and significance of your research to the field. The following are some helpful tips when preparing this portion of the grant application:
*Two to three pages is recommended for the background and significance section
*Highlight potential impacts
*Identify controversies that the project is designed to resolve.
*Specify existing gaps that the project is intended to fill.
*References should reflect up to date knowledge of the field.
*Highlight why research findings are important beyond the confines of the specific research project
*Convey the importance and relevance of research aims.&lt;ref name=&quot;nih&quot;&gt;http://grants.nih.gov/grants/writing_application.htm&lt;/ref&gt;                                    


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Preliminary Studies/ Progress Report:'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
This section can be used to describe your prior work relevant to the proposed project. This can consist of your own publications. Make sure to have a solid body of preliminary data that demonstrates the probable success of your research. The following are some helpful hints when preparing this portion of the grant application:
*Discuss how previous work leads to the current proposal.
*Accuracy and overall presentation are important in figures, tables, and graphs.
*If you do not have the required expertise for a specific methodology, enlist a collaborator or consultant. (Make sure to include a letter of support or agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;nih&quot;&gt;http://grants.nih.gov/grants/writing_application.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Research Design and Methods'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
This section goes along with the narrative about what you plan to do with the money if you receive it.
Use this section to describe how you plan to carry out the research. Your research methods should relate directly to the aims you've described. This section is critical for demonstrating that the applicant has developed a clear, organized, and thoughtful study design that tests the central hypothesis. This section is '''NOT''' a list of recipes for methods, experiments, and data collection. The following are some helpful hints when preparing this portion of the grant application:
*Should provide an overview of the proposed design and conceptual framework. 
*Study goals should relate to proposed study hypotheses. 
*Include details related to specific methodology; explain why the proposed methods are the best to accomplish study goals. 
*Describe any novel concepts, approaches, tools or techniques. 
*Include details of how data will be collected and results analyzed. 
*Consider required statistical techniques. 
*Include proposed work plan and timeline. 
*Consider and discuss potential limitations and alternative approaches to achieve study aims. 
*Keep in mind that a carefully developed research plan will also be reflected in a realistic and well-justified budget for the project, whether it is a modular or non-modular budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;nih&quot;&gt;http://grants.nih.gov/grants/writing_application.htm&lt;/ref&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Proofreading and Editing your Grant Application'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
* Make sure you allow a sufficient amount of time to go back and edit the application. 

* Make sure to allot time for colleagues, mentors, and collaborators to review and edit the grant application.

* It is generally a great idea to have an independent expert provide an objective critique of your application.

* Last but '''DEFINITELY''' not least, you need to make sure you have '''ZERO''' tolerance for typographical errors, misspellings, grammatical mistakes, and/or sloppy formating. An application with any of these errors will lead reviewers to think that your research is conducted in the same manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;nih&quot;&gt;http://grants.nih.gov/grants/writing_application.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unit 9 Discussion'''

As I was reading over the past class's work, I noticed that a missing piece in their page was &quot;the human factor&quot; as Schneier calls it. I would like to develop a page that discusses why good professional development and/or staff training would be necessary in a school district to keep information more secure. As Schneier (2000) says, &quot;humans are the weakest link in a chain of security&quot; (p. 266). Susan--[[User:Stomchak|Stomchak]] ([[User talk:Stomchak|talk]]) 16:21, 22 March 2010 (UTC)

Sue- this seems like a great topic to add to the wikibook.  The human factor plays such a large role in security that its important to touch on --[[User:Thomernie|Erin Thomas]] ([[User talk:Thomernie|talk]]) 16:53, 28 March 2010 (UTC)more.&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Insert non-formatted text here&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I think I might address security policies for mobile technologies such as phones, ipods, etc.  - K. Covey 

''K. Covey, thank you for looking into this topic. I believe that districts need to start addressing possibly using letting students using mobile technologies for class work.''--[[User:Stomchak|Stomchak]] ([[User talk:Stomchak|talk]]) 15:10, 27 March 2010 (UTC)
K. Covey- this is a good idea to focus on.  Mobile technologies are so widely used today and I haven't seen much information on security policies for these types of devices.--[[User:Thomernie|Erin Thomas]] ([[User talk:Thomernie|talk]]) 16:53, 28 March 2010 (UTC)
K. Covey - I would love to read about the topic of cell phones in relation to education since I am considering having my students use their cell phones in the classroom. - D. Kellner

I'd like to devote my topic to malicious software, viruses, worms, trojan horses, etc. Ch 10 of Schneier's book and Ch 4 of Computer Security Basics both have good info, and there are more resources available. - D. Mulherin
Dean:
This is a great topic.  I can use some resources for this b/c I am not very familiar with this.

--[[User:Thomernie|Thomernie]] ([[User talk:Thomernie|talk]]) 14:23, 27 March 2010 (UTC)For my wiki page I would like to focus on network defenses such as firewalls, DMZs, email security, etc.
Erin--[[User:Thomernie|Thomernie]] ([[User talk:Thomernie|talk]]) 14:28, 27 March 2010 (UTC)

Help! I have no idea what I would even consider addressing. I will think some more, but any ideas would be appreciated. - D. Kellner

''What about a page devoted to case studies in information security?''--[[User:Stomchak|Stomchak]] ([[User talk:Stomchak|talk]]) 15:10, 27 March 2010 (UTC)

What a great idea. This would help schools understand the risks from the point of view of what has happened previously.  Thank you so much. - D. Kellner

How about something with encryption and or cryptography.  I found these topics to be somewhat difficult to understand so maybe putting some of the information in layman's terms would help visitors to this wikibook.--[[User:Thomernie|Erin Thomas]] ([[User talk:Thomernie|talk]]) 16:53, 28 March 2010 (UTC)

Thanks, but unfortunately, I also found these topics, although fascinating, difficult and foreign. I don't think I would be able to do a good job making them easy to understand. - D. Kellner
Darlene:
Why don't you look at social websites and the policies developed for schools? This is a hot topic on the CFF Listserv.-KCovey
I wanted to take a look at CIPA, FERPA and HIPAA in regards to school information security. I have already found some information about how each of these impact the creation and implementation of information security plans in schools. The references I have found thus far are:

 |Curr=Framing stage
 |Prev=One frame at a time
 |Next=Understand strategy}}

==Understanding the frame of reference==

The purpose of the framing stage is to gain a better understanding of the decision maker's view of the world.  Understanding the strategy for a company requires consolidating the views of all decision makers in the strategy diagrams.  The final Strategy Map is the official and explicit strategy for the company.  The Strategy Map is then used to build the architecture each frame.  

In the previous chapter we argued that decision makers make rational choices based on limited resources.  Decision makers use values and beliefs to build cognitive lenses used to transform limited information into useful knowledge about the world.  Values influence their preferences regarding outcomes. Gaining a better understanding of these cognitive structures, called a frame of reference, is the first step in the framing stage.

At the heart of the framing stage is the understanding both of the frame of reference and the need for the frame owner to carry out the strategy.  Both of these items combine to influence the building of the frame.  Decision makers frame policies in terms of conceptual lenses that have significant consequences for their behavior.  Their reference frame filters data so they can make sense of the world.  What the decision maker sees and judges as important is based on information that passes through &quot;conceptual lenses&quot; that all individuals use to make sense of information.

The frame must help the decision maker in this process.  The business analyst must uncover are the conceptual lenses that shape how the decision maker views the world.  Companies produce huge quantities of data.  The decision maker has theories regarding how to evaluate the data.  Specifically, he or she chooses to focus on certain details but ignores other details.  The frame should facilitate this process by filtering certain data and focusing on other data.

==Frame of Reference and BI Systems==

How does the frame of reference help us build a Business Intelligence System?  Barberg argues &quot;Why waste time and effort on developing reports, analytical capabilities, and data marts if you have not first gained agreement on which are the most important things to measure and analyze in order to execute your specific business strategy?&quot;  This is a critical point.  You focus on and measuring activities that you want to influence.  Strategy makers identify important activities critical to profitability.  For instance, Southwest Airlines identifies quick gate turnaround as an important activity.  All activities focus on achieving the fastest gate turnaround.  Southwest originally averaged a gate turnaround time of 10 minutes, with longer turnaround times requiring a written explanation for the delay.  Later the average was 15 minutes.  Then, after substantial growth, the airline maintained a 25-minute turnaround [http://www.southwest.com/about_swa/southwest_cares/our_planet.html].  While the company was not able to maintain the industry first 10 minute gate turnaround, this is still a critical activity.

This is why the first step in build a BI system is to understand the strategy and the important activities that achieve operational and strategic effectiveness.  BI must allow decision makers fast and efficient access to the information necessary to evaluate operational and strategic effectiveness by focusing on processes/activities.  

Building a BI system requires understanding the decision maker's frame of reference regarding how they interpret the strategy and understanding how to achieve goals.  Their frame of reference will show which measures of operational and strategic performance to include in the BI system.  Using an architecture based on a frame of reference creates a system that allows the decision maker to effectively and efficiently access information regarding these measures.

==Scorecards as Frames of Reference==

This book argues that using the balanced scorecard approach allows the BI architect to build a system based on reference frames.  A frame of reference is a complicated cognative structure.  It is not possible to capture the whole frame.  However, it is only necessary to catpure that part of the frame that is necessary for building the BI system.


In one of Norton &amp; Kaplan’s most-referenced case studies, Mobil Oil’s North American Marketing and Refining division had been reporting and analyzing the gasoline sales of the services stations that purchased their product and sell it to the public (see [http://www.businessintelligence.com/print.asp?id=26&amp;type=article&amp;page=PAGE4 Barberg]). By using the balanced scorecard approach Mobil turned their focus from measuring and reporting on total gasoline sales to the sale of premium-grade gasoline only.  Based on the notion that “you get what you measure” they focused on measuring a different type of behavior. This seems incomplete from a bottom up perspective as it ignores a great deal of data.  However, the objective of a BSC measure is to focus attention rather than provide the most complete analysis. Again, in the realm of BI, the measures are primarily determined by the data that is available for analysis. The BSC approach emphasizes the process of identifying the “critical few” measures that drive the successful execution of strategy.[http://www.businessintelligence.com/print.asp?id=26&amp;type=article&amp;page=PAGE4]

==Scorecards and BI architecture==

The final stage in developing the frame is to use the scorecard in the BI architecture.  Architecture here means blueprint.  The structure of the frame revolves around bring information, based on analyzing the scorecard, to the decision maker.

One way to do this is to build an architecture with a dashboard at the center of a reporting system.  A dashboard presentsa concise view of the most important measures of success.  For instance, assume a decision maker at a railroad such as Union Pacific would want to know how fast terminals put trains move through terminals.  Trains must remain in terminals to load and off-load cargo and take on fuel, for example.  The longer a train remains in the terminal the less time it spends moving cargo.  An initiative that successfully reduced terminal dwell would help free up trains.  The decision maker would need to know if the initiative was successful.

A scorecard would help identify the measures necessary to determine if the initiative was successful.  The initiative might be called the &quot;Cycle Time Optimization Program.&quot;  The objective of this initiative would be faster terminal turnaround.  The measures of success would be terminal dwell and on-time departure rates.  The decision maker would focus on these two measures to determine if initiative was achieving its objective.

The BI architecture should explicitly include items from the scorecard, here terminal dwell and on-time departure rates.  The decision maker should be able to determine, at a glance, if the company is achieving this objective.  This information would appear on the dashboard.  If the measures were not exceeding expectations then the decision maker should be able to access reports providing detailed information on both terminal dwell and the rate of on-time departures.  This would help the decision maker diagnose the problem and take corrective measures.

==Conclusion==
Frames incorporate knowledge into the BI system architecture.  This is done by embedding scorecards directly into the BI system.  This is because scorecards are a means to diagram knowledge about strategy.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE LAW AND THE PRIESTHOOD==
With the new covenant, there was a complete change of priesthood.  The covenant at Sinai was initially set up incorporating the existing patriarchal priesthood with Aaron and his sons added to serve in the ministry of the High Priesthood over the nation.  However, with the sin of the Golden Calf, the priesthood was changed from the firstborn tribal heads and in place of them, the Levites who had been faithful, were appointed to the priesthood  (Exodus 13:2,13; 22:29; 32:25-29; Numbers  3:13; 8:17).

==THE RELATION OF THE COVENANT TO THE PRIESTHOOD==
Yahweh first set the covenant which He was going to make with the people before them when they arrived at Sinai, saying to them,  &quot;'Now therefore if you will obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure unto Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&quot;&quot;  (Exodus 19:5-6a)  Note, that this is before He spoke the commandments to them while they still retained the patriarchal priesthood.  It was a covenant agreement based on their obedience whereupon, He would make them His &quot;special treasure&quot;, a &quot;kingdom of priests&quot; and a &quot;holy nation&quot;.

With their consent to the covenant, they were given His laws which they were to obey  (Exodus 19:7-8). Yahweh God then spoke to them Himself the ten basic principles of His Law  (Exodus 20:1-17). Then Moses went up the mountain to receive the remainder of the instructions for them at their request and His consent, that He not continue to speak directly to them  (Exodus 19:18-21).  Them Moses returned and proceeded to give them the remaining instructions which are in Chapters 20-24 of Exodus.  So all the basic laws were given before the sin with the Golden Calf.  This includes the Sabbath and the Feasts with other social principles. Then the offerings and furniture for the Tabernacle follow in Chs. 25-30.  Notice - there is no mention of the Levitical priesthood during this time, only that of the High priest and his sons.

Yahweh's original intention was that they be a nation of priests led by the firstborn of each household and the oversight of a High priest from the lineage of Aaron. Instead they became a nation with a Priesthood.

So we see here that the priesthood with which the covenant was formed was changed when the nation sinned and broke the covenant, and the Levitical priesthood was put in place with all the rituals and ceremonies that pertained to making atonement for the sins of the nation (Leviticus 1-7).  These daily offerings culminated in a final cleansing being made each year by the High Priest on the Day of Atonement (Lev.16).

With the breaking of the covenant, Moses had to make atonement for the sin of the people (Exodus 32:30-35) as well as intercede for them and renew the covenant which is outlined in Chapter 34; particularly verses 10-11, repeating the main points of the previous covenant and adding to it a promise of driving out the inhabitants of Canaan (verse 11) with an added warning against the sins of idolatry they had just committed (verses 12-17), together with an exhortation to keep His Feasts rather than the pagan forms of worship in which they had just indulged, in the worship with the Golden Calf (verses 18-26).

This was a new covenant on the same condition of obedience, &quot;Observe what I command you this day ...&quot; (34:11) with some changes to the benefits of the covenant, the same Law but a different priesthood.  This is basically what took place with the institution of what we know as the &quot;new covenant&quot;. There were better promises added to the covenant, but the same law with a change in the priesthood.

==THE CHANGES IN THE PRIESTHOOD==
The priesthood was changed from the patriarchal form of the firstborn sons representing the family in priestly service to that of one tribe performing the service for the nation at Sinai (Exodus 32:26-29; Numbers 1:47-53).
Abraham functioned in this form of priestly service over his household (in which Lot was included) toward Melchizedek, the High Priest of his day (Genesis 15:18-21; 18:19, 23-32).

David, as one that rose above the system of his time, entered into the Melchizedek-type priesthood wherein he worshipped apart from the established system in a Tabernacle where he entered into the very Presence of Yahweh God, before the Ark (1 Chronicles 15:1-28).  Born of the tribe of Judah, as was Yeshua his descendant, he had no right to serve as a priest after the Levitical order. But as a priest after the order of Melchizedek, he went beyond his era and established a type of the Messiah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah who would come as a High priest after the order of Melchizedek  (Psalm 110:1, 4; Hebrews 5:5-6).

Sacrifices were still performed in David's tabernacle because the Messiah had not yet come, but other than that the worship was a twenty-four hour a day worship service before the earthly throne of God (1Chr.16:37-43).

He established a different form for the rituals and ceremonies for the priestly services which were incorporated into the Temple service after it was built. The law for the priesthood of the tribe of Levi was not applicable for the priesthood of the Lion of the tribe of Judah  --  i.e. the Melchizedek priesthood in which he functioned.

The reversion to the Melchizedek order was not perpetuated in his son Solomon when he built the Temple, although some of it was incorporated into it. What David entered into beyond the veil was one of a kind. But it wrought a change and a progression in the Levitical priesthood to a form similar to that which will be carried forward in the Millennial Temple  (Ezekiel Chs.40-46 )

==THE MELCHIZEDEK PRIESTHOOD==
It was the Melchizedek priesthood that was re-instated with Yeshua as our High Priest of the new Covenant, over a &quot;kingdom of Priests&quot;  (1 Peter 2:5-9).  He became the Melchizedek that was pre-figured at that time.

With the reinstatement of the Melchizedek priesthood, the covenant was also renewed back to its original form of them being a &quot;kingdom of priests&quot; rather than a kingdom with priests which was Yahweh's original intention for them. The proviso in the Levitical priesthood was an intermediary one, because they were stiff-necked and hard of heart (Exodus 33:5 Acts 7:51; Hebrews 3:16-19); it was never intended to be permanent.

All the form of service, the ceremonies and the rituals, pertained to the Levitical priesthood; they did not exist with the previous Melchizedek priesthood. Nor was there a physical Tabernacle in which to perform the service of priesthood in that order of priesthood. It was based upon faith in a direct personal relationship between each functioning priest and the promised Messiah whom they knew as the Word, the Son of the Father (Prov. 30:4). 

And so, with the reinstatement of the Melchizedek order, the rituals and ceremonies associated with the Levitical order were not required. Nor is an earthly Temple required because we, as living stones have been made the corporate temple of the living God (1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Peter 2:5). Also, the sacrifices we offer are spiritual sacrifices, which are our prayers and the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His Name (Ephesians 6:10-18; Hebrews 13:14-16) to our High Priest, who ever lives to make intercession for us  (Hebrews 7:13-16, 23-25).

So now, we have a High Priest who is ministering in the true tabernacle erected by God of which the law pertaining to the rituals and ordinances was a but a pattern.  The earthly pattern has been superseded by the reality which is taking place in heaven now by our High priest.  Hebrews 8:1-2

All animal sacrifices were instituted for the atonement for sin. With Messiah offering Himself as the Lamb of God for the sin of the world, there is not only no need for the sacrifices, but there is no need for all of the requirements necessary for the priests to perform those sacrifices, as was so clearly demonstrated when the veil of the Temple was torn from top to bottom with Yeshua's perfect and complete sacrifice  (Hebrews 7:27).

Now He is the mediator of a better covenant based upon better promises and a better priesthood in a better temple; that of a spiritual nature, rather than that of an earthly Sanctuary (Hebrews 8:7-13). The priesthood has been made higher and eternal by Messiah, and so the service concerning that priesthood has been made higher as well. We are all a royal priesthood now, serving in the Melchizedek order in the heavenly sanctuary.

&quot;He has made us unto our God, a kingdom of priests, and we shall reign on the earth&quot;  (Revelation 5:10)

|description =Pipsissewa (pip-'''sis'''-sue-wah) is an low-growing evergreen closely related to wintergreen.  It grows 4-10 inches tall, and has shiny, bright green leaves arranged in opposite pairs or whorls of 3-4 along the stem. Leaves have a shallowly toothed edge, where the teeth have fine hairs at their ends. The flowers are white or pink, produced in a small group of 4-8 together.  The flowers rise well above the leaves.  If you're lucky enough to find one of these in bloom, be sure to look on the underside of the flower.  That's where most of its decoration is.
|facts =Pipsissewa is used as a flavoring in candy and soft drinks, particularly root beer.  The word &quot;Pipsissewa&quot; is a Cree name meaning &quot;It-breaks-into-small-pieces&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Systems==

==Digital systems==
Medium format digital systems differentiate themselves from 35mm DSLR type cameras by having a larger sensor, usually a CCD. However many medium format cameras can also be described as Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR).
*Hasselblad H system, eg HD3II-50 (50 megapixel 36×48mm sensor), leaf shutter lenses
*PhaseOne digital backs, compatible with a variety of cameras, eg P65+ camera back (53.9x40.4 mm, 60.5 megapixels)
*Leaf system using the Rollei mount, Leaf Aptus-II 10 (56x36mm snesor, 56 megapixels) [http://www.leafamerica.com/ShowProductDetails/MenuID/975/ParentMenuID/314/]
*Sinar Hy6 system using the Rollei mount

===Scanning type===
*Seitz 6x17 Digital

==Film systems==
Medium format film photography systems generally use roll film that is 6cm wide; either 120 film that is 72cm long with a paper backing or 220 film that is twice as long with no paper backing. Different systems use different aspect ratios, such as the smaller 6×4.5cm film size (also known as 645), the square 6×6cm format up to the panoramic 6×17cm format. The actual image size on the film is slightly smaller than the stated value, for example the Mamiya 645 system creates images sizes of 5.6x4.15cm[http://www.mamiya.com/645afd-iii.html#Specifications].
  
===6×4.5cm===
*Hasselblad H system, eg H2F camera, autofocus leaf shutter lenses
*Mamiya 645 system, eg 645 AFD III, autofocus, focal place shutter

===6×6cm===
*Rollei, eg 6008AF camera, autofocus on selected Schneider lenses. Zeiss manual focus lenses also available. Leaf shutter.

===6×7cm===
*Mamiya 7 system. Rangefinder with leaf shutter.

===6×17cm===
*Linhof Technorama, 5 Schneider lenses, groundglass and shift adapter available

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;''And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us (as Yeshua the Messiah), and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth''.&quot;  John 1:14

He was full of grace and truth, the two pre-dominant qualities of the Father who is love and light. See 1 John 4:16 (Love) &amp; 1 John 1:5 (Light)

God's love is manifested in His undeserved favour and blessing toward us which is made manifest in Yeshua our Messiah enabling us through faith to walk in His truth.

Walking in His truth is living according to His commandments which is called the Law. 

Through the impartation of His life, we also are enabled to walk in that same balance of grace and truth, or as it is referred to by the apostles, &quot;faith and works&quot;, enjoying His love and favour in keeping His commands.

This requires that we live from the source of His life and not from our own soulishly motivated efforts to obey His commandments. We must live from the Tree of Life and not from the Tree of The Knowledge of Good and Evil.

Thanks for participating in this book, but should it be depended on the point of view of the west? for example &quot;Amnesty attacks Saudi Arabia applying of Sharia law in retribution (killing who kills)&quot;.was replaced with &quot;Against the use of applying Sharia law when violating human rights&quot; so now Amnesty doesn't attack but Sharia law violate human rights!!? 

I don't recall that we all agreed on what is the &quot;Human Rights&quot; and I believe we have different thoughts about it. I'm going to change the sentence. does any one have some thing to say? [[User:الحارث بن همام|الحارث بن همام]] ([[User talk:الحارث بن همام|talk]]) 03:42, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

: I updated the text shortly thereafter.  Amnesty International shares its thoughts of human rights as dictated by several UN articles on the same subject.   The problem with your sentence is that you cherrypicked an event.   This is more of a POV agenda against Amnesty International.  Please don't do this.  Amnesty International is against anything stated by the UN to be an infringement of human rights regardless of what a religion or any other doctrine may say.   These beliefs by this organization are stated on their webpage.  Whether or not you like it does not change the fact that you must keep this NPOV.  -- [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 04:10, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE TWO TREES===
There were two trees in the garden planted by Yahweh in the midst of the Paradise He had prepared for His son, the first Adam.  Two significant trees whereby his destiny would be determined.

One was the 'tree of life'
and the other was 'the tree of the knowledge of good and evil'

What was the significance of these two trees?   What did they symbolise?

A simple command &quot;Do not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil&quot;

Why not eat of that tree?

Isn't it good to know what is good and what is evil?

Why should they not eat of it?


We know the end of the story!   They did eat, and they did die.  They died spiritually because their life was dependent upon being in union with their Father Yahweh, their Creator and Sustainer.  They had no life in themselves. Unlike the angels He had created, they were mortal and corruptible.  When they became independent from Him, their life-source was cut and spiritual death was the result.

Yahweh in His mercy reached out to them and provided a way back, an atonement to make them AT-ONE with Him again.  A sacrificial lamb to die in their place that they might live.

And He clothed their spiritual nakedness with the skins of the lamb He had provided for them.  Their unrighteousness was 'covered' by the atonement of the sacrificial lamb.

They were covered with His righteousness, the covering provided by His lamb in type of THE Lamb that was to come, Yeshua our Messiah.

&quot;Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!&quot;   John 1:29

The shed blood of the lamb to atone for the sin of man.  The death of one and the offering of its life-blood as a substitute for another.  The righteous for the unrighteous.  The innocent for the guilty.

And so, Yahweh provided a way for the unrighteous to become righteous.
They who had lost the garments of righteousness (spiritual garments of light and glory) which they had while in communion with Him were now 'covered over' by His provision for them. 
Their spiritual nakedness did not appear while they accepted the way He had provided.

In Chapter 3 of Genesis, Yahweh led them through the steps of confessing and repenting of their wrong-doing so He could bring them back into a relationship with Himself again by a sacrificial lamb.  Howbeit, no longer with the same position and privilege that they had in the garden.

But they had the promise of One who was to come who would one day re-instate them to their former glory.   The promise of a Messiah/Saviour!

For His manifestation they waited in faith, by offering the acceptable sacrifices for the covenant Yahweh God has established with them to atone for their sinful state.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE TWO WAYS===
By faith Abel offered to Yahweh a 'more excellent sacrifice' than Cain through which he obtained witness that he was righteous    Hebrew 11:4

Why was Abel's sacrifice 'more excellent' than Cain?  (The Greek for 'excellent is 'PLEIOU' from the word 'PLEROMA' meaning 'fulness')

A more excellent sacrifice!   And why was that so?  

It came from a full and complete obedience which measured up to the standard of His requirements.  It was therefore a more complete fulfillment of the requirement which Yahweh had given them than the one performed by Cain.
They were both either taught the sacrifices to be given by their parents or else Abel gained the understanding of what Yahweh required by revelation given to him through the  relationship he had with Him, and out of an obedient heart, offered the right sacrifice.

And so, in humility of heart he brought the sacrificial lamb as the substitute for his own sinful state, his shortfall before the presence of a holy God.

What could atone for his sin?  -   nothing but the blood of a pure innocent lamb!
What a price!  A tender life from his own flock had to die to pay the penalty of his sinful state.

Nothing of himself - only a plea for acceptance.
Can you imagine him proceeding forward with trepidation lest his sacrifice be not accepted? 

But, he had met the requirements and Yahweh  witnessed to the acceptance of his sacrifice and  gave him the witness that he was righteous.  His sin was atoned for by faith in the revealed manner of a sacrificial lamb.

And what was wrong with Cain's sacrifice?    Why was it inferior?

Cain brought that in which he had invested a lot of thought, that which had cost him a lot of time, a lot of energy and it was a sustained effort in which he had needed to maintain and  apply all his skill, wisdom and talents.  He had put his heart into producing the very best that the ground could bring forth using every talent with which he had been endowed.

With great deliberation he chose the very best quality and put together an offering worthy of the Creator of all and proceeded with great delight and pride in the work of his hands to present this gift to Yahweh.

He expected commendation and praise for the fruit of his labour   (see Genesis 4:2b-4)
	
BUT
:He was rejected!

:::::Why was it not accepted?

:::::What had he done wrong?

Firstly, we may assume either he had not enquired of Yahweh to see what was required or else had gone against what he knew to be right, but whatever, he devised his own plan, his own way!

Then what he did was based on the wrong assumption that Yahweh would accept him in his fallen state on his own merits and accept the produce of a cursed creation as an offering.

Cain ignored the fact of sin and disrespected and dishonoured Yahweh in presumptuously coming on his own merits and in his own way to meet with a holy God. Everything of his sacrifice originated in self - his own way, his own efforts, his own choice -
:And Yahweh did not respect his offering   (Genesis 4:3-5)

Cain had gone his own way, either in ignorance or in direct disobedience to the revealed will of Yahweh which was made known to his parents. Even without a personal relationship, he still could have obeyed what was made known to his parents, but, he chose to go his own way.		

&quot;All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned each one to his own way&quot;	 (Isaiah 53:6)      

This is the root of sin.

===THE WAY OF CAIN===
Cain's face fell, and he became angry and Yahweh put His finger on the root of the problem - 
Sin lying at the door   (Genesis 4:6)

And what was the sin that was identified here?
The sin of self-righteousness!

Cain wanted to be accepted on own his own merits for his own works, and it was totally unacceptable to Yahweh.

One's own works always fall short even if an attempt is made to do it 'right'

For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them&quot;  Galatians 3:23

The law requires complete, absolute perfection - no shortfall or imperfection from the standard of Yahweh's righteousness as was revealed in the life of Yeshua.

'The way of Cain' is under the curse (Jude 11)

&quot;They have  zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.  For they being ignorant of the righteousness of Yahweh and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
For Messiah is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.&quot;  Romans 10:2-4

Messiah is the end - the finish of operating by the law to obtain righteousness.
And the only requirement?   -    Believing!

That is, receiving His righteousness by faith!

One's own 'righteousness' as opposed to the righteousness of Yahweh.
The way of Cain or the way of Abel.

John says that Cain 'was of that wicked one'  (1 Jn.3:12)  whereas Abel was righteous.
(The Greek word for 'wicked' is PONEROS = bad, malignant, miserable)

That takes us back to the garden to   THE    'wicked one'
The wicked one said 'ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil'  (Genesis 3:1)
:'as gods'  - 	master of one's own destiny - independent
::able to discern/judge between right or wrong and therefore able to make one's own choices between right and wrong.

It has the echo of Lucifer's sin   'I will be like the Most High'

Instead of living in trust and obedience to what Yahweh told them, now they are  'as god' knowing and choosing what they will do. 
 
They were now separated from the life of Yahweh, from being dependent on Him, and were in a state of spiritual death, as they only had life while in union with Him.  Man has no life source of his own.

That is the fruit of the tree of which they partook! It was death to them as Yahweh had said.

===THE FRUIT OF THE TREE===
Cain established his own way based upon his own perceptions of what was 'good' and right in his own eyes and it was unacceptable.

It was not obviously 'wrong' or evil - it actually looked good.

Good intentions, but the inner motivation was wrong.

Yahweh said, &quot;If you do well, won't you be accepted?&quot;   Genesis 4:7
Sin was in control.

Sin is living in independence from Yahweh, deciding and making choices for oneself in life, rooted in what pleases or satisfies self.  It is 'I' on the throne (i.e. being a god), choosing what is 'right' for oneself.  That is, living from the knowledge of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
The tree is the knowledge of good and evil.  The knowledge of good as well as the knowledge of evil.  Choosing to do good if it originates in a independent lifestyle to satisfy one's own ego is living from the wrong tree.  it is just as wrong, though not obviously so to man, as doing evil in His sight, for it originates from the 'tree' of independence from God.

Cain's own ego was satisfied in what he chose to do.

A self-righteous person will mostly choose to do 'good' things, because doing good is what justifies the image they are establishing of themselves.  A self-righteous person sees themselves as doing the 'right' thing.  Doing evil can never really be excused to our conscience unless we blame others, and so a person is only made righteous in their own eyes by doing what is right and good.

===WORKS OF THE LAW===
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is basically the law.  It is the knowledge of right and wrong according to His eternal standards.  There is only one standard of right and wrong - that which He set for Himself according to His own nature and the mould in which He created man 'in His own image and likeness'.

The written law was given to Moses and that served as a point of reference that was no longer subject to the functioning of man's conscience.  It was an irrefutable reference to measure oneself by and thereby reveal sin for what it was.  It was the 'schoolmaster' to bring us to Messiah, to the acknowledgement that we need a Saviour     (Galatians3:24,24)

The law in essence is good (1 Timothy 1:8) but it is not the criteria for the 'saved' to live by, it is for the lawless and disobedient.  The law brings death for the natural man.  

James talks of the law for a believer as 'the law of liberty' as against the law which tends to bondage (James 1:25, 2:8-13).  The 'law'  now written on our hearts motivates us to do in freedom that which the 'law' articulates.  But it is from the life of Messiah within.  The 'law of the spirit of life in Yeshua the Messiah has made us free from the law of sin and death'   Romans 8:2  
But,  living from the 'law', the revealed will of Yahweh, by one's own effort in one's own energies is equivalent to living from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

Doing the 'works of the law' and living from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are interchangeable terms.

&quot;A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Yeshua the Messiah, even we (Jews to whom the law was given by Moses)  have believed in Yeshua the Messiah, that we might be justified by faith in Messiah and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified&quot;   (Galatians 2:19)

As Paul said, he  died to the law that he might live to God.  (Gal. 2:17)   That is, he 'died' to the knowledge of the law by identifying with Messiah in His death, thereby coming  into a faith relationship with God through Yeshua.  On the basis of that he could say, &quot;I have been crucified with Messiah, it is no longer I who live, but Messiah lives in me; and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who love me and gave Himself for me&quot;  (Gal.2:20)

Paul died to his knowledge of the law which was extensive having studied under the best teachers of his day, and having died to it, he then lived out of relationship with Messiah. 

No longer partaking of the wrong tree but living from the tree of life.  He, as all other believers who by faith accept Yeshua's sacrifice are brought back into relationship with the Father through His Son, the sacrificial Lamb of God to henceforth to live unto God.

And out of the ground Yahweh Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.

&quot;And Yahweh commanded the man saying, 'Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat ........&quot; (Genesis 2:16,17)

and now He says,

&quot;To him that overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God&quot;  (Revelation 2:9)


&quot;And He showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb.  In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each yielding its fruit every month.  The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&quot;  (Revelation 22:1-2) 



To him that overcomes!

      <text xml:space="preserve">===TWO WAYS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS===
There are two ways of righteousness according to the scriptures - That which is of the law and that which is of faith.

Paul speaks of Moses writing of the righteousness which is of the law, referring to all the commandments and precepts which he gave.  Romans 10:5

BUT, He says, &quot;the righteousness which is of faith speaks in this way  -   (Romans 10:6)

THAT  -  &quot;If you will confess with your mouth the Lord Yeshua, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved&quot;  (Romans 10:9)

'If you believe with your heart'   (not just your mind, remember the demons believe) 'that God raised him from the dead'  (i.e. that all God's requirements for sin's penalty was met in Yeshua)

If you confess Yeshua as your Lord (Master) on that basis, of being the substitute lamb for the payment of your sin - your shortcomings before God, then you will be saved from the penalty of your sin, which is death - spiritual and eternal!

For it was on the basis of sin's penalty having been met in the sacrifice of Yeshua, that Yahweh was able to raise him from the dead, in that, he was without sin and therefore death could not hold him.

SO, IF YOU BELIEVE  (trust and rely upon) what Yeshua did for you on the torture stake for yourself, you will be saved from sin's penalty.

THAT IS THE BASIS OF SALVATION ---  and that means being saved out of your fallen sinful state of separation from Yahweh.  Being saved experientially!   i.e. experiencing a reunion into fellowship with Him.

&quot;For with the HEART one believes unto RIGHTEOUSNESS&quot; 
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation&quot;	Romans 10:10

By believing in the efficacy of Messiah's atonement for you, you are MADE RIGHTEOUS.

That is, you come into right standing with God.   You have no righteousness of your own to justify this new position you have obtained of being reconciled to God.  It is not even to your own merit that you did make the choice to believe.  For although you have been saved by the exercise of your faith, that even is not of yourself, but an imparted gift which He gave you.

Scripture says it is not your own doing so that you have no grounds for boasting - i.e. no grounds for self acclaim or pride in having done the 'right thing'.  See Ephesians 2:8-10

From being in a sinful state, separated from Yahweh, you have been made righteous and brought into fellowship with Him  AND  it is all His doing and none of your own works. He graciously imparted to you the faith to act upon His promises. The righteousness which we have inherited is entirely then a result of Yahweh's undeserved favour toward us.

He made a bridge for us to pass over from unrighteousness to righteousness and He chose to do it that way because of fallen man's natural inclination to commend himself on some point and in so doing fall from grace.

The fallen human nature very quickly seeks to rise its ugly head and establish its own ego.

BUT,  the righteousness which is of faith gives no place for human effort,	whereas, the righteousness which is based on keeping the law originates in one's own effort to do the 'right' thing.  See Romans 10:5  You have 'life' by keeping the law.

One the result of God's mercy, the other the result of human effort.	

So we have  -
1.  The righteousness which is of the law
2.   The righteousness which is of faith


The Law shows no mercy.   You have to keep it completely to avoid its penalty.
&quot;Cursed is everyone who does not continue in ALL things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.&quot;    Colossians 3:10     See also Lev.18:4,5  &amp;  Deut.27:26

You have life only by keeping the law perfectly.

Then we have Grace 
God's impartation of enabling to believe in His Son's free gift of righteousness

&quot;The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Yeshua the Messiah&quot;   John 1:17

TWO WAYS
1. a written code of ethics,  principles and commands
2. a divine enabling to live the life exemplified by Yeshua

But with both, you only have life while you walk in it.

To continue in Yahweh's righteousness you have to stay rightly related in a place of union with Him, submitted to His will, living to please Him.  That is, doing moment by moment those things He desires you to do.  So, in obedience to Him, following His direction, you will do the 'right' things.  You will walk in righteousness - which is keeping the law.  And that, as an outcome of relationship, by Him living His life out through you.
(This of course requires death to the strong self nature, the &quot;I&quot; in us that wants to think its own thoughts and do its own thing)

This outflow of righteousness is as a result of being in union with Him as a branch is joined to a vine (John 15:5-8) and therefore what ever is produced on the branch is not one's own effort.  It is the result of the branch being joined to the vine.  The sap flowing through the vine produces the fruit.

Whereas to keep the commandments in one's own strength takes a lot of effort.
The dilemma of the effort  to keep the law, or as we often think of it, to do the right thing, or act in a godly and righteous way (however we think of it), is that we always fall short.  If not in our standards, we do fall short of His.  In ourselves, we are not righteous  -  as Paul quoted, &quot;there is none righteous, no not one!&quot;    Romans 3:10

All fall short of God's standard of righteousness - of His glorious person  (Romans 3:23), and because of our shortfall - our fallen nature, we are unable from our own resources to keep the law.  That is, to live up to Yahweh's standard of holiness.  The absolutely pure, holy glorious state of being which is His in which there is only perfect love and truth.

And so, &quot;by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight&quot; -   
see also Galatians 2:16
The law only gives a knowledge of our shortfall  (Romans 3:19-20)
It exposes our wrong motivation, self-seeking, lustful desires.

For that reason, knowing it was impossible for man to rise to that standard and keep them He ordained a way of righteousness apart from the law.  That is, it has nothing to do with keeping the law, it is by Yahweh completely passing over sins committed, and justifying those who have faith in Yeshua  Romans 3:21-26
So, Yahweh made what was impossible for man, possible by doing it all for him.

Firstly, by Yeshua coming into human flesh and becoming a man, although perfect - He was completely limited to the resources of all mankind.  Then, as a man standing in for man (as a second Adam) and gaining back for mankind what Adam lost as the head of the human race and becoming, through his perfect sinless life under many tests and trials, a substitute sacrifice for mankind, He was able to initiate our redemption.

Then, secondly,  Yahweh extends His power to enable us to believe so we may receive the free gift of His salvation, by the enabling of the Holy Spirit.
How wonderful is Yahweh's mercy and grace toward His creation!

And this way of righteousness was revealed to the Old Testament saints and prophets. It is not something that began in the New Testament.	See Romans 3:21
They received the gift of righteousness and justification for their sin on the promise of a Saviour to come, we on the One who has been.

Their righteousness was on the same basis of faith as ours.   

Going back to Abel, who through faith 'worked righteousness'  i.e. he believed and received the righteousness that is by faith, 'he obtained witness that he was righteous'  (Hebrews 11:4)   and as David testified  &quot;Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh does not impute sin&quot;  (Romans 4:6)

Abraham was the proclaimed 'father' of faith and all the true children of Abraham are the children of 'promise'   i.e. the children of faith.  
&quot;Abraham believed Yahweh and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&quot;   Romans 4:3
He was not justified by his 'works' but by his faith.    (Rom.4:2, 4-5)

&quot;Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace&quot;     Romans 4:16

The way of righteousness is a way of faith, dependant on the life of the Son of God who has brought us into union with our heavenly Father, that we might walk in a manner which is acceptable and pleasing unto Him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE LIFE OF FAITH VERSUS THE LIFE OF THE FLESH===

The dilemma often is that we do not reckon the old nature to be dead.  We do not count on/ believe and as a result experience a complete death to the old nature.
Either through ignorance in lack of teaching, or entrenched areas of behaviour/thinking patterns, we do not appropriate the Life of Messiah in its entirety.  There are blockages, hindrances or just that we fall back into old habits patterns of thinking and believing - just what we identify and have known ourselves to be,  i.e. our personality.

We have been born and bred in the enemy's mould of sin.  Being independent, making our own choices, being self-motivated - Self at the helm of our own ship, steering our own course in life as have our parents, and how many other generations before us that have set the mould of protecting our own interests, seeking our own pleasure, thinking our own thoughts.

Now we have to change and come into a new mode of operation!

Having a new helmsman, following His directions and fulfilling His plans - &quot;not my will, but Thine be done&quot;.  No longer 'I' in control.

That is a dramatic change to sustain over a period of time and in various situations.  It requires a constant ongoing exercise of faith to remain in union with this new helmsman.  It will take faith to maintain that continuous abiding in the vine.

And, having begun in faith, it is easy to slip into operating in the things you 'know' you should do and thus become caught up in keeping the 'law' - doing what is right because you know it is right (or good) and not because you are motivated from within from the life of Messiah.  

We operate from knowledge and not from the inner life.  Living from the wrong tree!

The tree of knowledge as compared to the tree of life.   (the tree of knowledge is the knowledge of '''good''' as well as the knowledge of evil)

As Paul wrote to the Galatians  &quot;O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, ....  This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  
Are you so foolish?   Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?  .....  &quot;  Galatians 3:1-3

&quot;Stand fast then in the liberty by which Messiah has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage&quot;	 Galatians 5:1

The fallen human nature desires to do something to earn or merit salvation.  To do something toward becoming righteous. It takes humility to accept a free gift.  The fact is, you owe your life to Him and there is nothing you can do now or in any future time to repay or be worthy of that free gift.  You can never become worthy by 'being righteous'.  It will ever be His righteousness until that day when we become immortal.

The only thing we can do is to recognize and honour His propriety over our life in having bought us back from the hand of the enemy and from being destined to eternity in hell.

That is such an awesome concept!  Destined to eternity in 'Gehenna' in the Lake of Fire that burns forever.  And then, Miraculously, with no strings attached, you are given a lifeline - a way of escape - a Saviour to lift you out of the mire and the penalty of your own errant way.

Then, not only to save you, but to adopt you into His own family and instate you with all the rights and privileges of an heir to His kingdom.  And for someone who doesn't deserve it!

That demands a heart response of gratitude and unreserved love.

And this is what He desires, our genuine heart-felt love for Him who reached down and in His mercy brought us unto Himself.  This is the 'return' that He seeks - relationship!

That out of love for Him and in relationship with Him, we will do the things that please Him and that are according to His will.  It will all come from an outflow of relationship.

Often though, our gratitude and desire to serve Him spills over into doing our own works.  Not being able to rest in the finished work of Messiah, we try to add some 'good works'

====THE OLD NATURE====
The old nature wants to be justified.  It wants to be right.  And look at Cain.  What rises up when confronted with the root of sin?  

Rejection  -  Self-pity  -  Resentment  -  Anger

&quot;The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace&quot;      James 3:18

There is no bad fruit when walking in righteousness.  
Paul calls it the 'peaceable fruit of righteousness'  (Heb.12:11)

But all types of wounding occur when walking in the flesh, in the self-life - and it progresses on to destruction.

Notice what Yahweh said to Cain (Genesis 4:6,7)   It is obvious that Cain could have taken control of his sinful response and brought it under control.  Yahweh was extending the way of reconciliation and repentance to him but he was entrenched in his self-life and chose not to repent.  Where self-seeking and covetous desire have free reign, every evil thing is present.  	(James 3:14 17)

The self life motivated by fleshly desires is the breeding ground for the powers of darkness to control and James says all that originates from it is demonic.   (James 3:15)

It goes back to the garden where the enemy said 'ye shall be as gods' by taking from the tree of knowledge.  You will be able to know for yourself what is good and evil and make your own decisions and be independent.  You will be as 'god'. You can set your own course.

And just as Eve was deceived in the garden, so is anyone today who eats from that tree thinking they can run their own life, even for 'good',  even religiously 'good' purposes.  The enemy continues to stand at the garden of our lives ready to tempt us to eat of the wrong tree.  The wrong tree will always bring forth bad fruit.

By allowing self to reign, the ultimate manifestation will be  'evil' deeds.

The fallen self is a broken creature - without inner validation.
Fallen man in himself is empty, void and lifeless, dependent upon commendation to give esteem and affirmation and acknowledgment of himself and his achievements.

Being in a state of spiritual death, he has no life in himself and needs some form of stimulii, some 'life' to come from an outside source, whether it be from interaction from other people, entertainment, pleasure, sport, indulgence of appetites, creature enterprises and/or various achievements in life.  He is very vulnerable because of his dependence on some form of life-support system.  Vulnerable to disappointment, defeat, deflation, apathy and to attack, wounding and destruction.  And so, self can become very touchy

Because of this vulnerability there arises in man the need to protect oneself   To Protect
:What you are
										      :What you do
										       :What you say
										        :What you think ...

To protect oneself, self-justification is involved, or if the devaluation is accepted and internalized. 

It results in self-condemnation.  The voice of the law comes into operation either excusing or accusing oneself.  Romans 2:15

Whereas,

If we are in union with Messiah, and not in the flesh, there is no judgment that can come and find a mark.  The enemy will always seek to condemn (and he uses people mostly),  but if you know that you are doing His works and not your own (walking in true righteousness) it is unjustified.

====HIS COVERING====
The scriptures speak of the 'breastplate of righteousness' covering our heart to protect it from the darts of the evil one.  If you know that you are in Messiah, you have an assurance in what you do and the enemy can't find a place to penetrate.  (Ephesians 6:14)

And, not only in the defensive aspect, but also in the offensive when we engage the enemy in warfare and counterattack his strategies, we are covered, by the 'armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left'  (2 Corinthians 6:7)

We can expect the enemy to attack us in our mind just as he did to Yeshua, and according to His example we can counter-attack with the Word.  When in the flesh, you lack the power and authority to deal with his strategies.  When other people are used to attack us,  if we are not controlled by the flesh, we can give a godly response.

Whatever the tactic, he will always seek to bring us back under the 'law' as that is where he has legal authority from the garden over man.

Yahweh's law is eternal and is a depiction of His own character and nature and His just requirement for mankind.  Its essence will never change.  But to attempt to be righteous, to measure up to God's standard in our own right is a complete affront to the Almighty.  It is akin to Satan's effort  to be like the Most High.  How dare we attempt to be righteous in our own merit. Yet, this is what the enemy will seek to have us do, either arrogantly or in ignorance and deception.

Yeshua 'kept' the righteous standards of His Father because He was righteous.  He was without sin, by birth (not being of Adam's fallen nature, but by the Spirit of the Father) and by keeping Himself from the enemy and his strategies to commit sin and act in independence of His Father during His life. No other man has ever been righteous or attained unto righteousness in his own merit.  (&quot;there is none righteous, no not one&quot;  Rom.3:10)

This 'second man' Yeshua, who passed the test for mankind where Adam the first man failed, has begun a new order. As the second 'Adam', all those in Him shall bear His image - that of a righteous man, no longer a natural man, but a spiritual one.  (1 Cor.15:47)

In the meantime while we are 'growing up in Him' we need to be aware of the enemy's tactics to bring us into defeat and back into the bondage of the 'law'.
Past or present shortcomings and actual transgressions are all things he will use or just the legalistic way of considering what is the right thing to do in a situation.  We are dead to the law, Paul says, and therefore we should not judge ourselves or others by it.  Rather we are to walk according to the new nature wherein we will not fulfill the lusts of our flesh (even those of the mind).

====MAKING JUDGMENTS====
When we judge ourselves or another we are operating under &quot;law', bringing them or ourselves under our understanding of the law.  We are setting ourselves up as a judge, as god, able to judge right and wrong, good and evil   -   back to the wrong tree!

We, none of us are able to keep the law ourselves, and yet we would judge our brother?  Usually on a point that stirs our self-nature, or that bites into an old wound.

&quot;Speak not one against another, brethren, he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, does speak against the law and does judge the law;  And if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
There is one lawgiver, who is able to save or to destroy; who are you that you judge the other?
										James 4:11-12
&quot;Who are you to judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls.  Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.    Romans 14:4

&quot;Why do you judge your brother?&quot;     Romans  14:10

When we do judge others , then we are not 'fully judging' ourselves and become 'ill-reasoning' judges.   (Quotations from Young's literal translation of James 2:4

Our reasoning is impaired and distorted by the 'mote' (beam or log) in our own eye and we haven't seen (judged) the problem in ourselves.  Usually when we are stirred by something in our brother, there is something in our own life that is out of order.

We are not properly able to judge issues - we do not have the wisdom, discernment and the determining criteria to make the evaluation.
In short, we are not God!

We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Messiah, so we should beware!
&quot;Therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the heart.  Then each man's praise will come from God.&quot;  1 Corinthians 4:5

and again, 

&quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged, for with the same judgment ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.&quot;   Matthew 7:1-2

One man's strength is another man's shortcoming, and we all fall short somehow.  Romans 3:23

The issue is usually offences that cause pain, and there is an answer for offences -
												FORGIVE!!!
											RECEIVE HEALING!!!

We need to take responsibility for our own wrong reactions and repent of our self-centeredness. Then forgive your brother and release him from your judgment.

Yeshua said, &quot;I came not to judge the world, but to save it.&quot;    John 12:47

Is our motivation to save our brother?

A good indication of our own motivation is in seeing how we judge our 'brother'
If we are walking in a subtle self-righteousness, our thoughts will track along either commending or condemning others or ourselves.

If things appear good - commendation
If they appear evil - condemnation			See John 7:24

Paul said that he did not judge himself one way or another, but committed himself to God's judgment.   1  Corinthians 4:3-4;  See also 2 Corinthians 10:12,17

This was Yeshua's example to us,
&quot;Who committed himself to Him who judges righteously&quot;	1 Peter 2:23

And that, in the most extreme situation of being betrayed and delivered up to death on the stake.

To overcome and endure the trial set before Him, He spent the night agonizing in prayer, but He triumphed and went as a lamb to the slaughter and opened not his mouth in accusation against His accusers, neither in self-defense or in rebuke.  Isaiah 53:7 &amp; 1 Peter 2:21-22

The supreme test!

He fulfilled all righteousness from beginning to end.  He exemplified the summary that He gave of the law as loving Yahweh and your neighbour to the fullest extent, and calls us to follow His example, yoked to Him.

&quot;This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God and Yeshua Ha Maschiach whom you have sent&quot;

&quot;And the glory which you gave me I have given them, that they might be one just as we are one: I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one,  .....&quot;

... that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them, ..  &quot;  John 17:3,21.26

&quot;To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the  Paradise of Yahweh&quot;  (Revelation 2:7)

      <comment>/* Returning Results */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like to use an existing XQuery function.  You need to be able to understand how functions work and how they are documented.

== Method ==
The XQuery 1.0 specification has many built-in functions for handling strings, URIs and other data.  To use a built-in function you need to know what its inputs are and their data types and what form of output it creates.

== Understanding XQuery Parameters and Return Types ==
XQuery is a strongly typed language, so functions are usually carefully designed to work with a restricted set of data types.  When you pass data into a function using a parameter, you must specify its type, using combinations of elements, nodes, items, sequences or any of the XML Schema data types.  In addition to the data type, a suffix called an occurrence indicator, such as &quot;+&quot;, &quot;?&quot; or &quot;*&quot;, follows the data type to indicate whether a parameter is optional or could have multiple values.  Here are the three occurrence indicators and their meanings:

* '''?''' matches zero or one items
* '''*''' matches zero or more items
* '''+''' matches one or more items

Care should be taken to understand the difference between an argument as a single sequence and a repeating set of items.

There are around 111 built-in functions to the XQuery language, but many find that 10% of the XQuery functions are used 90% of the time.  Here are some of the most commonly used functions:

  string-length($string as xs:string) as xs:integer - returns the length of a string as the number of its characters

Example: string-length(&quot;Hello&quot;) returns 5, since the string &quot;Hello&quot; is five characters long.

  concat($input as xs:anyAtomicType?) as xs:string - concatenates a list of strings together.

The function does not accept a sequence of values, just individual atomic values passed as separate arguments.

Example: concat('big', 'red', 'ball') returns &quot;bigredball&quot;

  string-join($sequence as xs:string*, $delimiter as xs:string) as xs:string - combines the items in a sequence, separating them with a delimiter

Example: string-join(('big', 'red', 'ball'), '-') returns &quot;big-red-ball&quot;

Note that string-join takes as its first argument a single sequence of items, whereas concat takes zero or more strings as arguments.

== Sample data types ==

* '''xs:date''' refers to the built-in atomic schema type named xs:date
* '''attribute()?''' refers to an optional attribute node
* '''element()''' refers to any element node
* '''element(po:shipto, po:address)''' refers to an element node that has the name po:shipto and has the type annotation po:address (or a schema type derived from po:address)
* '''element(*, po:address)''' refers to an element node of any name that has the type annotation po:address (or a type derived from po:address)
* '''element(customer)''' refers to an element node named customer with any type annotation
* '''schema-element(customer)''' refers to an element node whose name is customer (or is in the substitution group headed by customer) and whose type annotation matches the schema type declared for a customer element in the in-scope element declarations
* '''node()*''' refers to a sequence of zero or more nodes of any kind
* '''item()+''' refers to a sequence of one or more nodes or atomic values

== Returning Results ==
Each XQuery function you write will return a result.

In the following example, the input is a '''sequence''' of 0 to many nodes and the output is a '''sequence''' of 0 to many nodes.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: input 0 to many nodes and return 0 to many nodes :)
declare function local:myFunction($input as node()*) as node()* {

&lt;/source&gt;

In the following example, the input is a single '''required''' node and the output is a single '''required''' node.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: input a single required nodes and return a single required node :)
declare function local:myFunction($input as node()) as node() {
&lt;/source&gt;

In the following example, the input is a single '''optional''' node and the output is a single '''optional''' node.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: input a single optional nodes and return a single optional node :)
declare function local:myFunction($input as node()?) as node()? {
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH IS BY FAITH===

We can be religiously self -righteous and functioning from the wrong tree - the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil, i.e. the knowledge of the law.  Doing all things that we know to be good religious practices - going to assembly, tithing, helping others, praying etc. etc., but if it is not done out of our relationship with Messiah and His life within, then it is dead works and the fruit of self-righteousness.  

If self is in control making the decisions, then it is our own works.  If we have yielded to the life within and given Him control of our life and all our faculties so that our mind and heart are under His command, then what we are doing is His works and the result of obedience, of yielding to His promptings - His direction.

Righteousness is a result of obedience!   

See Romans 6:16

Of submitting to the righteousness of Yahweh and making Him Lord!  

No longer living out of one's own self-nature, but instead, living in obedience to His motivations in our heart.  His life flowing out from us causing us to bear the 'fruit of the Spirit'.

It is an exercise of faith from our relationship with Yahweh to initiate the life-flow of the Son of God within us.    Romans 10:10

And the pre-requisite?   -   that we execute death on the old self-nature, RECKONING ourselves dead to sin, but alive unto God (Yahweh).  That requires another operation of faith.  Our sin-nature (the independent self-nature that likes to think its own thoughts and do its own thing) WAS crucified with Messiah - that is a fact!  But we have to 'reckon' it to be so in us to experience it.  It is by faith that we receive the promises.  Read Romans 6:1-11

It is ever the righteousness of Yahweh that is imputed to us - given to us, as a gift.  It is the 'gift of righteousness' which we now have     Romans 5:17       It is not our own!

&quot;Christ (Messiah) is made unto us ...... righteousness...&quot;     1 Cor.1:30

By FAITH!

By believing - you receive as a free gift that which you did not deserve, which you didn't work to attain to, and can never attain to in your own efforts - His righteousness!

It is a gift bestowed by grace, by His favour, undeserved, unmerited and unwarranted.
We can't earn it, deserve it or work toward it - we receive it and live out from it, not only at salvation but thereafter daily, moment by moment.

We have imputed righteousness now!   -   and to the measure that we live in a faith relationship to that measure it will be evident in our lives.
The Bible speaks of the 'hope of righteousness'.  For we live in hope of the complete fulfillment of Messiah's righteousness being worked out in our lives.  The eager expectation (the hope) of the operation of our faith progressively brings it into reality.

Paul prays that we may be pure and without offence until the day of Messiah, being filled with the 'fruit of righteousness'   (Phil.1:10-11)

NOTICE  The external, visible righteousness is only the fruit of the life from within - the life of Messiah!

It IS possible to come to a place of being FILLED with the fruit of righteousness.  That is, the fruit of living in a faith relationship based on complete obedience to His will - 'abiding in the vine'  i.e.  the right tree!
Another way of saying it  is, being filled with the life of Messiah in righteousness, or being filled with Messiah's righteousness in your life.

&quot;For to this we are called, because Messiah suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you may follow in His steps, who did not commit sin ....
Who our sins Himself did bear in His body on the tree, that to sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; by whose stripes ye were healed, for you were as sheep going astray, but you have turned back to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.1 Peter 2:21-25  (Young's Literal Translation &amp; Is.53:6)

He left us an example as a 'man' living in complete union and dependence upon His Father, that we also, having died to sin's lifestyle by identification with Him,  should now live up to the standard of righteousness that He exemplified.

Yeshua had no resources that are not available to us as a new creation man.  He lived fully within the limitations of human flesh, yet without sin.  (without independent self-motivation). He relied fully on His Father to direct Him, speak through Him, heal and deliver the oppressed.  He went where the Father told Him to go and did what the Father told Him to do and spoke the words the Father gave Him to speak.

&quot;I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, I speak these things.  And He who sent me is with me.  The Father has not left me alone, for I always do those things that please Him&quot;     John 8:28, 29

&quot;I speak what I have seen with my Father&quot;  John 8:38  see also 12:49

&quot;He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin ..
Whoever abides in Him does not sin&quot;    1 John 3:5,6

&quot;Little children, let no one led you astray; he who is doing the righteousness, is righteous,  even as  He is righteous&quot;   1 John 3:7  (Young's literal translation)

We are called to be righteous AS He is righteous!

====MAKING IT REALITY====
Because this is impossible on our own strength from our own resources, we tend to make excuses and say we can't do it.  Only Yeshua through His life within us can enable us to live the life that He lived.  The 'life' that  he lived has been imparted to us through the Spirit and if we yield to that life within, which is the 'law' written on our hearts, He will fulfill the standard of the 'law' - the Father's perfect standard of righteousness.

We are exhorted to look at the great cloud of witnesses arrayed in the spiritual grandstand watching us run the race when we are tempted to allow temptation to overcome us and to give in to the old nature and allow a besetting sin to reign in our life.

&quot;Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Yeshua the author and perfecter of our FAITH ........&quot;	Hebrews 12:1-2

For it is by faith that we overcome!

By FAITH those who have gone before us  -  obtained promises  -  	        wrought righteousness	Hebrew 11:33

They overcame the fallen human nature by FAITH!!

Look at Abraham the father of faith, who became heir to the righteousness which is of faith  (Heb.11:7)

&quot;By FAITH he obtained witness that he was righteous&quot;  i.e. he experienced the impartation of Yahweh's righteousness through the operation of his faith.  
By his faith he obtained righteousness   Romans 4:21-25

The scripture says that Abraham BELIEVED Yahweh and that (his faith) was accounted to him for righteousness.  Romans 4:1-3

&quot;To him who does not work (put in one's own effort - strive at being righteous) but believes on him who justifies the ungodly (who makes the ungodly justified i.e. just as if he had no sin) his faith is accounted for righteousness&quot;    Romans 4:5

FAITH = RIGHTEOUSNESS

By believing in His power/ability/willingness/provision &amp; promise to make your fallen ungodly state righteous, you enter into a position of right standing, and as a result it becomes a reality in your experience.

You are not righteous in your own merit (all our righteousness is as filthy rags in His sight), but on the basis of faith, He reckons righteousness to your account.  You are accounted righteous.  Whereas you were in a state of estrangement and spiritual separation, you are placed into fellowship, into relationship and union with Him.

Garments of righteousness have been placed upon you to cover your nakedness before Him (which is your state of sin) so that you can come into His presence and be righteous in His sight. You appear before Him in the righteousness of Yeshua, His beloved Son in whom He was well pleased.

This now becomes your position of acceptance with the Father.

&quot;Therefore having been justified through FAITH, we have peace with God through our Lord Yeshua Maschiach, through whom also we have access by faith into this grace  (this undeserved position of favour) wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of Yahweh (the future full manifestation of His power and presence in our lives)&quot; Romans 5:1-3

We were enemies - but now we are reconciled!   Read Romans 5:10
And, as reconciled, brought into relationship, we are to live a new life as a transformed creature - old things having been passed away.   2 Corinthians 5:17

&quot;We are to walk in newness of life&quot;    Romans 6:4

Read Romans 7:4-6

We have been delivered from the 'law' so that now we can serve in the newness of the Spirit, able to bear fruit to Yahweh. (The law is the knowledge of what is right and wrong, but that does not change us)

Through a change in nature, we have a new life and from that 'life' we can do what is 'right', that is, we do from the heart the things that are pleasing to Him, which is walking in His precepts, according to His law.

So, by faith we receive righteousness and by faith we continue to live out of that righteous nature within.   (Messiah in us by the Spirit)

And by faith we must overcome the old nature with its habit patterns so that we continue to abide in Him and allow His life to flow out through us.

      <comment>/* Standard use */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Iterate provides an English language like iteration mechanism much like the Common Lisp LOOP facility.  This begs the question, why use iterate when you have LOOP built in.  The best reason for using Iterate is for its extensibility.  LOOP is quite static, but Iterate can be extended to iterate over your own data structures, for instance.

==Standard use==
As you will see, the syntax of Iterate is very much like LOOP.  In fact, it is often a good idea to think of Iterate as LOOP with parentheses.  The parentheses are purely aesthetic.  The main idea behind the parentheses is to provide hints to text editors for how the syntax should be formatted and to make it easier to write extensions.

*FOR loops
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
;; Collect the values from 0 to 9
(iter (for i below 10)
      (collect i))

=&gt; (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

;; Collect the values from -5 to 10 stepping by PI
(iter (for i from -5 to 10 by pi)
      (collect i)

=&gt; (-5.0d0 -1.8584073464102069d0 1.2831853071795862d0 4.424777960769379d0
 7.5663706143591725d0)

;; Find the number in the file that maximizes the square of itself.
(iter (for number in-file #p&quot;file&quot;)
      (finding number maximizing (expt number 2)))

&lt;/source&gt;

For a list of all iterate constructs, use the function DISPLAY-ITERATE-CLAUSES.

==Extending Iterates Functionality==

In order to extend Iterate you need to write a new driver.

===Using DEFCLAUSE-SEQUENCE and DEFMACRO-DRIVER===

===DEFMACRO-CLAUSE===

==Iterate “gotchas”==

Binding done by the iterate in the FOR driver is actually done via a SET.  This means that you have to pay extra attention to these bound variables when you collect a series of closures.  Unless you explicitly make a lexical binding, the closure will close over the variable that iterate is mutating.  In the end, you will get a collection of closures that all have the binding that iterate exited on.

Don't do this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *closures*
  (iter (for number below 10)
        (collecting (lambda () number)) ))

==&gt; *CLOSURES*

(funcall (first *closures*))

==&gt; 10
&lt;/source&gt;

Do this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *closures*
  (iter (for number below 10)
        (collecting (let ((number number))
                      (lambda () number)) )))

==&gt; *CLOSURES*

(funcall (first *closures*))

==&gt; 0
&lt;/source&gt;

You should note that LOOP behaves the same way.

Let &lt;math&gt;A \in  R^{n\times m} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n \geq m \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Assume &lt;math&gt; rank(A) =m \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is known that the symmetric matrix &lt;math&gt;A^TA \!\,&lt;/math&gt; can be factored as 


:&lt;math&gt;A^TA=V \Lambda V^T \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where the columns of &lt;math&gt;V \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are orthonormal eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt; A^TA\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the diagonal matrix containing the corresponding eigenvalues.  Using this as a starting point, derive the singular value decomposition of &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. That is show that there is a real orthogonal matrix &lt;math&gt;U \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and a matrix &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \in R^{n \times m} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; which is zero except for its diagonal entries &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \ldots \geq \sigma_m &gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A=U \Sigma V^T \!\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Solution 3a==
We want to show 


&lt;math&gt;A=U \Sigma V^T \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which is equivalent to


&lt;math&gt;AV= U \Sigma \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Decompose Lambda===
Decompose &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \!\,&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^T\Sigma \!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e.


&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix} 
\sigma_1 &amp;          &amp;       &amp;      \\
         &amp; \sigma_2 &amp;       &amp;       \\
         &amp;          &amp;\ddots &amp;       \\
         &amp;          &amp;       &amp; \sigma_m
\end{bmatrix}}_{\Lambda \in R^{m \times m}}=
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{\sigma_1} &amp;          &amp;       &amp;          &amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0\\
         &amp; \sqrt{\sigma_2} &amp;       &amp;          &amp;0&amp;&amp;\\
         &amp;          &amp;\ddots &amp;          &amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\\
         &amp;          &amp;       &amp; \sqrt{\sigma_m} &amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}}_{\Sigma^T \in R^{m \times n}}
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{\sigma_1} &amp;          &amp;       &amp;          \\
         &amp; \sqrt{\sigma_2} &amp;       &amp;         \\
         &amp;          &amp;\ddots &amp;         \\
         &amp;          &amp;       &amp; \sqrt{\sigma_m}  \\
     0   &amp; \cdots   &amp;       &amp;  0     \\
  \vdots &amp; \vdots        &amp;       &amp; \vdots \\
     0   &amp; \cdots   &amp;  0    &amp;  0             
\end{bmatrix}
}_{\Sigma \in R^{n \times m}}
 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


We can assume &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \ldots \geq \sigma_n &gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; since otherwise we could just rearrange the columns of &lt;math&gt;V \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Define U===
Let &lt;math&gt;U=AV\Sigma^{-1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; where 


&lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{-1}= 
\left(\begin{array}{ccccccc}
\frac1\sqrt{\sigma_1} &amp;          &amp;       &amp;          &amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0\\
         &amp; \frac1\sqrt{\sigma_2} &amp;       &amp;          &amp;0&amp;&amp;\\
         &amp;          &amp;\ddots &amp;          &amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\\
         &amp;          &amp;       &amp; \frac1\sqrt{\sigma_m} &amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0  
\end{array}\right)

,&lt;/math&gt;

===Verify U orthogonal===
&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
UU^T &amp;= AV\Sigma^{-1}\Sigma^{-T}V^TA^T \\
     &amp;= AV\Lambda^{-1}V^TA^T \\
     &amp;= AA^{-1}A^{-T}A^T \\
     &amp;= I 
\\
\\
U^TU &amp;= \Sigma^{-T}V^TA^TAV\Sigma^{-1} \\
     &amp;= \Sigma^{-T}V^T V \Lambda V^T V \Sigma^{-1} \\
     &amp;= I
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

__TOC__

== The sysctl Interface ==

The [[w:Sysctl|sysctl]] command provides an interface for modifying kernel parameters at runtime. There is an option in the grsecurity kernel configuration to enable support for this interface (see [[../Configuring_and_Installing_grsecurity#Configuring_grsecurity_and_PaX_Features|Configuring grsecurity]]). In Linux, &lt;tt&gt;sysctl&lt;/tt&gt; is simply a wrapper around filesystem routines that read and write contents of files in the ''/proc'' directory. This means that you can also set parameters by echoing values to files in ''/proc''. See the [[../Appendix/Sysctl Options|Appendix]] for a list of all available sysctl options for grsecurity.

=== Usage ===

The &lt;tt&gt;sysctl&lt;/tt&gt; command takes a list of ''variables'' or ''variable''=''value'' pairs and sets or reads their value. Variable is a path to a file in ''/proc/sys'' separated by periods or forward slashes. The value depends on the parameter in question. Most of grsecurity's options are either 1 (enabled) or 0 (disabled).

&lt;tt&gt;Sysctl&lt;/tt&gt;'s man page is available online at http://linux.die.net/man/8/sysctl.

=== Examples ===

If you want to know every available runtime option for grsecurity, list the contents of ''/proc/sys/kernel/grsecurity''.

To enable mount auditing and disable chdir auditing in a single &lt;tt&gt;sysctl&lt;/tt&gt; command, run:
&lt;pre&gt;
# sysctl kernel.grsecurity.audit_mount=1 kernel.grsecurity.audit_chdir=0
kernel.grsecurity.audit_mount = 1
kernel.grsecurity.audit_chdir = 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can achieve the same result by echoing:
&lt;pre&gt;
# echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/grsecurity/audit_mount
# echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/grsecurity/audit_chdir
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Introduction==

Our rapidly increasing technology including a global network has allowed educators the opportunity to create, communicate and store information in incredible ways.  Students have access to instant information.  Classes can learn with peers who live on the other side of the globe.  School systems can store and access information on students, staff and operational issues with ease.

In addition, many schools/districts are being rewarded grants that allow for the purchase of technology tools to which they otherwise would never have had financial access.  Entire districts are being set up with laptops, LCD projectors, and other tech tools including staff training and mentoring for Classrooms for the Future grants.  Here is a link that provides information on [http://www.edportal.ed.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=475&amp;&amp;level=1&amp;css=L1&amp;mode=2&amp;in_hi_userid=2&amp;cached=true'''Classrooms for the Future''']


Unfortunately, with all of this wonderful technology available, there are several security concerns that arise. It is our duty as school staff members and parents to work together to keep our children safe while using these technology tools.  Here is an incomplete list of security issues brought on by technology integration:
#Students/staff downloading unauthorized software with viruses [[File:Kids_at_computer.jpg|right|thumbnail]]
#Students, staff or outsiders hacking into confidential information
#Staff/students accessing, distributing, and/or downloading illegal material via the school network
#Hardware being stolen or damaged
#Students/staff using technology communication tools to bully/harass/intimidate/etc. others
#Denial of Service (DOS) attacks from outsiders or insiders
#Students/staff displaying or sharing passwords 

Because of these issues listed above (and more) there is a need to train our staff and students in the area of security awareness.  There are important steps for all members of an organization to take in order to keep our school community and network system safe.  This wikibook page will attempt to provide security awareness training to both staff members and students of an education organization. Of course, this information is not comprehensive and school administrators need to be aware and proactive in the dissemination of this information.  Please see the [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Information_Security_in_Education/Administrator_Awareness'''Administrator Awareness''']] section of this wikibook for more information.

==Teacher Information==

Teachers have many safety issues to be concerned with when it comes to keeping their students safe.  The rise of technology use in the classroom has developed its own set of safety issues.  Unfortunately, many (if not most) teachers are not equipped or trained to prevent some basic safety precautions to take with their students when using technology.    


===Internet Safety===
The Internet is widely used among teachers in classroom projects.  Students use it for seeking information quite regularly.  Unfortunately, school/district internet filters cannot possibly filter out everything that is bad for kids to see.   Due to this problem, teachers are faced with educating their students in using the Internet safely.  
The Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education[http://www.k12science.org/internetsafety.html'''CIESE'''] has come up with a web page that is excellent for teaching students and teachers about Internet safety and safety software.  [http://www.teachervision.fen.com/educational-technology/resource/6007.html'''TeacherVision'''] is another great site, however it requires a subscription (there is a free trial.) 
====For your students====
Here are some tips that teachers can use to make sure they are on the right path to keeping their students safe:
#Check to see if the school/district has an AUP (Acceptable Use Policy).  Most schools/districts do have one.  
#Read through this policy with your students in plain language that they can understand.
#Make sure that students and parents are aware of this policy by requiring them to sign and return the policy stating that they have read it.  Your school administrator may have this procedure already in place.
#If you have a web page, do NOT post your students names on the page.  Use a nickname (or pseudonym).
#Student work is great to post.  Just make sure that you do NOT have student pictures posted without written consent of the parent/guardian.
#Make sure that any content posted on your class web page meets your school’s/district’s AUP requirements.
#When teaching lessons requiring internet use by students, provide students with links to reviewed kid-safe sites for that activity to limit searches that result in inappropriate content.
#ALWAYS be present when students go online for activities.
#DO NOT leave lesson plans for substitutes that require Internet/computer use.
#Insist that students do not share their passwords or write them down.  Provide consequences for those who do to enforce this policy.  
#Keep students’ passwords in a protected and secure place such as a personal electronic file which cannot be accessed by students.
#Keep computers facing the center of the classroom so that you can always see what is on the screen.
#Provide parents with information regarding assisting and monitoring Internet use by their child.  A great site to give parents is the [http://www.fbi.gov/publications/pguide/pguide.htm'''FBI’s Parent Guide to Internet Safety'''].
#The following link provides teachers with a great cyberbullying video that all students should watch: [http://www.ikeepsafe.org/assets/videos/?vid=Comcast_Ikeepsafe'''Comcast iSafe Video''']

====For yourself====
Here are some tips that teachers can use to keep themselves safe when using the internet:

#Familiarize yourself with the section in this wikibook entitled [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Information_Security_in_Education/Legal_Issues'''Legal Issues''']].  
#Familiarize yourself with ways that students can hack into a school network system.  You can find information by visiting the section in this wikibook entitled [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Information_Security_in_Education/School_Hacking'''School Hacking''']].
#Make sure you read and understand your district’s/school’s AUP.  If you don’t, ask your technology administrator to help explain it to you.  
#Memorize your network passwords.  NEVER assume that a student couldn’t find it somewhere that you think it’s hidden.  DON’T leave your passwords around-like stuck to the side of your desk or on your monitor.
#Do not trust anyone, including other staff members, with your password. 
#Log in only when there are no people near your computer.
#Do NOT give out personal information including passwords to ANYONE over the phone, even if they say they are with your school’s IT department.  This is a good trick played by hackers.
#Log out and shut down your computer whenever you leave your room.
#Do NOT log in and allow a substitute, student or other staff member to use your computer unless you are right there with them the entire time.
#Have a school technician check your classroom computers for the history of websites surfed to make sure no inappropriate sites are being accessed especially if you share a classroom or have a substitute.

===Hardware Security/Safety===

Here are tips to help keep your electronic equipment in good condition and safe for students/yourself to use.  The following site is also helpful for computer hardware safety and care: [http://www.pcworld.com/article/14872/hardware_tips.html'''PC World Computer Care''']

#Keep all cords out of walkways/aisles.  Overheads, LCDs, etc. are costly.  Teachers tend to place them in the middle aisle of a classroom with cords easily stepped/tripped on.  Take the time to unplug, roll up and store cords.
#Wipe down all electronic equipment with a slightly damp cloth every few weeks to keep it free from dust.  Electronics tend to gather dust quickly and can damage parts.  There are also several products that allow you to clean smudges off your computer screen without damaging it.
#Keep all electronics in a locked area/room.   Do not give your key to unauthorized users (especially students).
#Make sure you monitor student use of any electronic device at all times.
#Do not plug electronics directly into a wall socket.  A surge protector will go a long way in protecting electronic devices.
#Do not allow students to hook up any type of personal (non-school issued) electronic device to school devices.
#Do not allow anyone (students or staff) to eat or drink near electronic equipment, ESPECIALLY COMPUTERS!
#Do not allow students to download software, use personal jump/thumb drives or use any type of unauthorized disk in the computer without your direct supervision. Software may usually never be downloaded by anyone except the technology administrator in a school system.  Check your AUP regarding this topic before you download anything on to a school issued computer.

==Student Information==
[http://www.safekids.com/'''SafeKids.com'''] is an effective site for finding out lots of information about technology safety for kids including cell phone safety, Internet safety and more.  The following list includes some of the tips for safety that this website provides.

===Safe at School===
#Never give any passwords to anyone (even friends).  That includes locker combinations, lunch passwords, Internet passwords,  or your student ID number.
#Never keep anything expensive in your locker.  Locks can be picked/hacked.
#Follow the rules of your school.  Report any bad behavior to a school official.  It’s the right thing to do.
#Treat school equipment with respect.  It is there for you to use.  Why ruin it?
#Report bullying.  You wouldn’t want it to happen to you.  It could happen to even the most popular person you know.
#Don’t give out personal information to other students.  
#Don’t let other students borrow your cell phone, laptop, iPod, etc.  They may not treat it like you would, even if they are your friend.
#Don't go on internet sites that are not pre-approved by your teacher.
#Let a teacher know if someone is cyberbullying you or on a site that you know is wrong or makes you uncomfortable.

===Cell Phone Safety===
#Don't let other people use your cell phone. 
#If you can't have a cell phone on you at school, leave it at home.  It could get stolen out of your locker.
#Talk with your parents about your texting plan and how much it costs or how many texts you can send per month.  It can get very expensive for you and your parents.
#Don't text back to anyone that you don't recognize and trust.
#Some cell phones have GPS systems (locator system).  Be careful that you don't give information out or communicate with someone that you don't know or trust.  They could locate you.
#Do not try and download illegal material (like child pornography) from your cell.  It is illegal and can be traced.
#Do not bully anyone using your phone and report anyone who may be bullying you (through texts, calling, or web applications)to the authorities or at least to your parents or a teacher.
#Do NOT EVER send pictures of yourself or anyone else to someone you don't know or trust.  
#DO NOT EVER send nude pictures of yourself or others.  Those pictures could be accessed forever and put on line for all to see.

===Preventing Cyberbullying===
You may want to view this [http://www.ikeepsafe.org/assets/videos/?vid=Comcast_Ikeepsafe'''Bullying Video'''].  It is an iSafe video produced by Comcast and can be used as an example of how harmful bullying can be.

===Preventing Sexting===
Sexting is referred to as sending nude photos of yourself or others or sending pornographic material to others using your cell phone or other electronic devices.  See the [http://www.safekids.com/sexting-tips/'''Sexting Tips'''] section of SafeKids.com.
#It could be a form of bullying.  Don't do it.
#It is against the law.  You can get in big trouble. 
#Your pictures could get sent to people you don't want them to.  They could harass you or post them on other sites.
 
If you are sending nude photos to others:
#STOP.  Explain your situation to your parents.  They may be able to help you before others report you to the police. 

If you are receiving nude photos of others:
#DO NOT forward them.  It is illegal.
#Talk to your parents immediately about the situation.  
#If a friend is sending them, talk to the friend about the trouble they could get in with the law.  The law can track these kinds of things without anyone telling on you.

===Preventing Grooming===
Grooming is when people try to form a relationship with a child online or using texting.  At first is seems like the adult is nice by saying flattering things to the child or teenager.  The adult's goal is to have sex, possible rape and/or hurt the child/teenager.  They try to build trust with the young person.  Check out the [http://www.safekids.com/how-to-recognize-grooming-2/'''How to Recognize Grooming''']section of SafeKids.com for some great examples of how these adult predators (pedophoiles) try to trick kids and teenagers.  

Here are a few safety tips to keep this from happening:
#Don't communicate with people you don't know whether it's online, texting, etc.
#Tell your parents if a strange person keeps trying to communicate with you. 
#Someone might tell you that they are a kid/teenager when really they are not.  Don't believe what strangers say.
#Don't agree to meet with anyone in person unless you are with your parents/gaurdians.
#The online predator might tell you that they have a modeling job, money or other attractive things for you. Don't believe it.
#Block messages from strangers, whether they seem like adults, teens or children.
#Let your parents know who you communicate with.

What can make this chapter better?
*Grants.gov vs Federal register - any advantage to searching one over the other?
*Foundation 
**any good free places to search for non-government grants?
**any other good places to search for non-government grants - subscription based
*I think adding more terms and tips would make this chapter more useful

Advocaat (lawyer or advocate) is a liquer which can be made at home from eggs, sugar, vanilla and pure alcohol or brandewijn (Dutch brandy). It can also be purchased commercially.

It becomes a thick light yellow egg nog which is usually enjoyed in the Christmas season and served in very small glasses garnished with whipped cream and eaten with a spoon.</text>

|description =Common Yarrow is a pretty plant capped with a flat cluster of tiny white flowers.  The leaves are very feathery and look a lot like the leaves of a fern.  It grows in open fields and in waste places (such as along roadsides and railroad tracks), but you can also find it in yards.  If you come across one of these, look very closely at it, especially underneath the flowers, and you might find a crab spider.  Crab spiders often make Common Yarrow their homes, because like a chameleon, they can change their color to exactly match that of the Yarrow's blossom.  When an insect comes along to get nectar from the flower, the spider strikes!  The crab spider in the photo on the right has caught a moth.  

Yarrow has also been used as a food, and was very popular as a vegetable in the 17th century. The younger leaves are said to be a pleasant leaf vegetable when cooked as spinach, or in a soup. Yarrow is sweet with a slight bitter taste.  People also brew an herbal tea from the leaves.

|facts = Common Yarrow has a long history as a powerful 'healing herb' used topically for wounds cuts and scrapes. The genus name ''Achillea'' is derived from mythical Greek character, Achilles, who reportedly carried it with his army to treat battle wounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WJ Flower
|common name = Queen Anne's Lace
|binomial = Daucus carota
|color = white
|image1 =Daucus carota inflorescence kz.jpg
|caption1=Note the three-forked bracts beneath the flower cluster
|image2 =Daucus carota0.jpg
|caption2=See the red flower in the center?
|image3 =Daucus Carota ssp azorica (Habitus).jpg

|description =Queen Anne's Lace is similar to Common Yarrow, but it is a bit larger.  Like Common Yarrow, the flowers form a flat cluster at the top of the plant.  Queen Anne's Lace gets taller than Yarrow though, and its leaves, though fern-like, are not as feathery as Yarrow's.  

If you find some, and if it's OK to do so, pull one up (most people consider it a weed, so it's probably OK, but you really should check first).  Now smell the root.  Does it smell like carrots?  If so, don't be surprised - another name for Queen Anne's Lace is Wild Carrots!  Now check the underside of the flower.  You should see some leaf-like bracts coming our from the stem just beneath the flower cluster.  These should have three forks.  If you cannot find three forks, you may have found Spotted Water Hemlock instead, and that plant is very poisonous.  
|facts =If you look closely at the center of the flower cluster, you might find one red or purple flower.  The purpose of this flower is to attract insects.  The plant is called Queen Anne's Lace because the flower cluster looks like lace.  The red one in the center is supposed to represent a drop of blood from when Queen Anne pricked herself with a needle while making lace.

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

I think the primary reasons English is easy to learn are:
#There are already a large portion of English speakers worldwide, foreign or not;
#It lacks a case systems in nouns (excluding pronouns), and verb conjugation is a lot simpler to memorize and adapt to (ratio is 1:50 for some!)
#It has a fairly flexible word order (there are more flexible ones, but those are because they have cases to allow it)
Latin derivations may be a reason but definitely not before those. Currently I'm learning Latin and the only things in my way are the lack of speakers/literary texts aimed at beginners, and the inflection of words. -- [[Special:Contributions/203.171.192.197|203.171.192.197]] ([[User talk:203.171.192.197|talk]]) 01:57, 10 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''[[w:particle physics|particle physics]]''': a branch of physics that studies the elementary constituents of matter and radiation, and the interactions between them. It is also called high energy physics, because many elementary particles do not occur under normal circumstances in nature, but can be created and detected during energetic collisions of other particles, as is done in particle accelerators.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.&quot;   Ecclesiastes 12:13-14


Every Christian, will agree that society must have moral standards if we are to avoid anarchy. But who defines moral standards? Certainly we humans cannot. The answer is: God alone has the authority to define moral standards; because He created us. In other words, Yahweh's law, as recorded in the Bible, identifies the moral standards He wants humanity to live by. If His law didn't exist no one would know right from wrong. 
The Bible says:

&quot; The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. &quot;  Psalm 19: 7-8

&quot;The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.&quot;  Psalm 111:7-8 	


* Yahweh's laws are necessary. 

* They identify sin. They convert the soul! 

* They act like signposts or schoolmasters pointing the way to the Saviour Jesus Christ (Yeshua the Messiah). 

* Without God's law no one would know right from wrong.

* Yahweh's laws are eternal. 

* The high level principles they embody will be obeyed throughout eternity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The comparator shall detect the relative phase and the missing transition===
A CDR phase comparator is a digital circuit operating at line speed that compares the instants of transition (between different levels, or different phases) of the received pulses with the instants of transition of the local clock.

It provides two pieces of information, updated at every cycle of the local clock:
#  '''whether a transition''' in the incoming line signal '''is present''', i.e. whether a meaningful comparison can be made;
#  in the form of a pulse or of  a couple of pulses, '''just the sign''' (bang-bang comparator), '''or the value with sign''' (linear comparator), '''of the phase difference at its inputs'''.

::&lt;small&gt;The same information can be translated into equivalent signals, depending:
::*  on the circuits that follow the phase comparator and
::*  on the architectural choice about what to do when a signal transition is missing:
::::* simply declaring the mid range, indifferent output value when the transition is missing, or
::::* replicating the result of the previous detection when a transition is missing.&lt;/small&gt;

:::As explained further on in this page, the first option (=mid range output on no transition) is often used for bang-bang detectors (Ternary detectors &lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot; /&gt;), while the second option (reconfirm last detection on no transition) can be found in some linear phase comparators and in bang-bang detectors as well.


The phase comparator output(s) are always subject to low-pass filtering to reduce the high frequency contents, that do not carry phase information but that can propagate as noise to other blocks of the CDR.

This low-pass (always present) rejects only signal frequencies higher that those that participate in the loop operation. It is the subsequent [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR' amplifier/filter|filter block]] -when present- that takes care of shaping the loop frequency responses.


Even if the comparator low-pass and the filter block are physically close and often combined together, it is useful to keep separate the two functions: a clear distinction renders the engineering tasks easier.


====Variable density of transitions in the incoming signal====
In a digital transmission, the incoming signal carries its phase information by its transitions from one level to another. 

The NRZ bit stream (the most often used for data transmission) has a variable density of transitions. ''(An [[w:Line code|encoded signal]] may be used, but the problem of variable density of signal transitions, although mitigated, remains).''

In a NRZ signal, a transition occurs when a bit 1 is followed by a bit 0, or viceversa.


=====Irregular flow of incoming level transitions=====
The irregularity can be approximately described defining two parameters of the NRZ bit stream:
: - the maximum '''run length''' ([[w:Run-length limited#Technical overview|the number of contiguous bit (runs) during which the signal does not change level]]);
:  - the '''transition density D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''' (average probability of a signal level change between adjacent pulses of the signal), that corresponds to the concept of the run-length, but from the long-term average point of view. With reference to a given length of a serial signal, and in the hypothesis that it is the average that matters :
&lt;center&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = actual number of transitions / maximum amount of transition  [0% to 100%]&lt;/center&gt;

Both parameters depend on the NRZ bit stream itself and on the rules used to process it.
Essentially, these rules are either: 
: a change of the bits, according to a fixed rule that changes each bit taking into consideration it and a limited number of preceding bits, called [[w:Scrambler|scrambling]]
: an encoding that increases by some percent the bit rate of the original bit stream, either
:: - [[w:Forward error correction|FEC]], or
:: - line codes. The most important line codes are presented in the following table.
The maximum run-length for a code is easy to identify for the codes created to allow a good clock recovery.

With a rough approximation, the run-lengrth may affect the closed loop performance of the CDR in proportion to its value multiplied by:   1 / (f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; ). 

Depending on the specific CDR implementation, the jitter generation may be the performance more affected, or the jitter transfer, or the jitter tolerance.

In any case, the minimum and maximum values of D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; that are specified for the application considered, do influence significantly both the design and the testing of a CDR.


=====What to do when a transition is missing? =====

The phase comparator renders available ''phase'' information when (i.e. if during one period of the local clock) a transition is received, and a the ''missing transition'' information when (i.e. if during one period of the local clock) no transition has been present in the received signal.

How is such information supplied to the next circuit block (the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR' amplifier/filter|amplifier/filter]]) ? What use is made of it?

The answers depend on how the overall PLL circuit is made (i.e. on its architecture) and on what the PLL circuit is meant to do (on its application).


A first distinction can be made between two alternatives:
# '''hold''', in the sense of prolonging  the current PLL state 
# '''free-running''', in the sense that the phase comparator output becomes mid-range for that clock cycle. If maintained, this output of the PD would make the local oscillator run free at its &quot;free-running&quot; frequency.   

:&lt;small&gt;This is similar to the dilemma of a helmsman at night when temporarily unable to see the lighthouse he should guide the ship to, because dazzled by a flash of light, or because something is passing in front, or…
:#The helmsman could take the helm to its amidships position whenever he can not see (= free-running).
:#The helmsman could otherwise hold the position of the helm that he had just before the loss of vision. It should be kept in mind that the phase comparator operates synchronously at the line bit frequency, and its memory span can not be extended in time: at the next clock edge that triggers the flip flops, all memory of the previous phase comparison is lost. To find inside the CDR a memory element similar to the memory of our helmsman, the analogy must include also the loop filter (its time constant -in many cases of the order of 1000 pulses &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tek.com/document/primer/clock-recovery-primer-part-2| Clock Recovery Primer, Part 2 by Guy Foster, par.10: Survey of Clock Recovery Used in Selected Standards]&lt;/ref&gt; - is longer than the longest lack of transitions -that never exceeds 100 pulses ''(see the Table above)''-) and use it to remember the last meaningful information from the phase comparator. 

:This second analogy involves not only helmsman and helm, but also the complete steering gear from helm to rudder, the integration from the rudder position to the direction that the ships points to, and the overall inertia of the ship.
:The helmsman corresponds to the detection of the phase error, the steering gear to the amplifier/filter block, the integration to the phase to frequency relationship in the VCO and the overall inertia to the PLL closed loop low pass characteristic.
&lt;/small&gt;


The choice amongst 1. and 2. can only be made taking into consideration the ship characteristics and function, which correspond to taking into consideration the CDR architecture and application.

:&lt;small&gt;In a small ship with little inertia and direct connection of the tiller to the rudder (PLL architecture 1-1), solution 2. is the best choice . And if the ship is towed, the free-running position  is the destination implicit in the towline, very much like the local clock in the case of a phase aligner.&lt;/small&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;In a very fast, extremely manoeuvrable ship with short hull and very wide rudder angles, that needs fast control and overcompensation, it is only the good reaction of the helmsman and of a servo transmission that can achieve the correct performance. Solution  1. or  2.apply.  Here an analogy with 2-2 architectures inside monolithic CDRs for fiber optic receivers is apparent.
&lt;/small&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;In a big liner with refined mechanics and well balanced hull, 2. may look like a good solution. But a CDR that has reached phase lock looks like a ship that is constantly driven with some offset of the rudder from its central position. The measure of this biased drive is the difference between the free running frequency of the local oscillator f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e. the center amidship position of the helm) and the frequency of the received pulses f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (the rudder position that keeps the ship pointed towards the lighthouse; the offset from center of the rudder position is analog to of the steady state drive error of the VCO). If cost is not a big concern, then 1. is the good solution. That means to disconnect the helm and to freeze the rudder position. On the PLL side of the analogy, a fundamental part of the control loop, the amplifier/filter, must be involved in the solution. This is the case of CDRs with 2-1 architecture for long regeneration spans in Telecom applications. An implementation of the solution 1. can be found in [4]. (A sub-circuit detects when a transition is missing in the incoming NRZ data stream [i.e. when the next data bit is NOT the opposite of the previous data bit]. In such occasions the output of the phase comparator would be unable to generate the couple of pulses whose average duration tells the phase difference between the local clock and the data transitions. The sub-circuit then forces the Low Pass Filter of the PLL to the same filter output that would result from the addition of a “dummy” couple of pulses equal to the last one from the output of the phase comparator.) A further refinement of this type of retrofit is found in [5].
&lt;/small&gt;



===The non-linearities of the phase comparator are the most critical for the CDR modeling===

Mathematical models of a circuit can be very useful. This is especially true if the circuit operation can be considered as linear: in such case the mathematical terms are very neat and describe the circuit in all its different conditions.

Unfortunately the reality is never exactly linear. Rather, it is seldom very close to linear and sometimes can be markedly distant from linearity.

The phase comparator is the CDR component that deviates more often and to a larger extent from linearity.



===Inevitable non-linearities of the phase comparator (the &quot;linear&quot; phase comparator)===


====Linear range====
Even if a circuit operates as linear (to any practical purpose), it has a finite range of operation. The EXOR circuit can be a good introductory example:
[[Image:Exor_phase_comparator.png|center|450px|450px|]]
The figure above represents a clock signal on the lower input that changes its delay with respect to the upper input. 

The output is a periodic signal of twice the frequency of the inputs (the EXOR is a “multiplier”). 

If such delay reaches one full half cycle of the period of the two signals (180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;), the output reaches its maximum level. 

If the delay is further increased, then the output gradually decreases to its minimum level. 

If the two inputs are exactly in phase with each other (0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;), the output is again at its minimum. If the phase difference is gradually varied, the entire input-output characteristic of this circuit can be obtained. It is a triangular sawtooth of period 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;  (= π) and amplitude +/- π   (or 0 to 1, depending on the circuit implementation!).
[[Image:Exor_phase_comparator_of_clocks.png|center|700px|700px|]]
The useful signal is the filtered output, not the output of the EXOR, that has useless wide swings at the clock frequency. In fact the phase comparator always works at the bit line frequency (very high) but the CDR loop just needs the low frequency components of the phase comparison.

(Low frequency means in this case “not  higher than the maximum frequency of significance for the control loop operation”, which is at least 10 times lower than the bit line frequency, but often 100 or more times lower).

In the figure above, two points should be noted:
#Only one of the two slopes of the sawtooth characteristic correspond to stable operation of the loop. Operation on the other one is unstable and the working point would quickly move to the closest end of the nearest stable slope.
#The gain of this comparator, along any stable slope of its characteristic, is 1V / π/4 radian, that is 1.273 V/radian.



===The &quot;linear&quot; phase comparator===

A very simple phase comparator generates a pulse every time a signal transition is received, like the EXOR multiplier of the previous section above does when comparing two clock signals.
[[Image:Exor_and_FF_comparator_for_NRZ_data.png|center|650px|650px|]]
 &lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Introduction to the NRZ-to-Clock linear phase comparator. See the next figure for the full circuit. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This type of  comparator is called “linear” because the duration of the generated pulses is proportional (='''linear''' relation) to the phase distance between the transition of the incoming signal and the corresponding transition of the other input signal.

The pulses obtained in the figure above tell -with their duration- the phase distance between each transition of the incoming signal and the next sampling edge of the local clock (such distance should be 90&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; , or π/2, for optimum sampling of the received waveform).

Unfortunately such pulses can only be obtained when a signal transition is present.



=====What should the linear comparator do when a transition is missing? =====
*1. '''To steer abruptly to one side'''? Certainly not this type of linear comparator! &lt;small&gt;(Some [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#Reconfirm the previous detection when a transition is missing? More jitter but gain independence from DT !|bang-bang comparators]] may, in special cases).&lt;/small&gt; But this is what the output waveform in the figure &lt;u&gt;above&lt;/u&gt; does, because it stays at its lowest level when no transitions are present! 
*2. The helmsman could '''take the helm to its amidships position''' whenever he can not see. The equivalent to taking the helm to its central position would be obtained with the retrofit to our phase comparator that is described in the &lt;u&gt;following&lt;/u&gt; figure.
:- I&lt;small&gt;n case of a transition, It subtracts a pulse lasting exactly one half-period to the pulse generated by the comparator. As a result, just the difference between zero phase and transition phase is the actual output.&lt;/small&gt;
:- I&lt;small&gt;n case the transition is missing, the comparator contributes with a low level, and the retrofit with a high level: the actual output is a constant mid level, that corresponds to the detection of zero phase diference.&lt;/small&gt;
[[Image:Linear phase comparator for NRZ data input var gain.png|center|850px|650px|]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt; NRZ-to-Clock phase comparator &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
::''&lt;small&gt;The compensating pulse starts from zero and goes negative as soon as the comparing pulse ends.&lt;/small&gt;''
::''&lt;small&gt;The (positive) comparing pulse has a duration proportional to the phase difference plus T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; / 2 (0 for -π, T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; for +π), while the (negative) compensating pulse has a fixed duration of T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; / 2.&lt;/small&gt;''

&lt;center&gt;'''50% clock duty cycle is not necessary in a linear phase comparator'''&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:em8; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt; 
::::&lt;small&gt;The clock waveform needed by the linear comparator in the figure above must have a 50% duty cycle. The duration of the compensating pulse varies with it.&lt;/small&gt;

::::&lt;small&gt;Is it possible to conceive another variant of the basic linear comparator, where this 50% duty cycle is not necessary? '''Yes!'''&lt;/small&gt;

::::&lt;small&gt;E.g., the signal “Period following a transition” could be inverted and used as compensating pulse. It would directly drive the second resistor that should be doubled to compensate for the doubled duration of the compensating pulse&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

:::&lt;u&gt;A clock for a linear phase comparator needs not be 50% duty cycle, because just its positive going transition is really needed to measure the relative phase.&lt;/u&gt;

::The gain of this phase comparator will be a function of the ratio between the actual number of transitions in the incoming signal, and the number of transitions corresponding to a continuous 10101010.. data pattern. This ratio is D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, the transition density, defined earlier in this page. 
::The comparator gain can be calculated considering that the couple of output pulses (corresponding to one input transition) averages:
::: -50%  for a clock sampling the transition at the beginning of the received pulse  (clock phase = -&amp;pi; radian),
:::    0%   for a clock sampling the center of the received pulse (clock phase = 0 radian) and
::: +50%  for a clock sampling the end transition of the received pulse (clock phase = +π radian)

::Taking into account also the transition density:
&lt;center&gt;Gain =  D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;  /  2π    [V/radian.]&lt;/center&gt;


::The characteristic of this comparator as a function of the phase difference of its inputs is again a sawtooth, but has normally oblique stable slopes and vertical unstable slopes.
[[File:Char of a linear phase comp for different DT.png|center|700px|&lt;center&gt;''Characteristic of the linear comparator. Sawtooth with linear, stable slopes and vertical, unstable slopes alternating. Three different densities of the level transitions that can be compared with the reference clock.''&lt;/center&gt;]]
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:em8; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt; 
::::&lt;small&gt;The transition density  D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; in practical cases is never very close to zero. The information bits  sent to the other end of the communication link are processed and receive the addition of other bits. When transmitted they become, amongst other elaborations,:&lt;/small&gt;
::::: &lt;small&gt;- often structured in bytes via the 8B10B coding (which ensures that the difference between the count of 1s and 0s in a string of at least 20 bits is no more than 2, and that there are not more than five 1s or 0s in a row. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8B10B| See also 8b/10b encoding, from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia])&lt;/small&gt;
::::: &lt;small&gt;- often scrambled (which is exactly meant to reduce the probability of long strings of identical bits.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambler | See also Scrambler in telecommunication and recording, from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia])&lt;/small&gt;
::::: &lt;small&gt;- often processed with Forward Error Correction coding ( [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction | See also Scrambler, from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia] ).&lt;/small&gt;
:::::&lt;small&gt;- sometimes (Wide Area Networks) intermixed with headers and tails of layer 1, layer 2 and layer 3 framing&lt;/small&gt;
::::&lt;small&gt;so that the bit flow that is actually transmitted exhibits a D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; much closer to its mid range value of 0.5. The values of  D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; actually expected shall be used to evaluate the actual behavior of the phase comparator and its gain&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;


*3. It would be best for our helmsman -temporarily blind- '''to maintain''' for a while '''the position of the helm that he had just before''' the loss of vision. The same holds good for the output of the phase comparator if it is followed by a filter that can remember its present output for longer than the longest run rate expected. Note that the analogy is now between the rudder position and the signal that drives the VCO (= the output of the filter, not any longer simply the output of the phase comparator). 

A CDR that has reached phase lock looks like a ship that is forever on a curving path. The measure of this unending curve is the difference between the free running frequency of the local oscillator f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e. the center position of the rudder) and the frequency of the received pulses f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (the difference telling the rotation of the rudder, analogy of the steady state drive error of the local oscillator). Therefore CDRs with linear comparators are least sensitive to long run-lenths when retrofitted in this sense. An implementation of such a retrofit can be found in &lt;ref&gt; A Monolithic 156 Mb/s Clock and Data Recovery PLL Circuit Using the Sample -and-Hold Technique  by Noboru Ishihara and Yukio Akazawa, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. SC-29, pp. 1566-1571, December 1994&lt;/ref&gt;. (''A sub-circuit detects when a transition is missing in the incoming NRZ data stream [i.e. when the next data bit is NOT the opposite of the previous data bit]. In such occasions the output of the phase comparator would  be unable to generate the couple of pulses whose average duration tells the phase difference between the local clock and the data transitions. The sub-circuit then forces the Low Pass Filter of the PLL to the same filter output that would result from the addition of a “dummy” couple of pulses equal to the last one from the output of the phase comparator.''). 
A further refinement of this type of retrofit is found in &lt;ref&gt;A 2.5 Gb/s Clock and Data Recovery IC with tuneable Jitter Characteristics for Use in LAN's and WAN's by Keiji Kishine, Noburu Ishihara, Ken-ichi Takiguchi, Haruhiko Ichino, 1999, a paper inserted in : Phae-Locking in High-Performance Systems, edited by Behzad Razavi  2003 &lt;/ref&gt;.

This 3. way of  filling the intervals of lack of transition(s) uses some sort of &quot;analog&quot; memory and makes the gain of the linear comparator independent from the transition density and equal to its  at maximum value D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;.
::&lt;small&gt;The circuit diagrams of the linear comparator in the figures above have been reduced to very simple cases that still incorporate the essential features, for sake of quick understanding.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The actual circuits may be somewhat more complex, but they do retain the same essential structure and features.&lt;/small&gt;

===Deliberately non-linear phase comparator (bang-bang)===
Its characteristics are well described in the fundamental article of J.D.H. Alexander &lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;&gt;J.D.H. Alexander, &quot;Clock Recovery from Random Binary Signals&quot;, vol. 11, pp. 541 - 542, October 1975 in Electronics Letters. © Institution of Electrical Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a circuit easy to understand and easy to design.

Unfortunately it is strongly nonlinear: 
*its operations consists in the generation of pulses of fixed amplitude and duration at every period of the local clock, and 
*it detects only the sign of the phase difference but does not collect any information about the amount of the phase difference it detects.

The term detector seems more appropriate than the term comparator in this case.

The bang-bang detector is easy to integrate inside a monolithic chip. Sometimes (when the line pulses are at frequency close to the F&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; of the chip technology &lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omnisterra.com/walker/pdfs.papers/BBPLL.pdf|title=Designing Bang-Bang PLLs for Clock and Data Recovery in Serial Data Transmission Systems|author=Richard C. Walker|year=2003|publisher= pp. 34-45, a chapter appearing in &quot;Phase-Locking in High-Performance Sytems - From Devices to Architectures&quot;, edited by Behzad Razavi, IEEE Press, 2003, ISBN 0-471-44727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it may even be the only possible comparator for a monolythic CDR.




====The classic bang-bang phase detector====
&lt;center&gt;The Alexander&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot; /&gt; phase detector&lt;/center&gt;
[[File:Bang – Bang Phase Detector.png|thumb|center|500px|&lt;center&gt;The bang-bang phase detector compares the negative edge of the clock with the data transition,&lt;br /&gt;
and the present data bit with the previous data bit.&lt;br /&gt;
Using 4 flip flops the resulting info is contemporarily available for one entire clock period.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The flip flop 3 is clocked with the negative edge of the local clock and detects (when there is an transition in the input data) whether its sampling edge comes before ( Early ) or after ( Late ) the data transition.

The other three flip flops are clocked with the positive edge of the local clock, and make their outputs stable and contemporarily available for one entire clock period:
*Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : the result of sampling the input data waveform with the positive edge of the local clock;
*Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : the result of sampling the input data waveform, with the positive edge of the local clock, one clock period before;
*Q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; : 
***the clock negative edge has been early (E=1) or late (E=0) with respect to the data transtion, if a transition has occurred;
***if no transition has actually occurred, Q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tells the sign common to the two bits (but in this case, this signal is not relevant for phase detection).
&lt;center&gt;&lt;u&gt;This comparator '''requires''' a local clock with positive and negative edge equally spaced by half a clock period ('''duty cycle = 50%''')&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
:The distance in time between the negative edge and the positive edge represents the time between the transition detection and the sampling of the received pulse.
:If it is different from 50% of the clock period, then the sampling deviates correspondingly from the optimum sampling instant when the received pulse (supposed symmetric) is maximum, and makes the Bit Error Rate worsen.
::&lt;small&gt;&quot;Using a fully differential ring oscillator, it is possible to achieve a very precise 50% duty-cycle clock source.&quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot; /&gt;

The output of the detector is a combinatorial function of the three signals, Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, but can essentially be resumed by two bits: T and E.
# T      = there has been, or there has not been, a '''transition''' in the input signal. T =  {{overline|Q}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{overline|Q}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
# E      = if there has been a transition, the local clock has been found either '''early''' or late. E =  {{overline|Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}Q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{overline|Q}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Note that E is meaningless when T=0 (cells with light grey background), that is when no transition of data occurs.

The logic after the flip flops can be slightly modified if a [[#The charge pump inside a PLL comparator for clock and data recovery|charge pump]] is present, and generate the two signals UP and DOWN to drive the two current generators of the charge pump.

::&lt;small&gt;DOWN=T*E activates the charge pump (to reduce the cumulated charge) only when its value is 1. It is never 1 when T=0.
&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;{{overline|UP}}  (= UP active low) activates the charge pump (to increase the cumulated charge) only when its value is 0. It is never 0 when T=0.&lt;/small&gt;



====Reconfirm the previous detection when a transition is missing? More jitter but gain independence from D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; !====

It is possible to add to the bang-bang detector logic some circuits that channel into a single wire the information needed to drive the following stage in the PLL (the amplifier/filter).
::&lt;small&gt;This may be convenient in particular when the output signals from two different phase detector are put together to implement a Phase and Frequency Detector [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR Phase and Frequency Detector PFD#How a bang-bang PFD is made|PFD]].&lt;/small&gt;


During the  clock period corresponding to a missing transition,  it is possible for the detector to either:
* signal '''free-running''', i.e. to generate a waveform of average value ½ (in the example of the temporarily blind helmsman, this corresponds to bringing the helm to its central position). 
::&lt;small&gt;''This is exactly equivalent to what the two signals  UP and DOWN do in the case of the charge pump, that output a zero current for one clock period in correspondence to a missing transition'';&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The detector that outputs  '''an intermediate state, or level, when no transition is detected''' is called '''&quot;ternary&quot;''', as opposed to &quot;binary&quot; that can only output two states (or levels). A ternary detector is often found in practice.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The third level gradually propagates to the output of the charge-pump filter and then to the output phase of the VCO.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;It is also possible to retrofit wit a sample-and-hold fixture the loop filter (between the first coarse low-pass at the output of the charge pump and the low-pass that actually implements the loop filter, in a way essentially identical to the continuous mode CDR using a linear comparator. The transition from the present level of VCO drive level to the free-running drive level can be made even longer.&lt;/small&gt;

* signal '''hold''', i.e. to repeat the last output, again and again as long as no new transition arrives. This is different from the hold of  a linear comparator, that requires an additional analog memory. The bang-bang detector can easily be retrofitted to hold, but only into either of the two extreme output levels.
::&lt;small&gt;In [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Applications of the 2nd order type 2 architecture|applications with the 2 - 2 architecture]] this is mitigated by the very low gain of the filter block at mid and high frequencies, compensating the very high gain of the monolithic VCO.&lt;/small&gt;

The additional logic would conceptually work as in the following figure:
[[File:One wire only.png|thumb|400px|center|&lt;center&gt;Bang bang output on a single wire, without or with transition stuffing&lt;/center&gt;]]


Which between free-running and hold? The question is best answered making reference to the CDR &lt;u&gt;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#The three CDR functions in the clock domain|functions]]&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Burst and Continuous transmission modes#From the application point of view|applications]]&lt;/u&gt;.
# '''burst-mode''' CDRs and phase aligners in particular. Transition stuffing is NOT needed, and free-running is best.
::&lt;small&gt;To &quot;reconfirm&quot; the detector would always output the detection obtained from the last signal transition, independently of the number of cycles elapsed after it (independently of the instantaneous run-length).&lt;/small&gt; 
::&lt;small&gt;The option of reconfirming the previous detection in case of  lack of transitions would offer the advantage of a faster acquisition and the disadvantage of an increased jitter once acquisition is achieved.&lt;/small&gt; 
::&lt;small&gt;A fast acquisition is fundamental in '''[[Clock and Data Recovery/Burst and Continuous transmission modes#Burst transmission mode|burst-mode]] transmission''', where  unfortunately the described advantage does not materialise. In fact there is no need to reconfirm because transitions are not missing! The  protocols include at the beginning of every burst a sequence of dummy bits with transition density equal to 100%, for a duration sufficient for a good acquisition. As the advantage cannot materialize, the '''repetition is not a necessary choice in burst mode'''.&lt;/small&gt;
::Phase-aligners are a special case of burst-mode CDRs, &lt;small&gt;where the phase of the local clock does not drift at all unless explicitly requested to do so. Once acquisition is achieved, the phase bangs forth and back around the best position.&lt;/small&gt; No transition stuffing&lt;small&gt;, as its only result would be to increase the jitter and to decrease the jitter tolerance. A ternary detector drives directly the phase of the local clock.&lt;/small&gt; 


# In the case of '''[[Clock and Data Recovery/Burst and Continuous transmission modes#Continuous transmission mode|continuous mode]] transmission''', a fast acquisition is not the prime requirement and the addition of &quot;hunting&quot; jitter to the output signal is somewhat of a deterioration of performances. The bang-bang detector already generates a lot of jitter anyway, and  a further jitter addition is not welcome.
::&lt;small&gt;Although usable for tightly constrained block codes as [[W:8b/10b encoding|8b10b]], binary phase detectors are essentially unusable for codes such as 10Gb Ethernet [[W:64b/66b encoding|64b66b]] or [[W:Synchronous optical networking|SONET]] which have very long run lengths of up to 66 or 80 bits, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot; /&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

On the other hand the repetition offers &quot;the advantage of a constant detector gain and therefore of a reduced pattern dependent jitter&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jafar Savoj and Behzad Razavi, A 10-Gb/s CMOS Clock and  Data Recovery Circuit with a Half-Rate Linear Phase Detector, IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, VOL. 36, NO. 5, MAY 2001,  http://www.seas.ucla.edu/brweb/papers/Journals/S&amp;RMay01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

The the trade-off between advantages and disadvantages is debatable, but '''free-running in the sense of a ternary output''' is more often '''preferred''' also for '''continuous mode''' applications.



====Bang-bang Phase Detector with “hold”====
This detector is similar to the Alexander detector, from which it differs because its output that is made up of one wire only.
[[File:Bang bang Phase Detector with “hold”.jpg|thumb|800px|center|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Description of a bang-bang PD with one output wire only.&lt;br&gt;The output remains at the previous level every time that the input data stream lacks a transition (i.e. it &quot;holds&quot;), and makes the detector gain independent from D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

The data retimed by CK are present on Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. They are then used to sample Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:
* with the leading edges in flip-flop 3  (the output used is  {{overline|Q}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and 
* with the trailing edges in flip-flop 4  (the output used is  Q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). 

Q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are obtained from the Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signal, that is sampled respectively by the leading edge and by the trailing edge of Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ( = by the transitions of the retimed data ).

Q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stores the result of sampling the latest rising data transition by {{overline|CK}}, Q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; stores the result of sampling the latest falling data transition by {{overline|CK}}.

The multiplexer at the end is driven by the retimed data and uses {{overline|Q}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; according to the retimed data polarity.

The PD output corresponds to asserting ''L with_hold_if {{overline|T}}'' where L means ''Late_active_high'' and {{overline|T}} means ''Transition_active_low''.


The result is that the state machine output (= PD) is clocked by the local clock (CK in the figure above).



An equivalent representation of this PD, oriented to implementations inside high speed ICs, is  presented in the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR Phase and Frequency Detector PFD#A bang-bang Phase Detector that &quot;holds&quot;, in a different representation|next]] page.



====The charge pump inside a PLL comparator for clock and data recovery====
The two output signals of the comparator logic, (for instance T and E), are combined together. A simple low-pass follows. The resulting signal drives the subsequent [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR' amplifier/filter|amplifier/filter]] block.

In most monolythic implementations of CDRs, the two output signals, coming out of the sequential logic of the phase comparator, drive a charge pump.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd M. Gardner, &quot;Charge-Pump Phase-Lock Loops&quot;, vol. COM-28, NO.11, pp. 1849 - 1858, November 1980 in IEEE TRANSACTION ON COMMUNICATION.&lt;/ref&gt;

On each wire, pulses of fixed amplitude and duration come from the comparator logic with the frequency of the local oscillator (equal to f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; when in lock).

They represent, with their value 0 or 1, the relative phase of the input data signal with respect to the local clock. &lt;small&gt;''(Their duration, unlike in a linear Phase Comparator, does not carry any &quot;analog&quot; information about the value of the input phase difference).''&lt;/small&gt;
[[File:Charge pump.png|thumb||center|450px|&lt;center&gt;Charge pump that follows the comparator logic.&lt;br /&gt;
Both the green and red network implement a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 2 loop. &lt;br&gt;
The red one makes the filter h-f gain (largely) independent from I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The capacitor C (in black) is the charge pump high-frequency low pass. &lt;/center&gt;]]
The active part of the charge pump is made by two current generators of equal value.

One is a source from V&lt;sub&gt;dd&lt;/sub&gt; and the other is a sink to V&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;; their outputs are connected.

The source is activated when the comparator logic indicates that there has been a transition and that the second input of the comparator (the local clock in a PLL) is late with respect to the first input (the incoming data stream in a PLL).

The sink is activated when the comparator logic indicates that there has been a transition and that the local clock has been found early.


The condition when both are active, or are not active, at the same time, is equivalent to the third state of a ternary comparator and carries no indication of phase difference, neither of early clock nor of late clock.

The loop filter (in red or in green in the figure above) remains frozen and keeps the VCO frequency frozen as well.

The output node, connected to the two current generators, drives in turn an RC network that filters the current pulses. More precisely, the RC network accomplishes two functions:
#to smooth down the sharp corners of the current pulses, eliminating the high frequency components around fp, 3fp, etc... This low-pass does not eliminates baseband signal frequencies that carry useful phase information from the comparator (in the figure above, &lt;u&gt;this function is performed essentially by C&lt;/u&gt;).
#to filter the control loop signals so that the dynamic performances of the loop (jitter transfer, jitter tolerance, noise generation) are modified and improved. In the figure above, &lt;u&gt;this second function is primarily performed by (one of) the colored RC networks&lt;/u&gt;.
Both filtering networks implement a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2 loop, the most common for charge pumps.  

The network in red implements a more accurate definition of the high frequency gain of the overall loop (resistor values are more accurate than I&lt;sub&gt;cp&lt;/sub&gt; values). The resistor ratio varies the loop damping factor. The resistor ratio allows also the reduction of the filter gain. An attenuation (instead of a gain) is needed to compensate for a very high gain of the VCO, which is typical of [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Applications of the 2nd order type 2 architecture|monolithic  CDRs ]]



===Gain of the two main types of phase comparators===
The gain of the bang-bang detector is not constant, but varies with the signal amplitude.&lt;br /&gt;
The gain is maximum when the difference signal at the input of the detector deviates least from its center value (from zero difference).


The gain is minimum instead when the signal deviates most from its center value.

When the gain of a bang-bang phase detector is indicated by a fixed value, that value means the minimum gain at the largest phase difference close to the output inversion.

[[File:Static gain of comparators.png|thumb||center|770px|&lt;center&gt;Transfer curve and gain of the linear and of the bang-bang comparators as a function of the phase difference at their inputs&lt;/center&gt;]]




====D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is a factor of the comparator gain====
It is important to keep in mind that the gain curves shown for both types of phase comparator correspond to a transition density D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; equal to its maximum, i.e. 100%.


When transitions are missing, which always occurs in practical cases, the D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; (the average frequency of the their occurrences with respect to their possible maximum)  decreases accordingly.


The gain of the comparator may decrease by the same amount as D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; (unless the comparator has been deliberately made &quot;D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; independent&quot;), and this decrease of the comparator gain affects the loop characteristics and performances.


As it will be shown , loop models with different architectures are affected  differently by a gain variation [[Clock and Data Recovery/Conclusion#Just three models are needed for a solid background]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==INTRODUCTION TO THE LAW OF GOD==
The idea of 'law' can conjure up in one's mind the concept of judgment, restriction, suppression and control which inhibits our freedom of expression and limits our creativity as individuals to cause unnecessary restraint and bondage. It is the nature of fallen man to question and rebel against set standards and not accept/believe that the stated consequences and results of breaking the rules will come upon us. It’s our nature to seek out our own knowledge through experience, and to believe out of our experience of the resulting consequences, rather than to trust and obey as Yahweh God has asked us to do from the beginning in the Garden.

==DEFINITION OF LAW==
A Dictionary definition says that a 'law' is &quot;a rule established among a community and enjoining or prohibiting certain action, the system made  up of these rules, its controlling power, the order produced by it, its administration&quot;  etc. ..  (The Australian Oxford Dictionary)

So we have the word defined as a rule or set of rules which prescribe or prohibit our actions to conform to a certain order or pattern of behaviour. The 'Law of God' has many aspects and there are a variety of words used in the Hebrew text, for the different categories within His Law which identifies their classification. 

The word 'torah' is the Hebrew word for teaching and direction for life and the one mostly used for the laws/principles which Yahweh God has given to His people for their benefit and spiritual well-being. This is a different concept from the meaning which we normally attach to the word 'law' and its penalties.

The other categories for instance are,

The Judgments (Mishpatim) are the methods of administering justice in human affairs.

The Statutes (Chukkim) are the precepts or regulations for Health Care and Hygiene etc.

The Testimonies (Edot) are the earthly types that give witness to His plans and purposes (Tabernacle, Feasts)

The Commands (Mitzvot) are the ordinances or commands related to the terms of the covenant


The word 'law' is used in very general terms in the New Testament, to cover a wide variety of meaning unlike the Hebrew of the Old Testament. The word in Greek is NOMOS which according to Vine's Expository Dictionary means &quot;to divide out, primarily that which is assigned, hence, usage, custom, or by statute; .. .. .. .. nomos became the established name for law as decreed by state and set up as the standard for the administration of justice.  In the New Testament it is used in general expressing a general principle relating to law.&quot;

Youngs Analytical Concordance gives the rendition of 'nomos', as 'law, ordinance, custom'.  

The term 'law' then in the new Testament was used for every aspect of the body of the Law , whereas, in the Old Testament we have several Hebrew words for our English 'law' which cover the varieties of meaning from laws, statutes and precepts to directions or teaching. The Greek and the English words don't classify them. 

==THE REASON FOR LAWS==
The whole creation is established on set rules for its function. Governments and social structures are based upon agreed-upon rules for their functioning as are all organisations and groups. Sometimes those rules are informal as an agreed upon code of ethics between its members, but just the same, any organised activity has to have rules of conduct for the participants and share common goals. Without that there is anarchy.

Rules set the standard for any activity as the guidelines upon which it is to function and define that activity. Those who desire to engage in the activity have to accept the rules. so, the rules are not really the focus. We engage in activities because we enjoy and find fulfillment in those activities and the achievement of the set purpose of the activity. So it’s more about what our goal is, than about what the rules are and it comes down to the focus of our interest and how important it is to us to be involved in the activity or achieve the set goal.

A participant who hasn't got a clear focus or enthusiasm for the goal, may object to the rules of engagement. Yahweh runs everything by rules too. Yahweh's Law, as recorded in the Bible, identifies the moral standards He wants humanity to live by. If Yahweh's law didn't exist no one would know right from wrong. Because He is the ultimate Ruler, He has the right to set the standards and make the rules of engagement.

There are 'rules' or principles involved in having a relationship with Yahweh God through Yeshua, His Son. He sets before us the goal of knowing Him and having eternal life with Him in the kingdom of God (John 17:3).

The rules are a means to achieve the end purpose and not an end in themselves. We are not following a set of rules but a Person with whom we desire to have a relationship; which relationship just happens to be governed and defined by a set of rules to achieve that purpose. To anyone not interested in a closer relationship with God, then His rules are a restrictive burden to follow, which will appear legalistic.  Whereas, someone who is passionate about knowing Him in a deeper way, will eagerly embrace the 'rules' as that means to the end.

==WHAT IS GOD'S LAW==
The Scriptures are His rule book on how to love Him with all our heart, soul, mind and strength; and on how to love those around us, as ourselves. Those rules instruct us on how to interact socially and morally with our neighbors, how to interact with our enemies; how to deal in business and with property and contain the blueprint for every aspect of life in the kingdom of God and how to avoid the path which leads to death. 

When we study His rules and apply them to our lives, we will enter into a deeper measure of covenant relationship with Him  (John 15:21). Whereas when we break His laws, His Spirit withdraws from us.

&quot;Whoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law&quot;  (1 John 3:4)  

Breaking His law is sin, and sin separates us from a holy God.  Therefore, 
&quot;... if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.&quot;  (Matthew 19:17)

&quot;The law of Yahweh is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of Yahweh is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of Yahweh are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes&quot;  (Psalm 19:7-8)

Those rules were given to the nation of Israel, as the Constitution of the nation, to guide every decision in the government, in the judiciary system and in both their religious and private life. 

Where a nation is not established upon God's laws, those by-laws which apply to governmental and judiciary systems are redundant and superfluous because they cannot be put into effect. That however, does not imply that those laws have changed or been done away with. They will be instituted in the Kingdom  of God.
His laws are eternal and unchanging but the implementation of some laws are suspended now until the kingdom of God is established on earth. For now, it remains for each individual to apply the principles of His righteous laws within the framework of the society in which they live, and to the extent that they have personally responsibility. Yahweh's laws are eternal and the high level of principles which they embody will be inscribed on true believers' minds and hearts and will be instinctively obeyed throughout eternity.

&quot;All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.&quot;  (Psalm 111:7-8)

Everything is going to be judged by His Law. That is the plum-line against which everyone will be measured.

&quot;Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.&quot;  (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14)

&quot;And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.&quot;  (Revelation 20:12)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE LAW BEFORE MESSIAH==
The Law of Yahweh God is eternal, however the depth of understanding of man to walk in His ways is progressive over time and has been unveiled by God in greater measure throughout history as He has taken His people forward in His eternal purposes for their spiritual growth into sonship.

==THE LAW BEFORE SINAI==
The Patriarchs had a knowledge of the eternal law of God and its application in keeping the ordinances. It is often called the Age of Conscience, as the godly line retained the knowledge which Adam had walked in and passed it on down until the flood. The godly lineage was then carried through Shem and imparted to Abraham who was brought up in, and called out of, the heathen culture of his time (Genesis 14:18-24; 18:19; 26:5).

We see that Abraham was familiar with the necessary sacrifices and ordinances and taught them to his household (Abram - Genesis 12:8; 13:4, 18; 14: 20c; 15:9-10; 21:27-32; Jacob - Genesis 28:18-22; 35:1-4, 11-15)
Note that they understood the requirements for sacrifices and offerings, tithes and covenants.

Moses also had been taught the laws of God, and was well able to judge matters of the law and teach the people before the actual giving of the Law at Sinai (Exodus 18:15-16; 19-29). So when the Lord spoke to them at Sinai, it was not new to them, but His law was then established to them with authority as a covenant.

The Sabbath which they had not been able to keep under the work schedule of Egypt, was restored to them before they came to Sinai, so it was not without an understanding of what was involved when Yahweh God presented to them the terms of obedience on their part for His covenant with them, before the Law was actually formally given to them at Sinai  (Exodus 16:4-5; 19:5-6).

==THE LAW AT SINAI==
Notice that Yahweh presented to them the terms of the covenant, &quot;Now therefore&quot; --  i.e.  on the basis of His love and provision for them and His mighty deliverance of them from the hand of the enemy:
&quot;if you will obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine, and you shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot;  (Exodus 19:5-6)

This was the covenant  --  obedience to His voice on their part with His promise of their elevation to a special place with Him, a holy people with a ministry of priesthood as a nation to the rest of the world. Notice that it was a call to obedience to His voice in particular, and not to written Laws. It was a call to a personal relationship with Him. For this purpose, they were to prepare themselves by setting themselves apart as a nation from everything of the natural, to consecrate them for the divine encounter (Exodus 19:10-14).The terms of the covenant were presented to them first for their agreement and then, when the necessary consecration was done, He spoke His Word to them. The covenant was enacted before and separately from, the giving of His spoken Law. What they had in effect, was His Word spoken into their inner being and it was so overpoweringly awesome that they could not bear it and requested Moses to be their mediator and hear the Word from Yahweh on their behalf  (Exodus 20:18-19).

The scripture tells us that there were &quot;thunderings, lightning flashes, the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking&quot; (Ex.21:18). Sound waves are vibrations and in the transmission of sound through the heavens we hear thunder before we see the lightning flashes. This is a parallel to what is being described here. The voice of the Lord resonated through the mountain as &quot;voices&quot; (thunderings) that went forth in a multiple fiery substance (lightnings) in various sound waves and passed through their midst.  

The Hebrew text literally translated, means &quot;voices&quot; and &quot;torches&quot;; they were as &quot;voices&quot; (thunderings) that went forth as 'torches' of fire (lightnings). This is very similar to the inauguration of the new covenant where the &quot;tongues of fire&quot; came and sat upon each of them and each one heard in their own tongue (Acts 2: 4; 7-11). The Rabbis say that the tongues of fire danced through their midst, passing from head to head, so that each one heard the voice of the words of Yahweh without Moses needing to speak as an intermediary.

Yahweh came personally to speak to His Beloved Israel the terms of the marriage contract that she was entering into with Him.  A prospective groom speaks personally and intimately with his Bride-to-be, heart to heart.  So with Yahweh, He came and spoke to her personally the terms of His marriage covenant with her.  He told her that she would be His prized possession and that she would be a kingdom of priests unto Him, a holy, set-apart people that He would delight in, His special purchased possession.

All Jewish weddings begin with a ceremonial washing by immersion, in preparation for the wedding to come.  In this ritual, the bride immerses herself completely into a pool of water, symbolically cleansing all impurities, as did Israel before the giving of the Law (Ex.19:10). She then came up out of the water to meet her husband.  The bride and groom then meet for the ceremony under a wedding canopy, which represents the cloud upon the mountain. They then enter into vows upon the terms of the wedding contract – representing the covenant agreement, which certifies the union. The ten words spoken are those He spoke to His Bride from the Cloud, when He accepted her. He, as the Groom then went about making preparations for them to dwell together in the Tabernacle of meeting - the Mishkan.

Moses went, according to the request of the people and the agreement of Yahweh, to come before Him to hear the rest of the Law with its ordinances and the promises pertaining to the covenant  (Exodus 20:22-23:32). He returns and &quot;told the people all the words of the Lord and all its judgments. And all the people answered with one voice and said, 'All the words which the Lord has said, we will do'&quot;  (Exodus 24:3).

He then wrote all the words of the Lord in a book, made an altar, prepared the necessary sacrifices and enacted the covenant &quot;according to all these words&quot;  (Exodus 24:4-8).

Notice that this covenant is made upon the spoken Word, not upon the written Word, although He also gave it to them in written form, too. They had the Word enter their heart in a spiritual form and penetrate deep into their being when they were on the mount, as well as having the written form of the Word given to them. It was also His intention to give them the essence of His Word &quot;written with the finger of God&quot;', the ten commands, which Moses received when he went up the mountain again (Exodus 31:18).

But the scripture says, &quot;but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:2)  In their fear they drew back and did not enter into the relationship that He provided, but chose instead to have Moses as their mediator and remain in unbelief and hardness of heart. In Moses absence, devoid of a personal relationship, they fell into idolatry and the covenant was broken. 

Tablets of natural stone, which Moses had to cut, replaced the broken covenant, symbolised by the broken tablets, whereas the original tablets were said to be of the pavement upon which He stood (Exodus 24:9-11). In all, the covenant, the priesthood and the application of the Law, which replaced the original, was an earthly, natural form of the previous covenantal relationship and promises (Exodus 32: 34:1). 

They failed to enter into the spiritual inheritance He had for them of being a kingdom of priests to the nations. This was His perfect will for them to enter at this time, however, His provision for their failure was to have the Levitical priesthood compensate as an intermediary function until the fullness of time for Messiah would come. Then, through the perfect sacrifice in the offering of Himself, the stony heart could be replaced with the Law written on the tablets of their hearts by the Finger of God (Ezekiel 36:26; 2 Corinthians 3:3; Hebrews 8:10).

His laws, which had to be written on tablets of stone and could find no resting place in its pure essence on the stony heart of man, found embodiment in the Son of Man as the Word made flesh  (John 1:14). By His Spirit, man can now be born of the incorruptible seed of the Word of God in the new covenant (1 Peter 1:23, 25).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE LAW AT SINAI==
Daniel was given a vision wherein he saw the throne of Yahweh God. In describing it, he said, &quot;His throne was a fiery flame, its wheels a burning fire; A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him&quot;  (Daniel 7:9b-10)  Literally, that reads,
' His throne was like flames of fire, its wheels were burning fire; a river of fire ran and issued from before Him'
[Strongs gives the meaning of flames 'as split into tongues'  -  i.e. tongues of fire]

We are told that, &quot;Our God is a consuming fire&quot; (Hebrews 12:29). He appeared to Moses in the burning bush as a flame of fire (Exodus 3:2).  This is the essence of His Being which manifests in Light/Truth and Love which are the two things which are generated from fire - light and warmth (1 John 1:5; 4:8). 

On many occasions of divine manifestations, prior to The Word manifesting in human flesh, He came in the form of angelic Beings which veiled His glory to a measure and which was tolerable to man's perceptions. However, at Sinai, it was the very essence of Yahweh God which came forth from the throne room of heaven and broke forth into this earth's physical dimensions.  In the process of this, the mountain quaked and the rocks rent, as His fiery essence was transmitted through His Word (John 1:1-3),  to the people.

&quot;Now Mount Sinai was completely in smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire. Its smoke ascended like the fire of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly&quot;  (Exodus19:18); and,
&quot;The earth shook; the heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God; Sinai itself was moved at the Presence of God, the God of Israel&quot;  (Psalm 68:8; Judges 5:5).

This is confirmed by Moses in a later account, where he says, &quot;The Lord came forth from Sinai, .... .. And He came with ten thousand of saints; from His right hand came a fiery law for them&quot;  (Deuteronomy 33:2)  
Literally this reads, 'from His right hand went a fire (fiery substance) to them'  [Strongs 784 - fire, not fiery law]

It was the essence of His own nature that appeared as fire and was transferred through the agency of The Word into sound as He, The Word, expressed the essence of God's nature to the people in words they could understand and it was delivered to them through the instrumentality of the angelic hosts (Gal. 3:19; Acts 7:35).

==THE SPOKEN AND THE WRITTEN WORD==
The people at Sinai had The Word Himself speak to them and what He spoke to them was the expression of the the essential qualities of God, proceeding from His very nature, the principles of His own Being and therefore it is called the &quot;Law&quot; of God or the principles of God as it pertains to humans who are made in His image.

It came to them in a Spiritual form and it is therefore spiritual (Romans 7:14) and not carnal or natural, therefore not what is referred to as &quot;the law of a fleshly commandment&quot; (Hebrews 7:16); it was according to His own nature, therefore it is holy and good, or beneficial (Romans 7:12).

It was the spoken Word, the words from the mouth of God, and what was expressed was the whole essence of Yahweh God's Law for man. Within those ten commands, are the basic principles for the rest of the laws which were later given as a breakdown and application of these principles for daily life. The Spoken words of the ten commands were written by the Finger of God on tablets of stone also (Ex.24;12) so that they would have a written witness to what He had spoken to them and these were placed within the Ark of the Covenant and this was called the &quot;Testimony&quot;  (Exodus 40:20).

Then Moses went up the mountain with God and Yahweh spoke to him the remainder of what was to be the commandments that they were to obey, as part of the covenant which He was making with them (Ex.21-23). This eventually was written in a book and placed by the side of, but outside of the Ark of the Covenant. This was called the &quot;Book of the Covenant&quot; (Exodus 24:7; Deuteronomy 30:10; 31:26)

So we have the spoken Word of God inside the Ark of His Presence, and the written Word outside, but attached to, the Ark of His Presence. This was meant to portray the fact that the ten commands, the Living Word was an integral part of the nature of God, whereas the written Word was an application of that Word.

Just as in the New Covenant, He spoke His Word into their hearts and gave them also a written manual of reference. And so, they had the Spirit of the Word and the Letter of the Word, two witnesses to His truth. He spoke His Word into their hearts, but because it was not mixed with faith, it did not profit them. We also in the new covenant have the Spirit of His Word within us (1 Peter 1:23), and the Written Word (2 Timothy 3:16).

==THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW==
That which was spoken from the mouth of God is eternal and as unalterable as the nature of Yahweh Himself. Therefore, those ten precepts spoken directly from Him by His Spirit is the unchanging Law of God.

Yeshua said, &quot;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God&quot;; and,
&quot;It is the Spirit that gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.&quot;  (Matthew 4:4; John 6:63).  Here Yeshua refers to the Decalogue as that which proceeded from the mouth of God and used it as the living Word of God. He always only spoke those words that came from the Father.

The Words that He spoke through the Spirit then, were the living and powerful Word of God spoken from the mouth of God in the ten commands.  (John 8:28, 12:49; 1 Corinthians 10:3-4; Hebrews 4:12). 

The Decalogue can be further summarised as Yeshua did into those laws which pertain to walking in love and truth toward God and those which apply to our neighbour (Luke 10:27).  The first four concern our relationship with Yahweh God and the last six our relationship with our fellow man which is a reflection of our love for Him.

In the new covenant it is termed the &quot;Royal Law&quot; ([basikilos - Kingly]; James 2:8) because of the elevated status it is given through the royal priesthood ([Basileios -  belonging to the king];  2 Peter 2:9) of the Melchizedek order which is kingdom of priests functioning in the freedom of the Spirit under their King.

These commands are differentiated from the words Moses received which were the application of the Decalogue. The Decalogue was called the &quot;Law of God&quot;, whereas the words Moses received were called the &quot;Law of Moses&quot;. The Law of Moses contained all the ceremonial laws and ordinances which were subject to that covenant.

These laws and ordinances applied to terms of the covenant, social aspects of their society, regulations for sacrifices and offerings as well as the ordinances for the functioning of the Levitical priesthood.  All of these were limited to that covenant and were subject to changes being made in the covenant or the priesthood. 

&quot;You came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them just ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments. You made known to them Your holy Sabbath, and commanded them precepts, statutes and laws, by the hand of Moses Your servant&quot;  (Nehemiah 9:13-14)

Out of the Law of Moses, we get a further breakdown into these categories of 'ordinances', 'laws', 'statutes' and 'commandments' which defined the various by-laws into their classifications.

Ordinances: mishpat  S4941  --  Judgments for the administration of justice in social life

Laws: torah   S8451          -- Direction, teaching and principles thereof regarding moral issues

Statutes: chukkim  S2706  --  Decreed limit of a requirement, or a regulation as in food laws, health regulations

Commands: tsavah S4687  --  Precept or the terms of a contract, as in a covenant


All of these are only an interpretive commentary in an expanded form of the principles in the Decalogue.  For if we break it down into the two Great Commandments of loving God with all of our heart, mind, soul and strength and our neighbour as ourself; then we will do no ill to our neighbour and those those principles will regulate all of our lifestyle.  If His Law is in our heart, then His love will direct us in the interpretation of His Law in the situations of life. Because their heart was hardened, the by-laws spelt it out for them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE TWO COVENANTS AT SINAI==
It is often overlooked that there were two covenant made at Sinai, particularly in the implications of the differences between the two of them.  The first was based upon His spoken Word to them, with the ten commands given to them directly and the remainder spoken to Moses and then delivered verbally to them. The first covenant is contained between chapters 19-24 of the book of Exodus and the requirements for the Tabernacle and the High Priesthood through Aaron and his sons continues from Chs.25-31, ending with an exhortation to keep all the Sabbaths and then Moses was given the two Sapphire Tablets (Exodus 31:18).

The second covenant was made after the first was broken by the sin of the Golden Calf and was not a re-institution of the same covenant. The broken covenant incurred the death penalty (Exodus 32:33-35). Moses goes up the mountain again with two stones which he had to cut and Yahweh makes a new covenant with them, this time on Moses behalf as a response to his intercession and mediation (Exodus 33:17; 34:8-10).  

This covenant is based upon His grace and mercy to them as revealed to Moses with the promise that in spite of their stubbornness of heart that He would miraculously take them into the land and drive out its inhabitants from before them (Exodus 33:12-23; 34:11).  The main points to the terms of this covenant which renews the previous covenant, is an emphasis on the issues of their previous sin - not having any other gods or making agreements with the people of Canaan, and performing His Feasts as He prescribes them and not after the pattern of how the nations worship their gods, which they had done  (Exodus34:26; Deuteronomy 12:29-32).

Then Yahweh makes the statement, &quot;Write these words, for according to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.&quot;  (Exodus 34:27)
Moses is again told to write down the words of this covenant, as he had done with the previous covenant (Exodus 24:4) and that this covenant was with him and with Israel, no longer one directly with the people. He was the mediator of this covenant and that is the reason why it is often called the &quot;law of Moses&quot;.

==THE PRIESTHOOD==
Notice that in all of the time Moses is up the mountain with Yahweh after instituting the first covenant, there is no mention of the service of the Levites in the Tabernacle. The only ones mentioned are Aaron and his sons for the service of the High Priesthood. This period covers Exodus 24-31. The Levitical priesthood only came to be mentioned after the sin with the Golden Calf where the tribe of Levi was chosen because it proved itself faithful to Him. Previously, from the time of the Exodus to the time of their sin, the function of priesthood had been undertaken by the heads of the tribal families (Exodus 19:7, 24; 24:1, 5, 9, 14).

We see that immediately after Israel was redeemed and delivered from Egypt, Yahweh had called for the consecration of the Firstborn sons, &quot;Consecrate to Me all the Firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both man and beast; it is Mine.&quot;  (Exodus 13:2)

The Firstborn had always carried the family inheritance and responsibility before Yahweh God and thus, served as a priest before God on behalf of his family.  We see the lineage from Adam to Noah was always named by the Firstborn.  Abraham functioned as a priest over his extended household, building altars and offering sacrifices and in the case of Lot, interceding and petitioning God for his deliverance. The pattern follows through to Jacob who receives the Blessing of the Firstborn and likewise functions as the priestly head of the family (Abraham - Genesis 12:7, 8; 13:4, 18; 18:23-32:  Jacob - 28:18-19; 35:1-7, 13-15).

The consecrated Firstborn sons were intended to serve as priests under the Aaronic  order as High Priests. Hence the instructions in the first covenant, &quot;An altar of earth you shall make for Me, and you shall sacrifice upon it your burnt offering s and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I record My name I will come to you, and I will bless you. And if you make Me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone; for if you use your tool upon it, you have profaned it. Nor shall you go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness be not exposed upon it.&quot;  (Exodus 20:24-26)

These altars had no place in the Tabernacle. The altars there were of bronze overlaid upon Shittim wood in the outer court (Exodus 27:1-2); and of gold overlaid upon Shittim wood in the Sanctuary (Exodus 30:1-6). The only function these altars would serve would be for the leaders of the various divisions and heads of households within the tribes to perform their priestly service according to the firstborn status.  This is borne out by the instruction given for the Levites when they replaced the order of the  failed Firstborn priesthood.

&quot;Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they might serve him. And they shall attend to his needs and the needs of the whole congregation .. .. ..&quot;

&quot;Now behold, I Myself have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of the firstbron who opens the womb among the children of Israel. Therefore the Levites are Mine&quot;  (Numbers 3:6-7, 12)

Under the first covenant the Firstborn priesthood was to continue to function within the nation according to their divisions within the tribes and the Aaronic priesthood was to represent the nation as a whole before God. There were very few instructions for the priesthood in the first covenant. The patriarchal pattern of priesthood had been well established and was well understood.  They were the ones who taught their families God's laws and precepts and judged matters within the household. Apart from some basic instructions for the altar, there was no added rituals or ceremonial rites attached to it.  The Levitical priesthood however, was replete with ceremonial rites and rituals and required new laws to instruct the new priesthood in all their service.

In the first covenant they failed to function as a &quot;kingdom of priests&quot; and a new order had to be established. They failed to teach and direct the people in the true worship of God and represent Him back to the people. And so, they were replaced by the Levites who proved themselves zealous for the honour of Yahweh God.

Just as the people failed to keep the terms of their betrothal contract while He was preparing the Tabernacle so that He could dwell among them, so the priesthood was also unfaithful to their charge. Therefore, both the covenant and the priesthood had to be replaced by a more elementary system that required less responsibility. Even then, the northern kingdom broke the covenant and was dispersed and the southern kingdom was judged for their unfaithfulness but with the promise of a new covenant which would be a restoration of the first type of covenant, but this time with His law written on their hearts and an individual priesthood with every man knowing Him, &quot;I will put My law in their minds and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God and they shall be My people. No more shall every man teach his neighbour, and every man his brother saying, 'Know the Lord,' for they shall all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the Lord.&quot; (Jer.31:33-34a)

==APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE NEW COVENANT==
Just as the broken covenant required amendments to accommodate the weakness of their flesh, so also the priesthood required a different system with different laws to train them in the concepts of holy service through rituals and physical patterns of spiritual realities. Each change in the covenant between God and man requires changes in the priesthood which has an outworking in the form of the priestly service under each covenant.

With the advent of the Melchizedek priesthood in the new covenant, all the laws, rituals and ceremonies which applied to the Levitical priesthood were not relevant. In becoming a High priest on our behalf according to the order of Melchizedek, the Aaronic order was also made redundant. He also became our Supreme Sacrifice for all sin in the one offering of  Himself, so making obsolete the whole sacrificial system using animals.  Most of the laws in the old covenant, revolved around the priesthood and the sacrificial system and are therefore not applicable to the Melchizedek order. They were only relevant to that priesthood.

The laws given in the first covenant after Yahweh spoke the ten commands, were primarily for the institution of their social and judicial system as a nation (Exodus 21-23) and so, they are only applicable for a government submitted to God. After the nation of Israel was dispersed for their rejection of Messiah, Jews and all believers have been subjected to living under the laws of the nations wherever they were and are in the similar situation to Abraham, the father of faith, walking in the Law of the Lord (essence of the Law - 10 commands) amongst the ungodly and applying the precepts of the rest of the Law to their individual lives wherever it was possible. The principles of the Law remain constant but can only be applied individually in a non-observant society.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE LAW AND THE COVENANT==
The purpose of the Law is to instruct us in God's righteousness which was manifest in the life of Yeshua the Messiah and as part of that instruction, to provide us with principles of conduct (doctrine), and reproof and correction of ungodly behaviour  (2 Timothy 3:16).

Just as the scripture tells us to train up our natural children in the way they should go, so we as spiritual children need to be instructed and trained in the way of righteousness  (Proverbs 22:6; 1 Peter 1:23, 2:1-3). However, we are under a different covenant with a different priesthood and so there is a change in the application of the Law. The Law of God has not changed, it is eternal, but our relationship to it has changed. So we need to consider how these changes in the covenant and the priesthood affect the application of the Law.

==THE NEW COVENANT==
When the scripture prophesied about a new covenant in Jeremiah 31:31-33, the word used is 'renewed' (chadashah), not 'new'  as in newly created or 'new', as to it's age.  The word &quot;chadashah&quot; refers to something that has undergone a reformation in character and purpose, or a simple reappearance on a different scale.  In the new covenant scriptures, the Greek word is kainos, and means &quot;new as to form or quality, of a different nature from what is contrasted as old&quot; (Vine's Expository Dictionary). It does not mean &quot;new in age&quot; (neos). 

So it was not prophesied to be a different covenant, but a new improved form of the previous covenant which had already been upgraded several times to allow for changes in the nation's responsibilities. In ancient treaties, if one of the party's situation changed, then part of the covenant could be amended (or renewed) as required, to adapt to the new situation, but everything else remained in effect exactly as before. 

The New covenant is a compilation of all the former covenants made with Abraham, Moses, and David which were encompassed by and fulfilled in Yeshua the Messiah. He fulfilled them in Himself, thus making a 'new' covenant of the former ones in an &quot;improved&quot; form, for the benefit of the participants in the covenant.  The terms of the previous covenant was obedience to His Law which at that time was written on tablets of stone made personal by the means of the fringes on their garments  (Numbers 15:38-39). Now, the terms of the covenant are the same, except that the law is written on human hearts.  It has been internalised by an impartation of His Spirit, making it a &quot;better&quot; covenant  (Deuteronomy 4:13; John 15:9-14; 2 Corinthians 3:3).

Just after enacting the new covenant with His disciples in the Last Supper, Yeshua stated the terms of the covenant. It was to be based upon them obeying His commandments and the promise on His part was that He would send the holy Spirit from the Father to dwell in them (John 14:15-18).  The 'new', improved covenant was in them having His Spirit within them and His Presence with them to personally guide, instruct and empower them to keep the Law (John 14:18, 20, 25-26; 15:26-27).  

The covenant was also an upgrade from servant-hood in the old, to being &quot;friends&quot; in the new as partakers in the advent of His coming kingdom and glory.  But it was all based upon obedience to His commandments, just as it was in the previous, original issue of the covenant. 

A covenant always has terms and promises which each party commit themselves to fulfill. Notice how many times Yeshua stressed the point of obedience to the commandments - in John 14:15, 21, 23, 24; 15;10, 14)

&quot;If you love me, keep My commandments&quot;

&quot;He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves me&quot;

&quot;If anyone love Me, he will keep My word&quot;

&quot;If you keep My commandments you will abide in My love&quot;

&quot;You are My friends if you do whatever I command you&quot;

And the covenant was sealed with His prayer in Chapter 17 of John, that they would be united in one Body with the godhead and be partakers of His glory.

==THE NEW EXPECTATION==
God's laws, His principles for man to live by, are eternal and unchanging but the measure of responsibility in His covenant that He gives to man, can vary upon his spiritual growth and maturity. Because the Law is now internalised in man's heart by faith, there is a higher expectation upon those in covenant relationship with Him, to love with the same type of love with which He loved.  Previously, it was to love one's neighbour as oneself.  Now it is to love as He loved us - a self-sacrificial type of love. This was the new commandment given for the new covenant, not displacing the other commandments, as Yeshua still referred to the Father's commandments which He had kept as those which He had embraced and now imparted to them (John 15:9-10).

Because of the better promises of receiving the divine nature, there is an expectation and responsibility upon the new covenant believer to manifest the more elevated quality of the divine nature in their life (2 Peter 1:1-7)

The bond of the covenant is a love relationship and it is out of this love relationship that we are to obey Him. Israel was brought into the bond of the covenant at Sinai which was in the form of a betrothal contract, the terms of the covenant being the keeping of His Law out of their love for Him (Deuteronomy 6:6; 30:11-14).  

Because of the weakness of the Law by itself to enable fallen man to keep the commandments, they broke the covenant many times (Jeremiah 31:32).  The Law had no power to change the heart of man because it was a &quot;fleshly commandment&quot; whereas the new covenant imparted the power of His eternal life, as quoted, &quot;the power of an endless life&quot;, to enable us to walk in or within the Law (Hebrews7:16).

&quot;For on one hand there is an annulling (to put of no value, to set aside - Vines) of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness, for the law made nothing perfect; on the other hand, there is the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.&quot;  Hebrews 7:18-19

The previous covenant was ineffective or 'weak' - i.e. it was powerless because it &quot;made nothing perfect' in the condition of fallen humanity. It gave the outline of Yahweh God's requirements without the power to perform it.

We have two different terms used here - 'commandment' and 'law', differentiating the commandment to obey, from the whole context of the Law of Yahweh God, which is eternal and unchanging. Now, in the new covenant, the commandment to obey is empowered by a changed heart fulfilling the prophecy of the new covenant, 
&quot;I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God and they shall be My people&quot;  (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10b)

The new covenant believer is no longer &quot;under the law&quot; in servitude to the Law, but is enabled to live &quot;in the law&quot; through His life. The Law, in its written form in the old covenant could not give life and therefore did not effect righteousness (internally) in those who kept the law (externally). &quot;For if there had been a law which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the Law.&quot;  (Galatians 3:21)

The living embodiment of the Law, Yeshua the Messiah, now indwells the believer so that if he abides in the relationship which he has with the Redeemer and walks in the Spirit of the Messiah who indwells him, he will fulfill the 'works' of the law, the outward acts of righteousness in the liberty of the Spirit.
&quot;But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law&quot;  (Galatians 5:18)

&quot;For the law of the Spirit of life in Yeshua the Messiah has made me free from the law of sin and death.&quot;  

The life of the living &quot;Law&quot;, of the Messiah has released us from the penalties of the broken Law (Romans 8:2). Therefore, when we live in His Law, we are living in His love, in union with the Father and the Son.

&quot;As the Father love Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.&quot;  John 15:9-10

This is the benefit of the &quot;better&quot; covenant, based upon &quot;better&quot; promises  (Hebrews 7:19, 22; 8:6).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE ROYAL LAW==
The &quot;royal law&quot; which is referred to in the new covenant is expressed in the ten commands which Yahweh spoke into existence as a revelation of the nature of God and the way for man to live in harmony with Him.
It was channeled to Israel in a spiritual form through sound waves into audible speech and then transcribed onto tablets written by the Spirit of God as a written testimony or witness to the spoken Word.

These ten basic principles were an itemization of the principles of Yahweh God's nature and formed a descriptive outline of the behavior pattern for man formed in His likeness to follow. They are an outline of what the god-like person would and would not do - like a code of ethics.

==THE LIVING REALITY==
This is the eternal law, or code of ethics for mankind which has always existed and has never changed. His nature was revealed to Adam in the Garden through personal interaction in a relationship with Him in the &quot;cool of the day&quot;. He knew the reality of what was later expressed in the outline by this code of ethics.

A description of an experience cannot fully portray the image of that living reality. What Adam knew and interacted with in this Glorious Being, involving all of his senses, gave him a living experience with Him.

The Patriarchs that followed had a diminished image of Him through the lens of oral tradition and spiritual encounters. But when it came to the children of Israel, they had regressed so far into the physical realm that their spiritual encounter with Him did not profit them and they had to be taught from elementary standards. And so, what came to them as a mighty spiritual encounter with the Most High God became reduced to moral ethics and a break-down of laws to live by, to instruct them in the ways of righteousness until their level of consciousness had grown so that the Law could be transcended by the living reality.
 
In the incarnation of Yeshua, we have the living expression of the Law in a human life, the nature of God expressed in a human being. When He died He imparted His life to us so that now, we do not live by a set of commands and a code of ethics, but we have been given His life, by His Spirit. But to assist in our human weakness, we have the new covenant scriptures which give an account of the life that was in Him, as a testimony and a witness to its reality. 

As the apostle said, 
&quot;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of Life -- the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us -- that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, .. .. .. &quot;   (1 John 1:1-3)

He is the Word made flesh, the living spiritual reality of what was expressed in the essence of the law in written form, of a life conformed to the image of God. He lived in the spirit of the commandments and not by the written code of them.  As the Word made flesh, the Law reached its fullest potential for expression in a human life, in Him. Therefore the Law was fulfilled in Him, by His complete obedience to the Father's commandments.  He came to implement and perfect the law in a human life so that it could be imparted to us and we would have a new life - a god-kind of life that is able to keep the law, no longer in our own strength, but empowered by the new nature which He has given us  (Matthew 5:17; Hebrews 5:8-9).

==LIVING BY THE ROYAL LAW==
The Law has been elevated to a new status in the new covenant under the Melchizedek priesthood.

The Melchizedek priesthood is a &quot;royal priesthood&quot; - an order of king/priests, or kingly priests (1 Peter 2:5, 9). The word &quot;royal&quot; means 'kingly' [basileios]. It is a priesthood that has been elevated to rule and exercise a priestly functions in coordination with their High Priest, the King of Kings. It is a priesthood that is entrusted with authority to rule and reign with Him through overcoming the flesh-nature, just as He also overcame and has been given authority to rule (Matthew 28:18-20; Revelations 3:21; 12:11 ). It is a priesthood destined for the throne functioning in the freedom of the Spirit under its King.

It is for &quot;kings&quot; to make laws and the people living under their jurisdiction are bound by those laws. They are subject to those laws and therefore their lives can be said to be &quot;under the law&quot; of the &quot;king&quot;. But, a king's son who  has been disciplined to respect and keep his father's laws, when he comes to maturity; he can walk with liberty in those laws because he has been trained by them and has internalized them into his own nature. Therefore he is no longer under the jurisdiction of them but lives according to them as part of his own nature. This is the meaning of being &quot;under grace&quot; and not &quot;under law&quot;.  Once we have received the grace of His life and His Word is born in us, we no longer need the disciplinary structure of the Law to keep us from sin.

The &quot;law of the Spirit of life&quot; in Yeshua our Messiah, has set us free from the law of the cycle of sin and death, &quot;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit&quot; (See Romans 8:2-7 &amp; Galatians 5:16-25).

To walk according to the Spirit, is to walk in His commandments through the grace and liberty He has given us in the new nature. It is to observe His commandments by being in subjection to His Spirit, and not yielding again to the desires of the former fleshly nature. We fulfill the law by being observant of it, as He did. If we maintain our relationship with Him, we will abide in Him and His life will be lived out through us (Jn. 15:7).  

It is for this purpose that the written Word serves as a means of exposing the works of the flesh to us now. It acts like an mirror to reflect the image of God to us, a measuring stick with which to compare ourselves. So that if we lose sight of the image of the new 'man', by looking into the &quot;perfect law of liberty&quot;, it will be reflected back to us to expose the works of our flesh (James 1:22-25).  James calls it the &quot;royal law&quot;.

While ever we walk in the Spirit, by His life, we do not come under the law. We fulfill the law. &quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.&quot;  Galatians 5:22-25

&quot;I say then: walk in the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.&quot;  Galatians 5:16

But if we walk in the flesh, instead of in the Spirit by the divine nature, according to the royal law, then we come back under the Law; and we will be judged by the Law (James 2:8-11).

==FULFILLING THE ROYAL LAW==
Yeshua gave us the royal law in the summary He made of the ten commands into two main principles; loving God with all of our being and loving our neighbor as ourselves. This is the essence of the new man's nature. It is not a replacement of the 613 laws which can be itemized in the written law, nor a substitute for the ten commands, but just as Yeshua perfectly fulfilled the Law, so shall those who are led by the Spirit.

The Spirit of God always agrees with the Word (1 John 5:6). He is called the Spirit of Truth (John 14:25-26). We are sanctified by His Word, as He said, &quot;Your Word is truth&quot; (John 17:17).

The two Great Commandments of the royal law are the itemization of the Decalogue upon which hang all the Law and the Prophets (Matthew 22:37-40). They categorize the first four commands into that which is directed toward God and the other six, into that which pertains to our fellow man.

Most of the violations of the first four commands fall into the category of idolatry and hence the exhortation, &quot;Little children, keep yourselves from idols&quot; (1 John 5:21). That is all-inclusive of anything which takes pre-eminence in our lives and comes between God and us.

The other six cover the various aspects of our relationship with others in the royal law, as James 2:8 says,

&quot;If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, 'You shall love your neighbour as yourself, you do well'&quot;    
&quot;Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good  .. ..  For we know that the law is spiritual .. .. &quot; ; and we have been liberated to live within His holy law (Romans 7:12, 14)

A [[w:Provinces of Pakistan|province]] in the south Asian country of [[w:Pakistan|Pakistan]], '''Sindh''' has long been the centre of legends where seafaring merchants charted courses to the remotest lands and villagers sold spices, the birth-place of a [[w:Indus Valley Civilisation|civilisation]] that rivalled those of Egypt and Mesopotamia. Throughout this book, we will explore what is known of the past of this magnificent land and its people.

__TOC__
==Neolithic Mehrgarh==
The hunter-gatherers had travelled the farthest in days and food was scarce. They heard of a new technology – agriculture – one that required growing one's own food. In the later part of the 7th millennium BC, somewhere in the late Neolithic era, agriculture had become a main source of nutrition for the people that settled in the plains of what is now part of the province of [[w:Baluchistan|Baluchistan]] in Pakistan. During excavations carried out in and around Mehrgarh in the late 1970s and early 1980s, ruins of an agricultural village as big as 300 hectares or about 1.1 square miles were discovered. This site was immediately deemed a pre-cursor to the greater Indus Valley civilisation. Indus, the mighty river that runs from the mountains of the Himalayas down to the Indian Ocean is now seen as the cradle of one of the earliest civilisations, and one that rivals those of the other neighbouring civilisations in terms of technology and trade.

The agricultural economy was based on the cultivation of barley, jujubes, einkorn and emmer wheat and the meat diet was still obtained from hunting animals. Where hunting was slowly becoming the thing of the past, domestication of animals started to take precedence. People started domesticating ''[[w:Zebus|zebus]]'' (''Bos primigenius indicus''), the humped cattle, and goats, and soon hunting activities died out and gave way to the more productive technologies – pottery and making of ornaments.&lt;ref name=&quot;mehrgarh01&quot;&gt;[http://www.guimet.fr/Indus-and-Mehrgarh-archaeological Indus and Mehrgarh archaeological mission]&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Mehrgarh would have been the most advanced of their surrounding settlements.

How animal husbandry and batteries improved their nutritious needs is unclear, however from the terracotta figurines of bulls and oxen acquired from the period suggests that the average citizen of Mehrgarh worshipped them, their exalted status as givers of life and providers of food.

==Chalcolithic endeavours==
The people of the region dug earth for the cultivation of experimental crops, they are deemed to have stumbled across strange rocks they had never seen before – that of [[w:Chalcopyrite|Chalcopyrite]] (or Copper ore). The people would later became aware of its metallurgy and start forming tools from metals that they excavate from the earth locally. Like their experiments with farming, meddling with the rocks provided them with an opportunity to make better tools. Some of which were hand-crafted to assist in better farming.

These endeavours led to a faster development of technology and better crop yields making the Mehrgarh people superior in all sense to the civilisation that had sprouted up simultaneously across its surrounding regions. It is then that historians make note of the development of similar technology in the infant civilisations of Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.

While metallurgy thrived, pots were used more often as a common utensil to store crop yields. Made from unrefined clay pots were usually made from hand. Remarkable advances, mainly in ceramics gave way to a pottery of a new kind – one with refined fine-quality clay and on a potter's wheel (another of the invention these people came up with). These pots were then decorated with paintings of animal forms and birds found locally and brought trade to the region. Structures in the excavated town show signs of storage cells adorned with ceramic linings excellent for storing cereal crops.

With better metal tools, people of the land dug earth faster and made great canals dividing the river Indus into irrigation channels. With every passing day the civilisation extended more towards the river and started building transport over water: primitive floating devices – used mainly for fishing in deeper waters.

==Cotton cultivation and export==
There came a time when livestock were abundant than the hunt and killing an animal was being deemed more as a sport. It was then that the people of the land started focusing more on adding more crops to their farms. One of the major crops grown in the period were those of cotton. Excavated ornaments shows copper beads, one of which still carried the trace of a cotton thread, the oldest example of a fibre that exists to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;mehrgarh01&quot; /&gt; It became obvious that people had become aware of manipulating raw cotton into fibre and had already started utilising this in their handiwork. Beyond the realms of this lesser civilisation of thread-mongers lay slightly advanced civilisations of greater Mesopotamia, envoys of which would travel across the land and shores that met Mehrgarh and the early Indus Valley civilisation. These merchants would take home the cotton products which with time the region would be renowned for. In fact, it is often documented that cotton was deemed a high quality export and that much of the cotton found in ancient Egypt came from civilisations on the shores of the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;cotton&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Cotton in Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|first=Moritz|last=Schanz|publisher=Read Books|isbn=1406783110|pages=pp. 7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend continues today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The section I decided to edit was the opening statement in regards to the Effective Student Organization/Problems that Students Organization Face. I thought this was relevant because after reading the previous statement I felt it lacked some important information. Before, it didn't really have an opening statement that told you exactly what the contents below was about and why it is useful to club/organization members. I now feel it is more appealing and informative and lets the reader know what exactly what the motives of the section below is about.</text>

== Vandalism from 216.100.91.2 ==

The IP 216.100.91.2 empties pages.

== SIte Header ==

I am a Wikipedia user who stumbled on here by accident, so please forgive my ignorance. I just wanted to let you guys know that the site header about the survey is out of date, as the survey has expired. On Wikipedia any admin can edit the site interface, and I assume it's the same here. Thanks, [[User:Genius101|Genius101]] ([[User talk:Genius101|talk]]) 20:40, 15 May 2009 (UTC)

== Unifying Account ==

I have an inactive account (Due to me being in the US Military) on Wikipedia, and when I created my account here on WikiBooks I saw the opportunity to unify my account.  Fantastic idea!  I am back from deployment and would like to unify the accounts.  When I try to have them e-mail me my new password so I can get into my Wikipedia account, I am told the account doesn't exist.  I have verified the case sensitivity.  Wikibooks says the account still exists, but Wikipedia doesn't.  I can't continue with the unification until that account is cleared or password reset.  Any help?

-Old Wolf
:The account &quot;OldWolf&quot; is a global account already, with an unattached account on Spanish Wikipedia. To attach that account to the global one, you need the password, which can only be retrieved if you set and confirmed an email for it (which doesn't seem to be the case). However, since that account has no edits, the bureaucrats on Spanish Wikipedia will probably rename the account so you can re-register it (and then it'll be attached to the global account). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:25, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

Fair enough.  Since I don't know spanish, any advice on how to contact the bureaucrats on Spanish Wikipedia? -Old Wolf
:See [[:w:es:Wikipedia:Cambiar el nombre de usuario]]: there are instructions in English (and there are several bureaucrats who speak English). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:41, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

Block this IP
Please block this ip as it is a school board. 72.1.205.79 (talk) 15:59, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

That is not a ground for blocking. Please see WB:BLOCK for more. --Swift (talk) 16:50, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

[edit] Seeking attention
I noticed you added your signature to a number of talk pages, but without adding any content. Only after checking this IP's contributions did I figure that you may have been trying to get attention to the request above. Please note that a better way to reach the community is to post a message in the appropriate Wikibooks:Reading room. In the case of a block request, you would be looking for the administrative assistance reading room. Take care, --Swift (talk) 16:50, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;The preceding was copied from [[User talk:72.1.205.79]] by the talk page IP holder.&lt;/span&gt;

: Yes you can request a block, but this IP address has not been used for much vandalism in the past. It would be preferable that it be kept open unless there were it were the source of large amounts of blatant vandalism. Not all schools have the same amount of immature students.
: Should this be an IP address of a school that is the source of sufficient amounts of vandalism, then we'd probably put a IP range block on it. Please give us a list of past vandlism and the IP range and we'll look into that. Thanks. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:50, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

== Bug: MediaWiki:Gadget-Personalper.js hardwires &quot;/wiki/&quot; into personal .css and .js script names ==

The personal per_book gadget uses the fixed string &quot;/wiki/&quot; as the pathname to the personal per_book css and js filenames (see MediaWiki:Gadget-Personalper.js). This works on Wikibooks, but not on other Mediawiki installations, which may have a different path to the mediawiki code. The fix is simple. Replace &quot;/wiki/&quot; by wgScript, which holds the proper pathname prefix. I reported this bug on MediaWiki bugs, but was told this is a script maintained by Wikibooks administrators. [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 18:54, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

: Fixed now. Books in a person's userspace should also work with it now too. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:11, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

Thanks. However, there still seems to be a problem. When I follow the call chain (using Firebug) from &lt;code&gt;  '''runOnloadHook()''' through '''importScript(perbook + bookname + &quot;.js&quot;}''' to '''importScript(page)''' &lt;/code&gt;, the resulting uri is : '''&quot;/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Dnessett/per_book%2FTemplate.js&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript&quot;'''. Notice the %2F character code after per_book isn't changed to '/'. This seems to occur because of a bug in &lt;code&gt; '''importScript(page)''' &lt;/code&gt;. Specifically, the uri is created using the following statement: &lt;code&gt; '''var uri = wgScript + '?title=' +  encodeURIComponent(page.replace(/ /g,'_')).replace('%2F','/').replace('%3A',':') + '&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript';''' &lt;/code&gt;. To properly convert the input parameter to a valid uri, the 2nd and 3rd calls to replace should use a global search, i.e., &lt;code&gt; '''.replace(/'%2F'/g,'/').replace(/'%3A'/g,':')''' &lt;/code&gt;. (I think. I have no Javascript programming experience). [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 22:13, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

'''Errata''': I should have left out the ',s in the above replace. That is the correct search is: &lt;code&gt; '''.replace(/%2F/g,'/').replace(/%3A/g,':')''' &lt;/code&gt; (Found this out when I modified my local wikibits.js) [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 22:35, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

: That one would be something to report on bugzilla. We don't have any control over wikibits.js, we can just work around the bug locally until its fixed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:02, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

Done. Bug 18965. Thanks. Can this be fixed on Wikibooks without waiting for a MediaWiki bug-fix distribution? I hope to move my template work to Wikibooks in about a week. [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 23:29, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

'''Update''': It appears the bug is fixed in r50537. Comment from mediawiki developer: &quot;Already fixed in r50537. Will go live next scap.&quot; I'm not sure what a scap is, but I assume it is update revision. Do all mediawiki foundation projects use the same mediawiki version? If so, is it likely that Wikibooks will have the fix installed in a reasonable amount of time? [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 23:52, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

: Not all wikimedia foundation projects use the same version or are updated at the same time, but they are all usually kept pretty much up to date. It could be a week or a month before the next time the revision Wikibooks uses is next updated. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:55, 27 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction== 

 *Purpose: Understand the decision maker's frame of reference
 *Input: List of BI system users and administrators
 *Activities: Interview users
 *Outputs: Users needs and requirements
 *Documents: Statement of user requirements

&quot;A key point to keep in mind throughout the project is that users will always ask questions of the decision support system from their frame of reference. If you do not understand that frame of reference, you could deliver a system that may theoretically be fabulous, but end users will have trouble using it, or the performance will be incredible poor since you have design a completely different set of parameters.&quot; (Poe et al. 1997)  To understand the decision maker's frame of reference involves eliciting a wide range of knowledge from the users. A further problem is that interviewer may need to gather requirements from users with little or no BI knowledge or experience. This requires an open-minded approach (Morgan et al. 2007).

The keys to successful interviews is preparation, providing advanced notice and making sure that the end-user understands the importance of the interview (Poe et al. 1997).  This requires first studying the by looking at the competitive marketplace.  After studying the firm's environment it is then necessary to study the decision makers and strategists.  Finally, the analyst must then study the company ''from the point of view of the frame owner.''  
Note that the approach taken in this book is that the analyst does not work for the company.  The analyst therefore begins with a blank slate regarding the company.

==Organizational chart==

A very useful tool for identifying interviewees is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_chart organizational chart].  This is a diagram that shows the structure of an organization and the relationships and relative ranks of its parts and positions/jobs.  The chart shows the executives, managers and sub-workers who make up an organization.  The important features are the names of employees, role/position and the links between employees using the identification of superior and subordinate.

A hierarchical chart is most appropriate because it shows the structure of an organization [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_organization hierarchical organization].  This type of chart shows each entity in the organization, except one, as subordinate to a single other entity. Hierarchies denote a singular/group of power at the top, a number of assistants underneath and hundreds of servants beneath them.  The chart allows the analyst to deduce the roles of all the employess and identify important decision makers.


==Interviewees==

All the interviewees will fall into specific roles.  You need to identify people in the following roles in order to interview all the responsible parties.

:* Sponsors
:* Executives
:* Managers
:* Analysts
:* Data warehouse and database administrators
:* Project managers

===Sponsors===

::&quot;If you ask people what the number one enabler for a successful BI deployment is, most will respond &quot;executive support.&quot; It's an easy answer as executive support is key to the success for almost any companywide initiative—change in business strategy, new product launch, or reorganization. However, getting that executive support may not be easy, particularly if senior executives don't believe in or understand the value of business intelligence.&quot;  (Howson 2007)

Sponsors are the people, regardless of role in the company, whose backing will increase the chance of project success by backing the project.  They are therefore the first group to identify and interview.  One IT professional was quote as saying that the BI initiation was not successful because of the lack of vision, sponsorship and leadership from the executive level (Howson 2007).  Since executive support is important, gaining one or more supporters at the executive level will significantly increase the chance of success.

These individuals can be in IT, the business unit, in the C-suite, members of the board, or possibly even outside the organization.  Where they come from is not important.  Rather, their influence on the company is important.
 

===Executives===

''C-Suite''

The highest level executives reside in the C-Suite.  These individuals are in the group of executives that have word &quot;chief&quot; in their titles.  They are the highest level executive officers.  For example, Microsoft has the following C-suite personnel as of June 2009 (this is not an endorsement of Microsoft):

Craig Mundie- Chief Research and Strategy Officer was quoted as saying
“We're really trying to change the nature of software...to move it beyond the point and click model of computing to something where people will have a much more natural way of interacting with the machines...I think increasingly we'll be able to talk to our computer and it will talk back...it may even be possible for it to anticipate some of the things we want to do and just do them for us.” [http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/leadership/default.aspx]
-&quot;Looking Back, Moving Forward&quot; video, June, 2008

It is important to gain a better understanding of the reference frame of all decision makers in the C-Suite.

''Presidents and Vice presidents''

A president or vice president usually reports to a president (VP) or member of the C-suite (president or VP).  VP rankings starts with the Executive VP, with the Senior VP next, VP usually as the lowest ranking and Assistant/Second/Staff Vice President used as a subordinate rank to Vice President.

Presidents can be as important in shaping vision and strategy as vice presidents.  Regardless of the specific title any Vice President is always an important decision maker for the organization but may not be as important as the president.  One way to think of the VP is as a subject area specialist below the level of the C-suite and president.  For example, Microsoft has the following President and Vice Presidents as of June 2009:

Dr. Qi Lu - president of Microsoft's Online Services Division (OSD), leads the company's search and online advertising efforts and also oversees all of its online information and communications services. Dr. Lu oversees the OSD Research &amp; Development team which has responsibility for the evolution of Microsoft's search, portal and advertising services; the Online Audience Business Group; and the Advertiser and Publisher Solutions Business Group. Dr. Lu reports to Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer.

Mich Mathews - As the senior vice president for Microsoft's Central Marketing Group, oversees the company's global marketing function, spanning a diverse set of businesses and audiences.  Mathews reports to the chief operating officer, Kevin Turner.

Lisa Brummel is the senior vice president for Human Resources at Microsoft, a position she has held since May 2005.

Brad Smith -  Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. He leads the company's Department of Legal and Corporate Affairs, which is responsible for all legal work and for government, industry and community affairs activities.

The connection between reference frame and role is important.  A president or vice president has a specific reference frame and in the case of a vice president it is usually part of their title. 

===Director/Manger===

&quot;[http://www.ensynch.com/sp_operational_efficiency.aspx Operational Efficiency] is what occurs when the right combination of people, process, and technology come together to enhance the productivity and value of any business operation, while driving down the cost of routine operations to a desired level. The end result is that resources previously needed to manage operational tasks can be redirected to new, high value initiatives that bring additional capabilities to the organization.&quot;

Executives develop strategy.  Directors and managers execute strategy by leading departments or groups that engage in activates designed to achieve a specific outcome for the customer or facilitate the outcome.  They do this by focusing on strategic goals.  These groups must have the people, process and technology needed to engage in activities required to achieve their assigned goals.  Directors and managers are responsible for executing strategy by allocating resources towards improving people, process or technology.  

Dividing the company into departments that can effectively and efficiently engage in the activities is critical for executing the strategy.  Companies are divided into departments through the process of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departmentalization Departmentalization], meaning referring to the process of grouping people, processes/activities and technologies into departments.  These departments have efficient groups of specialists that perform a few functions efficiently and effectively.  By [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour Specialization/Division of labor] the firm achieves the organization of cooperative labor in specific, circumscribed tasks and roles, intended to increase the productivity of labor. 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management Business management] consist of six separate branches:

*Human resource management
*Operations management or production management
*Strategic management
*Marketing management
*Financial management
*Information technology management responsible for management information systems


===Analysts===
The analysts perform the day-to-day [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analytics analytics] for a company and is the main business intelligence worker.  Analytics includes quantitative and qualitative analysis, explanatory data analysis, predictive modeling, querying, reporting, OLAP, and &quot;alerts&quot; needed for decision making.  Businesses analytics represent a subset of business intelligence (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_H._Davenport Davenport]).  The analyst can answer such questions as 
*What happened?
*How many?
*How often?
*Where?
*Where exactly is the problem?
*What actions are needed?
*Why is this happening?
*What if these trends continue?
*What will happen next?
*What is the best that can happen?

The goal is to understand how they use the system and how the system can help them deliver the intelligence needed for making decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Spacing==
MS Word has many options for formatting spacing, the most commonly used are for selecting spacing between lines, and the spacing between paragraphs. These options are both on the 'Format → Paragraph' dialog. As you might expect, the 'Line spacing' option sets that spacing between adjacent lines, while the 'Before / After' Spacing sets the space between different paragraphs.

If you have text that belongs on a new line, but is still part of the same paragraph, then you can use 'SHIFT-ENTER' to insert a newline while remaining in the same paragraph.

==Special Symbols==
Special symbols (Greek letters, typographic marks, small icons or pictures), can be inserted by using the Menus 'Insert → Symbol...'.
Most commonly used symbols are included in the main fonts, while commonly used icons are in the 'Windings' or 'Webdings' fonts.

Locate the symbol you wish to insert and click 'Insert' to place it into your document at the current cursor position (also known as the 'insertion point').

|description =Boneset is a tall plant with a cluster of tiny white flowers that rise above the leaves.  The leaves are thick and wrinkly.  They wrap all the way around the stem of the plant and make it look like the stem has poked through the leaf. It is also called &quot;agueweed&quot;, &quot;feverwort&quot; or &quot;sweating-plant&quot;. Native Americans introduced Boneset to the American colonists as a way to treat fevers.  
|facts =The leaves growing together around the stem lead to a past superstition that wrapping the leaves in bandages around splints would help mend broken bones.

      <comment>Updated thread example code. It was using Thread.fork, which forks the current Ruby process to a new system process, rather than creating a thread within the same one Ruby process.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Outline ==

=== Ruby Interface ===

Come to think of it, I haven’t yet shown an example of using Ruby threads in practice.  It’s not much but here’s an introduction for now:

&lt;pre&gt;Thread.new {
  while true
    puts 'from thread'
  end
}
while true
  puts 'from main'
end&lt;/pre&gt;

If you execute this program, you should see “from thread” and “from main” mixed together in the output.

Of course, more than just creating multiple threads, there are also a number of ways to control them.  There isn’t a &lt;code&gt;synchronize&lt;/code&gt; keyword like in Java, but common primitives like &lt;code&gt;Mutex&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Queue&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Monitor&lt;/code&gt; are provided, and the API below can be used for operations on the threads themselves.

==== Thread API ====

&lt;code&gt;Thread.pass&lt;/code&gt; — Pass execution to another thread&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Thread.kill(th)&lt;/code&gt; — End the thread &lt;code&gt;th&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Thread.exit&lt;/code&gt; — End this thread&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Thread.stop&lt;/code&gt; — Pause this thread temporarily&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Thread#join&lt;/code&gt; — Wait for the receiving thread to end&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Thread#wakeup&lt;/code&gt; — Resume a thread that was previously paused

=== Ruby Threads ===

At a glance, threads may seem to all be run together, but they are actually executed in turns, each for a little bit of time.  Strictly speaking, on multi-CPU machines one can run two threads at once, but even so, if there are more threads than CPU’s, then the threads must run in turns.

In short, for threads to be created, someone, somewhere must switch between them.  Techniques for doing so are divided into two major types: &lt;em&gt;kernel-level&lt;/em&gt; threads and &lt;em&gt;user-level&lt;/em&gt; threads.  Just as written, kernel-level threads are created by the kernel and user-level threads are created by the user.  Kernel-level threads can make use of multi-CPU machines to run more than one thread at once.

So what are Ruby threads?  Ruby threads are user-level threads and thus are limited to one running thread at a time.

=== Preemptive? ===

Now we’ll talk about the characteristics of Ruby threads in a little more detail.  When talking about threads, one can talk about whether or not they are &lt;em&gt;preemptive&lt;/em&gt;.

In a preemptive threading system, even if the user of the threads doesn’t explicitly switch threads, the threads will be switched on their own.  Looked at in reverse, the timing of thread switching cannot be controlled by the user.

On the other hand, in a non-preemptive threading system, as long as the user of the threads doesn’t explicitly say “you can pass control to the next thread now,” the threads won’t switch.  Looked at in reverse again, it is clear that the user of the threads can control where it is possible for threads to be switched.

This distinction can also be made for processes.  In this case, preemptive is seen as the “superior” approach.  If, for example, a program had a bug which caused it to fall into an infinite loop, processes would not be able to switch.  In other words, one user program could lock up the entire system; this is no good.  Windows 3.1 has MS-DOS as its foundation, so its process switching is non-preemptive, but Windows 95’s is preemptive.  Therefore, Windows 95 is more robust and it can be said that Windows 95 is “superior” to Windows 3.1.

So which is it for Ruby threads?  At the Ruby level, threads are preemptive and at the C level, threads are non-preemptive.  In other words, when writing C code, you can almost exactly specify the timing of thread switches.

Why is Ruby threading like this?  Threads are indeed convenient but there are certain considerations that must be made when using them.  Namely, code must accommodate for the threads (the code must be &lt;em&gt;thread-safe&lt;/em&gt;). That is, if thread switching were preemptive at the C level, all of the C libraries that we use would have to be thread-safe.

However, there are actually many C libraries that are not yet thread-safe.  If we decreased the number of libraries you can use by making thread safety a requirement, all of the effort taken to make extension libraries easy to write would be meaningless.  Thus, for Ruby, making threading non-preemptive at the Ruby level is the rational choice.

=== Management Structure ===

We learned that at the C level, Ruby threads are non-preemptive.  That is, after your thread runs for a while, it voluntarily gives up control to another thread.  So let’s consider an executing thread that is just about to stop running.  Which thread should it pass control to?  No, to begin with we need to know how Ruby threads are represented internally.  Let’s take a look at the variables and data structure for managing threads.

▼  Thread management structure

&lt;pre&gt;864  typedef struct thread * rb_thread_t;
865  static rb_thread_t curr_thread = 0;
866  static rb_thread_t main_thread;

7301  struct thread {
7302      struct thread *next, *prev;

(eval.c)&lt;/pre&gt;

For various reasons, &lt;code&gt;struct thread&lt;/code&gt; has become very large, so we focus on the important parts here.  Looking at just the two members, &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt;, which are both &lt;code&gt;rb_thread_t&lt;/code&gt; structures, you might think that &lt;code&gt;rb_thread_t&lt;/code&gt; is a doubly-linked list.  But actually, it is not just a doubly-linked list; its ends meet.  In other words, it is a circular doubly-linked list.  This is an important point.  When you add the static variables, &lt;code&gt;main_thread&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;curr_thread&lt;/code&gt;, the whole data structure looks like Diagram 1.

&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;:  Data structure for managing threads

&lt;code&gt;main_thread&lt;/code&gt; is a thread that exists when the program is starting up.  In other words, it is the “first” thread.  &lt;code&gt;curr_thread&lt;/code&gt; is, of course, the current thread; that is, the thread that is currently running.  The value of &lt;code&gt;main_thread&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t change throughout the operation of the process but the value of &lt;code&gt;curr_thread&lt;/code&gt; changes rapidly.

With the threads forming a cycle in this manner, choosing the next thread is simple: just follow the &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; link and choose that thread.  With just that, you can run all threads evenly, to an extent.

A '''D'''ocument '''T'''ype '''D'''efinition is a file that links to an XML page. It controls what must or can be displayed, what attributes and their values must/can have and how the XML file should look like. XHTML, HTML and other markup languages use DTDs to validate their documents. '''Note''': Web browsers accept bad markup in HTML.

== Uses OF DTDs ==
DTDs are used to store large amounts of data in a custom markup language that can be used for a specific program or organization. Like schemas they can have elements, attributes and entities. The only difference is how it is displayed.
== Prologue ==
Like in a schema, a DTD has a prolog. It is one line of text.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The question mark is to tell the computer you are giving him an instruction. The word xml tells him that you are using XML, the version attribute tells what version of XML you are using and the encoding attribute tells him how to encode the data (you would use a different encoding if you wanted to use chinese text).

== &lt;!ELEMENT&gt; tag ==
The element tag is used to display an element of the page, depending on how you declare it. It can go only on a specific part of the page or anywhere on the page. 

The first element you declare is the root element (in HTML it's html). Let's pretend that there was an organization that wanted a bunch of XML files containing info about each person. They probably would have a root element of the file named &quot;person&quot;. The standard for declaring an element with children elements is

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!ELEMENT elementName (childElement, childElement2, childElement3)&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

So the orginization root element tag declaration would be

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!ELEMENT person (firstName, lastName, postalCode, cellNumber, homeNumber, email)&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Note''': A child element must be declared in a separate element tag to be valid.

'''Note''': The comma is used where you identify the child element is an occurrence indicator (something that tells the computer how it should occur). There are other occurrence indicators. We will cover them later in this chapter.

'''Note''': The  parentheses define what content type is found in the bracket. Different content types are found later in this chapter.

Some elements you don't want to be linked to specific tags (like a formatting tag you want to use to highlight important info), you do the same thing except you don't use it as a child element for any element depending on your needs, you may use the ANY content type, which allows you to use character data or other tags in your tag, the EMPTY content type, which looks like &quot;&lt;exampleXmlTag /&gt;&quot; or #PCDATA for text.

'''Note''':In an element declaration you can combine parentheses with #PCDATA. It looks like this &lt;!ELEMENT elementName ( #PCDATA| childName). The pipe bar  means that you can use text or other tags.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:CompactFlash Sandisk 4GB ExtremeIII.jpg|thumb|A 4GB CompactFlash card can hold a lot of data, draws little power and is relatively easy to use.]]

'''CompactFlash cards''' are a very common [[w:flash memory|flash]]-based removable storage technology that was first released in 1994. It is heavily based on the PCMCIA standard. CompactFlash (CF) cards are larger than most other memory cards, but they are more rugged than most and have the advantage of a simple and open interface protocol, as opposed to devices like SD cards, which have proprietatry interfaces.

CompactFlash cards have 50 pins, but only 15 are absolutely necessary for a minimal interface, which means that many mid-range microcontrollers have enough pins to use one. CompactFlash cards have so many pins partly because they use a parallel data bus, presenting and outputting 8 or 16 bits at a time, which are all sent together. Devices like SD cards have a serial interface, which requires much more complicated timing to use.

All flash-based memory operates in blocks - you cannot access individual bytes or words like you can in RAM. CF cards almost invariably have a 512 byte block size. If you want to read, write or change any data, you must always deal with the entire block. This is a limitation of all flash memory, but it is the trade-off made for such enormous capacity.

A CF card can be used to store any data at all, and this included raw, unformatted bytes, or a full file system, such as FAT or ext3. We will firstly deal with simple raw data operations. File systems can be implemented on top of this if required.

==The CompactFlash format==

Physically, CF cards are rectangular, with slots in the sides for guides in the socket and a female connector on the card, which mates with male pins in the socket. There are two form factors for CF card, Type I and Type II, the only difference being the physical thickness of the card. Type II cards are 5mm thick and Type I are 3.3mm thick. Everything else is identical, so a Type I card will fit in a Type II socket, but not the other way around.

CompactFlash cards are generally more rugged that other formats. They can withstand shock of 2000G (a three-metre drop onto a hard surface) and are rated to at least 10000 mating cycles. In normal usage, a CompactFlash card can be expected to last around a hundred years.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.compactflash.org/faqs/faq.htm#shock&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pinout===

The pins of a CompactFlash card are arranged in a 2×25 rectangular array with 0.05 inch spacing (50 mils or 1.27mm). CF cards have slots on each side, which are used to ensure the card cannot be inserted upside down or backwards. When looking into the card's connector, the wider slot is on the left when oriented as in the image below.

[[File:CompactFlash Pinout.svg|center|frame|Pinout of the female connector on a CompactFlash card, shown looking into the card.]]

The function of the pins can depend on the mode that the card is being used in. See [[Practical_Electronics/Device_pinouts/CompactFlash_cards|here]] for a full pinout description.

==Memory Modes==

CompactFlash cards support three modes of memory access: PC Card Memory mode, PC Card I/O mode and True IDE Mode.

===PC Card Memory mode===

In PC Card Memory mode (or Common Memory mode), the task file registers are mapped into the common memory space of the CompactFlash card.

In this mode, the card can perform either 8-bit or 16-bit I/O operations to any of the common memory addresses.

===PC Card I/O mode===

In PC Card I/O mode (or I/O Function mode), the task file is mapped into the I/O memory space.

===True IDE mode===

In True IDE mode, task file registers are mapped into the I/O memory space, like in the I/O mode. True IDE mode has the advantage that direct interfaces with existing IDE buses are possible, as the CF card appears exactly like a hard-drive.

True IDE mode is specified by holding {{overline|ATA SEL}} (pin 9) low during power-up. There are sometimes ways to switch into True IDE mode, but these cannot be relied on as they are optional in the specification.

In True IDE mode, the PCMCIA protocol and all configuration is disabled. Only I/O operations to the task file and data register allowed, with no memory or attribute registers accessible.

==A minimal interface==

CompactFlash cards can be used with only a fraction of the pins connected to a controller device. This is very useful when a microcontroller or other device has limited pins. The downside is that this method is slower than using all the available pins. This method uses an 8-bit interface, which is ideal for most low- to mid-range microcontrollers with 8-bit architectures. 

When in common memory mode, all necessary registers can be accessed using just 3 address lines, and the interface is particular simple. The information needed for the card to read and write data is first loaded into control registers, and then the data is read out a byte at a time.

==File systems==

CompactFlash cards have no intrinsic file system in their memory, it is just blocks of raw data. File systems that allow the card to be read as a disc by a computer, such as FAT, NTFS or ext3, are placed into memory just like any other data, but have special significance to a computer that reads them.

===Windows file systems===

When using a disc formated with FAT, the first 512 bytes of data (sector 0) contain the master boot record (MBR), which tells the computer how big the disc is, how the memory is arranged and the name of the card, amongst other information. If you corrupt or remove this information by writing into sector 0, Windows will be unable to recognise the CF card as usable memory. It may even be impossible to recognise the disc enough to reformat it normally.

In this case, an &quot;unconditional&quot; format is required. Using the command prompt, enter the following (replace &lt;tt&gt;X:&lt;/tt&gt; with the relevant drive letter).

 format X: /fs:fat /u

You may need to do this twice to fully restore the disc to a Windows-compatible format. This method may destroy some data on the CF card. To prevent this, always begin indexing the CF card from sector 1 or higher. This may still corrupt the file system if you write blindly, but you will be able to mount the disc to retrieve data with tools such as WinHex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WJ Flower
|common name = Blackberry
|binomial = Rubus pensilvanicus
|color = white
|image1 =BrombeerblüteMitKäfer.jpg
|caption1=Single flower
|image2 =Braambloem.jpg
|caption2=Flowers and unripe fruit
|image3 =Brombeere-reif.JPG
|caption3=The familiar, ripe Blackberry fruit
|description =Blackberries are a summer delight.  The fruit is formed before the last of the flowers fades, though it is not yet ripe.  In late summer the fruit ripens, and then it can be picked and eaten on the spot, or collected and made into a pie.  The flowers are white with five petals, and have several thread-like stamens ('''stay'''-mins) coming out of the center.  Bees love blackberry flowers, and should be allowed to do their work on them.  Without the bees, the flowers could not turn into berries.  The leaves have jagged edges, and the stems are covered with thorns (which makes picking berries more of a challenge).
|facts =The stems of the blackberry are called &quot;canes&quot; and live for two years.  When a cane is in its first year, it produces neither flowers nor fruit.  Only in its second year does it bear flowers.

      <comment>deleted &quot;some sort of Kilroy machine;&quot; inserted proper name of lettering aid, the Leroy scriber</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Lettering is a dying art that presents text, dimensions and notes that are hand written in a standard form. Lettering is typically all upper case without slant or formatting but the creator of a drawing will often put their own personality into the lettering. All caps on an engineering drawing is not &quot;yelling&quot; but is good practice and facilitates clear communication. Slanted lettering may be used for emphasis of a particular point or idea.

Letters are all block letters generally of equal width and 1/8 inch tall. The use of a mechanical guide or construction lines to control height is recommended for consistency. Unless an inked drawing is lettered using a Leroy scriber (now obsolete) lettering is done freehand. All letters are upper case only unless in a long paragraph of more than 2 sentences. Letters of a word will be close to each other without touching. Space between words is about the same as the letter H or W. Numbers are the same size as letters. Fraction numbers are slightly smaller than 1/8 inch, stacked and symmetrical to the line it is in. Multiple lines of text should leave space between each line of about half the height of a normal letter. 

Special cases of lettering may be smaller or larger than the standard height. Title block lettering may be larger. Section view identifiers and cutting plane labels may also be larger. 

Each letter is generally created from top to bottom and left to right. At the end of each straight leg or line of a letter, the pen or pencil is picked up and relocated for the next line. For example the letter 'A' consists of a stroke down and to the left, down and to the right and a final stroke left to right half way up the height connecting the two legs together. Rounded letters such as 'O' start at the top and go down and around to the left to the bottom, pencil up, then another stroke from the top then down and to the right closing the O at the bottom. Shortcuts are often taken making these letters with one stroke. Letters are generally sans-serif though using she serif form of 'I' as the word I is accepted. 

Notes on special letters and numbers: &lt;br&gt;
The letter 'W' has both outside legs slanted outward and are not vertical.  &lt;br&gt;
The letter 'M' outside legs are vertical and not slanted. 'M' is not an upside down 'W' and vice versa.  &lt;br&gt;
The number '0' (zero) and '7' do not have a slash. &lt;br&gt;
The number '4' comes to a point and is not open. &lt;br&gt;
The number '8' is made of two small circles of two to four strokes and not a single figure eight stroke. &lt;br&gt;
The number '9' is similar to the number '6' being made of curved strokes and no straight lines. &lt;br&gt;

If you wouldn't mind replying to my talk page, I need guidance regarding a couple of questions not obvious to me:

# Are the books intended to retain obvious grammatical errors?
# How literal is the formatting? Should embedded titles be italicized?

Thanks. – [[User:UnicornTapestry|UnicornTapestry]] ([[User talk:UnicornTapestry|talk]]) 10:24, 11 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{navigation|Book=Linear Algebra
|current=Vector Spaces
|previous=Topic: Speed of Gauss' Method
|next=Definition of Vector Space}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The first chapter began by introducing Gauss' method and finished with a fair understanding, keyed on the Linear Combination Lemma, of how it finds the solution set of a linear system. Gauss' method systematically takes linear combinations of the rows. With that insight, we now move to a general study of linear combinations.

We need a setting for this study. At times in the first chapter, we've combined vectors from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, at other times vectors from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, and at other times vectors from even higher-dimensional spaces. Thus, our first impulse might be to work in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, leaving &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; unspecified. This would have the advantage that any of the results would hold for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; and for many other spaces, simultaneously.

But, if having the results apply to many spaces at once is advantageous then sticking only to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;'s is overly restrictive. We'd like the results to also apply to combinations of row vectors, as in the final section of the first chapter. We've even seen some spaces that are not just a collection of all of the same-sized column vectors or row vectors. For instance, we've seen a solution set of a homogeneous system that is a plane, inside of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. This solution set is a closed system in the sense that a linear combination of these solutions is also a solution. But it is not just a collection of all of the three-tall column vectors; only some of them are in this solution set.

We want the results about linear combinations to apply anywhere that linear combinations are sensible. We shall call any such set a '''vector space'''. Our results, instead of being phrased as &quot;Whenever we have a collection in which we can sensibly take linear combinations ...&quot;, will be stated as &quot;In any vector space ...&quot;.

Such a statement describes at once what happens in many spaces. The step up in abstraction from studying a single space at a time to studying a class of spaces can be hard to make. To understand its advantages, consider this analogy. Imagine that the government made laws one person at a time: &quot;Leslie Jones can't jay walk.&quot; That would be a bad idea; statements have the virtue of economy when they apply to many cases at once. Or, suppose that they ruled, &quot;Kim Ke must stop when passing the scene of an accident.&quot; Contrast that with, &quot;Any doctor must stop when passing the scene of an accident.&quot; More general statements, in some ways, are clearer.

;Definition 1.1{{anchor|def:VecSpace}}:&lt;!--\label{def:VecSpace}--&gt;
A '''vector space'''
(over &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;) consists of a set &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; along with
two operations &quot;+&quot; and &quot;&lt;math&gt; \cdot &lt;/math&gt;&quot; subject to these conditions.

&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt; For any &lt;math&gt; \vec{v},\vec{w}\in V &lt;/math&gt;, their '''vector sum''' &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}+\vec{w} &lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\vec{v},\vec{w}\in V &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}+\vec{w}=\vec{w}+\vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; For any &lt;math&gt;\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}\in V &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; (\vec{v}+\vec{w})+\vec{u}=\vec{v}+(\vec{w}+\vec{u}) &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; There is a '''zero vector''' &lt;math&gt; \vec{0}\in V &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}+\vec{0}=\vec{v}\, &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in V&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; Each &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in V &lt;/math&gt; has an '''additive inverse''' &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}\in V &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}+\vec{v}=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; If &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt; is a '''scalar''', that is, a member of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in V &lt;/math&gt; then the '''scalar multiple''' &lt;math&gt; r\cdot\vec{v} &lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; If &lt;math&gt; r,s\in\mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in V &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; (r+s)\cdot\vec{v}=r\cdot\vec{v}+s\cdot\vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; If &lt;math&gt; r\in\mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{v},\vec{w}\in V &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; r\cdot(\vec{v}+\vec{w})=r\cdot\vec{v}+r\cdot\vec{w} &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; If &lt;math&gt; r,s\in\mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in V&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; (rs)\cdot\vec{v} =r\cdot(s\cdot\vec{v}) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;li&gt; For any &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in V &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; 1\cdot\vec{v}=\vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Remark 1.2:
Because it involves two kinds of addition and two kinds of multiplication, that definition may seem confused. For instance, in condition 7 &quot;&lt;math&gt; (r+s)\cdot\vec{v}=r\cdot\vec{v}+s\cdot\vec{v}\, &lt;/math&gt;&quot;, the first &quot;+&quot; is the real number addition operator while the &quot;+&quot; to the right of the equals sign represents vector addition in the structure &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;. These expressions aren't ambiguous because, e.g., &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; are real numbers so &quot;&lt;math&gt; r+s &lt;/math&gt;&quot; can only mean real number addition.
}}

{{anchor|closure}}The best way to go through the examples below is to check all ten conditions in the definition. That check is written out at length in the first example. Use it as a model for the others. Especially important are the first condition &quot;&lt;math&gt; \vec{v}+\vec{w} &lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;&quot; and the sixth condition &quot;&lt;math&gt; r\cdot\vec{v} &lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;&quot;. These are the '''closure''' conditions. They specify that the addition and scalar multiplication operations are always sensible&amp;mdash; they are defined for every pair of vectors, and every scalar and vector, and the result of the operation is a member of the set (see [[#ex:PlaneThruOriginSubsp|Example 1.4]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:PlaneThruOriginSubsp}--&gt;).

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.3{{anchor|ex:RealVecSpaces}}: &lt;!--\label{ex:RealVecSpaces}--&gt;
The set &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; is a vector space if the operations &quot;&lt;math&gt; + &lt;/math&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;math&gt; \cdot &lt;/math&gt;&quot; have their usual meaning.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} x_1+y_1 \\ x_2+y_2 \end{pmatrix}
\qquad
r\cdot
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} rx_1 \\ rx_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We shall check all of the conditions.

There are five conditions in item 1. For 1, closure of addition, note that for any &lt;math&gt; v_1,v_2,w_1,w_2\in\mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; the result of the sum


:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} v_1+w_1 \\ v_2+w_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


is a column array with two real entries, and so is in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;. For 2, that addition of vectors commutes, take all entries to be real numbers and compute

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} v_1+w_1 \\ v_2+w_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} w_1+v_1 \\ w_2+v_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

(the second equality follows from the fact that the components of the vectors are real numbers, and the addition of real numbers is commutative). Condition 3, associativity of vector addition, is similar.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
(\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{pmatrix})
+\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{pmatrix}
&amp;=\begin{pmatrix} (v_1+w_1)+u_1 \\ (v_2+w_2)+u_2 \end{pmatrix} \\
&amp;=\begin{pmatrix} v_1+(w_1+u_1) \\ v_2+(w_2+u_2) \end{pmatrix} \\
&amp;=\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
+(\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{pmatrix})
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

For the fourth condition we must produce a zero element&amp;mdash; the vector of zeroes is it.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

For 5, to produce an additive inverse, note that for any &lt;math&gt;v_1,v_2\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} -v_1 \\ -v_2 \end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

so the first vector is the desired additive inverse of the second.

The checks for the five conditions having to do with scalar multiplication are just as routine. For 6, closure under scalar multiplication, where &lt;math&gt;r, v_1, v_2 \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,


:&lt;math&gt;
r\cdot\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} rv_1 \\ rv_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

is a column array with two real entries, and so is in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Next, this checks 7.

:&lt;math&gt;
(r+s)\cdot\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} (r+s)v_1 \\ (r+s)v_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} rv_1+sv_1 \\ rv_2+sv_2 \end{pmatrix}
=r\cdot\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}+s\cdot\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

For 8, that scalar multiplication distributes from the left over vector addition, we have this.

:&lt;math&gt;
r\cdot(\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{pmatrix})
=\begin{pmatrix} r(v_1+w_1) \\ r(v_2+w_2) \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} rv_1+rw_1 \\ rv_2+rw_2 \end{pmatrix}
=r\cdot\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}+r\cdot\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The ninth

:&lt;math&gt;
(rs)\cdot\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} (rs)v_1 \\ (rs)v_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} r(sv_1) \\ r(sv_2) \end{pmatrix}
=r\cdot(s\cdot\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix})
&lt;/math&gt;

and tenth conditions are also straightforward.

:&lt;math&gt;
1\cdot\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} 1v_1 \\ 1v_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

In a similar way, each &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; is a vector space with the usual operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. (In &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^1 &lt;/math&gt;, we usually do not write the members as column vectors, i.e., we usually do not write &quot;&lt;math&gt; (\pi) &lt;/math&gt;&quot;. Instead we just write &quot;&lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;&quot;.)

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.4{{anchor|ex:PlaneThruOriginSubsp}}: &lt;!--\label{ex:PlaneThruOriginSubsp}--&gt; This subset of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; that is a plane through the origin

:&lt;math&gt;
P=\{ \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} \,\big|\, x+y+z=0\}
&lt;/math&gt;

is a vector space if &quot;+&quot; and &quot;&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;&quot; are interpreted in this way.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} x_1+x_2 \\ y_1+y_2 \\ z_1+z_2 \end{pmatrix}
\qquad
r\cdot
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} rx \\ ry \\ rz \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|inherited operations}}The addition and scalar multiplication operations here are just the ones of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, reused on its subset &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; '''inherits''' these operations from &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. This example of an addition in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

illustrates that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is closed under addition. We've added two vectors from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;&amp;mdash; that is, with the property that the sum of their three entries is zero&amp;mdash; and the result is a vector also in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, this example of closure is not a proof of closure. To prove that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is closed under addition, take two elements of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix} \quad \begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

(membership in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x_1+y_1+z_1=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2+y_2+z_2=0&lt;/math&gt;), and observe that their sum

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x_1+x_2 \\ y_1+y_2 \\ z_1+z_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

is also in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; since its entries add &lt;math&gt;(x_1+x_2)+(y_1+y_2)+(z_1+z_2)=(x_1+y_1+z_1)+(x_2+y_2+z_2)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. To show that &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is closed under scalar multiplication, start with a vector from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

(so that &lt;math&gt; x+y+z=0 &lt;/math&gt;) and then for &lt;math&gt; r\in\mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; observe that the scalar multiple

:&lt;math&gt;
r\cdot\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} rx \\ ry \\ rz \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

satisfies that &lt;math&gt; rx+ry+rz=r(x+y+z)=0 &lt;/math&gt;. Thus the two closure conditions are satisfied. Verification of the other conditions in the definition of a vector space are just as straightforward.

[[#ex:RealVecSpaces|Example 1.3]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:RealVecSpaces}--&gt; shows that the set of all two-tall vectors with real entries is a vector space. [[#ex:PlaneThruOriginSubsp|Example 1.4]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:PlaneThruOriginSubsp}--&gt; gives a subset of an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; that is also a vector space. In contrast with those two, consider the set of two-tall columns with entries that are integers (under the obvious operations). This is a subset of a vector space, but it is not itself a vector space. The reason is that this set is not closed under scalar multiplication, that is, it does not satisfy condition 6. Here is a column with integer entries, and a scalar, such that the outcome of the operation

;Warning!:
The examples so far involve sets of column vectors with the usual operations. But vector spaces need not be collections of column vectors, or even of row vectors. Below are some other types of vector spaces. The term &quot;vector space&quot; does not mean &quot;collection of columns of reals&quot;. It means something more like &quot;collection in which any linear combination is sensible&quot;.

==Examples==
{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.8{{anchor|ex:PolySpaceThree}}: &lt;!--\label{ex:PolySpaceThree}--&gt;
Consider &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_3=\{a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3\,\big|\, a_0,\ldots,a_3\in\mathbb{R}\} &lt;/math&gt;, the set of polynomials of degree three or less (in this book, we'll take constant polynomials, including the zero polynomial, to be of degree zero). It is a vector space under the operations

:&lt;math&gt;
(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3)+(b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+b_3x^3)
&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
=(a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+(a_2+b_2)x^2+(a_3+b_3)x^3
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
r\cdot(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3)=(ra_0)+(ra_1)x+(ra_2)x^2+(ra_3)x^3
&lt;/math&gt;

(the verification is easy). This vector space is worthy of attention because these are the polynomial operations familiar from high school algebra. For instance, &lt;math&gt;3\cdot(1-2x+3x^2-4x^3)-2\cdot(2-3x+x^2-(1/2)x^3)=-1+7x^2-11x^3&lt;/math&gt;.

Although this space is not a subset of any &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;, there is a sense in which we can think of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_3&lt;/math&gt; as &quot;the same&quot; as &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^4 &lt;/math&gt;. If we identify these two spaces's elements in this way


:&lt;math&gt;
a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3
\quad\text{corresponds to}\quad
\begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\ a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

then the operations also correspond. Here is an example of corresponding additions.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lr}
&amp;1-2x+0x^2+1x^3 \\
+ &amp;2+3x+7x^2-4x^3 \\ \hline
&amp;3+1x+7x^2-3x^3
\end{array}
\quad\text{corresponds to}\quad
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 7 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Things we are thinking of as &quot;the same&quot; add to &quot;the same&quot; sum. Chapter Three makes precise this idea of vector space correspondence. For now we shall just leave it as an intuition.

The set &lt;math&gt; \{f\,\big|\, f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}\} &lt;/math&gt; of all real-valued functions of one natural number variable is a vector space under the operations

:&lt;math&gt;
(f_1+f_2)\,(n)=f_1(n)+f_2(n)
\qquad
(r\cdot f)\,(n)=r\,f(n)
&lt;/math&gt;

so that if, for example, &lt;math&gt; f_1(n)=n^2+2\sin(n) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f_2(n)=-\sin(n)+0.5 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; (f_1+2f_2)\,(n)=n^2+1 &lt;/math&gt;.

We can view this space as a generalization of [[#ex:RealVecSpaces|Example 1.3]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:RealVecSpaces}--&gt;&amp;mdash; instead of &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;-tall vectors, these functions are like infinitely-tall vectors.

&lt;/math&gt;

Addition and scalar multiplication are component-wise, as in [[#ex:RealVecSpaces|Example 1.3]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:RealVecSpaces}--&gt;. (We can formalize &quot;infinitely-tall&quot; by saying that it means an infinite sequence, or that it means a function from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.)

This space differs from the space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_3&lt;/math&gt; of [[#ex:PolySpaceThree|Example 1.8]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:PolySpaceThree}--&gt;. This space contains not just degree three polynomials, but degree thirty polynomials and degree three hundred polynomials, too. Each individual polynomial of course is of a finite degree, but the set has no single bound on the degree of all of its members.

This example, like the prior one, can be thought of in terms of infinite-tuples. For instance, we can think of &lt;math&gt; 1+3x+5x^2 &lt;/math&gt; as corresponding to &lt;math&gt; (1,3,5,0,0,\ldots) &lt;/math&gt;. However, don't confuse this space with the one from [[#ex:FcnsNToRIsVecSp|Example 1.10]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:FcnsNToRIsVecSp}--&gt;. Each member of this set has a bounded degree, so under our correspondence there are no elements from this space matching &lt;math&gt; (1,2,5,10,\,\ldots\,) &lt;/math&gt;. The vectors in this space correspond to infinite-tuples that end in zeroes.

The set of solutions of a homogeneous linear system in &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; variables is a vector space under the operations inherited from &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;. For closure under addition, if

\vec{v}=\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix}
\qquad
\vec{w}=\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ \vdots \\ w_n \end{pmatrix}

both satisfy the condition that their entries add to &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}+\vec{w} &lt;/math&gt; also satisfies that condition: &lt;math&gt; c_1(v_1+w_1)+\cdots+c_n(v_n+w_n) =(c_1v_1+\cdots+c_nv_n)+(c_1w_1+\cdots+c_nw_n) =0 &lt;/math&gt;.

As we've done in those equations, we often omit the multiplication symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt; \cdot &lt;/math&gt;&quot;. We can distinguish the multiplication in &quot;&lt;math&gt; c_1v_1 &lt;/math&gt;&quot; from that in &quot;&lt;math&gt; r\vec{v}\, &lt;/math&gt;&quot; since if both multiplicands are real numbers then real-real multiplication must be meant, while if one is a vector then scalar-vector multiplication must be meant.

The prior example has brought us full circle since it is one of our motivating examples.

{{TextBox|1=
;Remark 1.16:
Now, with some feel for the kinds of structures that satisfy the definition of a vector space, we can reflect on that definition. For example, why specify in the definition the condition that &lt;math&gt; 1\cdot\vec{v}=\vec{v} &lt;/math&gt; but not a condition that &lt;math&gt; 0\cdot\vec{v}=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;?

One answer is that this is just a definition&amp;mdash; it gives the rules of the game from here on, and if you don't like it, put the book down and walk away.

Another answer is perhaps more satisfying. People in this area have worked hard to develop the right balance of power and generality. This definition has been shaped so that it contains the conditions needed to prove all of the interesting and important properties of spaces of linear combinations. As we proceed, we shall derive all of the properties natural to collections of linear combinations from the conditions given in the definition.

The next result is an example. We do not need to include these properties in the definition of vector space because they follow from the properties already listed there.

In any vector space &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;, for any &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in V &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r\in\mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;, we have
# &lt;math&gt; 0\cdot\vec{v}=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;, and
# &lt;math&gt; (-1\cdot\vec{v})+\vec{v}=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;, and
# &lt;math&gt; r\cdot\vec{0}=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Proof:
For 1, note that &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}=(1+0)\cdot\vec{v}=\vec{v}+(0\cdot\vec{v}) &lt;/math&gt;. Add to both sides the additive inverse of &lt;math&gt; \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;, the vector &lt;math&gt; \vec{w} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \vec{w}+\vec{v}=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
\vec{w}+\vec{v}
&amp;=\vec{w}+\vec{v}+0\cdot\vec{v} \\
\vec{0}
&amp;=\vec{0}+0\cdot\vec{v} \\
\vec{0}
&amp;=0\cdot\vec{v}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;


The second item is easy: &lt;math&gt; (-1\cdot\vec{v})+\vec{v}=(-1+1)\cdot\vec{v}=0\cdot\vec{v}=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt; shows that we can write &quot;&lt;math&gt; -\vec{v}\, &lt;/math&gt;&quot; for the additive inverse of &lt;math&gt; \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt; without worrying about possible confusion with &lt;math&gt; (-1)\cdot\vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;.

For 3, this &lt;math&gt; r\cdot\vec{0}=r\cdot(0\cdot\vec{0})=(r\cdot 0)\cdot\vec{0}=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt; will do.

==Summary==
We finish with a recap.

Our study in Chapter One of Gaussian reduction led us to consider collections of linear combinations. So in this chapter we have defined a vector space to be a structure in which we can form such combinations, expressions of the form &lt;math&gt; c_1\cdot\vec{v}_1+\dots+c_n\cdot\vec{v}_n &lt;/math&gt; (subject to simple conditions on the addition and scalar multiplication operations). In a phrase: vector spaces are the right context in which to study linearity.

Finally, a comment. From the fact that it forms a whole chapter, and especially because that chapter is the first one, a reader could come to think that the study of linear systems is our purpose. The truth is, we will not so much use vector spaces in the study of linear systems as we will instead have linear systems start us on the study of vector spaces. The wide variety of examples from this subsection shows that the study of vector spaces is interesting and important in its own right, aside from how it helps us understand linear systems. Linear systems won't go away. But from now on our primary objects of study will be vector spaces.

One of the examples that led us to introduce the idea of a vector space was
the solution set of a homogeneous system.
For instance, we've seen in [[Linear Algebra/Definition and Examples of Vector Spaces#ex:PlaneThruOriginSubsp|Example 1.4]]&lt;!--\ref{PlaneThruOriginSubsp}--&gt;
such a space that is a planar subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. 
There, the vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; contains inside it another
vector space, the plane.

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 2.1{{anchor|subspace}}:
For any vector space, a '''subspace''' is a subset that is itself a vector space, under the inherited operations.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.2{{anchor|ex:PlaneSubspRThree}}:&lt;!--\label{ex:PlaneSubspRThree}--&gt;
The plane from the prior subsection,

:&lt;math&gt;
P=\{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, x+y+z=0\}
&lt;/math&gt;

is a subspace of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;.
As specified in the definition, 
the operations are the ones that are inherited from the larger space, that is,
vectors add in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as they add in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} x_1+x_2 \\ y_1+y_2 \\ z_1+z_2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and scalar multiplication is also the same as it is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. To show that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace, we need only note that it is a subset and then verify that it is a space. Checking that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the conditions in the definition of a vector space is routine. For instance, for closure under addition, just note that if the summands satisfy that &lt;math&gt;x_1+y_1+z_1=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2+y_2+z_2=0&lt;/math&gt; then the sum satisfies that &lt;math&gt;(x_1+x_2)+(y_1+y_2)+(z_1+z_2)=(x_1+y_1+z_1)+(x_2+y_2+z_2)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.3{{anchor|ex:SubspacesRTwo}}:&lt;!--\label{ex:SubspacesRTwo}--&gt;
The &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;-axis in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; 
is a subspace where
the addition and scalar multiplication operations are 
the inherited ones.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} x_1+x_2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\qquad
r\cdot\begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix} rx \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

As above, to verify that this is a subspace, we simply note that it is a subset and then check that it satisfies the conditions in definition of a vector space. For instance, the two closure conditions are satisfied: (1) adding two vectors with a second component of zero results in a vector with a second component of zero, and (2) multiplying a scalar times a vector with a second component of zero results in a vector with a second component of zero.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.4:
Another subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; is 

:&lt;math&gt;
\{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\}
&lt;/math&gt;

its trivial subspace.
}}

Any vector space has a trivial subspace &lt;math&gt; \{\vec{0}\,\} &lt;/math&gt;.
At the opposite extreme, any vector space has itself for a subspace.
{{anchor|improper}}These two are the '''improper''' subspaces.
{{anchor|proper}}Other subspaces are '''proper'''. 

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.5{{anchor|ex:OperNotInherit}}:&lt;!--\label{ex:OperNotInherit}--&gt;
The condition in the definition requiring that the addition and scalar multiplication operations must be the ones inherited from the larger space is important. Consider the subset &lt;math&gt; \{1\} &lt;/math&gt; of the vector space &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^1 &lt;/math&gt;. Under the operations &lt;math&gt;1+1=1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;r\cdot 1=1&lt;/math&gt; that set is a vector space, specifically, a trivial space. But it is not a subspace of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^1 &lt;/math&gt; because those aren't the inherited operations, since of course &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^1 &lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt; 1+1=2 &lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.6{{anchor|ex:LinSubspPolyThree}}:  &lt;!--\label{ex:LinSubspPolyThree}--&gt;
All kinds of vector spaces, not just &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;'s, have subspaces. The vector space of cubic polynomials &lt;math&gt; \{a+bx+cx^2+dx^3\,\big|\, a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{R}\} &lt;/math&gt; has a subspace comprised of all linear polynomials &lt;math&gt; \{m+nx\,\big|\, m,n\in\mathbb{R}\} &lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.7:
Another example of a subspace not taken from an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is one from the examples following the definition of a vector space. The space of all real-valued functions of one real variable &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; has a subspace of functions satisfying the restriction &lt;math&gt;(d^2\,f/dx^2)+f=0&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.8{{anchor|ex:RPlusNotSubSp}}:&lt;!--\label{ex:RPlusNotSubSp}--&gt;
Being vector spaces themselves, subspaces must satisfy the closure conditions. The set &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^+ &lt;/math&gt; is not a subspace of the vector space &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^1 &lt;/math&gt; because with the inherited operations it is not closed under scalar multiplication: if &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}=1 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; -1\cdot\vec{v}\not\in\mathbb{R}^+ &lt;/math&gt;.
}}

The next result says that [[#ex:RPlusNotSubSp|Example 2.8]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:RPlusNotSubSp}--&gt; is prototypical. 
The only way that a subset can fail to be a subspace 
(if it is nonempty and the inherited operations are used)
is if it isn't closed.

{{TextBox|1=
;Lemma 2.9{{anchor|le:SubspIffClosed}}:&lt;!--\label{le:SubspIffClosed}--&gt;
For a nonempty subset &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; of a vector space, under the inherited 
operations, the following are equivalent 
statements.&lt;ref&gt;More information on equivalence of statements is in the appendix.&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;

for any vectors &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}_1,\vec{s}_2\in S &lt;/math&gt; and scalars &lt;math&gt; r_1,r_2 &lt;/math&gt;
the vector &lt;math&gt; r_1\vec{s}_1+r_2\vec{s}_2 &lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;

for any vectors &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}_1,\ldots,\vec{s}_n\in S &lt;/math&gt; and scalars
&lt;math&gt; r_1, \ldots,r_n &lt;/math&gt;
the vector &lt;math&gt; r_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+r_n\vec{s}_n &lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/ol&gt;
}}
Briefly, the way that a subset gets to be a 
subspace is by being closed under linear combinations.

{{TextBox|1=
;Proof:
&quot;The following are equivalent&quot; means that each pair of 
statements are equivalent.

:&lt;math&gt;
(1)\!\iff\!(2)
\qquad
(2)\!\iff\!(3)
\qquad
(3)\!\iff\!(1)
&lt;/math&gt;

We will show this equivalence by establishing that
&lt;math&gt; (1)\implies (3)\implies (2)\implies (1)&lt;/math&gt;.
This strategy is suggested by noticing that
&lt;math&gt; (1)\implies (3) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (3)\implies (2) &lt;/math&gt; are easy and so we need only
argue the single implication &lt;math&gt; (2)\implies (1) &lt;/math&gt;.

For that argument, assume that &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty subset of a vector space
&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is closed under combinations of pairs of vectors.
We will show that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space by checking the conditions.

The first item in the vector space definition has five conditions.
First, for closure under addition, if
&lt;math&gt; \vec{s}_1,\vec{s}_2\in S &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}_1+\vec{s}_2\in S &lt;/math&gt;,
as &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}_1+\vec{s}_2=1\cdot\vec{s}_1+1\cdot\vec{s}_2 &lt;/math&gt;.
Second, for any &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}_1,\vec{s}_2\in S &lt;/math&gt;, because addition
is inherited from &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;, the sum &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}_1+\vec{s}_2 &lt;/math&gt;
in &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; equals the sum &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}_1+\vec{s}_2 &lt;/math&gt;
in &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;, and that equals the sum &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}_2+\vec{s}_1 &lt;/math&gt; in
&lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space, its addition is commutative), 
and that in turn equals the sum &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}_2+\vec{s}_1 &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;.
The argument for the third condition is similar to that for the second.
For the fourth, consider the zero vector of &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; and note that 
closure of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; under linear combinations of pairs of vectors gives that 
(where &lt;math&gt; \vec{s} &lt;/math&gt; is any member of the nonempty set &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;)
&lt;math&gt; 0\cdot\vec{s}+0\cdot\vec{s}=\vec{0} &lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;;
showing that &lt;math&gt; \vec{0} &lt;/math&gt; acts under the inherited operations as the additive
identity of &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is easy.
The fifth condition is satisfied because for any &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}\in S &lt;/math&gt;,
closure under linear combinations shows that the vector
&lt;math&gt; 0\cdot\vec{0}+(-1)\cdot\vec{s} &lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;; showing that it is the
additive inverse of &lt;math&gt; \vec{s} &lt;/math&gt; under the inherited operations is
routine.

The checks for item 2 are similar and are saved for [[#exer:SubspIffClosed|Problem 14]]&lt;!--\ref{exer:SubspIffClosed}--&gt;.
}}

We usually show that a subset is a subspace with &lt;math&gt; (2)\implies (1) &lt;/math&gt;.

{{TextBox|1=
;Remark 2.10:
At the start of this chapter we introduced vector spaces as collections in
which linear combinations are &quot;sensible&quot;.
The above result speaks to this.

The vector space definition has ten conditions but eight of them&amp;mdash; the
conditions not about closure&amp;mdash; simply ensure that referring to the
operations as an &quot;addition&quot; and a &quot;scalar multiplication&quot; is sensible.
The proof above checks that these eight
are inherited from the
surrounding vector space provided that the nonempty set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
[[#le:SubspIffClosed|Lemma 2.9]]&lt;!--\ref{le:SubspIffClosed}--&gt;'s statement (2) 
(e.g., commutativity of addition in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; follows right from
commutativity of addition in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;).
So, in this context, this meaning of &quot;sensible&quot; is automatically
satisfied.

In assuring us that this first meaning of the word is met, the result draws
our attention to the second meaning of &quot;sensible&quot;.
It has to do with the two remaining conditions, the closure conditions.
Above, the two separate closure conditions inherent in statement (1) are
combined in statement (2) into the single condition of closure under all
linear combinations of two vectors, which is then extended in statement (3) to
closure under combinations of any number of vectors.
The latter two statements say that we can always make sense of 
an expression like
&lt;math&gt;r_1\vec{s}_1+r_2\vec{s}_2&lt;/math&gt;, without restrictions on the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;'s&amp;mdash; such 
expressions are &quot;sensible&quot; in that the vector described is defined 
and is in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

This second meaning suggests that a good way to think of a vector space is as a collection of unrestricted linear combinations. The next two examples take some spaces and describe them in this way. That is, in these examples we parametrize, just as we did in Chapter One to describe the solution set of a homogeneous linear system.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.11:
This subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
S=\{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, x-2y+z=0\}
&lt;/math&gt;

is a subspace under the usual addition and scalar multiplication
operations of column vectors (the check that it is nonempty and closed under
linear combinations of two vectors is just like the one in 
[[#ex:PlaneSubspRThree|Example 2.2]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:PlaneSubspRThree}--&gt;).
To parametrize, we can take &lt;math&gt;x-2y+z=0&lt;/math&gt; to be a one-equation linear system and 
expressing the leading
variable in terms of the free variables &lt;math&gt;x=2y-z&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
S
=\{\begin{pmatrix} 2y-z \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, y,z\in\mathbb{R}\}
=\{y\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}+z\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, y,z\in\mathbb{R}\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now the subspace is described as the collection of unrestricted linear combinations of those two vectors. Of course, in either description, this is a plane through the origin.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.12{{anchor|ex:ParamSubspace}}:&lt;!--\label{ex:ParamSubspace}--&gt;
This is a subspace of the &lt;math&gt; 2 \! \times \! 2 &lt;/math&gt; matrices

:&lt;math&gt;
L=\{\begin{pmatrix}
a  &amp;0  \\
b  &amp;c
\end{pmatrix}
\,\big|\, a+b+c=0\}
&lt;/math&gt;

(checking that it is nonempty and closed under linear combinations is easy).
To parametrize, express the condition as &lt;math&gt;a=-b-c&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
L
=\{\begin{pmatrix}
-b-c  &amp;0  \\
b     &amp;c
\end{pmatrix}
\,\big|\, b,c\in\mathbb{R}\}
=\{b\begin{pmatrix}
-1    &amp;0  \\
1     &amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
+c\begin{pmatrix}
-1    &amp;0  \\
0     &amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\,\big|\, b,c\in\mathbb{R}\}
&lt;/math&gt;

As above, we've described the subspace as a collection of unrestricted linear combinations (by coincidence, also of two elements).
}}

Parametrization is an easy technique, but it is important.
We shall use it often.

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 2.13:
The '''span'''(or
'''linear closure''') of a nonempty subset &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; of a
vector space is the set of all linear combinations of vectors from &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
[S] =\{ c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n
\,\big|\, c_1,\ldots, c_n\in\mathbb{R}
\text{ and } \vec{s}_1,\ldots,\vec{s}_n\in S \}
&lt;/math&gt;

The span of the empty subset of a vector space is the trivial subspace.
}}
No notation for the span is completely standard.
The square brackets used here are common, but so are
&quot;&lt;math&gt;\mbox{span}(S)&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;math&gt;\mbox{sp}(S)&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

{{TextBox|1=
;Remark 2.14:
In Chapter One, after we showed that the solution
set of a homogeneous linear system can be written as 
&lt;math&gt;\{c_1\vec{\beta}_1+\cdots+c_k\vec{\beta}_k\,\big|\,
c_1,\ldots,c_k\in\mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt;,
we described that as the set &quot;generated&quot; by the &lt;math&gt;{\vec{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;'s.
We now have the technical term; we call that the &quot;span&quot; of the set
&lt;math&gt;\{\vec{\beta}_1,\ldots,\vec{\beta}_k\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Recall also the discussion of the &quot;tricky point&quot; in that proof. The span of the empty set is defined to be the set &lt;math&gt; \{\vec{0}\} &lt;/math&gt; because we follow the convention that a linear combination of no vectors sums to &lt;math&gt; \vec{0} &lt;/math&gt;. Besides, defining the empty set's span to be the trivial subspace is a convienence in that it keeps results like the next one from having annoying exceptional cases.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Lemma 2.15{{anchor|le:SpanIsASubsp}}:&lt;!--\label{le:SpanIsASubsp}--&gt;
In a vector space, the span of any subset is a subspace.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Proof:
Call the subset &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is empty then by definition its span is the trivial
subspace.
If &lt;math&gt; S&lt;/math&gt; is not empty then by [[#le:SubspIffClosed|Lemma 2.9]]&lt;!--\ref{le:SubspIffClosed}--&gt; we need
only check that the span &lt;math&gt; [S] &lt;/math&gt; is closed under linear combinations.
For a pair of vectors from that span,
&lt;math&gt; \vec{v}=c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; \vec{w}=c_{n+1}\vec{s}_{n+1}+\cdots+c_m\vec{s}_m &lt;/math&gt;,
a linear combination
:&lt;math&gt;
p\cdot(c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n)+
r\cdot(c_{n+1}\vec{s}_{n+1}+\cdots+c_m\vec{s}_m)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
=
pc_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+pc_n\vec{s}_n
+rc_{n+1}\vec{s}_{n+1}+\cdots+rc_m\vec{s}_m
&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; scalars) is a linear combination of elements of &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; and so is in &lt;math&gt; [S] &lt;/math&gt; (possibly some of the &lt;math&gt;\vec{s}_i&lt;/math&gt;'s forming &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; equal some of the &lt;math&gt;\vec{s}_j&lt;/math&gt;'s from &lt;math&gt;\vec{w}&lt;/math&gt;, but it does not matter).
}}

The converse of the lemma
holds: any subspace is the span of some set, because 
a subspace is obviously the span of the set of its members.
Thus a subset of a vector space is a subspace if and only if it is a span.
This fits the intuition 
that a good way to think of a vector space is as
a collection in which linear combinations are sensible.

Taken together, [[#le:SubspIffClosed|Lemma 2.9]]&lt;!--\ref{le:SubspIffClosed}--&gt; and
[[#le:SpanIsASubsp|Lemma 2.15]]&lt;!--\ref{le:SpanIsASubsp}--&gt; show that the span of a subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of a
vector space is the smallest subspace containing all the members of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.16{{anchor|ex:SpanSingVec}}:&lt;!--\label{ex:SpanSingVec}--&gt;
In any vector space &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;, for any vector &lt;math&gt; \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt; \{r\cdot\vec{v} \,\big|\, r\in\mathbb{R}\} &lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;. For instance, for any vector &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}\in\mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, the line through the origin containing that vector, &lt;math&gt; \{k\vec{v}\,\big|\, k\in\mathbb{R} \} &lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. This is true even when &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the zero vector, in which case the subspace is the degenerate line, the trivial subspace.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.17:
The span of this set
is all of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}\}
&lt;/math&gt;

To check this we must show that any member of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination
of these two vectors.
So we ask: for which
vectors (with real components &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) 
are there scalars &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; such that this holds?

:&lt;math&gt;
c_1\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}+c_2\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Gauss' method 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
\begin{array}{*{2}{rc}r}
c_1  &amp;+  &amp;c_2  &amp;=  &amp;x  \\
c_1  &amp;-  &amp;c_2  &amp;=  &amp;y
\end{array}
&amp;\xrightarrow[]{-\rho_1+\rho_2}
&amp;\begin{array}{*{2}{rc}r}
c_1  &amp;+  &amp;c_2    &amp;=  &amp;x  \\
&amp;   &amp;-2c_2  &amp;=  &amp;-x+y
\end{array}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
with back substitution gives &lt;math&gt;c_2=(x-y)/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_1=(x+y)/2&lt;/math&gt;. These two equations show that for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; that we start with, there are appropriate coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; making the above vector equation true. For instance, for &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=2&lt;/math&gt; the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_2=-1/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_1=3/2&lt;/math&gt; will do. That is, any vector in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a linear combination of the two given vectors.
}}

Since spans are subspaces, and we know that a
good way to understand a subspace is
to parametrize its description, we can try to understand a set's span in 
that way.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.18:
Consider, in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_2 &lt;/math&gt;, 
the span of the set &lt;math&gt; \{3x-x^2, 2x\} &lt;/math&gt;.
By the definition of span, it is the set of unrestricted linear
combinations of the two &lt;math&gt;\{c_1(3x-x^2)+c_2(2x)\,\big|\, c_1,c_2\in\mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Clearly polynomials in this span must have a constant term of zero.
Is that necessary condition also sufficient?

We are asking: for which members &lt;math&gt;a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0&lt;/math&gt; 
of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_2&lt;/math&gt; are there &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0=c_1(3x-x^2)+c_2(2x)&lt;/math&gt;? 
Since polynomials are equal if and only if their coefficients are equal,
we are looking for conditions on &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; satisfying these.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{*{2}{rc}r}
-c_1  &amp;   &amp;     &amp;=  &amp;a_2   \\
3c_1  &amp;+  &amp;2c_2 &amp;=  &amp;a_1   \\
&amp;   &amp;0    &amp;=  &amp;a_0                                   
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Gauss' method gives that 
&lt;math&gt;c_1=-a_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_2=(3/2)a_2+(1/2)a_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;0=a_0&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the only condition on polynomials in the span
is the condition that we knew of&amp;mdash; as long as &lt;math&gt;a_0=0&lt;/math&gt;,
we can give appropriate coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;
to describe the polynomial &lt;math&gt;a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2&lt;/math&gt; as in the span.
For instance, for the polynomial &lt;math&gt;0-4x+3x^2&lt;/math&gt;, the coefficients
&lt;math&gt;c_1=-3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2=5/2&lt;/math&gt; will do.
So the span of the given set is 
&lt;math&gt;\{a_1x+a_2x^2\,\big|\, a_1,a_2\in\mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

This shows, incidentally, that the set &lt;math&gt; \{x,x^2\} &lt;/math&gt; also spans this subspace. A space can have more than one spanning set. Two other sets spanning this subspace are &lt;math&gt; \{x,x^2,-x+2x^2\} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \{x,x+x^2,x+2x^2,\ldots\,\} &lt;/math&gt;. (Naturally, we usually prefer to work with spanning sets that have only a few members.)
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2.19{{anchor|ex:SubspRThree}}:&lt;!--\label{ex:SubspRThree}--&gt;
These are the subspaces of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; that we now know of, the 
trivial subspace, the lines through the origin,
the planes through the origin, and the whole space
(of course, the picture shows only a few of the infinitely many subspaces). 
In the next section we will prove that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; has no other
type of subspaces, so in fact this picture shows them all.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Linalg R3 subspaces.png|x250px]]
&lt;/center&gt;
The subsets are described as spans of sets, using a minimal number of members, and are shown connected to their supersets. Note that these subspaces fall naturally into levels&amp;mdash; planes on one level, lines on another, etc.&amp;mdash; according to how many vectors are in a minimal-sized spanning set.
}}

So far in this chapter we have seen that to study the
properties of linear combinations, the right setting is a
collection that is closed under these combinations.
In the first subsection we introduced such collections, vector spaces,
and we saw a great variety of examples.
In this subsection we saw still
more spaces, ones that happen to be subspaces of others.
In all of the variety we've seen a commonality.
[[#ex:SubspRThree|Example 2.19]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:SubspRThree}--&gt; above 
brings it out: vector spaces and subspaces are best understood as a span, 
and especially as a span of a small number of vectors.
The next section studies spanning sets that are minimal.

All of the subspaces that we've seen use zero in their 
description in some way.
For example, the subspace in [[#ex:SubspacesRTwo|Example 2.3]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:SubspacesRTwo}--&gt; consists of
all the vectors from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; with a second component of zero.
In contrast,
the collection of vectors from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; with a second component of one
does not form a subspace (it is not closed under scalar multiplication).
Another example is [[#ex:PlaneSubspRThree|Example 2.2]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:PlaneSubspRThree}--&gt;, where the condition
on the vectors is that the three components add to zero.
If the condition were that the three components add to one then it would 
not be a subspace (again, it would fail to be closed).
This exercise shows that a reliance on zero is not strictly necessary.
Consider the set 

:&lt;math&gt;
\{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, x+y+z=1\}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;

The trivial space &lt;math&gt;\{\vec{0}\}&lt;/math&gt; has only one basis, the empty one &lt;math&gt; \langle  \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.9:
The space of finite-degree polynomials has a basis with infinitely many elements &lt;math&gt; \langle 1,x,x^2,\ldots \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.10:
We have seen bases before. In the first chapter we described the solution set of homogeneous systems such as this one

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{*{4}{rc}r}
x  &amp;+  &amp;y  &amp;   &amp;   &amp;-   &amp;w   &amp;=  &amp;0  \\
&amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;z  &amp;+   &amp;w   &amp;=  &amp;0  
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

by parametrizing.

:&lt;math&gt;
\{\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}y
+\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}w
\,\big|\, y,w\in\mathbb{R} \}
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, we described the vector space of solutions as the span of a two-element set. We can easily check that this two-vector set is also linearly independent. Thus the solution set is a subspace of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^4 &lt;/math&gt; with a two-element  basis.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.11:
Parameterization helps find bases for other vector spaces, not just for solution sets of homogeneous systems. To find a basis for this subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{2 \! \times \! 2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\{\begin{pmatrix}
a  &amp;b  \\
c  &amp;0
\end{pmatrix} \,\big|\, a+b-2c=0\}
&lt;/math&gt;

we rewrite the condition as &lt;math&gt;a=-b+2c&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
\{\begin{pmatrix}
-b+2c  &amp;b  \\
c     &amp;0
\end{pmatrix} \,\big|\, b,c \in \mathbb{R}\}
=\{b\begin{pmatrix}
-1  &amp;1  \\
0  &amp;0
\end{pmatrix}+
c\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp;0  \\
1  &amp;0
\end{pmatrix} \,\big|\, b,c \in \mathbb{R}\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, this is a good candidate for a basis.

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle \begin{pmatrix}
-1  &amp;1  \\
0  &amp;0
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp;0  \\
1  &amp;0
\end{pmatrix}  \rangle 
&lt;/math&gt;

The above work shows that it spans the space. To show that it is linearly independent is routine.
}}

Consider again [[#ex:FstBasisRTwo|Example 1.2]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:FstBasisRTwo}--&gt;. It involves two verifications.

In the first, to check that the set is linearly independent we looked at linear combinations of the set's members that total to the zero vector &lt;math&gt;c_1\vec{\beta}_1+c_2\vec{\beta}_2=\binom{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt;. The resulting calculation shows that such a combination is unique, that &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The second verification, that the set spans the space, looks at linear combinations that total to any member of the space &lt;math&gt;c_1\vec{\beta}_1+c_2\vec{\beta}_2=\binom{x}{y}&lt;/math&gt;. In [[#ex:FstBasisRTwo|Example 1.2]]&lt;!--\ref{ex:FstBasisRTwo}--&gt; we noted only that the resulting calculation shows that such a combination exists, that for each &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; there is a &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2&lt;/math&gt;. However, in fact the calculation also shows that the combination is unique: &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;(y-x)/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;2x-y&lt;/math&gt;.

That is, the first calculation is a special case of the second. The next result says that this holds in general for a spanning set: the combination totaling to the zero vector is unique if and only if the combination totaling to any vector is unique.

{{TextBox|1=
;Theorem 1.12{{anchor|th:BasisIffUniqueRepWRT}}:&lt;!--\label{th:BasisIffUniqueRepWRT}--&gt;
In any vector space, a subset is a basis if and only if each vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of elements of the subset in a unique way.
}}

We consider combinations to be the same if they differ only in the order of summands or in the addition or deletion of terms of the form &quot;&lt;math&gt; 0\cdot\vec{\beta} &lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

{{TextBox|1=
;Proof:
By definition, a sequence is a basis if and only if its vectors form both a spanning set and a linearly independent set. A subset is a spanning set if and only if each vector in the space is a linear combination of elements of that subset in at least one way.

Thus, to finish we need only show that a subset is linearly independent if and only if every vector in the space is a linear combination of elements from the subset in at most one way. Consider two expressions of a vector as a linear combination of the members of the basis. We can rearrange the two sums, and if necessary add some &lt;math&gt; 0\vec{\beta}_i &lt;/math&gt; terms, so that the two sums combine the same &lt;math&gt; \vec{\beta} &lt;/math&gt;'s in the same order: &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}=c_1\vec{\beta}_1+c_2\vec{\beta}_2+\cdots +c_n\vec{\beta}_n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}=d_1\vec{\beta}_1+d_2\vec{\beta}_2+\cdots +d_n\vec{\beta}_n &lt;/math&gt;. Now

:&lt;math&gt;
c_1\vec{\beta}_1+c_2\vec{\beta}_2+\cdots +c_n\vec{\beta}_n=d_1\vec{\beta}_1+d_2\vec{\beta}_2+\cdots +d_n\vec{\beta}_n
&lt;/math&gt;

holds if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;
(c_1-d_1)\vec{\beta}_1+\dots+(c_n-d_n)\vec{\beta}_n=\vec{0}
&lt;/math&gt;

holds, and so asserting that each coefficient in the lower equation is zero is the same thing as asserting that &lt;math&gt; c_i=d_i &lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 1.13{{anchor|def:RepresentingVectors}}:&lt;!--\label{def:RepresentingVectors}--&gt;
In a vector space with basis &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; the 
'''representation of &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;''' 
is the column vector of the coefficients used to express &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; as a
linear combination of the basis vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\rm Rep}_{B}(\vec{v})=
\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; B=\langle \vec{\beta}_1,\dots,\vec{\beta}_n \rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}=c_1\vec{\beta}_1+c_2\vec{\beta}_2+\cdots
+c_n\vec{\beta}_n &lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;'s are the
'''coordinates of &lt;math&gt; \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;'''
}}

We will later do representations in contexts that involve more than one basis. To help with the bookkeeping, we shall often attach a subscript &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to the column vector.

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1.14:
In &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_3 &lt;/math&gt;, with respect to the basis &lt;math&gt; B=\langle 1,2x,2x^2,2x^3 \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;, the representation of &lt;math&gt; x+x^2 &lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
{\rm Rep}_{B}(x+x^2)=\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1/2 \\ 1/2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}_B
&lt;/math&gt;

(note that the coordinates are scalars, not vectors). With respect to a different basis &lt;math&gt; D=\langle 1+x,1-x,x+x^2,x+x^3 \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;, the representation 

:&lt;math&gt;
{\rm Rep}_{D}(x+x^2)=\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}_D
&lt;/math&gt;

is different.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Remark 1.15:
This use of column notation and the term &quot;coordinates&quot; has both a down side and an up side.

The down side is that representations look like vectors from &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;, which can be confusing when the vector space we are working with is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, especially since we sometimes omit the subscript base. We must then infer the intent from the context. For example, the phrase &quot;in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}=\binom{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; refers to the plane vector that, when in canonical position, ends at &lt;math&gt; (3,2) &lt;/math&gt;. To find the coordinates of that vector with respect to the basis

:&lt;math&gt;
B=\langle 
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}  \rangle 
&lt;/math&gt;

we solve

:&lt;math&gt;
c_1\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
+c_2\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

to get that &lt;math&gt;c_1=3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2=-1/2&lt;/math&gt;.
Then we have this.

:&lt;math&gt;
{\rm Rep}_{B}(\vec{v})=\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, although we've ommited the subscript &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; from the column, the fact that the right side is a representation is clear from the context.

The up side of the notation and the term &quot;coordinates&quot; is that they generalize the use that we are familiar with:~in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; and with respect to the standard basis &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}_n &lt;/math&gt;, the vector starting at the origin and ending at &lt;math&gt; (v_1,\dots,v_n) &lt;/math&gt; has this representation.


:&lt;math&gt;
{\rm Rep}_{\mathcal{E}_n}(\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix})
=
\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix}_{\mathcal{E}_n}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Our main use of representations will come in the third chapter. The definition appears here because the fact that every vector is a linear combination of basis vectors in a unique way is a crucial property of bases, and also to help make two points. First, we fix an order for the elements of a basis so that coordinates can be stated in that order. Second, for calculation of coordinates, among other things, we shall restrict our attention to spaces with bases having only finitely many elements. We will see that in the next subsection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Greetings all!  My name is Michael, and I am happy to be joining you all in this excellent course, ECI 301 Foundations of Education.  Some notes of my background include the following.  I have just completed my second year of teaching high school mathematics.  A number of factors have inspired me to become a teacher.  First, is my Mom.  She is an excellent teacher and brings a real passion to the profession.  She also cares about people.  All of these qualities I find inspirationl.  Second, I have been led to this field out of a concern to reach out to and make a difference to the younger generation.

This opportunity to share our philosophies of education is exciting.  I find that my philosophy of education changes some as a typical school year progresses.  I start out communicating high expectations and attempt to help the students of the class develop a very strong work ethic for the class.  This includes helping them to develop habits paying maximum attention during class, putting forth maximum effort during work, studying hard for tests, and turning in homework consistently. Also, in the early stages, I try to communicate to students that I care about them and what them to succeed.  Also, I try to help them envision that they can succeed and do better than ever before. Then, as the year progresses, I am more open to allowing for humor to make its way into class at the appropriate times and look for opportunities for students to express their feelings about the course and/or what's going on with them in general.  I try to build relationships with students by attending whatever extra-curricular functions may be going on.  

Diversity is certainly an issue that any teacher must take into account when coming up with a philosophy of education.  Especially in contexts where classroom management can be challenging, its important that a teache figures out what makes each individual student &quot;tick.&quot;  In the case of one student, this student might fully cooperate unless he/she perceives she is being disrespected or looked down upon in the eyes of a particular friend in class.  I try to figure out what makes each student tick and then adjust accordingly.  I also try to develop an undestanding of what each student might be sensitive too, and I act in accordance to this consideration.  Some students learn at a much slower rate than others.  I plan tutoring for those who learn at a slower rate, and I give them extra individual attention in class. For those who learn more quickly, I try to create special opportunities--either after school or in groups during class-- where they can learn at a more accelerated pace.  Also, I find partnering with parents can help students who previously feel uncomfortable around the majority of students and in the class can help these students feel more comfortable and be more prone to succeed.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Question Re: Default Data Types'''

In the Using Variables section it  mentions the following (incorrect?) examples... 
bytMyVariable = 1
sbytMyVariable = -2
...
intMyVariable = 100

I find this kinda confusing. how does the compiler know if its sposed to be a byte, sbyte or integer? it cant tell only based on the value coz the value 1 and 100 is valid for all (byte, sbyte and integer) and the value -2 is valid for both sbyte and integer. It mentions in the previous paragraph: &quot;Integral literals, such as 42 and 1000, are of type Integer by default&quot; So according to this all three (bytMyVariable, sbytMyVariable and intMyVariable) should be of type integer. am i right? assuming that is correct, it also implies that it is impossible to have a variable of type byte or sbyte w/o an explicit type declaration statement like: Dim bytMyVariable As Byte = 1 or Dim sbytMyVariable As SByte = -2. Any thots?

'''Answer:'''

For those examples, I believe that you would be correct if those variables were declared as generic Object types.  I believe that the intention of the example is to show how variables can be assigned values when they have been declared with the types indicated in their variable names.

I would suggest that the examples be changed to include the declaration statements as suggested by the previous commenter.


'''Question Re: Constant Examples'''

The code snippet that reads:
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Const&lt;/font&gt; cnstRadToDeg &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;As Single&lt;/font&gt; = 57,29579143
Should that not be a '.' instead of a ','?</text>

(first two are not unique to relational databases, apparently)


'''entity''':
&quot;An entity is anything (a person, a place, a thing, or an event) about which data are to be collected and stored. An entity represents a particular type of object in the real world. Because an entity represents a particular type of object, entities are &quot;distinguishable&quot; that is, each entity occurrence is unique and distinct. For example, a CUSTOMER entity would have many distinguishable customer occurrences, such as John Smith, Pedro Dinamita, Tom Strickland, etc.&quot;


'''relationship''':
&quot;A relationship describes an association among entities. For example, a relationship exists between customers and agents that can be described as follows: an agent can serve many customers, and each customer may be served by one agent.&quot;


page 111 of the same book.

'''cardinality''':
&quot;Cardinality expresses the minimum and maximum number of entity occurrences associated with one occurrence of the related entity.&quot;

// That sentence meant jack to me. An example would be better:

STUDENT has a relationship with CLASS.

For each CLASS, how many students can there be?

Minimum 1. Can't be 0, or there would not be a class.

Maximum 30 (an arbitrary number).

Or something like that. Keep in mind I have no idea what I'm talking about.

YOU PIECES OF SHIT! GIVE ME BACK MY EEKE PAGE, OR I WILL DELETE ALL OF YOUR PAGES!

: I am sorry that you are upset.  You were warned that the page would be deleted because it does not meet Wikibook's inclusion criteria.  Rather than acting on that by backing up your data, you simply deleted the warnings.  You were also given a pointer to another wiki that might possibly host your project.  You deleted that too.  I saw no other way to let you know that we were serious about the intended deletion, so I deleted the book.  If you would like a second chance to make a backup, I would be willing to temporarily undelete your work.  However, it will certainly be deleted again.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:25, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

:I have undeleted it, but not because of the &quot;forcefulness&quot; of your demand.  I offered to do so, and I made good on that, in spite of the incivility of your request.  It will be deleted permanently tomorrow. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:38, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic XHTML documents ==

All XHTML documents follow a minimal pattern for document layout:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is the document type definition (described in the previous chapter) that identifies the standard being used. 

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair is the root tag that specifies an XHTML document.  It requires two tags: the &lt;code&gt;xmlns&lt;/code&gt; is the namespace tag that restates the specific context of the standard, and is normally a URL to the W3 specification.  The &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; tag specifies the language of the document.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My Document's title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair of the document concerns the meta data of the document.  It must contain the title of the document enclosed within the &lt;code&gt;&lt;title&lt;/code&gt; tags.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair indicates the main content of the XHTML document.  Within this tag, it encloses additional sub-tags to indicate paragraphs and other formatting information that is presented to the user.

== XHTML Structure ==

Within the body of the html document, content is broken into a discrete structure.  The most common form of separation involves the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair, which marks a section of text as a paragraph.  A paragraph is a section of text, and may also also include quotes, listings or other components that are contained in nested tags.  However, it does not directly contain another paragraph. 

Headers of text are identified the numbered series ranging from &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&gt;&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h6&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  They may also be identified by &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair, in combination with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;section&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair; the sections may contain additional headers or paragraphs. 

Additional structure to the document can be created using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/code&gt;.  This tag pair is used to aid layouts within the document, and may contain additional paragraphs or headers within the container.  

To separate two parts of the document, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;separator /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is places between two paragraphs or elements. 

=== Other structure tags ===

* &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used to mark contact information, normally with the &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; attribute.
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockcode&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used to mark a block of code where whitespaced layout is important. 
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used to identify a large quotation. 
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used to identify preformatted text.

=== Inline text tags ===
A set of text within text may have tags to describe modifiers to the text.  
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Element
!Description
|-
|&amp;lt;a &lt;nowiki&gt;[href=&quot;(link)&quot; | id=&quot;#tag&quot;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &gt;
|Defines an anchor for an explicit link or tag location.  In XHTML, the &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attributes can be placed on almost any tag as desired. 
|-
|&amp;lt;abbr full=&quot;#tag&quot;&gt;
|Defines an abbreviation.  The full attribute references an id within the same document as the abbreviation.
|-
|&amp;lt;cite cite=&quot;(source)&quot;&gt;
|Provides a citiation, where the cire attribute references the source material. 
|-
|&amp;lt;code&gt;
| Refers to computer code. 
|-
|&amp;lt;dfn&gt;
| Refers to a definition
|-
|&amp;lt;em&gt;
| Puts emphasis on the text, such as italics. Less important than &amp;lt;strong&gt;.
|-
| &amp;lt;kbd&gt;
| Refers to user input.
|-
| &amp;lt;l&gt;
| Refers to a line of text.
|-
| &amp;lt;q&gt;
| Refers to quoted text, but does not add quotation marks.  May use the cite attribute. 
|-
| &amp;lt;samp&gt;
| Refers to sample output from a computer program.
|-
| &amp;lt;span&gt;
| A generic container for use with styling. 
|-
| &amp;lt;strong&gt;
| Puts emphasis on the text, such as bolding.  More important than &amp;lt;em&gt;.
|-
| &amp;lt;sub&gt;
| Indicates a subscript.
|-
| &amp;lt;sup&gt;
| Indicates a superscript.
|-
| &amp;lt;var&gt;
| Indicates a variable in a computer program. 
|}

=== Lists ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Outer list tag
! Innter list tag
! Description
|-
| &amp;lt;ol&gt;
| &amp;lt;li&gt;
| An ordered list.  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may contain a value attribute.
|-
| &amp;lt;ul&gt;
| &amp;lt;li&gt;
| An unordered list.
|-
| &amp;lt;dl&gt;
| &amp;lt;di&gt;
| A definition listing.  
|-
| &amp;lt;dl&gt; or &amp;lt;di&gt;
| &amp;lt;dt&gt;
| A word being defined.  May appear multiple times to indicate separate spellings.
|-
| &amp;lt;dl&gt; or &amp;lt;di&gt;
| &amp;lt;dd&gt;
| The definition of a word.  May appear multiple times to indicate separate definitions.
|-
| &amp;lt;nl&gt;
| &amp;lt;li&gt;
| Entry in a navigation listing. 
|-
| &amp;lt;nl&gt;
| &amp;lt;label&gt;
| A label for a navigation listing. Labels may appear in other types of lists. 
|}

== Hyperlinking ==

Hyperlinks work in XHTML in the same manner as HTML.  An &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; attribute is added to the an anchor element:
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example.com/&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In XHTML 2.0, hyperlinks be placed directly on any element without the need of an anchor tag.  As such, elements such as images can be used for a hyperlink.

=== Image maps ===

A more advanced form of hyperlinking involved navigation maps.  This requires an element to use an image, and to include the &lt;code&gt;usemap&lt;/code&gt; attribute to reference an id of a navigation map. Within the navigation list, there are two additional attributes to use: &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;coords&lt;/code&gt;.  The coordinates are comma-delimited. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! shape || Description || coords
|-
| default || Specifies the entire region. || {{n/a}}
|-
| rect || Specifies a rectangle, with the two corners. || Two X-Y coordinate pairs.
|-
| circle || Specifes a circle with a given radius. || An X-Y pair, and a radius. 
|-
| poly || Specifies an arbitrary shape. || Multiple X-Y pairs outlining the polygon.  
|}

Within the navigation list, items apparing first within the list take priority if they overlap with another entry in the navigation map.  In addition, navigation lists that do not include an href attribute will be inactive.  

If &lt;code&gt;ismap=&quot;ismap&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is used on the image attribute, the image map is treated as a server-side map.  The client will automatically append the coordinates to the URL sent to the server on this form of map (or &quot;0,0&quot; if they are unable to do so.)

== Tables ==

Tables are created in an XHTML document using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair.  A table is a grid of cells that is displayed.  

Within a table, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;col&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags are used to specify a formatting or class to a set of columns. These two tags, which allow the &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; attribute, will cause a given column of cells to obtain a specific format (such as background colour or style sheet).  

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;summary&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair is used to provide a summary of the table. This is usually a caption about the table, such as a brief description about the table itself.  

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair identifies the body of the table.  It will enclose the row and cell tags that will be described shortly.

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tr&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair identifies a row within the table.  Each pair of this tag will contain the cell definitions, whether they are a header or content cell.  

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;td&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair identifies a cell within a table.  The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;th&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair identifies a cell within a table, which is treated as a header and given emphasis.  Cells may span multiple columns or rows with the &lt;code&gt;colspan&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rowspan&lt;/code&gt; attribute.  Some cells may require uting an abbreviation, which is performed using the &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;/code&gt; attribute. 

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;thead&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair identifies the table's header. 

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tfoot&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair identifies the table's footer.

== Stylesheets ==

Style sheets give a description on how to render an XHTML document.  Style sheets are not a direct part of the XHTML standard, but are extremely important for determining the layout or display of the document.  

They are declared using an empty &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&lt;/code&gt; tag, and use the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute for the document source and &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; to specify the type of style sheet (usually &quot;text/css&quot;).  An inline style sheet omits the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute and contains the affected text within the main element.  

External stylesheets may also be included by using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml-stylesheet ?&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; showing the source and type of stylesheet. 

If desired, a style can be included directly within an HTML element using the &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; attribute.  

== Metadata ==

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair contains the initial description of the document.  In addition to the basic title, this section of the document contains metadata useful for categorizing the document.

Meta data has the following atributes available:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Attribute || Description
|-
| about
| An about URL for the page.
|-
| content
| Specifies meta data for the associated content.  By default, it uses the content within the tags.  
|-
| datatype
|-
| rel
| Used with about; specifies relationship.
|-
| property
| Identifies a property with the XHTML document (see below)
|}

Metadata also provides properties that describe additional information in the document.  When the property attribute is set to an entry in the following table, it has the following effect or result:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Property || Description 
|-
| description || Provides a description of the resource.
|-
| generator || Identifies software used to write the resource.
|-
| keywords || Comma separated list of keywords for search engines.
|-
| reference || 
|-
| robots || Advises robots on behaviour; specific to web crawlers. 
|-
| title || Specifies a title for the resource. 
|}


=== Meta hyperlinks ===

In the head tag, you can include hyperlinks to provide information about the next and previous documents.  This is done using an empty &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/code&gt; tag, with the &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rel&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

{{fsharpTitle|Caching}}

Caching is often useful to re-use data which has already been computed. F# provides a number of built-in techniques to cache data for future use.

== Partial Functions ==
F# automatically caches the value of any function which takes no parameters. When F# comes across a function with no parameters, F# will only evaluate the function once and reuse its value everytime the function is accessed. Compare the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let isNebraskaCity_bad city =
    let cities =
        printfn &quot;Creating cities Set&quot;
        [&quot;Bellevue&quot;; &quot;Omaha&quot;; &quot;Lincoln&quot;; &quot;Papillion&quot;]
        |&gt; Set.ofList
        
    cities.Contains(city)
    
let isNebraskaCity_good =
    let cities =
        printfn &quot;Creating cities Set&quot;
        [&quot;Bellevue&quot;; &quot;Omaha&quot;; &quot;Lincoln&quot;; &quot;Papillion&quot;]
        |&gt; Set.ofList
        
    fun city -&gt; cities.Contains(city)&lt;/source&gt;
	
Both functions accept and return the same values, but they have very different behavior. Here's a comparison of the output in fsi:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! isNebraskaCity_bad
! isNebraskaCity_good
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let isNebraskaCity_bad city =
    let cities =
        printfn &quot;Creating cities Set&quot;
        [&quot;Bellevue&quot;; &quot;Omaha&quot;; &quot;Lincoln&quot;; &quot;Papillion&quot;]
        |&gt; Set.of_list
        
    cities.Contains(city);;

val isNebraskaCity_bad : string -&gt; bool

&gt; isNebraskaCity_bad &quot;Lincoln&quot;;;
Creating cities Set
val it : bool = true

&gt; isNebraskaCity_bad &quot;Washington&quot;;;
Creating cities Set
val it : bool = false

&gt; isNebraskaCity_bad &quot;Bellevue&quot;;;
Creating cities Set
val it : bool = true

&gt; isNebraskaCity_bad &quot;St. Paul&quot;;;
Creating cities Set
val it : bool = false
&lt;/source&gt;

| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let isNebraskaCity_good =
    let cities =
        printfn &quot;Creating cities Set&quot;
        [&quot;Bellevue&quot;; &quot;Omaha&quot;; &quot;Lincoln&quot;; &quot;Papillion&quot;]
        |&gt; Set.of_list
        
    fun city -&gt; cities.Contains(city);;
Creating cities Set

val isNebraskaCity_good : (string -&gt; bool)

&gt; isNebraskaCity_good &quot;Lincoln&quot;;;
val it : bool = true

&gt; isNebraskaCity_good &quot;Washington&quot;;;
val it : bool = false

&gt; isNebraskaCity_good &quot;Bellevue&quot;;;
val it : bool = true

&gt; isNebraskaCity_good &quot;St. Paul&quot;;;
val it : bool = false
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The implementation of &lt;code&gt;isNebraskaCity_bad&lt;/code&gt; forces F# to re-create the internal set on each call. On the other hand, &lt;code&gt;isNebraskaCity_good&lt;/code&gt; is a value initialized to the function &lt;code&gt;fun city -&gt; cities.Contains(city)&lt;/code&gt;, so it creates its internal set once and reuses it for all successive calls.

: '''Note:''' Internally, &lt;code&gt;isNebraskaCity_bad&lt;/code&gt; is compiled as a static function which constructs a set on every call. &lt;code&gt;isNebraskaCity_good&lt;/code&gt; is compiled as a static readonly property, where the value is initialized in a static constructor.

This distinction is often subtle, but it can have a huge impact on an application's performance.

== Memoization ==
&quot;Memoization&quot; is a fancy word meaning that computed values are stored in a lookup table rather than recomputed on every successive call. Long-running pure functions (i.e. functions which have no side-effects) are good candidates for memoization. Consider the recursive definition for computing Fibonacci numbers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; #time;;

--&gt; Timing now on

&gt; let rec fib n =
    if n = 0I then 0I
    elif n = 1I then 1I
    else fib (n - 1I) + fib(n - 2I);;
Real: 00:00:00.000, CPU: 00:00:00.000, GC gen0: 0, gen1: 0, gen2: 0

val fib : Math.bigint -&gt; Math.bigint

&gt; fib 35I;;
Real: 00:00:23.557, CPU: 00:00:23.515, GC gen0: 2877, gen1: 3, gen2: 0
val it : Math.bigint = 9227465I&lt;/source&gt;

Beyond &lt;code&gt;fib 35I&lt;/code&gt;, the runtime of the function becomes unbearable. Each recursive call to the &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt; function throws away all of its intermediate calculations to &lt;code&gt;fib(n - 1I)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fib(n - 2I)&lt;/code&gt;, giving it a runtime complexity of about O(2^n). What if we kept all of those intermediate calculations around in a lookup table? Here's the memoized version of the &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; #time;;

--&gt; Timing now on

&gt; let rec fib =
    let dict = new System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&lt;_,_&gt;()
    fun n -&gt;
        match dict.TryGetValue(n) with
        | true, v -&gt; v
        | false, _ -&gt; 
            let temp =
                if n = 0I then 0I
                elif n = 1I then 1I
                else fib (n - 1I) + fib(n - 2I)
            dict.Add(n, temp)
            temp;;

val fib : (Math.bigint -&gt; Math.bigint)

&gt; fib 35I;;
Real: 00:00:00.000, CPU: 00:00:00.000, GC gen0: 0, gen1: 0, gen2: 0
val it : Math.bigint = 9227465I&lt;/source&gt;

Much better! This version of the &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt; function runs almost instaneously. In fact, since we only calculate the value of any &lt;code&gt;fib(n)&lt;/code&gt; precisely once, and dictionary lookups are an &lt;code&gt;O(1)&lt;/code&gt; operation, this fib function runs in O(n) time.

Notice all of the memoization logic is contained in the &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt; function. We can write a more general function to memoize any function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let memoize f =
    let dict = new System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&lt;_,_&gt;()
    fun n -&gt;
        match dict.TryGetValue(n) with
        | (true, v) -&gt; v
        | _ -&gt;
            let temp = f(n)
            dict.Add(n, temp)
            temp
            
let rec fib = memoize(fun n -&gt;
    if n = 0I then 0I
    elif n = 1I then 1I
    else fib (n - 1I) + fib (n - 2I) )&lt;/source&gt;
	
: '''Note:''' Its very important to remember that the implementation above is not thread-safe -- the dictionary should be locked before adding/retrieving items if it will be accessed by multiple threads.

: Additionally, although dictionary lookups occur in constant time, the hash function used by the dictionary can take an arbitrarily long time to execute (this is especially true with strings, where the time it takes to hash a string is proportional to its length). For this reason, it is wholly possible for a memoized function to have less performance than an unmemoized function. Always profile code to determine whether optimization is necessary and whether memoization genuinely improves performance.

== Lazy Values ==

The F# &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; data type is an interesting primitive which delays evaluation of a value until the value is actually needed. Once computed, lazy values are cached for reuse later:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let x = lazy(printfn &quot;I'm lazy&quot;; 5 + 5);;

val x : Lazy&lt;int&gt; = &lt;unevaluated&gt;

&gt; x.Force();; (* Should print &quot;I'm lazy&quot; *)
I'm lazy
val it : int = 10

&gt; x.Force();; (* Value already computed, should not print &quot;I'm lazy&quot; again *)
val it : int = 10&lt;/source&gt;

F# uses some compiler magic to avoid evaluating the expression &lt;code&gt;(printfn &quot;I'm lazy&quot;; 5 + 5)&lt;/code&gt; on declaration. Lazy values are probably the simplest form of caching, however they can be used to create some interesting and sophisticated data structures. For example, two F# data structures are implemented on top of lazy values, namely the F#
[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/fsharp.powerpack/microsoft.fsharp.collections.lazylist.html Lazy List] and &lt;code&gt;Seq.cache&lt;/code&gt; method.

Lazy lists and cached sequences represent arbitrary sequences of potentially infinite numbers of elements. The elements are computed and cached the first time they are accessed, but will not be recomputed when the sequence is enumerated again. Here's a demonstration in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let x = seq { for a in 1 .. 10 -&gt; printfn &quot;Got %i&quot; a; a } |&gt; Seq.cache;;

val x : seq&lt;int&gt;

&gt; let y = Seq.take 5 x;;

val y : seq&lt;int&gt;

&gt; Seq.reduce (+) y;;
Got 1
Got 2
Got 3
Got 4
Got 5
val it : int = 15

&gt; Seq.reduce (+) y;; (* Should not recompute values *)
val it : int = 15

&gt; Seq.reduce (+) x;; (* Values 1 through 5 already computed, should only compute 6 through 10 *)
Got 6
Got 7
Got 8
Got 9
Got 10
val it : int = 55&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===First aid===
Snakebite first aid recommendations vary, in part because different snakes have different types of venom. Some have little local effect, but life-threatening systemic effects, in which case containing the venom in the region of the bite by pressure immobilization is highly desirable. Other venoms instigate localized tissue damage around the bitten area, and immobilization may increase the severity of the damage in this area, but also reduce the total area affected; whether this trade-off is desirable remains a point of controversy.

Because snakes vary from one country to another, first aid methods also vary. As always, this article is not a legitimate substitute for professional medical advice. Readers are strongly advised to obtain guidelines from a reputable first aid organization in their own region, and to be wary of homegrown or anecdotal remedies.

However, most first aid guidelines agree on the following:

#Protect the patient (and others, including yourself) from further bites. While identifying the species is desirable in certain regions, do not risk further bites or delay proper medical treatment by attempting to capture or kill the snake. If the snake has not already fled, carefully remove the victim from the immediate area.  If possible, take a photograph of the snake (many cell phones are equipped with cameras).  If you do not know what type of snake it is, someone else might be able to identify it from the photo.  A poor photo is better than no photo.
#Keep the victim calm. Acute stress reaction increases blood flow and endangers the patient. Keep people near the patient calm. Panic is infectious and compromises judgment.
#Call for help to arrange for transport to the nearest hospital emergency room, where antivenin for snakes common to the area will often be available.
#Make sure to keep the bitten limb in a functional position and below the victim's heart level so as to minimize blood returning to the heart and other organs of the body.
#Do not give the patient anything to eat or drink. This is especially important with consumable alcohol, a known vasodilator which will speed up the absorption of venom. Do not administer stimulants or pain medications to the victim, unless specifically directed to do so by a physician.
#Remove any items or clothing which may constrict the bitten limb if it swells (rings, bracelets, watches, footwear, etc.)
#Keep the victim as still as possible.
#Do not incise the bitten site.

Many organizations, including the American Medical Association and American Red Cross, recommend washing the bite with soap and water. However, do not attempt to clean the area with any type of chemical. Australian recommendations for snake bite treatment strongly recommend against cleaning the wound. Traces of venom left on the skin/bandages from the strike can be used in combination with a snake bite identification kit to identify the species of snake. This speeds determination of which antivenin to administer in the emergency room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usyd.edu.au/anaes/venom/snakebite.html |title=Treatment of Australian Snake Bites |author=Chris Thompson |work=Australian anaesthetists' website |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Runtime Structure of a Program ==

Before diving into the content of this chapter, let us review the organization of memory at program execution time. This chapter will involve some low-level components of computer architecture, so familiarizing oneself with some basic concepts ahead of time will be required. Moreover, these concepts will be required for later chapters as well. Let's get them out of the way here.

=== Segments ===

Most C programs have the following components in their memory space:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;text area,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a store of static and global variables,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the machine stack,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the heap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The text area is where the code is stored. The second component should be clear. The machine stack is where functions' arguments and local variables are stacked. The heap is what is allocated by &lt;code&gt;malloc()&lt;/code&gt;.

Let's discuss the machine stack in detail. Being called a machine &quot;stack&quot;, it obviously has a stack-like construction. In other words, we can keep adding new elements to the top. In practice values are added to the stack in individual &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; units but conceptually there is a larger unit called the &lt;em&gt;stack frame&lt;/em&gt;.

Each stack frame corresponds to one function call. In other words, each function call will add one stack frame and a stack frame is taken off on &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;. If we extremely simplify this, the machine stack could look like Figure 1.

&lt;pre&gt;
 the top
+-------------+
| stack frame | &lt;-- the frame for the currently running function
+-------------+
| stack frame |
+-------------+
| stack frame |
+-------------+
| stack frame |
+-------------+
| stack frame |
+-------------+
 the bottom
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: The machine stack&lt;/b&gt;

In this figure we marked the extreme end of the stack &quot;the top,&quot; but the machine stacks does not necessarily address frames from low to high. For example on x86 machines the stack grows from higher addresses to lower ones.

=== &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt; ===

With &lt;code&gt;malloc()&lt;/code&gt; memory of arbitrary size can be allocated. &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt; is the machine stack version of this. However, memory allocated by &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt; does not need to be deallocated. Or, rather, it may be better to say that that the memory &quot;gets&quot; deallocated with the function's &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;. Thus &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt;-allocated values cannot be used as a function's &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; value. This is the same as saying &quot;pointers to local variables cannot be returned.&quot;

All this is fine. It basically means that we can locally allocate arrays which change in length dynamically.

However there are environments where there is no native &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt;. Many would prefer to use an &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt; in those environments as well, so a function with the same behavior could be written in C. In this case, however, it may only be implemented to &quot;not require deallocation,&quot; but may not necessarily be allocating memory on the machine stack. In fact, it normally would not do this. If it could do that, there may as well be a native implementation of &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt;.

How can we implement &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt; in C? The most straight-forward implementation first allocates memory with &lt;code&gt;malloc()&lt;/code&gt;. It then stores the caller function and the allocated address on a global list. Then the next time &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt; is called, if there is any memory that was allocated for a function which has already concluded, it can be &lt;code&gt;free()&lt;/code&gt;'ed (see Figure 2).

&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: The behavior of a C implementation of &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Ruby's &lt;code&gt;missing/alloca.c&lt;/code&gt; is an implementation of just such an emulated &lt;code&gt;alloca()&lt;/code&gt;.

== Outline ==

Now let's begin the main subject of this chapter, garbage collection.

=== Introducing GC ===

=== What GC does ===

=== Mark &amp; sweep ===

=== Sweep &amp; copy ===

=== Reference counting ===

== Object management ==

=== &lt;code&gt;struct RVALUE&lt;/code&gt; ===

=== Object heap ===

=== &lt;code&gt;freelist&lt;/code&gt; ===

=== &lt;code&gt;add_heap()&lt;/code&gt; ===

=== &lt;code&gt;rb_newobj()&lt;/code&gt; ===

== Mark ==

=== &lt;code&gt;rb_gc_mark()&lt;/code&gt; ===

=== &lt;code&gt;rb_gc_mark_children()&lt;/code&gt; ===

=== &lt;code&gt;rb_gc()&lt;/code&gt; ===

=== The Ruby stack ===

=== Registers ===

==== &lt;code&gt;mark_locations_array()&lt;/code&gt; ====

==== &lt;code&gt;is_pointer_to_heap()&lt;/code&gt; ====

==== Register windows ====

=== The machine stack ===

==== &lt;code&gt;Init_stack()&lt;/code&gt; ====

==== &lt;code&gt;STACK_END&lt;/code&gt; ====

==== &lt;code&gt;rb_gc_mark_locations()&lt;/code&gt; ====

=== Other root objects ===

== Sweep ==

=== Special &lt;code&gt;NODE&lt;/code&gt; handling ===

=== The finalizer ===

=== &lt;code&gt;rb_gc_force_recycle()&lt;/code&gt; ===

== Considerations ==

=== Memory deallocation ===

=== Generations of GC ===

=== Compaction ===

=== The &lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt; keyword in GC ===

== Initialization codeflow ==

=== &lt;code&gt;gc.c&lt;/code&gt; internals ===

=== Interpreter internals ===

== Object Creation ==

=== The allocation framework ===

=== User-defined object creation ===

==== &lt;code&gt;Data_Wrap_Struct()&lt;/code&gt; ====

==== &lt;code&gt;Data_Get_Struct()&lt;/code&gt; ====

=== Problems with the allocation framework ===

== Consider including catalog.xml ==

While not difficult to visualize what books/book in catalog.xml might look like, it could be beneficial for those individuals who are using the example to learn if an explicit snippet of books/book was included.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The letter '''aliph''' (sometimes also Latinised '''aleph''' or '''alif''') is the first letter in the [[Urdu]] alphabet. The sound of the letter is that of an ‘a’ or ‘u’ in the English language especially as used in the words ‘&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;rt’ or ‘&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;mbrella’. The voice is usually dependant on the context this letter is used in. For Urdu, this letter was borrowed from the Arabic language where also is serves as the first letter in the alphabet.

      <comment>class=&quot;wikitable&quot; for {{prettytable}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In HTML, objects could only be attached to specific image tags or object tags.  This changed with XHTML, where these images or resources can be attached to almost any tag. 

== Images ==

Images can be explicitly specified with the &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; tag.  XHTML also provides the ability to attach images to &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; tags as described blow.  A significant change from [[HTML]] is that there is no longer an alt attribute to describe the image if it cannot load; instead, the content enclosed within the tag pair (if any) is displayed if the resource cannot be loaded. 

The &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute contains a URL to the resource in question.  If the resource can be loaded, it replaces the tag with the object itself.  Otherwise, the content within the tags is displayed instead.  This attribute is used in combination with &lt;code&gt;srctype&lt;/code&gt;, which provides information about the resource in question.  Typically, it may appear as &quot;image/png&quot; or &quot;image/jpeg&quot;. 

The &lt;code&gt;encoding&lt;/code&gt; attribute identifies the character set of the resource, if it is a text document.  

An image can also be used as a navigation map with the &lt;code&gt;usemap&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which refers to an id of a navigation list within the element.  The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/code&gt; tags within the navigation list will have the &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;coords&lt;/code&gt; elements to specify the details of the navigation map. 

== Objects ==

Arbitrary objects within XHTML are declared by the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;object&lt;/code&gt; tag.  The object itself is loaded from the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute.  If the object is loaded successfully, it will be loaded with the parameters enclosed within the object tag.  However, a failure will cause the enclosed to be rendered instead.

The following attributes are used:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Attribute || Description 
|-
| src 
| The source of the object.
|-
| srctype
| The type of object, such as &quot;image/png&quot;, &quot;audio/mpeg&quot;, or &quot;application/x-java-applet&quot;. Other types are possible. 
|-
| id
| A unique identifier for the object, if applicable. 
|-
| archive
| Provides additional URLs which are related to the object.
|-
| content-length
| Provides the size of the object in question.
|-
| declare=&quot;declare&quot;
| If present, causes the object to be loaded after the document finished loading. 
|}


=== Parameters ===
Within the object tag, parameters can be included to provide information to the loaded object.

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;param&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag uses two base attributes; &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; which is the name of the parameter, and &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; which is the content of the parameter. In addition, the param tag can also use &lt;code&gt;valuetype&lt;/code&gt; if the parameter's value is a reference (ref) or object (object).  Be default, the value type of the parameter is ''data''.

=== Standby ===
Content within a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;standby&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is displayed when an object is loading, but hasn't yet finished. 

== Scripting objects ==

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;handler&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag indicates a script that handles events within the document.  If the browser is unable to load the handler, it will process the content enclosed within the handler tag pair instead, including additional nested handler elements. 

With the handler element, the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; attribute is mandatory.  It describes the scripting language used, such as &quot;text/javascript&quot;.

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

I've got a couple of quibbles about this lesson.  Since I'm new here, I thought I'd air them on the talk page before messing with the lesson itself.

1) This lesson uses the word &quot;particle&quot; in a way that is (at best) very nonstandard.  In my experience &quot;particle&quot; always refers to a separate word, not an ending attached to another word, like both English &quot;-s&quot; and Sumerian &quot;-ene&quot;.  These are correctly termed &quot;affixes&quot;, not &quot;particles&quot;.

2) I haven't looked ahead, but I don't see any suggestion in this lesson that Sumerian didn't make plurals out of non-person nouns.  Whether this will come up in future lessons or not, it's fairly misleading to use &quot;cats&quot; as an example of a plural, when in fact Sumerian couldn't create an equivalent form.  Why not, e.g., &quot;sisters&quot; or &quot;kings&quot;?

3) The lesson says that the conjunction ''u'' was borrowed from Akkadian &quot;only much later in the life of the language&quot;, but Thomsen (p. 83) says it is &quot;found already in a text from Abu Salabikh ca. 2500 B.C.&quot;  Since the majority of texts date from later than this, it's hard to see how it qualifies as &quot;much later in the life&quot; of the language.

== Responses to queries from user &quot;Enlil&quot; ==

Hello Enlil! Glad you're finding the grammar interesting enough to keep reading :) To answer some of your questions:

1) The general usage of &quot;particle&quot; is actually quite flexible in linguistics, and changes sometimes pretty dramatically from language to language. In agglutinative languages, like Turkish or Sumerian, particles are regular affixed directly to the word chain, whereas in English or Japanese, particles are most often treated as separate words. So your intuition is correct - for most people interested in grammar, particles usually do mean separate words. In this particular case, though, Sumerologists have been using the term to mean affixes. Just a convention, and it doesn't really impact the grammar, just the way we talk about it. Thanks for pointing out the potential for confusion, though! ''[I have noticed that D Foxvog doesn't use the term quite as much as D O Edzard, so there may be a shift happening here - we can always change the verbiage if the Sumerologist community moves that way.]''

2) Actually, there are quite a few ways to make plurals out of non-person nouns - reduplication jumps immediately to mind. I will have another lesson to address all this stuff, probably based loosely on D O Edzard's treatment of the topic, which I thought was really clear and informative. Plurality is a pretty complex topic in Sumerian, as I gather you're already aware!, so I thought I'd introduce it later. If you'd like to start a lesson, though, please '''don't even hesitate'''! That's what the spirit of a wiki is all about :) We can all contribute to your core content once it's in place, even if you leave large sections unstarted or very rough. Just having the outline there usually makes people more inclined to contribute, at least I find that that's how it works for me.

3) Remember, Sumerian had already been around for 1000 years by that time! Think how different Beowulf-style English was to current English :) That being said, to my understanding '''u''' didn't really get super popular until Ur III at least - maybe 2100 BCE. Now, my info is several years out of date on this issue - if you're more confident than I am about the timeframe here, please '''by all means make the edit'''! I would love for this grammar to be as complete and correct as possible, and with the rapid pace of changes and new discoveries in Sumerian, it will be utterly impossible for one person to keep up with every change as it comes.

Thanks very much for so carefully reading and commenting on the text here. I really love when people comment on stuff - it makes me want to write new lessons and fix up the old ones to clarify any issues that are raised. I'll look into making some of these particular issues more clear in the texts shortly. In the mean time, I added a lesson nine on cuneiform - the history of cuneiform isn't my strongest topic, so please feel free to change anything if I've made any blatant errors.

Glad you're part of the community, Enlil :)

== to &quot;Mike the kitty&quot; ==

Thanks for the welcome.  I've taken you up on the suggestion to make changes myself, though for now in this lesson I've only touched &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;cats&quot;, turning them into &quot;king&quot; and &quot;kings&quot;.  You're absolutely right that there were ways of signaling plurality on non-person nouns, but .ene wasn't (to the best of my knowledge) one of them, and as these paragraphs make an implicit comparison between English -s and Sumerian .ene, I thought it might be best to stick to a word whose Sumerian equivalent would be likely to take .ene.

I'm not sure what to think about the word &quot;particle&quot;.  I checked my copy of Edzard's grammar, and he indeed uses that word for the various case affixes.  I don't know why I didn't notice that before.  So you may well be right that this term has a different usage when it comes to agglutinative languages.  Still, I'm bothered by the disconnect between the statement that linguists call English -s a particle, and the link to a Wikipedia page that clearly states that a particle is a word.  If you want to stick with the word &quot;particle&quot;, then maybe there should be at least some sort of disclaimer that this is a specialized use of the word in the Sumerological community and not the practice of linguists in general.

Regarding &quot;u&quot;, I'm happy to leave your statement alone.  The question may be whether you're looking at the written language or the spoken language.  The Abu Salabikh texts date from about the middle of the third millennium, is roughly halfway between the invention of writing and the death of the spoken language.  Since all we have today are the texts, I think it's fair to say that &quot;u&quot; came in fairly early in the history of written Sumerian, especially if the vast majority of preserved texts date from after the borrowing.  But it's also fair to say that it came in fairly late in the history of the spoken language.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Case study in psychology''' refers to the use of a [[descriptive research]] approach to obtain an in-depth analysis of a person, group, or phenomenon. A variety of techniques may be employed including personal interviews, [[direct-observation]], [[psychometric tests]], and archival records. In psychology case studies are most often used in [[clinical]] research to describe rare events and conditions, which contradict well established principles in the field of [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen&quot;&gt;Christensen, L. B. (1994).“Experimental methodology&quot;( 6th ed).,Simon &amp; Schuster:Needham Heights, MA. ISBN 978-0-205-15506-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Case studies are generally a single-case design, but can also be a multiple-case design, where [[reproducibility|replication]] instead of [[Sampling (case studies)|sampling]] is the criterion for inclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yin&quot;&gt;Yin, R.(1994). “Case study research: Design and methods” (2nd ed.).Sage Publishing:Beverly Hills, CA. ISBN 978-0-7619-2553-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other research methodologies within psychology, the case study must produce [[valid]] and [[reliable]] results in order to be useful for the development of future research. Distinct advantages and disadvantages are associated with the case study in psychology. 
==Advantages==
One major advantage of the case study in psychology is the potential for the development of novel [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] for later testing. Second, the case study can provide detailed descriptions of specific and rare cases.

==Disadvantages==
The major disadvantages of the case study in psychology is the inability to draw [[Causality|cause and effect]] relationships or test hypotheses. Further, with the case study it is impossible to generalize the findings to a wider population.&lt;ref name=Christensen/&gt; 

==Famous case studies in psychology==
*[[Phineas Gage]]
*[[Freud]] and [[Little Hans]]
*[[John Money]] and the [[John/Joan case]]
*[[Genie (feral child)]]
*[[Piaget's studies]]
*[[Washoe (sign language)]]

      <comment>/* Throwing objects: catch by value */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Throw Declarations ==
A nice future enhancement to this section would be to discuss throw declarations in function signatures: what they mean,
how to use them, and disadvantages of using them. [[User:Jlenthe|Jlenthe]] ([[User talk:Jlenthe|talk]]) 13:26, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

== Unhandled exceptions ==

&quot;Unhandled exceptions on the other hand will result in a function termination and the stack will be unwound '''(allocated objects will have destructors called)''' [...]&quot;

This is not true (at least for g++).

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Test
{
public:
	Test() { std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;ctor called&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; std::cerr.flush(); }
	~Test() { std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;dtor called&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; std::cerr.flush(); }

	void aaargh() { throw &quot;aaargh!&quot;; }
};

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	Test t;
	
	t.aaargh();

	return 0;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

results in following output:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ g++ test.c
$ ./a.out 
ctor called
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'char const*'
Aborted
$ g++ --version
g++ (Debian 4.3.2-1.1) 4.3.2
&lt;/pre&gt;

Obviously the destructor is '''not''' called.
It seems as if the elements on the stack only get cleanly deallocated iff there is a try-catch-block:

&lt;pre&gt;
int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	try
	{
		Test t;

		t.aaargh();
	}
	catch(...)
	{
		throw;
	}

	return 0;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

results in following output:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ g++ test.c
$ ./a.out 
ctor called
dtor called
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'char const*'
Aborted
&lt;/pre&gt;

: The ISO rules are a bit more complicated than what is written here. If an exception goes completely uncaught even in the main() function, the program is terminated. Whether the stack is unwound and destructors called before termination in that situation is implementation defined. The results you see is within the ISO rules. Unwinding of &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; happens and the destructor called in the second example because the uncaught exception in the aaargh() function is caught in the main() function. Also &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; is constructed within the try block and before the try block jumps to the catch &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; is destroyed if I've understood the ISO standard correctly. You might get different results if you print a message before ''throw'' in the catch handler depending on whether t is constructed before or in the try block as well:
: int main() { Test t; try { t.aaargh(); } catch(...) { std:cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;caught exception&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; std::cerr.flush(); } }
: int main() { try { Test t; t.aaargh(); } catch(...) { std:cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;caught exception&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; std::cerr.flush(); } }

== empty throw ==

There was a comment in the original text which says &quot;An empty throw can only exist in a catch block&quot;
This is Not true . You can also put empty throw in try block. But be careful !
For example this empty throw is not catch-able hence useless 
&lt;pre&gt;int main()
{
   try{
      throw ;
   }catch(...){
      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;What do you think you are doing ?? &quot; ;
   }
   return 0 ;
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;bash&gt;&gt; g++ exceptionClasses.cpp 
bash&gt;&gt; ./a.out 
terminate called without an active exception
Abort&lt;/pre&gt;

One usage would be to re-use empty throw based function to catch some other function's exception and forward e.g. extending above example


&lt;pre&gt;void mymain(){
   try{
      throw ;
   }catch(...){
      cout &lt;&lt; &quot; What do you think you are doing ??  &quot; ; 
   }
}

int main(){
   try {
      throw &quot;May be this makes sense !&quot; ;
   }catch(const char * str){
      cout &lt;&lt; str &lt;&lt; endl  ;
      mymain() ; 
   }
   return 0 ;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;bash&gt;&gt;./a.out 
 May be this makes sense !  
 What do you think you are doing ??&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Manish baphna|Manish baphna]] ([[User talk:Manish baphna|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Manish baphna|contribs]]) .&lt;/small&gt;

: You are partially correct. The standard does not forbid an empty throw from being placed anywhere. According to the standard an empty throw has the effect of throwing the most recently caught exception that hasn't finished being processed. I believe this is seen in your second example. In the mymain() function I believe the throw results in &quot;May be this makes sense !&quot; being rethrown and caught because that was in the middle of a catch that hadn't finished being processed. However the standard also says the program is to be terminated if there is no active exception currently being caught, which is what is seen in the first example. The only reason the throw isn't caught is because the program is terminated due to there being no active exceptions. This could be interpreted to mean that an empty throw can exist outside of any try-catch block too, but doing so results in program termination, just as the first example did: &lt;code&gt;int main() { throw; return 0; }&lt;/code&gt;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:08, 22 October 2010 (UTC)

== Java references ==
C++ is not Java. It shouldn't be compared to Java. There are nearly countless OOP languages out there (vm'd and natively compiled) that C++ ''could'' be compared to, but it's not. Let's not start. That's a slippery slope of, &quot;Oh, let's teach [Insert language here] developers how to program in C++ by comparison.&quot; I went ahead and removed references.
[[User:Prime|Prime]] ([[User talk:Prime|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Prime|contribs]])

:We have a section for that sort of comparisons that will always crop up. Can you check out Java section of the book and see if what you removed here is correctly demonstrated there ? Thanks. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:06, 5 June 2011 (UTC)

== Throwing objects: catch by value ==

&quot;But now, the catch handler that catches the exception, does it by value, meaning that a copy constructor is called. '''This can cause the program to crash if the exception caught was a bad_alloc caused by insufficient memory.'''&quot;

Are you sure about this? Catching the exception by value means that the copy is created on the stack, not on the heap. IIRC, only &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; can throw &lt;code&gt;bad_alloc&lt;/code&gt;.

Not all bibliographies need to be appended to books. Sometimes they are created as scholarly resources. I could perhaps point to Shafer's Bibliography of Sino-Tibetan Languages, or Stary's bibliography of Manchu studies. This is the intention of this book. In fact two such books have already been published as you can see in the entries under Arakawa and Kwanten. Much of it is not in English because much of Tangut studies is not done in English. You will notice that all Chinese and Japanese are transliterated into the standard anglophone systems (Pinyin and modified Hepburn respectively) and that many of the entries have English translations (the intention is to have translations for all Chinese and Japanese and maybe Russian, one assumes that most educated people know French and German, or at least one assumes that in works like this). [[User:Tibetologist|Tibetologist]] ([[User talk:Tibetologist|talk]]) 13:54, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

This is a valuable resource, and should not be deleted. Just because many of the works referenced are not in English does not mean that the bibliography itself is not in English, so the argument that it is not appropriate for English WikiBooks is not valid. [[User:BabelStone|BabelStone]] ([[User talk:BabelStone|talk]]) 16:54, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

:::agreed. This would actually be suitable for any language wikibooks: multilingual material has to go  ''somewhere''.[[User:DGG|DGG]] ([[User talk:DGG|talk]]) 20:56, 22 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Digestion and Absorption==
===Overview===
Digestion of food  breaks  the large molecules into smaller molecules suitable for absorbing in the ''small intestine''. This takes place either both in the lumen of the canal in the chyme and  at the epithelial junction of the cells of the small intestine.

The surface area for absorption is greatly increased by the '''christal folds''' and the villi of the small intestine (see anatomy), and the '''microvilli''' of the epithelial cells them selves, which form the '''brush border'''.

As was mentioned in the secretion section, if digestive secretions of the small intestine are collected free of cell debris then no enzymes are seen. We now know that the small intestine enzymes are anchored in the apical (lumen) margin of the epithelial cell ('''enterocyte'''), in the brush border. This prevents them from being washed down stream with the chyme

The Enterocyte is specialized for absorption of food stuffs, it is divided into an '''apical''' or '''lumenal''' surface where the final digestion and absorption takes place, and a '''basal/lateral''' surface surface where the products of digestion are passed into the interstitial fluid. The transport mechanisms at these two surfaces are quite different. The apical surface is characterized by numerous microvilli which greatly increase the surface area available for absorption. Adjacent to this is an '''unstirred layer''' of mucous that the products of digestion must penetrate before being absorbed.

The junctions between the cells is very tight, and no leakage takes place. At the walls at the base of the cells there is a space continuous with the interstitial space.

The enzymes of the small intestine consist of several peptidases; several enzymes for splitting disaccharides into monosaccharides, and a lipase. These enzymes operate while the substrates are being ''absorbed'' through the epithelium.

In this chapter we  will look at the digestive mechanisms of food stuffs, and then at the mechanics of how the products are absorbed into the body.

===Carbohydrate Digestion===
Carbohydrates are digested by salivary and pancreatic enzymes ('''α-amylases''') and by numerous '''oligosaccharidases''' of the small intestine wall. The following table shows the enzymes that operate on starch:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table Showing Nucleic Acid Digesting Enzymes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Source&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Enzyme&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Activated by&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Substrate&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Functions and/or Products&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saliva&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Salivary α-amylase (Ptyalin)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Cl-&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Starch&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Hydrolyses non-terminal α1:4 linkages to produce dextrins, maltotriose, and maltose&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pancreas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Pancreatic α-amylase (Ptyalin)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Cl-&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Starch&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Hydrolyses non-terminal α1:4 linkages to produce dextrins, maltotriose, and maltose&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td rowspan='5'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small Intestine mucosa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Glucose&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Maltase &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Maltose, maltotriose, α-dextrins &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Glucose&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Lactase &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Lactose&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Glucose and Galactose&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Sucrase &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Sucrose, maltose, maltotriose&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Glucose&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;α-Dextrinase &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;α-dextrins, maltose, maltotriose&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Glucose&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Trehalase &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Trehalose&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Glucose&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
 

The amylase  of the salivary gland (a.k.a.'''Ptyalin''') is inactivated by stomach acid, but when food enters the stomach it is first stored in the fundus of the stomach and not mixed with acid, so ptyalin can carry on acting until  mixing with stomach acid takes place, which can be sometime. By some estimates up to a third of the carbohydrates are reduced to polysaccharides by the time the chyme leaves the stomach. The other two thirds are digested by pancreatic amylase. 

Carbohydrates are taken in in mainly the form of plant carbohydrate ('''amylose''') and animal carbohydrate ('''glycogen''') together with some sugars, mainly disaccharides . In the western diet about 80% is in the form of amylose. Amylose is not highly branched and consists mainly of long chains of glucose linked by '''α1:4 linkages'''. Cellulose, the most abundant starch in nature, is formed of β1:4 linkages and cannot be digested in humans, although bacterial action in the colon does breakdown a minute amount.

Glycogen is a multi-branched starch with linkages at the 1:4 and 1:6 position.

[[File:Glycogen bonds.png]]

This gives very large granules of multi-branched starch.

[[File:Glycogen chain.png]]

Both the parotid and pancreatic amylases '''hydrolyse''' the 1:4 link, but not the terminal 1:4 links or the 1:6 links. This breaks amylose down into mainly disaccharides, and glycogen with its 1:6 linkages into polysaccharides.

[[File:Amylase hydrolysisl 1-4.png|300px]]

The net result of these actions are numerous disaccharides and polysaccharides. These are broken down into monosaccharides by the enzymes attached to the enterocycytes of the small intestine, as illustrated below:

[[File:Small intestine sugar enzymes.png]]

===Carbohydrate Absorption===
Glucose is transported from the lumen into the cell by a sodium linked co-transporter or symport (SGLT) and is thus highly dependent on the concentration of sodium in the lumen. Galactose uses the same mechanism. (see section on cell membrane transport for further details)

[[File:Na glu transport.png]]

Fructose uses a different mechanism, a facilitated diffusion carrier and is sodium independent.

Glucose is carried across the baso-lateral membrane by a facilitated diffusion carrier.

[[File:Absorb sugars.png|350px]]

The sugars are absorbed in the capillaries and carried to the liver.

===Protein  Digestion===
Proteins and polypeptides are digested by hydrolysis of the C-N bond. 

[[File:Amino acid4.png|250px]]

The proteolytic enzymes are all secreted in an inactive form, to prevent auto-digestion, and are activated in the lumen of the gut: by HCl in the case of the stomach '''pepsinogen'''; by '''enteropeptidase''' and '''trypsin''' in the case of the pancreatic enzymes. This was discussed in the section on secretions. Final digestion takes place by small intestine enzymes embedded in the brush border of the small intestine.

The enzymes are divided into '''endo-''' and '''exo'''-peptidases. The '''endopeptidases''' cleave the polypeptide at the interior peptide bonds, the '''exopeptidases''' cleave the terminal amino acid. Exopeptidases are further subclassified into '''aminopeptidases''' - which cleave off the terminal amino acid at the amine end of the chain, and '''carboxypeptidases''' which cleave off the terminal amino acid at the carboxyl end of the chain. This is illustrated graphically here:


[[File:Peptidase actions.png]]

Stomach pepsin cleaves interior bonds of the amino acids, and is particularly important for its ability to digest collagen. This is a major constituent of connective tissue of meat. In the absence of stomach pepsin, digestion in the small intestine proceeds with difficulty. Stomach pepsin digests about 20% of the proteins, the rest is digested by pancreatic and small intestine enzymes.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;Trypsin&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;Cleaves peptide bonds on carboxyl terminal amino acids with aliphatic or aromatic side chains &lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;Carboxypeptidase B (procarboxypeptidase B)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Trypsin&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Proteins and Polypeptides&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Cleaves peptide bonds on carboxyl terminal amino acids with basic side chains &lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign='top' rowspan='5'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Small Intestine mucosa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;Trypsinogen&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Trypsin&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;Carboxypeptidases&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Endopeptidases&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Polypeptides&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Cleaves mid portions of peptide&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dipeptidases&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dipeptides&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; ----&gt; two amino acids&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
'''^ Aromatic''' amino acids are amino acids which include an aromatic ring. They include phenylalanine, histidine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.

'''^^ Basic''' amino acids  are polar and positively charged at pH values below their pKa's, and are very hydrophilic. They include histadine, lysine and argenine.

'''^^^ Aliphatic''' implies that the protein side chain contains only carbon or hydrogen atoms.

===Protein Absorption===
Several different transport systems transport amino acids into the enterocyte, each dealing with different groups of amino acids. Most of these are sodium dependent co-transporters. Di-peptides and tri-peptites are transported by a H+ ion dependent co-transporter. In the cell the poly-peptides may be reduced to amino acids, or they may be carried across the cell intact.

They are transported across the baso-lateral border by both co-transporters and and facilitated transporters.

[[File:Absorb peptides.png]]

Some large peptides or proteins can be carried across the cell by transcytosis. this is particularly true in small children, and is a mechanism whereby the imunoglobulines in mothers milk can be transfered to the child. The enterocytes that do this are probably situated in the Crypts of Lieberkuhn, indeed in infants the openings to the pits are much wider than in older children and adults.

this mechanism also operates, but to a lesser extent in adults.

===Fats &amp; Cholesterol Digestion===
Fats are digested by '''Lipases''' which hydrolyze the glycerol-fatty acid bonds. Of particular importance in fat digestion and absorption are bile salts which emulsify the fats allowing for their solution as '''micelles''' in chyme, and increasing the surface are on which the pancreatic lipases can operate. 

Lipases are found in the mouth; the stomach; and the pancreas. Because the lingual lipase was inactivated by stomach acid, it was formally believed to be mainly present for oral hygiene and for its anti-bacterial effect in the mouth, however, it can continue to operate on food stored in the fundus of the stomach, and as much as 30% of the fats can be digested by this lipase. Gastric lipase is of little importance in humans. Pancreatic lipase accounts for the majority of fat digestion, and operates in conjuction with the bile salts.

The following table shows the fat digesting enzymes:
&lt;table cellpadding='10' style='margin:20px' border='1' rules='rows'&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table Showing Fat Digesting Enzymes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Source&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Enzyme&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Activated by&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Substrate&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Functions and/or Products&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Lingual Lipase &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Triglycerides&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Fatty Acids and 1,2-diglycerides&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stomach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Gastric Lipase &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Triglycerides&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Fatty Acids and glycerol (Not of great importance in humans)&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pancreas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Pancreatic Lipase &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Triglycerides&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Monoglycerides and Fatty Acids&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

====Bile Salts====
Bile salts are secreted by the liver, and have a '''hydrophopic''' and a '''hydrophilic''' side. These will attach to fat globules, emulsifying them, and causing them to form '''micelles'''. 
 
[[File:Lipid and bile salts.svg]]

The anatomy of a micelle is shown in the following illustration, together with the biochemical structure of a bile salt.

[[File:Micelle bile acid.png]]

Micelles are small, and because they have they hydrophilic side externally, they effectively allow the fats to act like water soluble particles. This allows them to penetrate the '''unstirred layer''' adjacent to the small intestine epithelium, and to be absorbed.

[[File:Micelle fat absorption.png|300px]]

In the absence of bile salts very few fatty acids make it through this layer and much of the fat will pass through the gut undigested and unabsorbed causing '''steatorrhea''' (fatty stool).

===Fats &amp; Cholesterol Absorption===
The micelles enable the fatty acids and cholesterol to cross the unstirred layer and come in contact with the brush border, where they easily cross the fat-soluble cell membrane. A few smaller free fatty acids transfuse across the cell and out at the baso-lateral border, passing into the capillaries. However most fatty acids enter the smooth endoplasmic reticulum where whey are repackaged into '''cholemicrons'''. These are carried out of the cell by exocytosis. 

[[File:Absorb fats.png]]

The cholemicrons do not enter the capillaries, but pass instead into the lymphatic system where they are carried to the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct empties into the superior vena cava.

===Nucleic Acids===
RNA and DNA are broken down by pancreatic enzymes and enzymes in the intestinal mucosa. 
&lt;table cellpadding='10' style='margin:20px' border='1' rules='rows'&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table Showing Nucleic Acid Digesting Enzymes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Source&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Enzyme&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Activated by&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Substrate&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Functions and/or Products&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td rowspan='2' valign='top'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pancreas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Ribonuclease &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;RNA&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nucleotides&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;Deoxyibonuclease &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;DNA&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nucleotides&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intestinal mucosa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nuclease &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nucleic Acids&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Purine and pyramidine bases and Pentoses&lt;/td&gt;
    
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The nucleic bases are absorbed by active transport, the pentoses are absorbed with the other sugars.

===Vitamins and Minerals===
====Vitamins====
The fat soluble vitamins '''A''', '''D''', and '''E''' are absorbed in the upper small intestine. The factors that cause malabsorption of fat can also affect absorption of these vitamins. '''Vitamin B12''' is absorbed in the ilium and requires to be bound to '''intrinsic factor''', a protein secreted in the stomach, to be absorbed. If intrinsic factor is missing then Vitamin B12 is not absorbed and '''pernicious anaemia''' results.

Of the water soluble vitamins, transport of Folate and B12 across the apical membrane are Na+ independent, but the other water soluble vitamins are absorbed by Na+ co-transporters.

====Calcium====
Between 30% and 80% of the bodies calcium intake is absorbed. This, and the relationship of Ca++ absorption to the Vitamin D derivative '''1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol''' is discussed further in the chapter on Ca metabolism. The rate of absorption is dependent on the bodies Ca+ needs.

====Iron====
Almost all iron absorption occurs in the ferrous (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) form in the duodenum. The ferric (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) form is converted to ferrous by the enzyme '''ferric reductase'''. A protein transporter designated '''DMT1''' is responsible for absorption at the apical surface of the enterocyte. Heme molecules are transported by the '''HT''' protein transporter. At the basolateral part of the enterocyte Ferrous ions are transported into the interstital fluid by a transporter called '''ferroportin (FP)'''.

In the plasma the ferrous form is reconverted back to the ferric form, and bound to an iron transporting protein '''transferrin (TF)'''.

===Water and Electrolytes===
The small intestine is presented with 9 liters, 2 extrinsic, and 7 intrinsic, of fluid a day for reabsorbtion. In health all but 200cc's are reabsorbed. About 1500 ccs of fluid leave the small intestine and enter the colon.

===Large Intestine===
The junctions between epithelial cells in the large intestine are much tighter than in the small intestine, and this precludes leakage of sodium into the lumen. Most of the fluid and electrolytes are absorbed in the ascending colon.

Although proteins and sugars have usually all been absorbed by the time fluid reaches the large intestine, the colon is capable for absorbing these substrates. Some hard to digest substances, such as beans, can be digested by the colonic bacteria, and these bacteria can even digest small amounts of cellulose.

== Overview ==

'''''Orion Black''''' was a pure-blood wizard, husband of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Walburga Black]] and father of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]]. He lived in the house on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], his ancestral home.  

== Role in the Books ==

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

The day after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] arrives at Grimmauld Place, he is assisting the Weasley family with cleaning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Doxy|Doxies]] out of the sitting room. When they stop for lunch, Sirius shows Harry a tapestry of the Black family tree, explaining that this was emblematic of the Black family beliefs; to the Blacks, genealogy was paramount. The fact that they could trace their family back to the earliest wizards was a source of family pride, and anyone who did not agree was expunged from the tree. Sirius shows the burn mark that had replaced his name, and the one for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks']] mother, who had married &quot;a Muggle,&quot; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]. He also said that he had escaped from this house because his parents were possessed by pure-blood mania. Both his father and his mother agreed with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s plans for the purification of wizarding race.

Later, as they clean up the house, Sirius finds that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] is trying to carry away a large golden ring. Sirius takes it from him and throws it away, saying it had been his father's, and that Kreacher was not as loyal to him as to Walburga.

== Strengths ==

We are told that Sirius' father did enhance the magical protection on the house. As the house must have been standing for many years at that point, and the existing spells should have been reasonably strong, we expect that he must have been a reasonably strong wizard.

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Orion was proud of his son Regulus because he was true to the family's Pure Blood beliefs. We are led to believe that both Orion and Walburga were proud of his becoming a Death Eater, and being in Voldemort's inner council. By the same token, Orion must have been disappointed in Sirius' pro-Muggle leanings. However, Sirius notes that it was Walburga who burned people off the tapestry of the family tree; Orion may have held out some hope of reconciliation.

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Did Orion treat Kreacher well, or not? If not, why would Kreacher try to retrieve Orion's ring?

*2010 Gillig 40 ft. BRT Hybrids (1096-1099) Powered by Cummins ISB diesel engines + electric motors

All the buses in BARTA's fleet are equipped with Allison transmissions, and the first two digits of the bus numbers tell you the year. 0302, 0321, 0322, 0406, and 0408 are fitted with bike racks on the front, and each rack holds two bikes. The bike racks were installed on those five buses in early 2009, sometime after the holiday. Five new hybrids were put into service on Friday, May 15, 2009. These buses run on a combination of diesel fuel and electric power, resulting in a 30-60% fuel savings and up to 90% reduced emissions. Since they generate their energy through braking, they get the best fuel economy on urban routes. The Gillig BRT's are equipped with video surveillance cameras. Four more hybrids were put into service on Tuesday, September 7, 2010, and they are also fitted with bicycle racks on the front. Plus, they ''came'' with bike racks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Have you ever had a child? If yes, then you'd know how inquisitive their little minds are. If you haven't had any kids, try remembering yourself as a toddler. It isn't hard enough to note that children usually start talking by asking simple questions like ‘'''what''' is this?’ and ‘'''where''' is that thing?’ We will start learning the Urdu in a very similar way: asking questions.
__TOC__
==Basic interrogation==
If Paul is to ask what a certain thing is, he'd say: '''what is this?''' It is pretty much how things work in Urdu with a slight change however. To learn Urdu, you would have to think in Urdu. When asking a question, a speaker, of say English, would use a special word called the [[w:Interrogative word|interrogative word]] which in Paul's example is '''what'''. If broken down, the simple question that Paul asked would appear as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Interrogative word
! [[w:Auxiliary verb|Auxiliary verb]]
! Object
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | What
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | is
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | this
|}

In the example above, we clearly see that the question begins with an interrogative word (what, where, when, etc.), followed by an auxiliary or helping verb and then comes the object. In Urdu grammar however things work a bit differently. Try looking at the same example in a different perspective.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Object
! Interrogative word
! Auxiliary verb
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | This
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | what
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | is
|}

This might seem incorrect grammatically in English, but this is actually the correct sequence of syntax when asking a question in Urdu. The object comes first with the auxiliary verb at the end and anything else (the interrogative word in this case) between the two. In Urdu, following question would be the equivalent of the question Paul asked.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
! Object
! Interrogative word
! Auxiliary verb
|-
! Latinised
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | '''Yeh'''&lt;br /&gt;{{Pronounced|yeɪ}}
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | '''kya'''&lt;br /&gt;{{Pronounced|k·yɑː}}
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | '''hai'''&lt;br /&gt;{{Pronounced|hæ}}
|-
! Urdu
| یہ
| کیا
| ہے
|}

==5. Discuss the Indians of your area with regard to: &lt;br&gt;a. Tribes located there&lt;br&gt;b. Homes and clothing&lt;br&gt;c. Native crafts performed, such as basketry, pottery, mats, etc.&lt;br&gt;d. Religious practices&lt;br&gt;e. Form of Government &lt;br&gt;If you do not live in North America, choose any of the following for study. Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest==
The four divisions of Northeast, Southest, Northwest, and Southwest are not really the best way to categorize Native American culture, as it excludes some major cultural societies that do not fit neatly into these four categories.  In addition to these four, we also present the culture of the Plains Indians.  Cultures from California, the Great Basin, the Plateau, Arctic, and Subarctic regions of North America could also be included.

{{clear}}
===Northeast===

====Tribes====
Algonquian tribes of the New England area include Mohegan, Pequot, Narragansett, Wampanoag, Massachusett, Nipmuck, Pennacook, and Passamaquoddy. The Abenaki tribe is located in Maine and eastern Quebec. These tribes practiced some agriculture. The Maliseet of Maine, Quebec and New Brunswick, and the Mi'kmaq tribes of the Canadian Maritime provinces lived primarily on fishing. Further north are the Betsiamites, Atikamekw, Algonkin and Montagnais/Naskapi (Innu). The Beothuk people of Newfoundland are also believed to have been Algonquians, but they disappeared in the early 19th century and few records of their language or culture remain. In the west, Ojibwe/Chippewa, Ottawa, Potawatomi, and a variety of Cree groups lived in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Upper Michigan, Western Ontario and the Canadian Prairies. In the Midwest lived the Shawnee, Illiniwek, Kickapoo, Menominee, Miami, and Sac and Fox, many of whom have since been displaced over great distances through Indian removal. In the mid- and south-Atlantic are the traditional homes of the Powhatan, Lumbee, Nanticoke, Lenape (Munsee and Unami speakers), and Mahican peoples.

====Homes====
&lt;gallery perrow=2 widths=300px&gt;
File:Wigwam Indigenous peoples.JPG|A typical '''wigwam''' in the Northeast has a curved surface which can hold up against the worst weather. The male of the family was responsible for the framing of the wigwam. Young green tree saplings, of just about any type of wood, about ten to fifteen feet long were cut down. These tree saplings were then bent by stretching the wood. While these saplings were being bent, a circle was drawn on the ground. The diameter of the circle varied from ten to sixteen feet. The bent saplings were then placed over the drawn circle, using the tallest saplings in the middle and the shorter ones on the outside. The saplings formed arches all in one direction on the circle. The next set of saplings was used to wrap around the wigwam to give the shelter support. When the two sets of saplings were finally tied together, the sides and roof were placed on it. The sides of the wigwam were usually bark stripped from trees.

File:Long House Iroquois Allen.jpg|'''Longhouses''' were built by native peoples in various parts of North America, sometimes reaching over 100 meters long (330 feet) but generally around 5 to 7 meters wide (16-23 ft). The construction method was also different: the dominant theory is that walls were made of sharpened and fire-hardened poles (up to 1,000 saplings for a 50 meter house) driven into the ground {?} had a roof of leaves and grass. Strips of bark were then woven horizontally through the lines of poles to form more or less weatherproof walls with doors usually in one end of the house, although doors also were built into sides of especially long longhouses.They were long and had fireplaces that kept them warm.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
====Clothing====
&lt;gallery perrow=2 widths=300px&gt;
File:Mary Kim Titla.jpg|'''Buckskins''' are clothing, usually consisting of a jacket and leggings, made from buckskin, a soft sueded leather from the hide of deer or elk. Buckskins are often trimmed with fringe (originally a functional detail, to allow the garment to dry faster when it was soaking wet because the fringe acted as wicks to soak away the water, or quills.

File:Beadedmoccasins.jpg|A '''moccasin''' is a shoe made of deerskin or other soft leather, consisting of a sole and sides made of one piece of leather, stitched together at the top, and sometimes with a vamp (additional panel of leather). The sole is soft and flexible and the upper part often is adorned with embroidery or beading, et cetera.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Crafts====
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Atrapasuenos.jpg|A '''dream catcher''' is a handmade object based on a willow hoop, on which is woven a loose net or web. The dreamcatcher is then decorated with personal and sacred items such as feathers and beads.
File:Quill knife sheath.png|'''Quillwork''' is a form of textile embellishment traditionally practiced by Native Americans that employs the quills of porcupines as a decorative element.
File:Svepask 2007a.jpg|'''Birch bark baskets''' were made by Native Americans wherever birch trees were found.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Religious Practices====
&lt;gallery perrow=2 widths=350&gt;
File:Sundance.jpg|A '''Sundance''' was a ceremony in which a medicine man would pierce the skin of a young man's chest and pass a skewer of bone through the piercing.  A rope was attached to the skewer on one end, and a tall pole on the other.  The brave would then attempt to free himself by pulling away from the pole until the skin tore.
File:JingleDress1.jpg|'''Jingle dress''' is a dance dress worn by women participating in the &quot;Jingle Dress Dance&quot; at a Pow wow. Made of cloth, the dress includes several rows of metal cones, which are sewn across the dress on the skirt (and blouse, in some areas). The metal cones create a jingling sound as the dancer moves. The Jingle Dress Dance is characterized by the jingle dress and light footwork danced close to ground. The dancer dances in a snake-like pattern around the drum; her feet never cross, nor does she dance backward or turn a complete circle.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Government====
''Gayanashagowa'' or the Great Law of Peace of the Iroquois (or Haudenosaunee) Six Nations is the oral constitution that created the Iroquois Confederacy. The law was developed by a man known as The Great Peacemaker and his spokesman Hiawatha. Member Nations ratified this constitution near present day Victor, New York.

The Iroquois Confederacy was once thought to have started in the 1500s, but more recent estimates date the confederacy, and its constitution between 1090 and 1150 CE. These estimates were based on the records of the confederacy leadership and astronomical dating related to a total solar eclipse that coincided with the founding of the Confederacy.

According to several historians, including Donald Grinde, the democratic ideals of the Gayanashagowa, which had been quite unknown in European feudal tradition, provided a significant inspiration to Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and other framers of the United States Constitution. John Rutledge of South Carolina in particular is said to have read lengthy tracts of Iroquoian law to the other framers, beginning with the words &quot;We, the people, to form a union, to establish peace, equity, and order...&quot; The Congress of the United States passed Concurrent Resolution 331 in October 1988, specifically recognizing the influence of the Iroquois Constitution upon the US Constitution and Bill of Rights.

===Southeast===
====Tribes====
The tribes of the Southeast included the Adai, Alabama, Apalachee, Caddo, Calusa, Catawba, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), Natchez, Pascagoula, Seminole, Tuscarora, Yazoo, Yemmassee and literally hundreds of others (feel free to expand this list).

====Homes====
The Apalachee built houses covered with palm leaves or the bark of cypress or poplar trees.

====Clothing====
;Apalachee: The Apalachee men wore a deerskin loincloth. The women wore a skirt of Spanish moss or other plant fibers. 

;Choctaw: The colorful dresses worn by today's Choctaw are made by hand and adapted from 19th century European-American designs. Choctaws today wear Choctaw clothing mainly for special events. Choctaw elders, especially the Choctaw women, dress in their traditional garb every day. Choctaw dresses are trimmed by full diamond, half diamond or circle and crosses that represent stickball sticks.

;Muscogee: Ancestral Muscogee peoples wore clothing made of woven plant materials or animal skins, depending upon the climate. During the summer, they preferred lightweight fabrics woven from tree bark, grasses or reeds. During the harsh winters, animal skins and fur were used for their warmth.  During the 1600’s the influence of European fashion became apparent in Southeastern clothing styles. Cloth was more comfortable and colorful than buckskin and quickly became a popular trade item throughout the region. Bolts of cloth could be obtained in a variety of patterns and textures, and allowed an individualized style of dress to evolve. Muscogee people were soon incorporating trade novelties and trinkets such as bells, ribbons, beads and pieces of mirror.

====Crafts====
[[File:Cherokeetwilledbasketofcane.png|thumb|200px|A traditional Cherokee basket pattern]][[File:Cherokeegourdmask.png|thumb|200px|Cherokee gourd mask]]

;Apalachee: The Apalachee made pottery, wove cloth and cured buckskin.

;Calusa: Between 500 and 1000 the undecorated sand-tempered pottery that had been common in southern Florida was replaced by &quot;Belle Glade Plain&quot; pottery, which was made with clay containing spicules from freshwater sponges (Spongilla), and which first appeared inland in sites around Lake Okeechobee. This change may have resulted from migration from the interior to the coastal region, or may reflect trade and cultural influence. There was little change in the pottery tradition after this. The Calusa were descended from people who had lived in the area for at least 1000 years prior to European contact, and possibly for much longer than that.

;Catawba: In the Carolinas, the Catawbas became well-known for their pottery, especially around the Charleston area. Some cooks believed that certain dishes, such as okra soup, could not be prepared properly without a pot made by the Catawbas.

;Choctaw: The Choctaws are basket &amp; beadwork makers, dancers &amp; musicians, and cuisine specialist, all of which are part of the collective Choctaw culture that defines them as a distinct cultural group.

====Religious Practices====
:Calusa; The Calusa believed that three supernatural people ruled the world, that people had three souls, and that souls migrated to animals after death. The most powerful ruler governed the physical world, the second most powerful ruled human governments, and the last helped in wars, choosing which side would win. The Calusa believed that the three souls were the pupil of a person's eye, his shadow, and his reflection. The soul in the eye's pupil stayed with the body after death, and the Calusa would consult with that soul at the graveside. The other two souls left the body after death and entered into an animal. If a Calusa killed such an animal, the soul would then migrate to a lesser animal, and eventually be reduced to nothing. Calusa ceremonies included processions of priests and singing women. The priests wore carved masks, which were at other times hung on the walls inside a temple. Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, an early chronicler of the Calusa, described &quot;sorcerers in the shape of the devil, with some horns on their heads&quot; who ran through the town yelling like animals for four months at a time. The Calusa remained committed to their belief system in the face of Spanish attempts to convert them to Catholicism. The &quot;nobles&quot; resisted conversion in part because their power and position were locked into the belief system; conversion would have destroyed the source of their authority and legitimacy. The Calusa were able to resist the Spanish and their missionaries for almost 200 years, until the tribe was destroyed by Creek and Yemassee raiders early in the 18th century.

;Catawba: The Catawba religion has a creator (Manatou), and sometimes is said to have a trinity. This trinity consists of Manatou, the creator, Kaia, the turtle, and a third being who is sometimes said to be the son of Manatou. It is likely that the three beings have always been deities in Catawba culture, but that Christian influence has changed Catawba stories so that the three beings are more like the trinity in the Christian religion.

;Cherokee: The Cherokee revered the Great Spirit, called the Yowa (a name so sacred that only a priest could say it), who presided over all things and created Mother Earth.  They held that signs, visions, dreams, and powers were all gifts of the spirits, and that their world was intertwined with and presided over by the spirit world.  The Cherokee believed that every aspect and thing had a spirit presiding over it, but did not hold a belief in multiple gods. All figures identified as 'gods' were simply greater beings in the Cherokee belief whose names were so great there were no English words for them, and thus they were recognized as 'gods' by Englishmen. However, the Cherokee paid direct respect to and worshipped only Yowa.

;Choctaw: The Choctaws believed in a good spirit and an evil spirit. They may have been sun, or Hushtahli, worshippers.  Prayers may have been introduced by missionaries; however, Choctaw prophets were known to have addressed the sun. Swanton wrote, &quot;an old Choctaw informed Wright that before the arrival of the missionaries, they had no conception of prayer. However, he adds, 'I have indeed heard it asserted by some, that anciently their hopaii, or prophets, on some occasions were accustomed to address the sun ...'&quot;

;Calusa: The Calusa had a stratified society, consisting of &quot;commoners&quot; and &quot;nobles&quot; in Spanish terms. A few leaders governed the tribe, and were supported by the labor of the majority of the Calusa. The leaders included the tribal chief, or &quot;king&quot;, a military leader, and a chief priest. In 1564, according to a Spanish source, the priest was the chief's father, and the military leader was his cousin. The chief was usually succeeded by his son. The Spanish reported that the chief was expected to marry his sister, although MacMahon and Marquardt suggest this may have been a misunderstanding of a requirement to marry a &quot;clan-sister&quot;. The chief also married women from subject towns and allied tribes.

;Cherokee: Cherokee society was traditionally broken into seven clans, with Cherokee villages having two governmental units, with one government (white) handling affairs in peacetime and the other (red) during times of war, and a medicine chief who would resolve disputes between the Red Chief and White Chief should they disagree. Family was also central to Cherokee society. During the year, the Cherokee celebrated the Cherokee Moons Ceremonies.

===Northwest Coastal===
The Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest Coast are the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Pacific Northwest Coast, their descendants, and many ethnic groups who identify with those historical peoples. They are now situated within the Canadian Province of British Columbia and the U.S. states of Alaska, Washington and Oregon.
====Tribes====
Tribes of the Northwest Coast included the Tlingit, Nisga'a, Haida, Tsimshian, Haisla, Heiltsuk, Wuikinuxv, Kwakwaka'wakw, Nuu-chah-nulth, and the Coast Salish.

File:Button blanket.jpg|A Native American tradition introduced after European contact , '''Button Blankets''' are particular to the Pacific Northwest tribes. Rather than sleeping equipment, the blankets are used as capes and gifts at ceremonial dances and potlatches.
File:Qagyuhl.jpg|The men during summer wore no clothing at all except tatoos and jewelery and in the winter they usually rubbed fat on themselves to keep themmselves warm.In battle the men wore red cedar armor and helmets and breechclouts made from cedar. During ceremonies they wore circles of cedar bark on their ankles as well as cedar breechclouts. The women wore skirts of softened cedar and during the winter they wore a cedar blanket on the top.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Crafts====
The creation of beautiful and practical objects (for all tribal communities) served as a means of transmitting stories, history, wisdom and property from generation to generation. Art provided Indigenous people with a tie to the land by depicting their histories on cave walls; totem poles; the Big (Plank) Houses of the Pacific Northwest coast; buffalo hides; long houses; tipis – the symbols depicted were a constant reminder of their birth places, lineages and nations.

It is important to note, however, that generally speaking art was not produced for aesthetic reasons. Time was always an issue, as there was much to do to keep tribal communities healthy and safe for another day. Therefore, the emphasis was placed on practical uses of items, such as clothing, tools, weapons of war and hunting, transportation, and shelter.

Many of the coastal peoples fashioned most of their goods out of Western Red Cedar, particularly from its bark, which could be fashioned into tools, clothing, roofing, armor, building materials and canoe skins. They used cedar in their Chilkat weaving, which the Tsimshian are credited with inventing.

====Religious Practices====
;Tsimshian: Tsimshian religion centered around the &quot;Lord of Heaven&quot;, who aided people in times of need by sending supernatural servants to earth to aid them. The Tsimshian believed that charity and purification of the body (either by cleanliness or fasting) was the route to the afterlife.
====Government====
;Clatsop: The tribe has never been organized hierarchically (under &quot;chiefs&quot;) but individual families affiliated with one another in small villages and seasonal camps located near food sources.

;Nisga'a: Nisga'a society is organized into four Tribes: Ganada (Raven), Gisk’aast (Killer Whale), Laxgibuu (Wolf), and Laxsgiik (Eagle).  Each Tribe is further sub-divided into House Groups - extended families with same origins. Some Houses are grouped together into Clans - grouping of Houses with same ancestors.

;Kwakwaka'wakw: The Kwakwaka'wakw are made up of 17 tribes who all speak the common language of kwak'wala. Their society was highly stratified, with three main classes, determined by heredity: nobles, commoners, and slaves.

===Southwest===
====Tribes====
Tribes of the southwest include the Hopi, Navajo, Pueblo, Mohave, Quechan, and many others.

File:Hogan Navajo.jpg|A hogan is the traditional Navajo home. For those who practice the Navajo religion the hogan is considered sacred. The doorway of the hogan was opened to the east so they could welcome the sun. The religious song &quot;The Blessingway&quot; describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes. Today they are rarely used as actual dwellings, but are maintained primarily for ceremonial purposes.

====Clothing====
;Puebloan People: Cloth and weaving were known to the Puebloans before the conquest, but it is not known whether they knew of weaving before or after the Aztecs. But since clothing was expensive, they did not always dress completely until after the conquest, and breechcloths were not uncommon.

File:Navajo sheep &amp; weaver.jpg|Though some people say the Navajo learned the art of weaving from the Pueblo people, the origins of Navajo weaving may never be known. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. By the 18th century the Navajo had begun to import yarn with their favorite color, Bayeta red. Using an upright loom the Navajos made almost exclusively utilitarian blankets. Little patterning and few colors on almost all blankets, except for the much sought after Chief's Blanket, which evolved from the 1st Phase, few wide bands, to the 2nd phase, wide bands with squares on the corners, to the 3rd Phase, which made more and more use of patterns and colors. Around the same time the Navajo people, who had long started traded for commercial wool, often from the uniforms of soldiers, rewove these into intricate multicolored blankets called Germantown.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
====Religious Practices====
;Navajo: Navajo spiritual practice is about restoring health, balance, and harmony to a person's life. One exception to the concept of healing is the Beauty Way ceremony: the Kinaaldá, or a female puberty ceremony. Others include the Hooghan Blessing Ceremony and the &quot;Baby's First Laugh Ceremony.&quot; Otherwise, ceremonies are used to heal illnesses, strengthen weakness, and give vitality to the patient. Ceremonies restore Hozhò, or beauty, harmony, balance, and health.

;Hopi: Hopi is a concept deeply rooted in the culture's religion, spirituality, and its view of morality and ethics. The Hopi religion is anti-war. To be Hopi is to strive toward this concept, which involves a state of total reverence and respect for all things, to be at peace with these things, and to live in accordance with the instructions of Maasaw, the Creator or Caretaker of Earth. The Hopi observe their traditional ceremonies for the benefit of the entire world.

;Mohave: The Mohave believed in their creator Mutavilya, who gave them their names and their commandments, and in his son Mastamho, who gave them the river and taught them how to plant. They were mainly farmers who planted in the overflow of the untamed river, following the age-old customs of the Aha macave.

;Puebloan People: Pueblo prayer included substances as well as words; one common prayer material was ground-up maize — white cornmeal. Thus a man might bless his son, or some land, or the town by sprinkling a handful of meal as he uttered a blessing. Once, after the 1692 re-conquest, the Spanish were prevented from entering a town when they were met by a handful of men who uttered imprecations and cast a single pinch of a sacred substance.  The Puebloans employed prayer sticks, which were colorfully decorated with beads, fur, and feathers; these prayer sticks (or talking sticks) were also used by other nations.


====Government====
The Hopi effectively have two parallel systems of local government. One is a Western-style tribal government established under authority of the Hopi Tribal Constitution, with elected or appointed members who serve on a reservation-wide Tribal Council, and an elected tribal chairman. The other is a traditional system of civil and spiritual leadership that traces back at least 1,000 years and is organized by villages and clans within each village. Some villages that have maintained more traditional structures, are often secret and opaque to outsiders.

Kikmongwi are, in one sense, merely the Tribal chiefs of each among the villages that follows a traditional governance structure. They are hereditary leaders based on a complex system of lineage and kinship. Each clan on each village has a Mongwi, or leader, responsible for the social and religious duties of the clan, and the Kikmongwi is the male head of the dominant clan. However, Hopi is unusual among tribes in that there is a recognized interface between the two systems of government. Namely, the Constitution and the Courts delegate certain tribe-wide duties such as the police force, schools, lawmaking, and administration of the courts to the tribe as a whole, but leave many civil matters such as land use, child custody, and inheritance to the villages to decide as they wish (meaning, the Tribe asserts no authority over these aspects of traditional governance). Further, the Kikmongwi appoints the delegates from these villages to the Tribal Council.

Kikmongwi have religious duties and significance as well. Inasmuch as Hopi do not make a firm distinction between secular and religious matters with respect to issues such as agriculture, land and water use, and family relationships, the position can be considered an inherently religious one as well. Mongwi, for instance, are often depicted as Kachinas.

It is also unusual for outsiders (no family/marriage ties) to have knowledge of or participate in any religious ceremonies at any or all villages therefore, making it difficult to accurately report of the actual functions of such a system.

===Plains===
====Tribes====
Plains Indians are usually divided into two broad classifications which overlap to some degree. The first group were fully nomadic, following the vast herds of bison. Some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture;growing tobacco and corn primarily. These included the Blackfoot, Arapaho, Assiniboine, Cheyenne, Comanche, Crow, Gros Ventre, Kiowa, Lakota, Lipan, Plains Apache (or Kiowa Apache), Plains Cree, Sarsi, Sioux, Shoshone, and Tonkawa.

The second group of Plains Indians (sometimes referred to as Prairie Indians) were the semi-sedentary tribes who, in addition to hunting bison, lived in villages and raised crops. These included the Arikara, Hidatsa, Iowa, Kaw (or Kansa), Mandan, Omaha, Osage, Otoe, Pawnee, Ponca, and Wichita.

====Homes====
&lt;gallery perrow=2 widths=300&gt;
File:Shoshoni tipis.jpg|The Plains Indians created tipis because they were easily disassembled and allowed the nomadic life of following game. When Spanish horses were obtained, the Plains tribes rapidly integrated them into their daily lives. By the early 18th century some tribes had fully adopted a horse culture. The Comanche were among the first to commit to a fully mounted nomadic lifestyle. This occurred by the 1730s, when they had acquired enough horses to put all their people on horseback.
File:Mandan lodge.jpg|The Mandan were in contrast with other tribes in the Great Plains region in the establishment of permanent villages instead of leading a nomadic existence tracking herds of buffalo. These permanent settlements featured round, earthen lodges surrounding a central plaza. While the buffalo was key to the daily life of the Mandan, it was supplemented by agriculture and trade.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Clothing====
[[File:Sioux-Womendress.jpg|thumb|300px|Souix dress]]
The Plains Indians made their clothing from the skins of animals, most notably, from the American Bison.
;Comanche: Comanche clothing was simple and easy to wear. Men wore a leather belt with a breechcloth — a long piece of buckskin that was brought up between the legs and looped over and under the belt at the front and back. Loose-fitting deerskin leggings were worn down to the moccasins and tied to the belt. The moccasins had soles made from thick, tough buffalo hide with soft deerskin uppers.

:The Comanche men wore nothing on the upper body except in the winter, when they wore warm, heavy robes made from buffalo hides (or occasionally, bear, wolf, or coyote skins) with knee-length buffalo-hide boots. Young boys usually went without clothes except in cold weather. When they reached the age of eight or nine, they began to wear the clothing of a Comanche adult.

:In the 19th century, woven cloth replaced the buckskin breechcloths, and the men began wearing loose-fitting buckskin shirts. They decorated their shirts, leggings and moccasins with fringes made of deer-skin, animal fur, and human hair. They also decorated their shirts and leggings with patterns and shapes formed with beads and scraps of material.

:Comanche women wore long deerskin dresses. The dresses had a flared skirt and wide, long sleeves, and were trimmed with buckskin fringes along the sleeves and hem. Beads and pieces of metal were attached in geometric patterns. Comanche women wore buckskin moccasins with buffalo soles. In the winter they, too, wore warm buffalo robes and tall, fur-lined buffalo-hide boots. Unlike the boys, young girls did not go without clothes. As soon as they were able to walk, they were dressed in breechcloths. By the age of twelve or thirteen, they adopted the clothes of Comanche women.

====Crafts====
Because of their frequent travelling, Comanche Indians had to make sure that their household goods and other possessions were unbreakable, and so they did not use pottery that could easily be broken on long journeys. Basketry, weaving, wood carving, and metal working were also unknown among the Comanches. Instead, they depended upon the buffalo for most of their tools, household goods, and weapons. Nearly two hundred different articles were made from the horns, hide, and bones of the buffalo.

====Religious Practices====
The Plains Indians followed no single religion. Animist religion was an important part of a Great Plains Indians' life, as they believed that all things possessed spirits. Their worship was centered on one main god, in the Sioux language Wakan Tanka (the Great Spirit). The Great Spirit had power over everything that had ever existed, and the Indians believed that by worshipping him they would become stronger. Earth was also quite important, as she was the mother of all spirits. Spirits were worshipped daily. People sometimes prayed alone, while other times there were group gatherings. The most important group ceremony was the Sun Dance, in which participants danced for four days around a sacred object, and some would inflict harm upon themselves on purpose, all while staring at the sun. They believed this self-sacrifice would encourage powerful spirits to support and defend them.

====Government====
The historical Sioux referred to the Great Sioux Nation as the Oceti Sakowin, meaning &quot;Seven Council Fires&quot;. Each fire was symbolic of an oyate (people or nation). The seven nations that comprise the Sioux are: Mdewakanton, Wahpetowan (Wahpeton), Wahpekute, Sissetowan (Sisseton), the Ihantowan (Yankton), Ihanktowana (Yanktonai), and the Teton (Lakota). The Seven Council Fires would assemble each summer to hold council, renew kinships, decide tribal matters, and participate in the Sun Dance. The seven divisions would select four leaders known as Wicasa Yatapicka from among the leaders of each division. Being one of the four leaders was considered the highest honor for a leader; however, the annual gathering meant the majority of tribal administration was cared for by the usual leaders of each division. The last meeting of the Seven Council Fires was in 1850.

==6. Name ten articles used by the Indians in their religious ceremonies. ==
* Eagle feathers
* Peyote (a spineless cactus)
* Eagle bone whistle
* Peace pipe
* Drums
* Gourd Dance Eagle Fan
* Gourd rattle
* Medicine wheel (stones structure)
* Smudge stick (charred bundle of dried herbs)
* Sweat lodge
* Tomahawk
* Wampum

==7. Explain two methods of mounting and displaying arrowheads. ==
Arrowheads are typically mounted in a shadow box.  This is a shallow wooden box with a removable glass cover.  The bottom of the box is covered with a photo framing mat.  The arrowheads can be sewn to the mat with monofilament, tied down with leather lacing, or they can be glued down.  If gluing, be sure to use a reversible glue, such as hot melt.

==8. Explain one method of restoring and mending damaged arrowheads, ollas, blankets, and baskets. ==
It is probably best to leave the repair of a valuable artifact to a professional.  We do not intend to provide instruction here in sufficient detail to allow a Pathfinder to attempt a repair, but rather outline the procedures used.
===Arrowheads===
Broken arrowheads can usually be glued back together using Cyanoacrylate (such as Superglue, or Krazy Glue).  Apply a drop or two of glue to one surface, join the pieces together, and hold them in position for a minute to allow the glue to set.  Once it sets, leave it alone for a couple of hours.  If any glue came to the surface of the crack, scrape it off with an X-Acto knife.

===Ollas (pottery)===
Pottery is sometimes repaired using the &quot;sandbox and Elmers&quot; approach.  First a container larger enough to hold the pot (in its ''whole'' form) is obtained, and a little sand is added to the bottom.  Then a two pieces from the bottom of the pottery are glued together using a water-soluble glue (such as Elmers).  The glued piece are placed in the sandbox, and sand is packed around them to hold them in position.  Then another piece is glued on, and sand is packed around it as well.  This process is repeated until the entire pot has been reassembled.  Once the glue has had sufficient time to dry (don't rush it), the pot is removed from the sand.  
*Adapted from http://www.artifactsguide.com/discus/messages/12/7194.html?1043987387

===Blankets===
Before you begin, you should have the blanket dry cleaned.  
This is especially true if the damage needing repair was caused by moths.  Dry cleaning will kill any eggs and larvae still present in the blanket and prevent the damage from recurring.

Wool blankets can be repaired by one of two methods: reweaving, or felting.  Reweaving is an art best left to professionals, but felting is within reach of the amateur.  

It is well known that if fine wool is dampened and packed into a boot, the boot placed on a foot, and then walked on, after a while the wool will be compacted into felt.  The same can be done without the use of a boot.  Felt can also be made by rolling it out onto a flat surface.

Place the blanket on a table, and cover the hole with a wad of fine wool.  Spray the wool with a fine mist of water to dampen it. Then get out a rolling pin and go over it repeatedly.  This will convert the wool into felt, and as it does so, will bond the felt with the wool in the blanket.  To further this process, the patched area can then be pressed with a hot iron (use steam) until the edges of the patch disappear into the surrounding blanket.

===Baskets===
Repairing a valuable basket should not be attempted except by a professional.  A low-value basket could be the subject of an amateur repair, and will yield insights into basket construction techniques.

;Weavers: If a weaver is broken, it should be cut off near a rib.  A new weaver should be selected and an attempt t omatch the color should be made.  A new weaver could be stained with coffee or tea to approximate the color of an existing one.  Once color matched, the new weaver should be worked into the weave and overlap the old weaver.  If desired, a little white glue can be pressed into service for a stronger repair.  

;Ribs: A broken rib can also be replaced.  A new (color matched) rib should be woven in right along side the broken rib.  Once it is in place, the broken rib can be removed.

==9. Name and locate at least ten different tribes of the present day and tell for what each is noted. ==
A careful reading of the material detailed in requirement 5 provides ample information for this requirement.

==10. Experiment with plant dyes as used by the Indians and try to obtain at least two shades of color. ==
===The dying process===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Natural dyes}}

===Plants and colors===
You can get some of these plants at a grocery store even in the winter.  Others will need to be gathered in the warmer months.
;Red: Rose hips, beets, dandelion roots
;Orange: Onion skins, sassafras leaves
;Yellow: Queen Anne's lace (carrot), burdock, dandelion flowers
;Green: Red onion skins, plantain roots
;Blue-Purple: Poke berries, grapes, blueberries, blackberries, red cabbage
;Brown: Walnut hulls, acorns, oak leaves
;Black-gray: Sumac leaves, iris roots

==11. Do one of the following: ==
===a. Visit an Indian museum ===
If you know of an Indian museum in your area, by all means, look into visiting that one.  You may also consult [http://www.hanksville.org/NAresources/indices/NAmuseums.html this web site] to find one in your area, or use an Internet search engine to look for &quot;Indian Museum ''state''&quot; where ''state'' is the name of the state in which you wish to find an Indian museum.  Also try replacing the word ''&quot;Indian&quot;'' with ''&quot;Native American&quot;''.

===b. Visit Indian ruins or mounds ===
See the Wikipedia category [[w:Category:Mound builders|Mound builders]] for a list of several Indian mounds throughout the United States.

===c. Make a personal visit with an Indian ===
If you know a Native American, invite him or her to speak to your Pathfinder club.  If you do not personally know a Native American, find an Indian museum as described in section ''a'' of this requirement and contact them.  They may be able to put you in touch with a Native American who is willing to share his or her culture with you.

===d. Visit an Indian village or reservation ===
There are about 300 Indian reservations in the United states.  Wikipedia has a [[w:List of Indian reservations in the United States|List of Indian reservations in the United States]].  In Canada, these are called Indian reserves, and Wikipedia has [[w:Indian reserve|an article]] covering those as well.

Previously, all three main responses (...Ngf6, ...e6, ...Qc7) were thought to be equivalent, and often transposed to the same position with black castling queenside. Later development saw Black look at castling kingside, but for a while this fell out of favour as White found he could move his knight to e4 or e2, and advance g4, without needing to prepare Rg1. This extra tempo seems to threaten this line as a viable alternative for black, as white can win the race between the white kingside and black queenside attacks. More recent theory, however, has seen Black resurrect ...e6, quite often not castling at all, while the other alternatives remain out of favour.

11. Bf4 is the most challenging response  when faced with modern Black theory where Black does not castle queenside. In earlier theory, when Black planned to castle queenside, Bd2 was almost equivalent. The other alternatives offer little for White.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= General Comments on Sumerian Cuneiform =

Before we get into the nitty gritty of reading Sumerian in cuneiform, we should probably first take a look at some of the concepts and issues involved with cuneiform in general, and Sumerian cuneiform in particular. A few of these details are laid out below. A lot more can be said, but as this is a course on Sumerian I won't spend too much time on the topic.

''[As a brief aside, if anyone has some good public domain images of some tables or other cuneiform inscriptions, please feel free to spice up any of the chapters here with some nice pictures. I have a few fairly good pictures from the Louvre, Vatican, etc but they are on my old computer and I really need to get that one linked up to my new one :)]''

== How Sumerian is Written ==

[[File:Sumerian_26th_c_Adab.jpg|300px|right]]

Now that you've learned a bit about the Sumerian language, you're probably wondering how to read it in the wild. You probably know that Sumerian is written in cuneiform. But what does that mean, exactly? How does cuneiform work? Who invented cuneiform?

To the best of our knowledge, people started using symbols on small clay objects to represent legal contracts between people. We have some artifacts from circa 3500 BC that show things like sheep and oxen, with rudimentary counts and numbers. Our best guess is that this kind of visual symbology lead, eventually, to the desire to express more abstract ideas in clay as well. By 3000 BC, we start seeing more interesting symbols being written down, and more complex ideas being represented. It is still very difficult to know what all these artifacts mean, or even how we should interpret many of the individual symbols. There is a lot of work yet to be done on this topic - but very important work! Writing has only developed independently four or five times in the course of human civilization, and we really would like to understand that process better. Unfortunately, we are at a great disadvantage being so temporally removed from early Sumerian, as well as not really understanding Sumerian itself, making early decipherment even more tricky.

By 2100 BC or so, we see a complete and fully-formed writing system - nothing like the clunky logographs of the past. Now, we have symbols that are purely phonetic, as well as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinative taxograms], which are not pronounced at all, but are purely to assist in the reading and writing of the text! This is the cuneiform we'll be mostly interested in for a starting point, but remember that cuneiform, just like any other medium, had a long history and evolution before this time, and continued to be used for millenia afterward.

But even in this well-formed state, there are quite a few open questions about the system, and quite a few problems inherent in the script itself that make understanding both cuneiform and the language it is trying to represent quite difficult. If you enjoy a good mystery, Sumerian cuneiform is one of the best. It is a testament to the skill and intuition of the early Sumerologists that we know as much as we do today, considering the paucity of data they had to work with!

== Problems with Cuneiform and Sumerian ==

[[File:Sumerian-akkadian lexicon Louvre AO7662.jpg|300px|right]]

Some of the problems we have with Sumerian cuneiform are rooted in the origins of the script. If you draw a picture of a sun rising above the horizon as a representation of ''day'', how do you represent ''dawn''? ''Dusk''? ''High noon''? Also, if you're just drawing pictures, you don't have any explicit connection to the actual phonology - the pronounciation of the word for ''day'', for example. Also, how do you draw the concept of ''resolve''? Or even ''when''?

=== Help from Sumerian ===

We get some helpful clues from Sumerian itself, when written in cuneiform. As we've already seen, a lot of Sumerian words were short one-syllable forms, and as such, there were a lot of homophones (words that sound the same but have different meanings - think ''mount'', as in saddle, versus ''mount'', as in mountain). Because of this, we don't actually see the Sumerians struggle to find a symbolic representation for ''when''. It turns out that the Sumerian word '''ud''', which is the word for ''day'', is also a homophone for the preposition ''when''. So instead of finding a whole new cuneiform symbol for ''when'', they just re-used the sun-rising-over-the-horizon symbol. In this way, we can find out a lot about Sumerian phonology - we can learn which words were homophones very easily, as they use the same picture for different words that sound alike. (Of course, they also had different symbols for homophones, too - Sumerian '''lil''' meant ''fool'', written one way, but it meant ''breeze'' when written a different way.)

Another huge source of information comes from the purely phonetic symbols. Lucky for us, Sumerian scribes liked to &quot;chain&quot; sounds together when adding particles. So '''lugal.ani''' might be written in cuneiform as '''lu-gal-la-a-ni'''. The &quot;l&quot; sound at the end of '''lugal''' was chained to the vowel in the next syllable to make '''la'''. This type of writing is extremely helpful to us now - seeing as we have no direct phonetic evidence in Sumerian, we can at least make good guesses that when we see the '''la-a-ni''' symbols, it's a good bet that the preceding word ended in an &quot;l&quot; sound. Using these types of internal comparisons, we can build up a phonetic idea of what Sumerian was like, but for symbols that show up less frequently, we're still in the dark. How can we figure out what these symbols mean?

=== Help from the Akkadians ===

A huge source of information comes to us from Akkadian-speaking scribes. As time went on in Sumer, the Sumerian language died out in favor of Akkadian as the mother tongue. We're not sure why - maybe it was due to the invasion of Akkadian speaking kings who mandated a language change, and maybe it just died out for natural reasons. Whatever the case, we do know that the Akkadian-speaking kings of the region liked to use Sumerian writing for official documents, probably because it came with a great sense of grandeur, having been used by the great kings of old, and hopefully instilling anything the new kings had written with a sense of authoritarianism and entitlement.

Regardless of motivation, the reality was that a bunch of Akkadian speaking scribes were being forced to write in Sumerian, almost a dead language by this point. It must have been quite annoying for them, but it's a great boon for us. That's because the scribes had to compile big translation dictionaries, so no one would forget what the Sumerian translation of a given Akkadian word was. What a treasure! We have found some of these tablets, and as we have a pretty firm understanding of Akkadian, we are automatically treated to a huge list of Sumerian words that Akkadians used. Now, of course, these are all just translations, and translations from any language to another invariably lose some nuances, and we even see some scribal errors here and there, but by and large these bilingual texts contribute enormously to our understanding of Sumerian cuneiform. Some words that occur very infrequently in Sumerian texts would be almost untranslatable without these lexical lists.

== The Evolution of Cuneiform ==



As mentioned before, cuneiform wasn't a fixed system. It evolved greatly over time, morphing to serve the desires of the scribes using it. When Akkadians usurped the system to write their own language, for instance, we see great changes in writing styles and symbols, as well as changes in the meanings of some symbols. Akkadians didn't use all the same syllables as Sumerians, after all, and certainly not in the same frequencies, so it only makes sense that they would want to make some changes in the way the script was written. This transition was not a simple one, as Sumerian and Akkadian are from completely different language families, meaning many syntactic constructs had to be completely abandoned, and many new words and particles created to fill the gaps.

This trend only increased as the script was modified and distributed to even more regions around Mesopotamia - when the Hittites and Old Persians got hold of it, the script needed to serve the Indo-European languages as well. Finally, someone in Ugarit got fed up with the whole thing, and decided to invent an &quot;alphabet&quot; of sorts - Ugaritic texts are found with a fairly good representation of an alphabet, with one symbol per sound. Unfortunately for us, this revolution in writing wasn't discovered in Sumerian times, so we're stuck with the mostly logographic/syllabic style of cuneiform.

== Questions about Sumerian Cuneiform ==

One important question remains unanswered regarding the earliest origins of cuneiform. We assume, by and large, that the Sumerians invented cuneiform, as it is the first language that we can definitively identify to be written in cuneiform. But, as we know, early writing was just symbols on clay - it really could have been any language at all being written! In fact, it wasn't even &quot;language&quot; at all. There was no syntax, no grammar in those early texts to point to one language versus another.

So, for many years, we all assumed that cuneiform was invented by Sumerians. This is how science works - linguists just thought up the simplest explanation that conformed to the known facts at hand, and the simplest explanation in this case was that somebody in Sumer speaking Sumerian invented writing.

Unfortunately, this simple hypothesis started to show signs of strain as more and more research was done on cuneiform as a writing system. Sumerologists started to question why the script seemed so ill-adapted to the language. Why, for instance, are there so many variations in the texts? Is it because the original language the script was invented for had a different phonetic inventory than Sumerian? Were the Sumerians just trying to &quot;fit&quot; their language onto someone else's sounds? Or perhaps it is the simple fact that languages change - over time, it's completely possible that Sumerian changed internally so much that the script simply couldn't catch up. This is just good science - we have to be willing to change our hypothesis in the face of contrary and overwhelming evidence.

In this case, the evidence is nowhere near overwhelming. The whole issue is still an open question, and one that deserves more research. If those early tablets and artifacts do, in fact, contain the writings from a different, as yet unidentified, language, it would be a really tremendous discovery, and it could modify the whole way we see the early history of writing.

This salad is very easy to make. 

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pickling [[cookbook:cucumber|cucumber]]
* 1 large [[cookbook:tomato|tomato]]
* 1 head [[cookbook:onion|onion]]
* 3 tbsp [[cookbook:vegetable oil|sunflower oil]]
* 1/2 tsp [[cookbook:Salt|salt]] (to taste)

== Procedure ==
# [[cookbook:Chop|Chop]] cucumbers and tomatoes into small cubes (approx. 1/4&quot; on the side)
# Peel and chop the onion
# Combine all of the above in an appropriately sized bowl
# Add sunflower oil and mix well
# Add salt to taste and mix again

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* Sunflower oil is usually available at ethnic stores. If not available, it can be substituted for any vegetable oil, although that will change the authentic taste.
* A chopped [[cookbook:green onions|green onion]] or a couple can be optionally added to the mix for a &quot;greener&quot; taste.
* The salad should better be all used up at once; the taste starts to deteriorate after a few hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Computer systems are made up of Hardware, Software, and Applications. ''Hardware'' refers to the physical components of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, hard drive and system board. ''Software'' refers to the set of instructions that directs the hardware to accomplish a task. The best known example of software is a computer's operating system, which provides a way for the user to interact with the hardware. Software uses hardware to perform four basic functions: input, processing, storage, and output. An ''application'' is specialized software that performs a certain function, such as word processing or media reproduction.

I think the area of copyright in schools is going to be a very big issue in the coming years. The biggest problem that I see with copyright is that no one seems to be on the same page in terms of what is allowed. Legal gray areas such as educational fair use can also complicate matters. I believe that schools should be latitude as the mission of schools is education. JJA</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Conditions for a situation to be normally distributed'''

If a situation is to be binomially distributed it must satisfy the following conditions.

1. The event must have only two possible outcomes.The outcomes are normally termed as 'success' ( denoted by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; ) and failure ( denoted by &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; )

2. The two outcomes must be independent.

== Converting Binomial distribution into a Normal Distribution ==

If an event is to be repeated &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; number of times with constant (independent) probabilities of both the possible outcomes occurring, by calculating the mean (&lt;math&gt; n * p&lt;/math&gt; ) of the distribution and the variance ( &lt;math&gt;n * p * q&lt;/math&gt; ) of the distribution, the binomial distribution can be converted into an '''approximate''' normal distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Visualizing Computation|A Compendium of Visual Techniques for Understanding the Execution of Software}}

Diagrams play a central role in communication in many fields, and computer science is no exception—our classroom lectures, research talks, textbooks, and Wikipedia pages are full of visual material to complements to our words.
The forms of these diagrams are typically defined vaguely if at all.
While this may be appropriate in a lecture setting,
uncertainty about the diagram can lead to confusion as students study their notes or books.
'''Visualizing Computation''' is an [[#The_Visualizations|archive of definitions]] of useful visualization techniques
that are often used in lectures without extensive discussion.

== Scope ==
Each page of this book covers a particular approach to visualizing some aspect of the execution of software.
Each page should serve as a stand-alone definition of the ''diagram style'',
but not a complete description of the system being visualized.
For example, '''Visualizing Computation''' describes 
[[/Memory_Evolution_Diagrams|diagrams that can be used to illustrate stack frame layout or evolving stack frame layouts]],
but leaves the definition and use of stack frames for the
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack Wikipedia call stack entry] or professor's lectures.
The visualizations themselves may be static illustrations of static entities,
techniques for capturing evolution-over-time in a static image,
or (in principle) animations.

== Why a Wikibook? ==
This book is designed to collect topics too specialized even for Wikipedia's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability notability] policy (&quot;Wikipedia is not a directory of everything in existence&quot;).
In particular, descriptions of interesting local variations in drawing style are ''encouraged'', not discouraged.
This project itself stems from repeated observations by [http://www.cs.haverford.edu/people/davew Wonnacott's] students at [http://www.haverford.edu Haverford College], who pointed out the difficulties of taking good notes when the professor keeps erasing and overwriting the same diagram.

== Contributing ==
Policy: ''If a diagram you draw or see isn't defined in this text, please add it (or have your student add it).''
Refer to the [[/style|style guide]] for ideas of what belongs in a page,
or the [[/quick-start|quick-start guide]] if you have never added to a Wikibooks or Wikipedia entry before.

Note to authors of papers and textbooks: According to the answer I got in the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General|reading room]],
uploading your content constitutes a non-exclusive grant to copy.
As I understand things, this means you can still use the version you uploaded however you like
(as long as you don't grant someone ''else'' an exclusive copyright),
so you can still include your original material in non-GFDL documents
(though you should probably make a traditional publisher aware of the GFDL version that's out there).
If you are unsure about the legal status of material you are using,
it should be sufficient to pick a different example and draw a fresh diagram
that's not covered by someone else's copyright.

== The Visualizations ==
* [[/Memory Evolution Diagrams|Memory layout and memory evolution]] diagrams
* Drawings of [[/Call Trees|call trees]]
* Drawing graphs of data-flow [[/Data-flow graphs|among statements of a function]] or [[/Instance-wise data-flow graphs|among different executions of statements]]
* [[/Function Machine/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Each page should include a concise definition of the object or process being visualized,
preferably with a link to some online resource explaining the topic in detail.

The approach to visualization should be clearly defined, with examples.
The page should include links to other approaches to visualizing the same thing,
and (if appropriate) links to examples of visualizing other things in the same way.
If there are several variants of the approach,
they can be listed on one page or several inter-linked pages.

A bit of context or history is also nice --- when did you first see (or use) this diagram in a lecture or book?
Is it primarily used in discussion of specialized research or to teach some basic principle?

A friend of mine is deported this yr of march,and he overstayed his visa in this country for 20 yrs,and they said that after a year of penalty,he can have a chance to get back here (japan) but because of 20 yrs of overstaying,is he have a chance to come back?or is there a chance that the immigration will issue visa even he overstayed for 20 yrs? Is that possible?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__

This page is a quick mini how-to designed for anyone who wishes to contribute a page to [[Visualizing Computation]] but does not have any prior experience building entries for Wikibooks or Wikipedia.
There are doubtless better references for anyone who wants to gain a deep understanding of working with wikis.

Here are some basic steps that can be used to create and edit a page for [[Visualizing Computation]]:

* Add a link to the name you'd like to use for your page, by
** clicking &quot;edit&quot; link by the section &quot;The Visualizations&quot; on the main [[Visualizing Computation]] page
** copy-and-paste one line and edit it to create a link to your not-yet-existing page
** click on &quot;save&quot; to save your edit --- you should now see the list of visualizations with your link in red
* Identify and copy a page with structure similar to the one you want to edit (perhaps the [[../Memory_Evolution_Diagrams|first entry of Visualizing Computation]])
** click on the existing page you'd like to copy (if you're not already looking at it)
** click on the &quot;edit this page&quot; link at the top of the page
** select and copy all the text of the page (in the window pane in the center of the editing window)
* Use your brower's back button (about twice) to get back to the list of visualizations
* Create your page by just clicking on your link and entering text for the page
** click on the red link you added before
** paste, into the edit pane, the text of the existing page you copied
** delete the bodies of the sections and enter your own text (or, better yet, paste your text into a word processor, edit it locally, and then paste the result into the Wikibooks site)
** the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cheatsheet wikipedia cheatsheet] is a useful reference for wiki text
* Apparently wikimedia drawings are conventionally done as SVG --- to enter your examples of visualization techniques
** Download, install, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_draw_a_diagram_with_Inkscape learn] to use an SVG editor such as [http://www.inkscape.org Inkscape] (I had real problems with my image size until I discovered that I could [http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/TricksAndTips#Adjusting_the_Canvas_Size_to_Fit_Your_Image set the canvas size to my image size]; also non-integer canvas sizes make many renderers display a solid black image, scale or rotate incorrectly, or otherwise crash --- so after any automatic adjustment make sure the height and width are integers.)
** Upload the resulting file using the &quot;upload file&quot; entry in the Wikimedia &quot;toolbox&quot; (on the left as you're editing text). [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Uploading_images#Multiproject_upload Uploading] to [[commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]] will allow broader use of the image.
** Create a link as you would for [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Images Wikipedia].

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
This page provides several examples how the Bref Template can be used to implement different book reference and citation styles.

==Example 1==

This example demonstrates basic Bref template functionality. The style illustrated is a book with a single references section located at the end of the book with references interspersed in chapter text. The example has three chapters and a references page. A fifth [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example1/Citations_List | Citations List page]] is used to hold citation data that is not rendered directly. This example also illustrates the use of a default Citations List Page.

===[[/Example1/Chapter 1 | Chapter 1]]===

===[[/Example1/Chapter 2 | Chapter 2]]===

===[[/Example1/Chapter 3 | Chapter 3 ]]===

===[[/Example1/References | References]]===

==Example 2==

This example demonstrates how Bref template functionality may be used to format references and citations on a chapter by chapter basis. The style illustrated is a book with two chapters, the first comprised of 3 wiki markup pages, the second comprised of 2 wiki markup pages and each chapter terminated (on its last wiki markup page) by a references section. The example uses two citations list pages: [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example2/Citations List 1 | Citations List 1]], and [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example2/Citations List 2 | Citations List 2]] that hold the book's citation data. This example does not use the default Citations List Page.

===[[/Example2/Chapter1/Markup Page 1 | Chapter 1, Markup Page 1]]===

===[[/Example2/Chapter1/Markup Page 2 | Chapter 1, Markup Page 2]]===

===[[/Example2/Chapter1/Markup Page 3 | Chapter 1, Markup Page 3]]===

===[[/Example2/Chapter2/Markup Page 1 | Chapter 2, Markup Page 1]]=== 

===[[/Example2/Chapter2/Markup Page 2 | Chapter 2, Markup Page 2]]===

==Example 3==

This example demonstrates how Bref template functionality may be used to support both citations and footnotes. The example book has two chapters, the first comprised of 3 wiki markup pages, the second comprised of 2 wiki markup pages. The first chapter is organized so that the first page contains links to the other two pages of the chapter. Each chapter is terminated by a footnotes section and all citations for the book are rendered on a separate references page. The example uses three citations list pages, the first two for chapter specific footnotes, [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example3/Chapter 1 Footnotes | Chapter 1 Footnotes]], and [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example3/Chapter 2 Footnotes | Chapter 2 Footnotes]], and the third [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example3/Citations | Book Citations]] for the book's citation data.

===[[/Example3/Chapter1/Markup Page 1 | Chapter 1, Markup Page 1]]===

===[[/Example3/Chapter2/Markup Page 1 | Chapter 2, Markup Page 1]]=== 

===[[/Example3/Chapter2/Markup Page 2 | Chapter 2, Markup Page 2]]===

===[[/Example3/References | References Page]]===

==Example 4==

This example demonstrates advanced use of Bref. The book comprises 3 chapters. At the end of the first two chapters are references and footnote sections. At the end of the third chapter is a footnotes section. At the end of the book is a master references section that organizes citations by type: 1) Conference papers, 2) Journal articles, and 3) Books. The third chapter references use the master references section in order to illustrate the use of tagged references (in this case, each reference specifies whether it is a Conference Paper (C), a Journal Article (J) or a Book (B)). This example also uses the Place Holder reference in Chapter 1. 

The three chapter citation lists are located at [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example4/Citations List 1 | Citations List 1]], [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example4/Citations List 2 | Citations List 2]], and [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example4/Citations List 3 | Citations List 3]]. The master references citation list is located at [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example4/Master Citations | Book Citations List]]. The three chapter footnote citation lists are located at [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example4/Chapter 1 Footnotes | Chapter 1 Footnotes]], [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example4/Chapter 2 Footnotes | Chapter 2 Footnotes]], and [[User:Dnessett/Bref_Examples/Example4/Chapter 3 Footnotes | Chapter 3 Footnotes]].
