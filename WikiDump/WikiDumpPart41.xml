== State Equation Solutions ==

{{SideBox|The solutions in this chapter are heavily rooted in prior knowledge of [[Ordinary Differential Equations]]. Readers should have a prior knowledge of that subject before reading this chapter.}}

The state equation is a first-order linear differential equation, or (more precisely) a system of linear differential equations. Because this is a first-order equation, we can use results from [[Ordinary Differential Equations]] to find a general solution to the equation in terms of the state-variable ''x''. Once the state equation has been solved for ''x'', that solution can be plugged into the output equation. The resulting equation will show the direct relationship between the system input and the system output, without the need to account explicitly for the internal state of the system. The sections in this chapter will discuss the solutions to the state-space equations, starting with the easiest case (Time-invariant, no input), and ending with the most difficult case (Time-variant systems).

== Solving for x(t) With Zero Input ==

Looking again at the state equation:

:&lt;math&gt;x' = Ax(t) + Bu(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that this equation is a first-order differential equation, except that the variables are vectors, and the coefficients are matrices. However, because of the rules of matrix calculus, these distinctions don't matter. We can ignore the input term (for now), and rewrite this equation in the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = Ax(t)&lt;/math&gt;

And we can separate out the variables as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx(t)}{x(t)} = A dt&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating both sides, and raising both sides to a power of ''e'', we obtain the result:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = e^{At+C}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''C'' is a constant. We can assign ''D = e&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;'' to make the equation easier, but we also know that ''D'' will then be the initial conditions of the system. This becomes obvious if we plug the value zero into the variable ''t''. The final solution to this equation then is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = e^{A(t-t_0)}x(t_0)&lt;/math&gt;

We call the matrix exponential ''e&lt;sup&gt;At&lt;/sup&gt;'' the '''state-transition matrix''', and calculating it, while difficult at times, is crucial to analyzing and manipulating systems. We will talk more about calculating the matrix exponential below.

== Solving for x(t) With Non-Zero Input ==

If, however, our input is non-zero (as is generally the case with any interesting system), our solution is a little bit more complicated. Notice that now that we have our input term in the equation, we will no longer be able to separate the variables and integrate both sides easily. 

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We subtract to get the &lt;math&gt;Ax(t)&lt;/math&gt; on the left side, and then we do something curious; we premultiply both sides by the inverse state transition matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-At}x'(t) - e^{-At}Ax(t) = e^{-At}Bu(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The rationale for this last step may seem fuzzy at best, so we will illustrate the point with an example:

=== Example ===

{{TextBox|1= Take the derivative of the following with respect to time:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-At}x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The product rule from differentiation reminds us that if we have two functions multiplied together:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)g(t)&lt;/math&gt;

and we differentiate with respect to t, then the result is:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)g'(t) + f'(t)g(t)&lt;/math&gt;

If we set our functions accordingly:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = e^{-At}\qquad f'(t) = -Ae^{-At}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(t) = x(t)\qquad g'(t) = x'(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Then the output result is:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-At}x'(t) - e^{-At}Ax(t)&lt;/math&gt;

If we look at this result, it is the same as from our equation above.}}

Using the result from our example, we can condense the left side of our equation into a derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d(e^{-At}x(t))}{dt} = e^{-At}Bu(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can integrate both sides, from the initial time (''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'') to the current time (''t''), using a dummy variable &amp;tau;, we will get closer to our result. Finally, if we premultiply by e&lt;sup&gt;At&lt;/sup&gt;, we get our final result:

{{eqn|General State Equation Solution}}
:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = e^{A(t-t_0)}x(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^{t}e^{A(t - \tau)}Bu(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

If we plug this solution into the output equation, we get:

{{eqn|General Output Equation Solution}}
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = Ce^{A(t-t_0)}x(t_0) + C\int_{t_0}^{t}e^{A(t - \tau)}Bu(\tau)d\tau + Du(t)&lt;/math&gt;

This is the general Time-Invariant solution to the state space equations, with non-zero input. These equations are important results, and students who are interested in a further study of control systems would do well to memorize these equations.

== State-Transition Matrix ==

{{SideBox|More information about '''matrix exponentials''' can be found in:&lt;br&gt; '''[[Engineering Analysis]]'''}}

The state transition matrix, ''e&lt;sup&gt;At&lt;/sup&gt;'', is an important part of the general state-space solutions for the time-invariant cases listed above. Calculating this matrix exponential function is one of the very first things that should be done when analyzing a new system, and the results of that calculation will tell important information about the system in question. 

The matrix exponential can be calculated directly by using a Taylor-Series expansion:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{At} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(At)^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;

{{SideBox|More information about '''diagonal matrices''' and '''Jordan-form matrices''' can be found in:&lt;br&gt; '''[[Engineering Analysis]]'''}}

Also, we can attempt to diagonalize the matrix A into a '''diagonal matrix''' or a '''Jordan Canonical matrix'''. The exponential of a diagonal matrix is simply the diagonal elements individually raised to that exponential. The exponential of a Jordan canonical matrix is slightly more complicated, but there is a useful pattern that can be exploited to find the solution quickly. Interested readers should read the relevant passages in [[Engineering Analysis]].

The state transition matrix, and matrix exponentials in general are very important tools in control engineering.

=== Diagonal Matrices ===

If a matrix is diagonal, the state transition matrix can be calculated by raising each diagonal entry of the matrix raised as a power of ''e''. 

=== Jordan Canonical Form ===

If the A matrix is in the Jordan Canonical form, then the matrix exponential can be generated quickly using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{Jt} = e^{\lambda t} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; t &amp; \frac{1}{2!}t^2 &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{1}{n!}t^n \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; t &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{1}{(n-1)!}t^{n-1} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''&amp;lambda;'' is the eigenvalue (the value on the diagonal) of the jordan-canonical matrix.

=== Inverse Laplace Method ===

We can calculate the state-transition matrix (or any matrix exponential function) by taking the following inverse Laplace transform:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{At} = \mathcal{L}^{-1}[(sI - A)^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;

If A is a high-order matrix, this inverse can be difficult to solve.

If the A matrix is in the Jordan Canonical form, then the matrix exponential can be generated quickly using the following formula:

    &lt;math&gt;e^{Jt} = e^{\lambda t} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; t &amp; \frac{1}{2!}t^2 &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{1}{n!}t^n \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; t &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{1}{(n-1)!}t^{n-1} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Where λ is the eigenvalue (the value on the diagonal) of the jordan-canonical matrix.

=== Spectral Decomposition ===

If we know all the eigenvalues of ''A'', we can create our transition matrix ''T'', and our inverse transition matrix ''T&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;'' These matrices will be the matrices of the right and left eigenvectors, respectively. If we have both the left and the right eigenvectors, we can calculate the state-transition matrix as:

{{eqn|Spectral Decomposition}}
:&lt;math&gt; e^{At} = \sum_{i = 1}^ne^{\lambda_i t} v_i w_i'&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;' '' is the transpose of the ''i''th left-eigenvector, not the derivative of it. We will discuss the concepts of &quot;eigenvalues&quot;, &quot;eigenvectors&quot;, and the technique of spectral decomposition in more detail in a later chapter.

=== Cayley-Hamilton Theorem ===

{{SideBox|For more information on the '''Cayley-Hamilton Theorem''', see:&lt;br&gt;'''[[Engineering Analysis]]'''}}

The '''Cayley-Hamilton Theorem''' can also be used to find a solution for a matrix exponential. For any eigenvalue of the system matrix ''A'', ''&amp;lambda;'', we can show that the two equations are equivalent:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\lambda t} = a_0 + a_1 \lambda t + a_2 \lambda^2t^2 + \cdots + a_{n-1}\lambda^{n-1}t^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Once we solve for the coefficients of the equation, ''a'', we can then plug those coefficients into the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{At} = a_0I + a_1 A t + a_2 A^2 t^2 + \cdots + a_{n-1} A^{n-1} t^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: Off-Diagonal Matrix ===

{{TextBox|1=Given the following matrix A, find the state-transition matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We can find the eigenvalues of this matrix as ''&amp;lambda;'' = ''i'', -''i''. If we plug these values into our eigenvector equation, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}i &amp; -1 \\1 &amp; i\end{vmatrix} v_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}-i &amp; -1 \\1 &amp; -i\end{vmatrix} v_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

And we can solve for our eigenvectors:

:&lt;math&gt;v_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ i\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_2 = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ -i\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

With our eigenvectors, we can solve for our left-eigenvectors:

:&lt;math&gt;w_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ -i\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;w_2 = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ i\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, using spectral decomposition, we can construct the state-transition matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{At} = e^{it}\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ i\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; -i\end{bmatrix} + e^{-it}\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ -i\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; i\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If we remember Euler's Identity, we can decompose the complex exponentials into sinusoids. Performing the vector multiplications, all the imaginary terms cancel out, and we are left with our result:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{At} = \begin{bmatrix}\cos t &amp; \sin t \\ -\sin t &amp; \cos t\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The reader is encouraged to perform the multiplications, and attempt to derive this result.}}

=== Example: MATLAB Calculation ===

{{TextBox|1=Using the '''symbolic toolbox''' in MATLAB, we can write MATLAB code to automatically generate the state-transition matrix for a given input matrix ''A''. Here is an example of MATLAB code that can perform this task:

 function [phi] = statetrans(A)
    t = sym('t');
    phi = expm(A * t);
 end

Use this MATLAB function to find the state-transition matrix for the following matrices (warning, calculation may take some time):

#&lt;math&gt;A_1 = \begin{bmatrix}2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 2\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;A_2 = \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;A_3 = \begin{bmatrix}2 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 2\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Matrix 1 is a diagonal matrix, Matrix 2 has complex eigenvalues, and Matrix 3 is Jordan canonical form. These three matrices should be representative of some of the common forms of system matrices. The following code snippets are the input commands into MATLAB to produce these matrices, and the output results:

;Matrix A1:
 &gt;&gt; A1 = [2 0 ; 0 2];
 &gt;&gt; statetrans(A1)
  
 ans =
  
 [ exp(2*t),        0]
 [        0, exp(2*t)]

;Matrix A2:
 &gt;&gt; A2 = [0 1 ; -1 0];
 &gt;&gt; statetrans(A1)
  
 ans =
  
 [  cos(t),  sin(t)]
 [ -sin(t),  cos(t)]

;Matrix A3:
 &gt;&gt; A1 = [2 1 ; 0 2];
 &gt;&gt; statetrans(A1)
  
 ans =
  
 [   exp(2*t), t*exp(2*t)]
 [          0,   exp(2*t)]
;
}}

=== Example: Multiple Methods in MATLAB ===

{{TextBox|1=There are multiple methods in MATLAB to compute the state transtion matrix, from a scalar (time-invariant) matrix A. The following methods are all going to rely on the ''Symbolic Toolbox'' to perform the equation manipulations. At the end of each code snippet, the variable '''eAt''' contains the state-transition matrix of matrix A.

;Direct Method:

 t = sym('t');
 eAt = expm(A * t);

;Laplace Transform Method:

 s = sym('s');
 [n,n] = size(A);
 in = inv(s*eye(n) - A);
 eAt = ilaplace(in);

;Spectral Decomposition:

 t = sym('t');
 [n,n] = size(A);
 [V, e] = eig(A);
 W = inv(V);
 sum = [0 0;0 0];
 for I = 1:n
    sum = sum + expm(e(I,I)*t)*V(:,I)*W(I,:);
 end;
 eAt = sum;

All three of these methods should produce the same answers. The student is encouraged to verify this.}}

=Scanners=
===Flatbed===
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scanners take images like text, photographs or even small objects and convert them into digital images. The scanner most of us have probably used is the '''Flatbed'''. For office use this by far the most cost efficient and relibale scanner.&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; The '''Hand Held''' is type of scanner that relies heavily on the steadiness of the hands doing the scanning. Unsteady hands dragging the device could result in the image distorting. The hand held's images are normally reproduced in monochrome. Due to it's inefficiency the hand held's popularity declined in the 90's.&lt;/br&gt;
===Drum===
&lt;br&gt; One of the earliest but still useful incarnations of the scanner is called the '''Drum'''. Scanning is done by first soaking the image in oil, then wrapping it around the drum and rotating it in front of a photomultiplier tube. Although, the drum can create higher resolution and shaper images, it is not used as widely used as the flatbed due to the cost and size. However, it is still used for high end scanning tasks like archiving photos in a museum.&lt;/br&gt;
===3 Dimensional===
&lt;br&gt;The ''' 3D''' scanner records &quot;points&quot; on the surface of an object to create a 3 dimensional effect like that found in video games. 3D scanning often requires numerous scans from several different angles. Like a camera it cannot record images that are unclear.&lt;/br&gt;
===Sci Fi Scanners===
&lt;br&gt; And then of course there are the &quot;Scanners&quot; with telepathic and telekinektic abilities, like those in the infamous David Cronenburg film Scanners, where people with the abiility to scan minds are used to aquire sensitive information on security systems. The movie begins with a Scanners head exploding prusumably from trying to scan the brain of someone with too much info in it.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'''Sesame oil''' is a rich, aromatic oil widely used in cooking across [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asia]], and to some degree throughout the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]]. It is usually extracted after toasting the sesame seeds, which gives the oil a pleasant nutty flavor.

'''Rocky Road''' is an [[Cookbook:Ice Cream|ice cream]] flavor, second only to [[cookbook:vanilla|vanilla]] in popularity in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]]. Though there are variations on the flavor, it is traditionally composed of chocolate ice cream, [[Cookbook:Nuts and seeds|nuts]] and marshmallows. The flavor is claimed to have been created in 1929 by William Dreyer when he cut up [[cookbook:almond|almond]] and marshmallows with his wife's sewing scissors and added them to his chocolate ice cream during the Great Depression. The company claims it was then so named &quot;to give folks something to smile about in the midst of the Great Depression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dreyersinc.com/about/WebHistory.pdf| title = Dreyer's History| accessdate = April 5|accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, California, claims that William Dreyer based his recipe on a Rocky Road ice cream invented by his friend, Fenton's George Farren, who blended his Rocky Road candy bar into ice cream; however Dreyer substituted pecans for almonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fentonscreamery.com/blender.html| title = Fenton's Blender Club:Rocky Road Ice Cream| accessdate = April 5| accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

exists ''where''? [unsigned]

:In Australia, rocky road is known almost exclusively as a confection, with nothing to do with ice cream. I have modified the article to indicate this. I suspect &quot;rocky road&quot; means slightly different things in many countries, so it shouldn't be described only as an ice cream flavour. If other editors could add/clarify other regional meanings, that would help. -[[User:Dmmaus|dmmaus]] 04:03, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

==Screening==

**Randomized. 53,454 persons, between 55 and 74 year of age, at high risk for lung cancer, randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose CT or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography.
**Outcome: Rate of positive screening tests: 24.2% (low-dose CT) vs. 6.9% (radiography); False positive: 96.4% vs. 94.5%; Diagnosis: 645 cases per 100,000 person-years vs. 572 per 100,000 person-years (rate ratio 1.13, 95%CI: 1.03 to 1.23); 20.0% (SS) relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose CT screening.
**Conclusion: Screening with the use of low-dose CT reduces mortality from lung cancer. 

*'''Multi-Institutional, 2007''' PMID 17341709 -- &quot;Computed tomography screening and lung cancer outcomes.&quot; (Bach PB, JAMA. 2007 Mar 7;297(9):953-61.)
**Retrospective. 3246 asymptomatic current or former smokers, annual CT screening, began in 1998. 3 institutions (Milan, Mayo, Moffitt)
**Outcome: Diagnosis: 144 patients vs. 44 expected (RR 3.2, SS); lung resection 109 vs. expected 11 (RR 10.0, SS); advanced cases 42 vs. expected 33 (NS); deaths 38 vs. expected 39 (NS)
**Conclusion: Screening increases rate of diagnosis and treatment, but may not reduce death from lung cancer
**[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/science/13lung.html?ex=1184644800&amp;en=4ee8b24fa7429fba&amp;ei=5070 NY Times commentary],  -- &quot;How Two Studies on Cancer Screening Led to Two Results&quot; (Welch GH, NY Times, March 13, 2007).

**31,567 pts. Screening annually using low-dose CT. 
**484 lung cancers detected. 85% had Stage I. Of those Stage I pts, 10-year survival rate was 88% (92% for those who underwent surgical resection).
**Conclusion: Annual CT screening can detect lung cancer that is curable.
**Comment: Interpretation of survival data only in those screened positive. Concern about lead-time and length bias, since those patients diagnosed earlier may live longer (longer survival) but have same death rate nonetheless. Not clear who should be screened.

**Review. Algorithm described:
**Compare current study with old study (CXR or CT). If growth, biopsy
**If no old study, do CT. If benign calcification or fat, no action
**If nodule on CT:
***If immunocompromised or fever, consider short (4-6 week) follow up or biopsy
***If history of malignancy, consider follow-up CT (3, 6, 12 months)
***Otherwise, look at size:
****If &lt;=4mm, repeat CT (timing depends on age). If growth, biopsy
****If 4-8mm, repeat CT (timing depends on age). If growth, biopsy
****If &gt;8mm, biopsy or PET

**Most lesions: granulomas, hamartomas, or lung cancer

Trifle is also commonly known as sherry trifle.  This is a traditional dessert in many countries and can be prepared with or without alcohol.  The non-alcohol version is popular with children in countries where it might be inappropriate to allow children to consume products with alcohol in.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 [[wikipedia:Swiss roll|swiss roll]] or similar sponge cake
* 50 to 100ml dry [[Cookbook:Sherry|Sherry]]
* 1 packet/sachet Fruit flavoured [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] (or &quot;Quick-Jel&quot;)
* A tin of [[Cookbook:Peach|peach]] segments
* [[Cookbook:Custard|Custard]]
* Whipped double [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
* ''Hundreds and thousands'' or other sweet topping (optional)

== Procedure == 
# Slice the swiss roll approximately 3/4&quot; (2cm) thick, and line the base of a Pyrex casserole dish with it.
# Pour a small glass of sherry (approx 50 to 100ml) over the swiss roll.
# Drain the peaches, keeping the juice/syrup aside and then arrange the peaches over the swiss roll.
# Prepare the jelly as per the instructions, you may wish to use the syrup from the peaches for this. Pour the jelly into the casserole dish and allow to set in the fridge. &quot;Quick-Jel&quot; may be preferable due to time taken to set.
# Make the custard, again as per the instructions (use fresh or powdered as opposed to canned). Allow this to cool to lukewarm, and pour into the casserole. Allow this to set in the fridge.
# Whip the cream for the top of the trifle and spread it over the custard. Garnish with ''hundreds and thousands''/vermicelli or other cake decorations.

Serve!

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
Without microchips you would not be reading this page... [[w:microtechnology|Microtechnology]] and [[w:microfabrication|microfabrication]] is a fundamental prerequisite for modern life.

This wikibook can hopefully become an opensource handbook in microfabrication. With the possibility to spawn subchapters, it should be possible to make detailed discussions of the various fabrication techniques and the processing details.

The devil is in the detail, and most people doing processing seem to have the same few lists that have been made on etch rates etc. Here, in the wiki system, users should be able to contribute and expand the readily available knowledge.

Hope you will contribute!! Things can always be changed, so its better to add things and comments to the book than just reading it!! Don't be afraid to participate :-)

Micro technology involves changing things in the scale of one micro metre, thats 0.000001 m or (10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; m)

=Overview=
[[Image:Electronic_structure_of_materials.jpg|thumb|400px|
Overview of the electronic structure of the different fundamental classes of materials.

'''Atoms''' have discrete energy levels for each electronic state. Electronic transitions by eg. optical excitation can change the state of the atom.

'''Molecules''' can also have discrete energy levels, but the more complex structure also gives a much more complex diagram of electronic states. In addition, the molecules can rotate and vibrate which modulates the observed energy levels.

'''Insulators''' can be seen as a condensed phase of molecules with little electronic connection between neighboring molecules for conducting a current. Only when excitation is made with an energy above the several eV bandgap will conduction be possible.

'''Semiconductors''' have a more narrow bandgap and even at room temperature a few conduction electrons will be excited into the conductance band.

'''Doped Semiconductors''' have higher electrical conductance because added dopants provide conduction electrons.

'''Metals''' can be considered as ionized metal atoms in a sea of free electrons, giving a high conductivity and high reflectivity of light (as long as it is not too high in frequency)

=Silicon=

The traditional material for microfabrication is silicon and a wealth of processes have been developed to work with silicon wafers.

There are several different silicon crystal orientations as well as polycrystalline silicon (often called polysilicon) to choose between, and these orientations all have their own material parameters.

The Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and shear modulus are transversely and vertically isotropic for Si111 whereas these vary significantly for Si100 and Si110
&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Wortman and R. A. Evans, “Young’s modulus, shear modulus, and Poissons ratio in silicon and germanium”, J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 36, 153-156 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;W. A. Brantley, “Calculated eleastic constants for stress problems associated with semiconductor devices”, J. Appl. Phys., vol. 44, 534-535 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Youngs modulus for polysilicon has values within that of crystalline silicon 
&lt;ref&gt;D. Maier-Schneider, J. Mansour, E. Oberheimer, D. Schneider, „Variation in Young’s Modulus and intrinsic stress of LPCVD-polysilicon due tohigh temperature annealing“, J. Micromech. Microeng. 3, 121-124 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;, 
which indicates that it is not affected by the grain boundaries, but is highly dependent on crystal orientation as well as the intrinsic stress &lt;ref&gt;P. J. French, “Polysilicon: a versatile material for microsystems”, Sensors and Actuators A 99 (2002), 3-12&lt;/ref&gt;.

Bulk shear modulus (which governs torsional motion) varies minimally on silicon (111), with respect to crystallographic directions, as compared to silicon (100) and (110)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim&quot;&gt; J. Kim, D. Cho and R. S. Muller, “Why is (111) silicon a better mechanical material for MEMS?”, TRANSDUCERS '01. EUROSENSORS XV, vol.1, 662-665 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;.

It should be kept in mind that the values of Young’s modulus for microstructures are very much dependent on the size of the structure &lt;ref&gt;W. N. Sharpe, K. M. Jackson, K. J. Hemker, and Z. Xie, “Effect of Specimen  Size in Young’s Modulus and Fracture Strength of Polysilicon”, J. Microeletromechanical Systems, vol. 10, no. 2, 317-326 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon is a nonlinear material, where the material parameters such as  thermal coefficient of expansion, conductivity, and piezoresistivity  all depend on the temperature. Care must be taken when modelling the behaviour devices with a wide temperature variation.

This table indicates that Si 111 is an attractive material compared to other Si crystal orientations when only considering the mechanical properties, because it is providing a rigid structure by the high Young’s modulus, low Poisson’s ratio, high shear modulus and also the simplest because it is transversely and vertically isotropic.

=IV Semiconductors=
Of the IV group elements C,Si,Ge,Sn,Pb; Si and Ge are considered semiconductors although graphite,a allotropic form of carbon is conducting but its conductivity is too high than the standard semiconductors.So,it is like the metal.

Processes where material is added to the wafer.

=Overview=

=Oxidation=

Oxidation in microtechnology refers most often to the oxidation of silicon. A layer of silicon dioxide created on the surface of a silicon wafer can be easily patterned.
An SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer can be created by [[w:Thermal oxidation|thermal oxidation]] or by [[w:Chemical_vapor_deposition#Silicon_dioxide|deposition]].

=Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)=
*[[w:Chemical vapor deposition|Chemical vapor deposition and plasma enhanced CVD]]

=Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)=
*[[w:Physical vapor deposition|Physical vapor deposition (PVD)]]

==Sputter Deposition==
*[[w:sputtering]]
*[[w:Thin-film deposition|Thin-film deposition]]

[[Image:DCplasmaSputtering.jpg|thumb|300px|Energetic ions sputter material off the target which diffuse through the plasma towards the substrate where it is deposited. There is no strong plasma glow around the cathode since it takes a certain distance for the plasma to be generated by electron avalanches started by a few secondary electrons from the sputtering process.
]]

==Electron Beam Evaporation Coating==
*[[w:Electron Beam Evaporation|Electron Beam Evaporation Coating]]

=Epitaxial Growth=
*[[w:MOVPE|Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE)]]
*[[w:Molecular beam epitaxy|Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)]] using solid sources and [[w:Chemical beam epitaxy|Chemical beam epitaxy (CBE)]] using gasseuos sources.
*[[w:Epitaxy|Epitaxy]] in general.
*[[w:Atomic layer epitaxy|Atomic layer epitaxy]] where only a few monolayers are deposited and bond to chemisorption sites on the surface.

=Electrochemical Methods=
==Electroplating==
*[[w:Electroplating|Electroplating]]
*list of standard reaction potentials [[Standard Reduction Potentials|standard reduction potentials]]

==Electroless depositions==

=Spinning=
Photo and electron beam resists as well as many other polymers are often coated on wafers by spinning a volatile solution of the compund onto the wafer.

=Surface Functionalization=
*[[w:Self-assembled monolayer|Self-assembled monolayers (SAM)]]
*[[w:Hydrophobe|Hydrophobe]] and [[w:Hydrophile|Hydrophile]] surface layers to control [[w:wetting|wetting]].

=Capillary Effects=
The surface tension of a wet etch solution can often make problems with movable parts in microchips and droplet formations that leave residues.

==Avoiding capillary effects==
*Use dry/gas etching instead of wet (eg. HF vapor instead of HF solutions)
*Use critical point drying
*Quickly take from wet etchant into a water rinse bath for a thorough rinse and then quickly into an ethanol bath and then dry - the low surface tension of ethanol reduces capillary effects when drying.
*use silicon structures with an oxide sacrificial layer - the very hydrophobic hydrogen terminated silicon after a HF wet etch will avoid capillary effects.

=Silicon KOH Etch=
[[w:Potassium hydroxide|Potassium hydroxide (KOH)]] is an anisotropic wet etch that preferentially etches the 100 planes of Si and almost doesn't attack the 111 planes. This leads to a V shaped pyramidal holes in Si 100 from square openings in the etch mask, with side edges at a 54.7deg angle from the surface. The etch rate does not depend on As, P, Sb dopants, but too high B doping will reduce the etchrate in the 110 direction.
The etchrate in the 100 and 110 direction can be varied by adding isopropanol to the solution.

Overall reaction:
Si + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

KOH% determination: KOH (%) = KOH dry mass(g) / solvents(ml) 

Recipe for a typical 30% KOH/Isopropanol etch solution:
*70g KOH pellets dissolved in 190mL DI water (use heat and/or ultrasound to dissolve quickly)
*Add 40mL Isopropanol
*The etch rate for should be about 1 micron/minute at 80°C

KOH etch masks can be made from silicon nitride or silicon oxide (though SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is slowly etched by KOH)

=Silicon Oxide Etch (HF, BHF, BOE)=
NB: HF is very dangerous, it diffuses quicker than anýthing you can add to try and reduce the damage, so the key is NOT to get in touch with it in the first place. It attacks the calcium in your bones, the nerves, and the bloodvessels - and importantly, it does not burn like other acids!! Wear labcoats, eyeprotection and 6h gloves, and work in a closed fumehood.

Fundamental reaction
SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6HF -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;+ 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Etchants:
*[[w:HF|HF]] or [[w:Hydrofluoric acid|Hydrofluoric acid]] is a highly corrosive and toxic solution of [[w:hydrogen fluoride|hydrogen fluoride]] in water.
*Buffered Hydrofluoric Etch (BHF) or [[w:BOE|Buffered Oxide Etch (BOE)]] is a mixture of [[w:Ammonium fluoride|ammonium fluoride]] and hydrofluoric acid with a more controlled etch rate of silicon oxide.
*[[w:Ammonium fluoride|ammonium fluoride]] containing etches give silicon surfaces with an atomically smoother surface than HF, ammonium fluoride solutions can also be used to make atomically flat surfaces. See Appl. Phys. Lett. vol 56 p. 656 1990 by Higashi.

An oxide etch is often used to remove the impurity containing native oxide layer of wafers before contamination sensitive processes. BOE has a more controllable oxide etch rate than HF (the pH is stabilized by the buffer) but also etches Si slowly and the higher pH in BOE can cause metal precipitation, so for clean processes or thin underlying Si layers a HF etch is preferable.

*49% HF is used for fast removal of oxide
*BOE gives a slower removal of oxide, but can extend the lifetime of a photoresist mask. Etch rate typically 1000-2500 Å/min.
*Diluted HF etches - say 5% HF - is used for removal of native oxide in about 30 seconds. The surface becomes highly hydrophobic.
*HF/HCl or HF/Glycerin mixtures can be used to make less rough surfaces when thinning oxide layers
*HF mixed with isopropanol can be used to increase the wetting properties of the solution to better etch into narrow pores.

Etch rates vary depending on on oxide quality (eg. wether its wet furnace grown or PECVD)

Recipe for Buffered Oxide Etch or Buffered Hydrofluoric Etch
*Prepare the 40% NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F solution, eg 40g NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F in 60mL water.
*6 parts 40% NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F and 1 part 49% HF - HF etches glass so use plastic beakers! Add HF into NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F instead of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F into HF.

Recipe for BHF/HCl etch for smooth oxide
*add 5mL Buffered Oxide etch as above to 85mL water
*Add 10mL conc. HCl
Etch rate about 1 micron/min at room temperature.

=Silicon Nitride Etch=
Typical etch rates
*Standard etch in H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 100Å/min at 180°C, 55Å/min at 165°C. Use a short BHF dip first to remove oxynitride layer.
*10% HF 5000 Å/min
*1% HF 600 Å/min
*BHF (7:1) 5-20 Å/min

=Cleaning Methods=
There are several standard cleaning procedures. Some use a wealth of dangerous and highly corrosive chemicals.
Don't underestimate the power of keeping things clean, and also simple soap rinses before starting on the more dangerous processes will probably increase the quality of the result.

==Rinsing==
In cleanrooms you often see people rinsing by submerging a wafer into a bath with running water. This has the advantage that the wafers do not dry out and eventually whatever should be washed away will be removed.

But think of how you can get tea leaves out of a tea pot: If you put the pot under running water, it will probably never ever really get completely free from leaves, whereas if you pour as much out as possible, add a little water, empty again and repeat a couple of times, your pot is completely clean with almost no use of water.
The math is simple. If you add 1/10 of water pr minute in a large bath you dilution will take place very slowly compared to adding a small amount of water that maybe is gives a 50/50 dilution in one go and thereby rapidly decrease the fraction of original contaminant considerably.

Flushing your wafers with a jet of water probably orders of magnitude more efficient and faster at rinsing than submerging in a bath...

==Ultrasound==
Ultrasound baths work by standing waves of high frequency sound that at the wave anti-nodes create so high pressure variations that water vapor bubbles form and implode during the sounds pressure cycle. The bubble implosion creates shock waves that knock any loose material off surfaces and also can initiate chemical reactions or cause pitting in soft materials and damage smaller MEMS structures.

==Soap==
Don't underestimate the power of ordinary soap or more harsh treatments with surfactants such as Triton-X. Especially together with ultrasound. 

==RCA==
A standard wafer cleaning method developed by the RCA corp.
It is made from 2 baths:
*RCA1 is a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O:NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cleaning of organic residues
*RCA2 is a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O:HCl:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; etch of metal impurities.

RCA cleaning is often used before furnace processes.

==Piranha==
[[w:Piranha solution|Piranha solutions]] are often made from sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). But basic solutions and other recipes are also named piranha.
The solution is very corrosive.  Use fumehood, labcoat, eyeprotection and nitrile/6H gloves. To effectively demonstrate to  people how dangerous it is, try putting a small droplet on a piece of paper and it instantly is burning black with a hissing sound.

*Acid Piranha (Caro's acid, Sulfuric Peroxide) - for 10mL Piranha, pour 7mL 95% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into 3mL 30% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -use glass beakers. The mixture heats on mixing to about 80°C 

*Peroxydisulfuric etch (also nicknamed 7-up since it bubbles upon heating to 80°C).
This is a piranha etch with Ammoniumperoxydisulfate. Mix 1L 95% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 80°C with a table spoon of Ammoniumpersulfate. The solution will start to bubble indiacting that it is ready. It can be reused several times (add another spoon of Ammoniumperoxydisulfate every time) until it does not bubble anylinger and must be replaced.

*Base Piranha is a 3:1 mixture of ammonium hydroxide (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH) with hydrogen peroxide.

Piranha solutions etches organic compunds vigorously. It can form explosive compounds if mixed with organic solvents, so be careful and do not work near eg. acetone, ethanol or isopropanol with piranha.

The exothermic heat of mixing can bring solution temperatures up to 120°C and can lead to violent boiling, or even splashing of the extremely acidic solution. Explosions may occur if the peroxide solution concentration is more than 50%. A 30% peroxide in water solution is more reasonable.

Too thick organic contamination can harden up in piranha, so a degrease clean is often made before piranha cleaning.

For instance a sequential cleaning as follows is often used for substrates used for epitaxial growth:
*2min sonication in Tri-chlor ethylene
*2min sonication in acetone
*2min sonication in ethanol
*2min sonication in millipore water (MPW)
*then rinse in MPW 3 times.
*Piranha etch 6 min.
*Rinse in MPW 3 times.
*Dehydration bake 200-250°C for 30 min.

*Electron beam induced deposition
*PMMA
*[[w:SU-8 photoresist|SU-8]]
===Positive E-beam resists===
Positive e-beam resists will be removed in the electron irradiation areas upon development.
'''PMMA'''
Typical PMMA process
*300nm PMMA think film made by spinning 950k PMMA 5% in anisole at 5000rpm for 30sec (avoid bubbles in the resist when placing it on the wafer, use about 3ml for a 4&quot; wafer).
*drying 180C Hot plate for 2 min or oven bake for at least 2h at 180 C. Oven takes longer than hot plate as convection heat trasnfer is slower than contact transfer.
*Electrob beam lithography. Dosage depends on pattern density and acceleration voltage.
*Developing in MIBK:IPA (1:3) for 60s and rinse in IPA for 30s.
*Post bake to improve etch resistance. 30 min at 110C
*5 mBar Oxygen plasma in faraday cage for 20 sec to remove residual resist.
*For instance metal evaporation to form metal structures, followed by liftoff 5 min in hot remover s-1165 and acetone in several fresh baths to remove liftoff fragments.

**ZEP

=Resist Coatings=
*Spinning
*Electrochemical coating
*Spray coating (Spray coaters are made by eg. EVG)
*Drop casting
*Self assembled monolayers

= Reliability design rules =

Sandia has published a set of &quot;reliability design rules&quot; for MEMS devices intended to avoid
failure modes experienced in early MEMS device tests.
The most common failure mechanism was wear of the rubbing surfaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve">First, '''do not touch''' a person who comes into contact with a live electric wire.  If you do, the electricity will also flow through your body, and there will be two victims instead of one.  Instead, if you can quickly turn off the power source, do so immediately.  If it cannot be turned off quickly, try to knock the wire off with something that does not conduct electricity, such as a shoe (take it off first), a wooden broom handle, or a wooden chair.  

Once the victim has been separated from the electric power source, check for breathing.  If the victim is not breathing, begin artificial respiration (mouth-to-mouth).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rounding ==

To round a number, you need to look at the [[w:digit|digits]] right of the decimal. If the first digit right of the decimal is equal or higher than 5 in rank&lt;small&gt; (see [[Arithmetic/Spelling out numbers|Spelling out numbers]])&lt;/small&gt;, we add 1 to the integer part of the number, lopping off digits right of the decimal; this is known as rounding up. If the first digit right of the decimal place is less than 5 in rank, we simply rewrite the number again excluding all the digits right of the decimal place; this is known as rounding down. Note that after the number is rounded up or down all of the digits right of the decimal are discarded and only the digits left of the decimal are written.

== Rounding to integer ==
The most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer.

There are many ways of rounding a number ''y'' to an integer ''q''. The most common ones are
* '''round down''' (or take the '''[[w:floor and ceiling functions|floor]]''', or '''round towards minus infinity'''): ''q'' is the largest integer that does not exceed ''y''.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \mathrm{floor}(y) = \left\lfloor y \right\rfloor = -\left\lceil -y \right\rceil\,&lt;/math&gt;
* '''round up''' (or take the '''[[w:floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]]''', or '''round towards plus infinity'''): ''q'' is the smallest integer that is not less than ''y''.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \mathrm{ceil}(y) = \left\lceil y \right\rceil = -\left\lfloor -y \right\rfloor\,&lt;/math&gt;.* '''round towards zero''' (or '''[[w:truncation|truncate]]''', or '''round away from infinity'''): ''q'' is the integer part of ''y'', without its fraction digits.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \mathrm{truncate}(y) = \sgn(y) \left\lfloor \left| y \right| \right\rfloor = -\sgn(y) \left\lceil -\left| y \right| \right\rceil\,&lt;/math&gt;
* '''round away from zero''' (or '''round towards infinity'''): if ''y'' is an integer, ''q'' is ''y''; else ''q'' is the integer that is closest to 0 and is such that ''y'' is between 0 and ''q''. The [[w:sign function|signum function]] is used to determine the sign
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \sgn(y) \left\lceil \left| y \right| \right\rceil = -\sgn(y) \left\lfloor -\left| y \right| \right\rfloor\,&lt;/math&gt;
* '''round to nearest''': ''q'' is the integer that is closest to ''y''.

The first four methods are called '''directed rounding''', as the displacements from the original number ''y'' to the rounded value ''q'' are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, [[w:Extended real number line|+∞]], or −∞).

If ''y'' is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero. If ''y'' is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if ''y'' is integer, ''q'' is just ''y''. Here the table with the rounding methods:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
!width=&quot;25%&quot;| ''y''
!width=&quot;15%&quot;| round&lt;br /&gt; down&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;(towards −∞)&lt;/small&gt;
!width=&quot;15%&quot;| round&lt;br /&gt; up&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;(towards +∞)&lt;/small&gt;
!width=&quot;15%&quot;| round&lt;br /&gt; towards&lt;br /&gt; zero
!width=&quot;15%&quot;| round&lt;br /&gt; away from&lt;br /&gt; zero
!width=&quot;15%&quot;| round&lt;br /&gt; to&lt;br /&gt; nearest
|-
| +13.67 || +13 || +14 || +13 || +14 || +14
|-
| +13.50 || +13 || +14 || +13 || +14 || +14
|-
| +13.35 || +13 || +14 || +13 || +14 || +13
|-
| +13.00 || +13 || +13 || +13 || +13 || +13
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| −13.00 || −13 || −13 || −13 || −13 || −13
|-
| −13.35 || −14 || −13 || −13 || −14 || −13
|-
| −13.50 || −14 || −13 || −13 || −14 || −14
|-
| −13.67 || −14 || −13 || −13 || −14 || −14
|}

The choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result.

* fraction

== Lesson ==

A '''rational number''' is a fraction, written &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are integers.
&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''numerator'' and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; the ''denominator''.
Applied to a cake, it means &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; parts of a cake divided equally into &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; parts.
For example &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; means a half. But note that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; can be negative.
&lt;math&gt;+\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; means gaining a half and &lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; means losing a half.

== Example Problems ==

I have been given 1 piece of cake, my father who is very hungry has taken 2. My mother has taken 1 and my sister has taken 1 too. There were 10 pieces. What fraction of the cake has been eaten?

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{10} + \frac{2}{10} + \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10}=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; of the cake, which is half of the cake.

Note that in this case, the addition is very simple because the ''denominator'' is always 10. We just have to add the ''numerators''.

== Fractions of negative numbers ==

If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are positive, then the fraction or '''rational number''' is ''positive''. This is the way we commonly think of fractions ( &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of a cake...).

There is no difference whether &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is negative or &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is negative. The reason for this is simple : if you talk about  losing parts of a cake ( &lt;math&gt;-\frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt; ), or about parts of a lost cake ( &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{-q}&lt;/math&gt; ), in both cases, you talk about lost parts. In these cases, the fraction is said to be ''negative''.

Finally, if &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are negative, then their effect is canceled by each other and the fraction is ''positive''. As rational numbers are on one axis, the second time you take the opposite you obtain the original fraction. Thus, the fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{-p}{-q}&lt;/math&gt; ''is'' the fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Information and Communication Technologies for Poverty Alleviation}}

The major aid agencies and donors, as well as many developing country governments, are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about the prospects for improving the effectiveness of their development activities by making Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) available to poor people. This primer describes how ICTs are being used to alleviate poverty. It addresses the so-called digital divide, which describes the stark disparities between the few people with abundant access to ICTs and the vast numbers of people without any access at all, and describes the efforts that are being applied to overcome it.

INTRODUCTION

Information and knowledge are critical components of poverty alleviation strategies, and ICTs offer the promise of easy access to huge amounts of information useful for the poor. However, the digital divide is argued to be the result rather than the cause of poverty, and efforts to bridge it must be embedded within effective strategies that address the causes of poverty. Moreover, earlier patterns of adoption and diffusion of technology suggest that ICTs will not achieve their full potential without suitable attention being paid to the wider processes that they are intended to assist and to the context within which they are being implemented.

There are many examples of successful implementation that allow for a synthesis of experience that can lead to an understanding of how to approach the use of ICTs for widespread alleviation of poverty.

ICTs are usually understood to refer to computers and the Internet, but many consider this view to be limited, as it excludes the more traditional and usually more common technologies of radio, television, telephones, public address systems, and even newspapers, which also carry information. In particular, the potential value of radio as a purveyor of development information should not be overlooked, especially in view of its almost ubiquitous presence in developing countries, including the rural locations in which the vast majority of the poor live.

This primer describes several examples of how ICTs have contributed to poverty alleviation, to a greater or lesser extent. Several case studies are given at the end. Some lessons learned from the examples are synthesized and it is shown how implementation efforts have to take into account the wide variety of factors that are critical for success. A poverty alleviation framework is presented to facilitate the full consideration of all such factors and the framework is used to analyse the outcomes of the cases and the factors that have influenced them.

Many of the factors that will define how ICTs will be integrated into existing community and national development initiatives are highly contextual in nature; dependent on existing norms of institutional behaviour and on how vigorously reforms can be implemented. As a result, diffusion and replication rates will vary among communities and between nations. In some cases, we can expect slow progress towards further diffusion of ICTs for poverty alleviation.

== What is poverty, where is it, and how does it look when it has been alleviated? ==

Before examining how ICTs might be used to alleviate poverty, it is appropriate to consider what is actually meant by poverty. The World Bank reports that of the world’s six billion people, 2.8 billion, almost half, live on less than US$2 a day, and 1.2 billion, a fifth, live on less than US$1 a day, with 44 percent of them living in South Asia. The Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 by international development agencies include reducing by half the proportion of people living in extreme income poverty, or those living on less than US$1 a day. The figure of US$1 income per day is widely accepted as a general indicator of extreme poverty within development discourse, but of course there is no absolute cut-off and income is only one indicator of the results of poverty, among many others.

'''Figure 1: Indicates the Global Distribution of Poverty (World Bank, 2001/2002)'''

The World Bank report goes beyond the view of income levels in its definition of poverty, suggesting that poverty includes powerlessness, voicelessness, vulnerability, and fear. Additionally, the European Commission suggests that poverty should not be defined merely as a lack of income and financial resources. It should also include the deprivation of basic capabilities and lack of access to education, health, natural resources, employment, land and credit, political participation, services, and infrastructure (European Commission, 2001). An even broader definition of poverty sees it as being deprived of the information needed to participate in the wider society, at the local, national or global level (ZEF, 2002).

The assertion that a knowledge gap is an important determinant of persistent poverty, combined with the notion that developed countries already possess the knowledge required to assure a universally adequate standard of living, suggest the need for policies that encourage greater communication and information flows both within and between countries. One of the best possible ways to achieve this greater interaction is through the use of ICTs. But when this happens, how is it possible to measure the effects?

Increases in household income that can be directly attributed to the use of ICTs are probably easy to isolate with careful research. Changes in the other characteristics of poverty, such as voicelessness and vulnerability, will be harder to tease out with research, and are best detected by asking the people concerned directly.

Experiences with field evaluations of ICTs that were deployed to alleviate poverty have been mixed and are controversial. Pilot projects have often failed to deliver expected benefits quickly enough for their funding agencies, or they have delivered unexpected benefits that the evaluators have difficulty accounting for. Usually, the time scales that communities require to fully appropriate ICTs and to use them to achieve significant benefits far exceed the expectations of the technology promoters and/or evaluators, who run out of patience and prematurely and inappropriately declare the project a failure.

== What is the “digital divide”? ==

The uneven global distribution of access to the Internet has highlighted a digital divide that separates individuals who are able to access computers and the Internet from those who have no opportunity to do so. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, has said:

:''The new information and communications technologies are among the driving forces of globalisation. They are bringing people together, and bringing decision makers unprecedented new tools for development. At the same time, however, the gap between information ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’ is widening, and there is a real danger that the world’s poor will be excluded from the emerging knowledge-based global economy. (Anan, 2002)''

A few statistics serve to highlight the alarming differences between those at both ends of the digital divide:

* All of the developing countries of the world own a mere four percent of the world’s computers.

* 75 percent of the world’s 700 million telephone sets can be found in the nine richest countries.

* There are more web hosts in New York than in continental Africa; there are more in Finland than in Latin America and the Caribbean combined.

* There were only 6.3 million Internet subscribers on the entire African continent in September 2002 compared with 34.3 million in the UK. (Nua Internet)

Table 1 shows the gap in Internet access between the industrialized and developing worlds. More than 85 percent of the world’s Internet users are in developed countries, which account for only about 22 percent of the world’s population.

'''Figure 2'''

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:eprimer_pov_table_1.jpg|300px]]
|}

Looking more closely at the access statistics reveals further levels of inequality within the developing countries that are least served. Typically, a high percentage of developing country residents live in rural areas. The proportion can rise to as much as 85 percent of the population in the least developed countries and is estimated at 75 percent overall in Asia. Rural access to communication networks in developing countries is much more limited than in urban areas. Table 2 depicts global teledensity levels (main lines plus cellular subscribers), indicating that the USA has more telephones than people, whereas Africa has a mere 6.6 telephones per 100 inhabitants.

In developing countries, rural teledensity is even lower than the global figures might suggest because of the differences between them and their urban counterparts. In the poorest countries, the already low urban teledensity can be three times or more that of the rural areas, whereas in the richest countries it is about the same. Table 3 shows how Internet host and personal computers are distributed throughout the world, further highlighting the gaps between developed and developing nations.

'''Figure 3'''

Not surprisingly, the digital divide mirrors divides in other resources that have a more insidious effect, such as the disparities in access to education, health care, capital, shelter, employment, clean water and food. These other divides can arguably be viewed as being a result of an imbalance in access to information— in short, the digital divide—than its cause. Information is critical to the social and economic activities that comprise the development process. Thus, ICTs, as a means of sharing information, are a link in the chain of the development process itself (ILO, 2001).

'''Figure 4'''

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:eprimer_pov_table_3.jpg|500px]]

== Does the digital divide refer only to access to technology? ==

Eliminating the digital divide requires more than the provision of access to technologies. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), although ICTs can contribute significantly to socio-economic development, investments in them alone are not sufficient for development to occur (ILO, 2001). Put simply, telecommunications is a necessary but insufficient condition for economic development (Schmandt et. al, 1990).

Martin and McKeown suggest that the application of ICTs is not sufficient to address problems of rural areas without adherence to principles of integrated rural development. Unless there is at least minimal infrastructure development in transport, education, health, and social and cultural facilities, it is unlikely that investments from ICTs alone will enable rural areas to cross the threshold from decline to growth (Martin and McKeown, 1993).

The digital divide then goes beyond access to the technology and can be expressed in terms of multiple dimensions. And if societies wish to share the benefits of access to technology, then further provisions have to be made in order to address all of the dimensions of the digital divide. Table 4 summarizes these dimensions.

These dimensions of the digital divide imply a variety of societal concerns that have to do with education and capacity building, social equity, including gender equity, and the appropriateness of technology and information to its socio-economic context.

'''Figure 5'''

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:eprimer_pov_table_4.jpg|500px]]
|}

Furthermore, some consider even the use of the term “digital divide” to be problematic. First, it is not the real issue; it is the information and knowledge gap that is the real concern and in that regard, the multiple dimensions in Table 4 deserve equal attention. Second, talk of a digital divide often implies that digital access alone will overcome the associated problems. Digital access requires only purchase and installation of technology. In fact, the multiple dimensions of the digital divide imply that it is not money and technology that matter but the right approach, and unless the other divides are also addressed, crossing the digital bridge will not achieve much. Finally, and possibly more significant, is an understanding of the patterns of cause and effect. As the G8 DOT Force report points out, the digital divide is a reflection of existing broader socio-economic inequalities, and a symptom of much more profound and long-standing economic and social divides within and between societies. The report goes on: “There is no dichotomy between the ‘digital divide’ and the broader social and economic divides which the development process should address; the digital divide needs to be understood and addressed in the context of those broader divides.” (G8 DOT Force, 2001).

The argument seems to be that the digital divide is the result rather than the cause of poverty, and that efforts to “bridge the digital divide” and increase access to ICTs, unless clearly rooted in, and subordinate to, a broader strategy to combat poverty, risk diverting attention and resources from addressing its underlying causes, such as unfair trade policies, corruption, bad governance and so on. In the next section, we examine the crucial aspect of how ICTs should be embedded within strategies for combating poverty so that both (the ICTs and the strategies) can achieve their optimal effect.

== What information technologies are capable of alleviating poverty? ==
In this section we will discuss the following ICTs: radio, television, telephones, public address systems, and computers and the Internet.

'''Radio'''&lt;br&gt;
Radio has achieved impressive results in the delivery of useful information to poor people. One of its strengths is its ubiquity. For example, a recent survey of 15 hill villages in Nepal found radios in every village, with farmers listening to them while working in their fields. Another survey of 21,000 farmers enrolled in radio-backed farm forums in Zambia found that 90 percent found programmes relevant and more than 50 percent credited the programmes and forums with increasing their crop yields (Dodds, 1999). In the Philippines, a partnership programme between UNESCO, the Danish International Development Agency and the Philippine government is providing local radio equipment and training to a number of remote villages. The project is designed to ensure that programming initiatives and content originate within the communities. According to UNESCO, the project has not only increased local business and agricultural productivity, but also resulted in the formation of civic organizations and more constructive dialogue with local officials (UNESCO Courier 1997).

In South Africa, clockwork radios that do not require battery or mains electricity supplies are being distributed to villages to enable them to listen to development programming. The Baygen Freeplay radio marks one of the first commercially successful communication devices to employ a clockwork mechanism as its power supply. It is sold on a commercial basis for approximately US$75 and has been used extensively by a number of non-governmental organizations as a key element in community education programmes and disaster relief efforts. For instance, the National Institute for Disaster Management in Mozambique distributed Freeplay radios so that flood victims could receive broadcasts on the weather, health issues, government policy toward the displaced, missing family members, the activities of the aid community, and the location of land mines. In Ghana, the government distributed 30,000 Freeplay radios so villagers could follow elections.

In Nepal, a digital broadcast initiative is being tested that will broadcast digital radio programming via satellite to low-cost receivers in rural and remote villagers. The programme is targeting HIV/AIDS awareness, and has the potential to link with computers to receive multimedia content.

Community radio projects indicate how communities can appropriate ICTs for their own purposes. For example, in Nepal, two community radio stations are well established—Radio Lumbini in Manigram in western Nepal and Radio Madan Pokhara in Palpa District. The Village Development Committee holds one licence and a community group holds the other. Both services have proven to be very popular. Ownership of radio receivers in the coverage areas has increased dramatically (shown as 68 percent in the census). Programmes include valuable development messages, such as AIDS awareness and prevention. The Kothmale community radio station in Sri Lanka{{ictpacite|1}} accepts requests for information from community members and searches the Internet for answers, which it then broadcasts on the air.

'''Television'''&lt;br&gt;
Television is commonly cited as having considerable development potential, and some examples of using it for education are given later in the report. Probably the most notable example of TV for development comes from China with its TV University and agricultural TV station. In Viêt Nam, two universities in the Mekong Delta Region work with the local TV station to broadcast weekly farmers workshops that are watched by millions.

'''Telephone'''&lt;br&gt;
The well-known case of Grameen hand phones in Bangladesh, in which the Grameen Bank, the village-based micro-finance organization, leases cellular mobile phones to successful members, has delivered significant benefits to the poor. The phones are mostly used for exchanging price and business and health-related information. They have generated information flows that have resulted in better prices for outputs and inputs, easier job searches, reduced mortality rates for livestock and poultry, and better returns on foreign-exchange transactions. Phone owners also earn additional income from providing phone services to others in the community. Poor people account for one-fourth of all the phone calls made. For villagers in general, the phones offer additional non-economic benefits such as improved law enforcement, reduced inequality, more rapid and effective communication during disasters and stronger kinship bonding. The phones also have perceptible and positive effects on the empowerment and social status of phone-leasing women and their households (Bayes et al., 1999).

A study in China found that villages that had the telephone, the most basic communications technology, experienced declines in the purchase price of various commodities and lower future price variability. It also noted that the average prices of agricultural commodities were higher in villages with phones than in villages without phones. Vegetable growers said that access to telephones helped them to make more appropriate production decisions, and users of agricultural inputs benefited from a smoother and more reliable supply. Better information also improved some sellers’ perception of their bargaining position vis-à-vis traders or intermediaries. Finally, village telephones facilitated job searches, access to emergency medical care and the ability to deal with natural disasters; lowered mortality rates for livestock thanks to more timely advice from extension workers; and improved rates in foreign-exchange transactions (Eggleston et al., 2002).

'''Public address systems'''&lt;br&gt;
Public address systems are commonly found in China and Viêt Nam where they are used to deliver public information, announcements and the daily news. One community in Viêt Nam is planning to augment its public address system by connecting to the Internet to obtain more useful information for broadcasting. Public address systems are more localized than radio, but are technically simpler and less expensive. However, research on poor communities suggests that the telephone and radio remain the most important (direct access) ICT tools for changing the lives of the poor (Heeks, 1999).

'''Computers and the Internet'''&lt;br&gt;
Computers and the Internet are commonly made available to poor communities in the form of community-based telecentres. As the examples cited in this report and the case studies in the annex show, community-based telecentres provide shared access to computers and the Internet and are the only realistic means of doing this for poor communities. Although telecentres come in many guises, the two key elements are public access and a development orientation. It is the latter characteristic that distinguishes telecentres from cyber cafés. Of course, the cyber café can be a useful device in fostering development through ICTs, but the difference is crucial, because development-oriented telecentres embody the principle of providing access for a purpose—that of implementing a development agenda.

To achieve their development objectives, telecentres perform community outreach services in order to determine the types of information that can be used to foster development activities. Computer literate telecentre staff act as intermediaries between community members who may not be familiar with ICTs and the information services that they require. Telecentres can provide a range of ICT-based services from which they can earn an income, such as telephone use, photocopying and printing, email and word processing. This helps with financial self-sustainability, which telecentres are often required to attain, although some argue that ICT-based development services should not have to be paid for by poor people, and should be provided as a public service, rather like libraries. The results of experiments with telecentres are mixed: some have demonstrated considerable benefits for their target audiences; others are struggling with fragile connectivity and uncertain communities. Very few have achieved self-financing sustainability.</text>

'''Glyphosate''' (N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;P) is a non-selective herbicide used to kill weeds, especially perennials. 

Glyphosate is the primary ingredient in Monsanto's popular herbicide, [[../Roundup/]].  Many crops have been genetically engineered to be resistant to it. The chemical is only absorbed by the leaves of plants and it is not absorbed by roots from the soil.

Glyphosate is an aminophosphonic analogue of the natural amino acid glycine and the name is a contraction of ''glycine'', ''phospho-'', and ''-ate''.

==Uses==
&lt;!--target plants, etc--&gt;

==Action==
Glyphosate kills plants by inhibiting the enzyme 5-enolpyruvoyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which forms the aromatic amino acids: phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. EPSPS catalyzes the reaction of shikimate 3-phosphate (S3P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form ESP and phosphate. The aromatic amino acids are also used to make secondary metabolites such as folates, ubiquinones and naphthoquinones. The shikimate pathway is not present in animals. CAS: 1071-83-6

==Application==
Glyphosate is applied as a spray or a paint. Concentrations depend on the particular formulation used.

==Precautions==
There are concerns about the effects of glyphosate (and Roundup) on non-plant species. For more information, see [[../Roundup/]].

Glyphosate binds tightly to soil so it does not end up passing through the soil and ending up in the aquifers. It is rapidly metabolized in the soil by dephosphorylation.

However, it should be noted that the government of Denmark banned spraying of glyphosate in Sept 2003 after groundwater concentrations over 5 times the allowed limit were discovered. Furthermore, glyphosate groundwater residues are documented in Canada, the Netherlands and also in the USA, as well as, off coast in many marine environments. (For more information please see http://www.national-toxic-encephalopathy-foundation.org/roundup.pdf)

===Endocrine disruption===
In-vitro studies (Walsh, ''et al.'' 2000) have shown glyphosate to have an effect on progesterone production in mammalian cells and can affect mortality of placental cells in-vitro (Richard, ''et al.'' 2005). Whether these studies classify glyphosate as an endocrine disruptor is a matter of debate.

Some feel that in-vitro studies are insufficient, and are waiting to see if animal studies show a change in endocrine activity, since a change in a single cell line may not occur in an entire organism. Additionally, current in-vitro studies expose cell lines to concentrations orders of magnitude greater than would be found in real conditions, and through pathways that would not be experienced in real organism. Current toxicological studies of higher order mammals (EU 2002) have suggested no endocrine disruption even at high doses.

Others feel that in-vitro studies, particularly ones identifying not only an effect, but a chemical pathway, are sufficient evidence to classify glyphosate as an endocrine disruptor, on the basis that even small changes in endocrine activity can have lasting effects on an entire organism that may be difficult to detect through whole organism studies alone. Further research on the topic has been planned, and should shed more light on the debate.

==Resistance==
Some microorganisms have a version of 5-enolpyruvoyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthetase (EPSPS) that is resistant to glyphosate inhibition. The version used in genetically modified crops was isolated from ''Agrobacterium'' strain CP4 (CP4 EPSPS) that was resisitant to glyphosate. The CP4 EPSPS gene was cloned and inserted into soybeans. The CP4 EPSPS gene was engineered for plant expression by fusing the 5' end of the gene to a chloroplast transit peptide derived from the petunia EPSPS. This transit peptide was used because it had shown previously an ability to deliver bacterial EPSPS to the chloroplasts of other plants. The plasmid used to move the gene into soybeans was PV-GMGTO4. It contained three bacterial genes, two PC4 EPSPS genes, and a gene encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS) from ''Escherichia coli'' as a marker. The DNA was injected into the soybeans using the particle acceleration method. Soybean cultivar A54O3 was used for the transformation. The expression of the GUS gene was used as the initial evidence of transformation. GUS expression was detected by a staining method in which the GUS enzyme converts a substrate into a blue precipitate. Those plants that showed GUS expression were then taken and sprayed with glyphosate and their tolerance was tested over many generations.

In 1996, genetically modified soybeans were available commercially([http://monsanto.com/monsanto/layout/about_us/timeline/default.asp]). This greatly improved the ability to control weeds in soybean fields since glyphosate could be sprayed on fields without hurting the crop. As of 2004, glyphosate was used on 80% of U.S. soybean fields to eliminate weeds.

'''Roundup''' is the brand name of a systemic, broad-spectrum herbicide produced by the United States company Monsanto. It is the most used herbicide in the world, and the top-selling agrichemical of all time. Monsanto developed and patented the glyphosate molecule in the 1970s, and marketed Roundup from 1973. It retained exclusive rights in the US until its US patent expired in September, 2000, and maintained a predominant marketshare in countries where the patent expired earlier.

==Uses==
Weeds and grass will generally re-emerge within one to two months after usage. Because of this mode of action, it is only effective on actively growing plants; it is not effective as a pre-emergence herbicide. Due to the absorption being limited to foliage, soil-bound glyphosate is effectively inert.

==Action==
The active ingredient of Roundup is the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate. Glyphosate's mode of action is to inhibit an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine. It is absorbed through foliage and translocated to growing points. 

==Application==
&lt;!--how it is applied--&gt;

==Precautions==
The surfactants used in the Roundup products may cause health issues. Like all herbicides, Roundup should only be applied in accordance with all labeling and legal requirements.

The US Environmental Protection Agency, the EC Health and Consumer Protection Directorate, and the UN World Health Organization have all independently concluded that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.

The toxicity of Roundup has been questioned, not so much because of its active agent ([[../Glyphosate|glyphosate]]) but because of the inactive ingredients, including the surfactant [[w:polyoxy-ethyleneamine|polyoxy-ethyleneamine]] (POEA) [http://www.pan-uk.org/pestnews/actives/glyphosa.htm]. These components are responsible for &quot;acute&quot; toxicity to humans such as eye irritation. Ingestion of Roundup has been proven to cause diarrhea following extremely high exposures. 

Roundup has also been found by researchers at Texas Tech University to disrupt the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) which has a role in testosterone production in males &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10964798&amp;query_hl=4]&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Resistance==
Due to heavy use of the herbicide, and its glyphosate-tolerant counterpart plants, fears have arisen that repeated exposure and cross breeding may eventually cause unwanted plants and weeds that might mutate into  Roundup tolerant forms effectively creating a superweed.

== What is the relationship between development, information and ICTs? ==

There is a risk that the argument in support of ICTs for development will be used excessively, in support of projects that cannot otherwise be justified by more rational means. The attendant danger is that the concept of ICTs for poverty alleviation loses credibility among development planners and decision makers. Nevertheless, the potential of information as a strategic development resource should be incorporated as a routine element into the development planning process, so that project managers become used to thinking in these new terms.

The most effective route to achieving substantial benefit with ICTs in development programmes is to concentrate on re-thinking development activities by analysing current problems and associated contextual conditions, and considering ICT as just one ingredient of the solution. This implies an approach to developing strategies for information systems and technology that are derived from and integrated with other components of the overall development strategy. This approach is depicted in Figure 6.

'''Figure 6. The Relationship Between Development, Information and ICTs'''

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:eprimer_pov_figure_2.jpg|500px]]
|}

The general rule is that the application of ICTs to development should always begin with a development strategy. From that, an information plan for implementing the development strategy can be derived and only out of that should come a technology plan. While strategic thinking can be informed by an appreciation of the capabilities of ICTs, it is essential to have clear development targets that are specific to the context before the form of use of the ICTs is defined. Additionally, in considering the development strategy, bottom-up, demand-driven development objectives are usually preferable to top-down, supply-driven objectives, so that goals begin with an appreciation of the needs of development recipients as they would themselves express them.

From an unambiguous articulation of the development strategy, an information plan is drawn. This will set down the information resources required to achieve the development strategy. Again, this determination can be made against an informed background with regard to the capabilities of ICTs, but it should not be driven by the mere application of technology. Finally, a plan for the technology can be drawn up that will be capable of delivering the information resources required for the achievement of the strategy.

Although such an approach makes sense intuitively, there are many examples of technology-related development projects that are technology-driven, top-down and supply-driven, and they often result in sub-optimal outcomes because of this.

Modelling the relationship between ICTs and development addresses the earlier comments about the digital divide in greater depth. The model is applicable at all points at which closing the divide is attempted. It was developed to facilitate a grass-roots implementation targeting community development where heavy emphasis was placed on empowering the community to construct their own agenda for ICT-assisted development, prior to introducing the technology (Harris et al., 2001).

In the next section, a number of technology-related development initiatives are described, and the reader might wish to reflect on the extent to which the outcomes of each were a result of deploying technology or of implementing a sound development strategy. The earlier discussion of some of the technology choices available underscores the need to be clear about the development and information delivery strategies before deciding on the technology. In highlighting where such strategies may be applied, subsequent sections provide a brief overview of the major areas of application of ICTs to poverty alleviation that have been observed to offer some promise.

== What strategies for poverty alleviation have been successfully pursued with the use of ICTs? ==

'''Distributing locally relevant information''' &lt;br&gt;
In the case of Internet diffusion, a consistent finding of surveys of Internet users and providers in developing countries is that the lack of local language and locally relevant content is a major barrier to increased use. Unless there is a concerted effort to overcome this constraint, Internet growth in many developing countries could be stuck in a low-use equilibrium (Kenny et al., 2001). The undersupply of pro-poor local content inhibits the virtuous circle, known as the network effect, whereby the growth of the on-line community makes the development of Internet content a more attractive commercial and social proposition, and increasing amounts of attractive content encourages the growth of the on-line community.

In the Village Information Shops in Pondicherry, India, a major contributory factor to all operations is the use of Tamil language and Tamil script in the computers (Sentilkumaran and Arunachalam, 2002). Despite there being no standard for the representation of Tamil in software at the time of implementation, the project staff were able to develop the use of Microsoft Office applications in Tamil script. Moreover, the applications are operated in Tamil using a western, Roman script QWERTY keyboard. The operators (semi-literate women) have learned the appropriate keyboard codes for the Tamil characters and are quite proficient at data entry. The centre in Villianur has generated a number of databases for local use, and all but one are in Tamil. The centres collect information on indigenous knowledge systems and are developing useful brochures in Tamil.

Beyond the entry of data, the extent to which use of the Tamil language has promoted the use of the information shops and fostered interactivity and engagement between the various information systems that are available and their intended beneficiaries, cannot be underestimated. Local content is directed towards the information needed to satisfy the communities’ needs, and is developed in collaboration with the local people. There are close to a hundred databases, including rural yellow pages, which are updated as often as needed. An entitlements database serves as a single-window for the entire range of government programmes, fostering greater transparency in government. Relevant content is obtained from elsewhere if it is found useful to the local community. For example, useful information has been collected from Government departments, the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Aravind Eye Hospital and the US Navy’s web site. The centres have held health camps in the villages in cooperation with local hospitals as part of gathering information about local health care needs. The centres use multimedia and loud speakers to reach out to illiterate clients, and publish a fortnightly Tamil newspaper called Namma Ooru Seithi (Our Village News), which has become so popular that Government departments such as the District Rural Development Agency, Social Welfare Board, and the Small Scale Industries Centre use it to publicize their schemes (Arunachalam, 2002).

The Gyandoot project in Madhya Pradesh State of India is an intranet in the district of Dhar that connects rural cyber cafés catering to the everyday needs of the masses{{ictpacite|2}}. It provides the following services:

* Commodity marketing information system
* Income certificate
* Domicile certificate
* Caste certificate
* Landholder’s passbook of land rights and loans
* Rural Hindi e-mail
* Public grievance redressal
* Forms of various government schemes.
* Below-Poverty-Line Family List
* Employment news
* Rural matrimonial
* Rural market
* Rural newspaper
* Advisory module
* E-education

'''Targeting disadvantaged and marginalized groups''' &lt;br&gt;

Within populations of poor people, disadvantaged and marginalized sections of society usually face impediments to using, and making good use of, ICTs in much the same way that they might face impediments in using other resources. Women in developing countries in particular face difficulties in using ICTs, as they tend to be poorer, face greater social constraints, and are less likely to be educated or literate than men. Moreover, they are likely to use ICTs in different ways, and have different information requirements than men. Women are also less likely to be able to pay for access to ICTs, either because of an absolute lack of funds or because they lack control of household expenditure. Constraints on women’s time or their movement outside of the home can also reduce their ability to access technologies (Marker et al. 2002). Such groups usually require special assistance and attention in order to benefit from programmes that are targeted at poor people.

People who do not understand the English language are also a marginalized section of society on the Internet. Such people include the majority populations of French-speaking Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Even when users have basic English proficiency, they are discouraged from using web sites that are only in English.

Strategies for reaching marginalized sectors of society through ICTs include the collection, classification, protection, and commercialization of indigenous knowledge by minority groups using ICTs. Traditional remedies are being recorded in databases and afforded protection from foreign applications for patents. The value of such practices is evident from the stringent rules imposed by the state government of Sarawak, Malaysia, on the island of Borneo, over the collection of flora samples in their rainforests, where a particular tree species promises to yield substances that might lead to a cure for HIV/AIDS. The Honey Bee network in India collects local innovations, inventions and remedies, stores them on-line, and helps owners obtain incomes from local patents and commercialization of inventions. The database contains more than 1,300 innovations. Similarly, the Kelabit ethnic group of Sarawak, one of Borneo’s smaller ethnic minorities, are recording their oral history in a database of stories told by the old people. They are also using computers to assemble their genealogical records.

The selling of handicrafts on the Internet by local artisans, a form of e-commerce, also provides buyers with the historical and cultural background of indigenous products. Traders in such products deliberately disconnect ethnic artefacts from the identity of the artists in order to keep down the prices at which they can obtain the artists’ works. Providing the artisans with more direct access to their market through the Internet allows them to build up a clientele and achieve recognition as the creator of original art and crafts. Relatedly, web sites that feature aboriginal art can now be found with strict warnings against using Australian aboriginal designs without permission, seemingly in response to complaints that T-shirt manufacturers freely plagiarize designs without any recompense to the creators. Whether such warnings are effective is hard to tell, but at least the web site can be used to register ownership rights and to demonstrate priority in the creation of designs.

Nearly 80 percent of the world’s disabled population of 500 million people lives in developing countries. Usually their disability only compounds the difficulties they already face as (possibly poor) citizens of developing countries. But like people who live in isolated and remote locations, they probably stand to gain far more benefit from being able to make good use of ICTs. Efforts to enable access to ICTs by disabled people are under way. One such effort relates to the development of adaptive technology, which is a major prerequisite for many people with disabilities to use computer technology. These are modifications or upgrades to a computer’s hardware and software to provide alternative methods of entering and receiving data. Many of the modifications can be made relatively inexpensively. Some modifications can be as simple as lowering a computer desk while others can be as elaborate as attaching an input device that tracks eye movements. Common adaptive technologies include programs that read or describe the information on the screen, programs that enlarge or change the colour of screen information, and special pointing or input devices. There are standards and guidelines for World Wide Web accessibility and electronic document accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines set out by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI){{ictpacite|3}} is the world standard for WWW contents accessibility.

Digital Divide Data Entry is a philanthropic organization that uses the Internet, the English language and the computer skills of Cambodia’s youth to provide basic information services to North America corporations. They employ 10 disabled people to copy type documents into a computer, a simple task that requires only typing skills and a basic knowledge of English. The organization is currently working on a US$30,000 contract to input more than 100 years of archives of the Harvard University newspaper. Once completed, the work can be sent to the US via e-mail. There are plans to hire more disabled people, more women and more poor people, and to expand from data entry to more complicated tasks, like creating web pages and Power Point presentations.

'''Promoting local entrepreneurship''' &lt;br&gt;

It has been claimed that ICTs have the potential to impact the livelihood strategies of small-scale enterprises and local entrepreneurs in the following areas:

* Natural capital - opportunities for accessing national government policies
* Financial capital - communication with lending organizations, e.g., for micro-credit
* Human capital - increased knowledge of new skills through distance learning and processes required for certification
* Social capital - cultivating contacts beyond the immediate community
* Physical capital - lobbying for the provision of basic infrastructure

To cite an example, India Shop is an Internet-based virtual shopping mall selling Indian handicrafts. Established by the Foundation of Occupational Development (FOOD) in Chennai, India Shop involves e-marketers who promote the goods over the Internet, through chat-rooms and mail lists. They work from a computer, either at home or in a cyber café, and draw commissions on the sales that they achieve. The e-marketers respond to sales enquiries and liase with the craftspeople, typically exchanging multiple e-mails with clients before sales are closed. There are more than 100 people marketers, earning between Rs2,000Rs10,000 per month.

In Gujarat, computerized milk collection centres using embedded chip technology are helping ensure fair prices for small farmers who sell milk to dairy cooperatives. The fat content of milk used to be calculated hours after the milk was received; farmers were paid every 10 days and had to trust the manual calculations of milk quality and quantity made by the staff of cooperatives. Farmers often claimed that the old system resulted in malfeasance and underpayments, but such charges were difficult to prove. Computerized milk collection now increases transparency, expedites processing, and provides immediate payments to farmers (World Bank, 2002).

Indeed, small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries, especially women, have shown the ability to harness ICTs for developing their enterprises. For example, a group of ladies in Kizhur village, Pondicherry decided that they wanted to start a small business enterprise manufacturing incense sticks. They began as sub-contractors but their confidence and enterprise grew from utilizing the local telecentre. As a result of some searches by the telecentre operators, they were able to develop the necessary skills for packaging and marketing their own brand name incense. The ladies were quickly able to develop local outlets for their products and they are confidently using the telecentre to seek out more distant customers.

ICT and e-commerce are attractive to women entrepreneurs (who in many developing countries account for the majority of small and medium-size enterprise owners), as it allows them to save time and money while trying to reach out to new clients in domestic and foreign markets. There are many success stories in business-to-consumer (B2C) retailing or e-tailing from all developing-country regions, demonstrating how women have used the Internet to expand their customer base in foreign markets while at the same time being able to combine family responsibilities with lucrative work. However, in spite of the publicity given to e-tailing, its scope and spread in the poorer parts of the world have remained small, and women working in micro-enterprises and the informal sector are far from being in a position to access and make use of the new technologies. Moreover, B2C e-commerce is small compared to business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce and thus benefits only a small number of women (UNCTAD, 2002).

'''Improving poor people’s health''' &lt;br&gt;

Health care is one of the most promising areas for poverty alleviation with ICTs, based largely as it is on information resources and knowledge. There are many ways in which ICTs can be applied to achieve desirable health outcomes. ICTs are being used in developing countries to facilitate remote consultation, diagnosis, and treatment. Thus, physicians in remote locations can take advantage of the professional skills and experiences of colleagues and collaborating institutions (DOI, 2001). Health workers in developing countries are accessing relevant medical training through ICT-enabled delivery mechanisms. Several new malaria Internet sites for health professionals include innovative “teach-and-test” self-assessment modules. In addition, centralized data repositories connected to ICT networks enable remote health care professionals to keep abreast of the rapidly evolving stock of medical knowledge.

When applied to disease prevention and epidemic response efforts, ICT can provide considerable benefits and capabilities. Public broadcast media such as radio and television have a long history of effectively facilitating the dissemination of public health messages and disease prevention techniques in developing countries. The Internet can also be utilized to improve disease prevention by enabling more effective monitoring and response mechanisms.

The World Health Organization and the world’s six biggest medical journal publishers are providing access to vital scientific information to close to 100 developing countries that otherwise could not afford such information. The arrangement makes available through the Internet, for free or at reduced rates, almost 1,000 of the world’s leading medical and scientific journals to medical schools and research institutions in developing countries. Previously, biomedical journal subscriptions, both electronic and print, were priced uniformly for medical schools, research centres and similar institutions, regardless of geographical location. Annual subscription prices cost on average several hundred dollars per title. Many key titles cost more than US$1500 per year, making it all but impossible for the large majority of health and research institutions in the poorest countries to access critical scientific information.

Apollo Hospitals has set up a telemedicine centre at Aragonda in Andhra Pradesh, to offer medical advice to the rural population using ICTs. The centre links healthcare specialists with remote clinics, hospitals, and primary care physicians to facilitate medical diagnosis and treatment. The rural telemedicine centre caters to the 50,000 people living in Aragonda and the surrounding six villages. As part of the project, the group has constructed in the village a 50-bed multi-speciality hospital with a CT scan, X-ray, eight-bed intensive care unit, and blood bank. It also has equipment to scan, convert and send data images to the tele-consultant stations at Chennai and Hyderabad. The centre provides free health screening camps for detection of a variety of diseases. There is a VSAT facility at Aragonda for connectivity to Hyderabad and Chennai. The scheme is available to all the families in the villages at a cost of Rs.1 per day for a family of five.

In Ginnack, a remote island village on the Gambia River, nurses use a digital camera to take pictures of symptoms for examination by a doctor in a nearby town. The physician can send the pictures over the Internet to a medical institute in the UK for further evaluation. X-ray images can also be compressed and sent through existing telecommunications networks.

Across Sub-Saharan Africa, the Internet is used to report daily cases of meningitis to monitor emerging epidemics. When threshold levels are reached, mass vaccination is required and the Internet is used to rapidly mobilize medical personnel and effectively coordinate laboratories and specialist services.

In Andhra Pradesh again, handheld computers are enabling auxiliary nurse midwives to eliminate redundant paperwork and data entry, freeing time to deliver health care to poor people. Midwives provide most health services in the state’s vast rural areas, with each serving about 5,000 people, typically across multiple villages and hamlets. They administer immunizations, offer advice on family planning, educate people on mother-child health programs and collect data on birth and immunization rates. Midwives usually spend 15–20 days a month collecting and registering data. But with handheld computers they can cut that time by up to 40 percent, increasing the impact and reach of limited resources (World Bank, 2002).

'''Strengthening education''' &lt;br&gt;

The growth of distance education is being fuelled by the urgent need to close the education gap between poor and rich nations. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), only about three percent of young people in sub-Saharan Africa and seven percent in Asia attend some form of postsecondary education. This compares with 58 percent in industrialized countries as a whole, and 81 percent in the United States.

Developing countries see investing in distance education programmes as a way to educate more people for less money. UNESCO and the World Bank have reported that in the world’s 10 biggest distance education institutions, the majority of which are in the Third World, the cost of education per student is on average about one third the cost at traditional institutions in the same country. In China, where only one out of 20 young people receives higher education, distance learning is helping the education system move from elite to mass education because traditional universities cannot meet the demand. China Central Radio and Television University has 1.5 million students, two-thirds of them in degree programmes. The university caters to working adults. It broadcasts radio and TV lectures at fixed times to students at 2,600 branch campuses and 29,000 study centres, as well as at workplaces.

Distance education seems a natural pre-cursor to on-line education, but the two are not the same, and the transition from the former to the latter can be a challenge. Even the pioneering British Open University still bases its course work on hard copy material, using the Internet for the support aspects of education, such as student and tutor interaction. Initial enthusiasm for the idea of a virtual university has been slow to materialize and there are still very few fully accredited degree programmes that can be taken entirely on-line. Some of the difficulties arose from the slow emergence of understanding about what ICTs contribute to the pedagogical aspects of the teaching-learning process. Other barriers to e-learning include the time and cost required to prepare digital learning materials.

On-line distance education is better suited to adult learners and there are now many organizations opening virtual universities to cater for them. The element of flexible timing for learning appeals to adults who are employed and who realize the value of life-long learning in a changing work environment.

Most developments in e-learning benefit the already privileged. Nevertheless, examples of pro-poor learning indicate the possibilities for the less privileged. It is almost a universally observable phenomenon that children seem to take to computers naturally, and in a unique experiment in India, this has been turned into a new mode of education called minimally invasive education. In 1999, Sugata Mitra of NIIT Ltd. placed an Internet-capable personal computer behind a glass screen in a wall of his office building that looked out to a piece of land occupied by street kids. In what became known as the “Hole in the Wall” experiment, the children very quickly learned an impressive range of computer skills without any tuition at all. As one child learned something new from experimentation, he/she passed it on to the next child. The experiment has since been repeated in half a dozen locations, and Mitra is making plans for 100,000 kiosks to create 100 million computer literates in five years.

In primary and secondary education, radio and television are increasingly important means of reaching the rural poor. In Mexico, over 700,000 secondary-school students in remote villages now have access to the Telesecundaria program, which provides televised classes and a comprehensive curriculum through closed-circuit television, satellite transmissions and teleconferencing between students and teachers. Studies have found that the program is only 16 percent more expensive per pupil served than normal urban secondary schools, while students benefit from the much smaller student-to-teacher ratios. Rural students enter the program with substantially lower mathematics and language test scores than their counterparts at traditional urban schools, but by graduation, they have equalled the math scores of those in the urban schools and cut the language score deficit in half (de Moura et al. 1999).

Further evidence that the impact of the Internet need not be limited to higher education or wealthier students can be found in Brazil’s urban slums. The Committee to Democratise Information Technology (CDI) has created 110 sustainable and self-managed community-based Computer Science and Citizenship Schools using recycled technology, volunteer assistance and very limited funds. CDI schools train more than 25,000 young students every year in ICT skills that give them better opportunities for jobs, education and life changes. CDI also provides social education on human rights, non-violence, the environment and health and sexuality. CDI cites many cases of participants developing renewed interest in formal schooling, resisting the lure to join drug gangs, and greatly increasing their self-esteem. Also, many of the program’s graduates are putting their computer skills to work in various community activities, including health education and AIDS awareness campaigns. Most teachers in CDI schools are themselves graduates of the program who have embraced technology and want to continue CDI’s work in their own communities (InfoDev).

'''Promoting trade and e-commerce''' &lt;br&gt;

It is in the Asia Pacific region that e-commerce is spreading most quickly among developing countries. The region’s enterprises, particularly in manufacturing, are exposed to pressure from customers in developed countries to adopt e-business methods and are investing to be able to do so. China’s population of Internet users is already the world’s third largest.

M-commerce, defined as the buying and selling of goods and services using wireless handheld devices such as mobile telephones or personal data assistants (PDAs), is likewise growing at a rapid pace. In the last four years, growth in the number of mobile telephone users worldwide has exceeded fixed lines, expanding from 50 million to almost one billion in 2002. This rapid growth stems from the cost advantage of mobile infrastructure over fixed-line installation and from the fact that mobile network consumers can simply buy a handset and a prepaid card and start using it as soon as the first base stations are in place, without having to open a post-paid account. The introduction of wireless communications has also brought wireless data services, which are essential to conducting m-commerce, to many developing countries. If the convergence of mobile and fixed Internet and ICTs continues, first access to the Internet for a significant part of the world will be achieved using mobile handsets and networks. Wireless technologies have made inroads even in relatively low-income areas, where prepaid cards allow access to people who cannot take out a subscription because of billing or creditworthiness problems. Developing Asia is the leader in this area (UNCTAD 2002).

The main areas of m-commerce use are in text messaging or SMS (short messaging service), micro-payments, financial services, logistics, information services and wireless customer relationship management. Text messaging has been the most successful m-commerce application in developing countries, where rates of low fixed-line connectivity and Internet access have made it an e-mail surrogate. Operators in China and other Asian developing countries are gearing up for m-commerce applications for financial services in particular. However, difficulties in making electronic payments and concerns over the security and privacy of transactions are limiting the conduct of m-commerce. It may have to wait for third-generation wireless technologies and fully Internet-enabled handsets.

ICTs have been widely touted as windows to global markets for small-scale developing country producers. However, there are significant barriers facing artisans in the developing world who are trading directly with consumers (business to consumer) via the Internet. Apart from anecdotal stories, there is little evidence of craft groups successfully dealing direct with end consumers on a sustainable basis. Business-to-business e-commerce offers the greatest opportunities for artisan groups to enhance the service given to business customers (exporters, importers, alternative trade organizations, wholesale and retail buyers etc). This is likely to be much more fruitful and cost-effective for artisans.

PEOPLink is a non-profit organization that has been equipping and training grass-roots artisan organizations all over the world to use digital cameras and the Internet to market their wares while showcasing their cultural richness{{ictpacite|4}}. Between 1996 and 2000, PEOPLink developed training modules and used them as the basis for on-site workshops and on-line support for web catalogue development by 55 trading partners serving more than 100,000 artisans in 22 countries. PEOPLink offers a tool-kit to communities that enable them to create a digital catalogue of their handicrafts for posting onto a web site. It also provides additional services such as on-line trend reports, product development and feedback tools, as well as providing logistical support and services such as payment collection, distribution and handling of returns. Many new jobs were created for hundreds of poor artisans in isolated Nepalese villages. The Rockefeller Foundation, which commissioned a strategic plan for PEOPLink, found that “Internet commerce is essential for third world artisan and SME development and PEOPLink can be a leader [in this area].”

However, while some reports suggest that PEOPLink is generating substantial revenue, with daily sales ranging from US$50–500, other reports indicate that PEOPLink has achieved very low sales. There seems to be little evidence to suggest that these operations are selling a significant amount of craft goods direct to consumers. According to a Department for International Development (DFID) report, PEOPLink has had a disappointing level of sales, with no producer contacted having sold any products through its site (Batchelor and Webb, 2002). PEOPLink is now focusing on its CatGen system, software to assist in the creation of on-line catalogues to enhance B2B (business-to-business) operations.

One area of e-commerce that shows potential is the promotion and marketing of pro-poor, community-based tourism. Pro-poor tourism aims to increase the net benefits for the poor from tourism, and ensure that tourism growth contributes to poverty reduction. It is not a specific product or sector of tourism, but a specific approach to tourism. Pro-poor tourism strategies unlock opportunities for the poor, whether for economic gain, other livelihood benefits or participation in decision-making (Ashley et al., 2001). Early experience shows that pro-poor tourism strategies are able to ‘tilt’ the industry at the margin, to expand opportunities for the poor and have potentially wide application across the industry. Poverty reduction through pro-poor tourism can therefore be significant at a local or district level. Moreover, the poverty impact may be greater in remote areas, though the tourism itself may be on a limited scale (Roe and Khanya).

Poor communities are often rich in natural assets—scenery, climate, culture and wildlife. Community-based tourism is closely associated with ecotourism and is regarded as a tool for natural and cultural resource conservation and community development. It is a community-based practice that provides contributions and incentives for natural and cultural conservation, as well as opportunities for community livelihood. Community-based tourism provides alternative economic opportunities in rural areas. It has the potential to create jobs and generate a wide spectrum of entrepreneurial opportunities for people from a variety of backgrounds, skills and experiences, including rural communities and especially women.{{ictpacite|5}}

Tourism and e-commerce are natural partners (UNCTAD, 2001). Tourism is highly information-intensive. During the intermediary period, the tourism product exists in the form of information only (reservation number, ticket, voucher). Value added by international tourism intermediaries, who are often no more than marketers and information handlers and who rarely own or manage physical tourism facilities, can be as high as 30 percent or more, which gives them control over terms and conditions throughout the whole value chain. Although it is the destination’s socioeconomic, cultural and geographical content that forms the fundamental tourism product, it often happens that with each intermediary party taking a commission, little income remains for the destination at which the product is consumed. Electronic commerce for tourism (e-tourism) can disintermediate and deconstruct the tourism value chain, driving income closer towards the actual providers of tourism experiences. But the lack of on-line payment facilities, which are fundamental to closing sales, and the lack of local financial and technological infrastructure that is typical of rural and remote locations in developing countries, regularly force e-businesses to establish external subsidiaries and accounts, thereby perpetuating dependence on established intermediary operations.


'''Supporting good governance''' &lt;br&gt;

E-governance is an area of ICT use that shows rapidly increasing promise for alleviating the powerlessness, voicelessness, vulnerability and fear dimensions of poverty. Where national or local governments have taken positive steps to spread democracy and inclusion to the poor, ICTs have dramatically demonstrated how they can be used to facilitate the process. The effect can be to break down traditional patterns of exclusion, opaqueness, inefficiency and neglect in public interactions with government officials (Bhatnagar, 2002).

In the Bhoomi project of online delivery of land titles in Karnataka, India, the Department of Revenue in Karnataka has computerized 20 million records of land ownership of 6.7 million farmers in the state. Previously, farmers had to seek out the village accountant to get a copy of the Record of Rights, Tenancy and Crops (RTC), a document needed for many tasks such as obtaining bank loans. There were delays and harassment and bribes often had to be paid. Today, for a fee of Rs.15, a printed copy of the RTC can be obtained on-line at computerized land record kiosks (Bhoomi centres) in nearly 200 taluks (districts) or at Internet kiosks in rural area offices. The Bhoomi software incorporates the bio-logon metrics system, which authenticates all users of the software using their fingerprint. A log is maintained of all transactions in a session. This makes an officer accountable for his decisions and actions. Previously, requests for changes to the records could take months to process and were subject to manipulation by the officers. Now, farmers can get an RTC for any parcel of land and a Khata extract (statement of total land holdings of an individual) in 5-30 minutes from an RTC information kiosk at the taluk headquarters.

There are plans to use the Bhoomi kiosk for disseminating other information, such as lists of destitute and handicapped pensioners, families living below the poverty line, concession food grain cardholders and weather information. The response of the people at taluk level has been overwhelming. Queues can be seen at the kiosks, and 330,000 people have paid the fee without complaint. When asked what single factor contributed most to the success of this project, the manager unhesitatingly replied, “political will”.

In Kerala, the state government is sponsoring the e-shringla project to set up Internet-enabled information kiosks throughout the State. The concept grew out of the state government’s experiences with a bill-payment service called FRIENDS, (Fast, Reliable, Instant, Efficient, Network for Disbursement of Service), which operates as a one-stop service centre equipped with computers for paying bills as well as for obtaining applications and remitting registration fees. E-shringla is the next logical step from FRIENDS. It networks with a variety of government departments and providing Internet access, enabling online services and e-commerce facilities for citizens. The Karakulam Panchayat has developed a Knowledge Village Portal as an example of a community portal system that delivers a range of government and community information.

Since January 2000, Gyandoot, a government-owned computer network, has been making government more accessible to villagers in the poor, drought-prone Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh. Gyandoot reduces the time and money people spend trying to communicate with public officials and provide immediate, transparent access to local government data and documentation. For minimal fees, Intranet kiosks provide caste, income, and domicile certificates, helping villagers avoid the common practice of paying bribes to officials. The kiosks also allow small farmers to track crop prices in the region’s wholesale markets, enabling them to negotiate better terms for crop sales. Other services include on-line applications for land records and a public complaint line for reporting broken irrigation pumps, unfair prices, absentee teachers and other problems. Kiosks are placed in villages located on major roads or holding weekly markets, to facilitate access by people in neighbouring villages. The network of about 30 kiosks covers more than 600 villages and is run by local private operators along commercial lines (World Bank, 2002).

'''Building capacity and capability''' &lt;br&gt;
The meaning of the term capacity building seems to vary according to the user, but there appears to be no doubt that ICTs can help achieve it. Capacity building refers to developing an organization’s (or individual’s) core skills and capabilities to help it (him/her) achieve its (his/her) development goals. This definition suits the context of ICTs well as it assumes knowledge of the existence of development goals without which ICTs are unlikely to be of much value. Hans d’Orville, Director of the IT for Development Programme, Bureau for Development Policy, United Nations Development Programme, puts it simply: “The full realisation of the potential of ICTs requires skills, training, individual and institutional capacity among the users and beneficiaries”.

But the key question for poverty alleviation seems to be whether ICTs can build the capacity of the poorest people to achieve whatever goals they may have. If you are illiterate, destitute, disabled, malnourished, low caste, homeless and jobless, will ICTs help? The most likely scenario is that these very poor people will receive assistance from organizations and institutions that use ICTs and whose programmes specifically target them as beneficiaries.

ICTs in the form of multimedia community centres/telecentres, especially at the rural level can act as a nodal point for community connectivity, local capacity-building, content development and communications, and serve as hubs for applications, such as distance education, telemedicine, support to small, medium-sized and micro-credit enterprises, promotion of electronic commerce, environmental management, and empowerment of women and youth. Where such services have a pro-ultra-poor strategy, then the benefits of ICTs can be directed to them.

The Village Information Shops in Pondicherry, India have adopted such a programme. They have used ICTs to build awareness in poor communities of the government programmes and entitlements that are available for their assistance. They have a database of more than 100 such entitlements. Moreover, they have acquired the list of ultra-poor people that the government maintains, and made it available through the centres. The staff proactively notifies the people on the list that they are entitled to claim certain benefits (the government officials had not been well known for promoting these schemes), and they provide assistance in submitting the claims, contacting the appropriate bureaucrat and moving the application forward. As a result, every household in one fishing village is now in receipt of the housing subsidies to which they are entitled, whereas previously none of them were.

Capacity building also relates to the accumulation of social capital, which refers to those features of social organization such as networks, norms and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit. The establishment of networks for mutual benefit can be nurtured and extended through the use of ICTs. ICTs can help create and sustain on-line and off-line networks that introduce and interconnect people who are working toward similar goals.

Many organizations in the women’s movement recognize this potential and have projects that provide support for ICT to be used as an advocacy tool. ICTs can also enable certain individuals, especially early adopters, to spark catalytic change in their communities. For example, one very resourceful lady in a small Mongolian town who single-handedly runs an NGO supporting women’s micro-enterprises used the local telecentre to contact a donor agency in the UK and received an award of US$10,000, a huge sum in that context, to help her in her work.

The 220,000 women members of India’s Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) who earn a living through their own labour or through small businesses have started using telecommunications as a tool for capacity building among the rural population. SEWA uses a combination of landline and satellite communication to conduct educational programs on community development by distance learning. The community development themes covered in the education programs delivered include organizing, leadership building, forestry, water conservation, health education, child development, the Panchayati Raj System and financial services.

'''Enriching culture''' &lt;br&gt;
ICTs can simultaneously be a threat and an opportunity to a culture. On the one hand, ICTs threaten to engulf indigenous minorities in the relentless processes of globalization. On the other hand, ICTs can be used as tools to help indigenous minorities to engage positively with globalization on their own terms. The concern at this stage is that the former is more likely to happen than the latter. ICTs alone will not achieve cultural diversity. As with all successful applications of ICTs, adaptations in the behaviour of individuals, groups and institutions are necessary before significant cultural benefits can emerge from the deployment of ICTs.

Existing institutions such as libraries and museums can help in the process of democratizing ownership of cultural assets, provided they face up to the limitations of their traditional roles. The Internet has made the conventional role of libraries and museums obsolete. Yet such institutions have major roles to play in mobilizing communities towards a more open and dynamic approach to the assembly and preservation of indigenous culture. Libraries and museums can facilitate a more dispersed pattern of ownership and custodianship of cultural artefacts that can be increasingly represented digitally. Networks that connect digitized cultural artefacts to the communities from which they were derived can be used to foster a wider appreciation of their value and importance as well as a more inclusive approach to how they are used and interpreted.

Studies of indigenous communities regularly point to the importance they place on their cultural heritage. But they also highlight the almost complete lack of control or participation such communities have in how their culture is collected or represented. The Kelabit people in Sarawak, for example, do not feel that they exercise ownership rights over their own cultural heritage. They are concerned that outsiders are able to more easily gain access to both the records and the artefacts related to their cultural heritage than they are. They are also concerned that this can give rise to misinterpretation of the meaning of their cultural heritage. They feel powerless to present to the outside world a picture of themselves, their history and achievements, which they themselves would wish to have known. They see the situation getting worse rather than better, as technology empowers a few people to engage with information relating to their heritage, while depriving the majority of an equal opportunity.

On the other hand, ICTs can be used to help rural indigenous and minority communities achieve custodial ownership and rights of interpretation and commercialization over their own cultural heritage. The Kelabit people of Sarawak are in fact starting to use their telecentre to redress this imbalance by recording their oral histories and genealogical records.

UNESCO is currently formulating a charter and guidelines for the preservation of digital heritage. Digital heritage is that part of all digital materials that has lasting value and significance. New strategies need to be developed to ensure that they are saved for posterity. Digital heritage is either ‘born digital’ where there is no other format, or created by conversion from existing materials in any language and area of human knowledge or expression. It includes linear text, databases, still and moving images, audio and graphics, as well as related software, whether originated on-line or off-line, in all parts of the world. The preamble to the UNESCO charter states that the intellectual and cultural capital of all nations in digital form is at risk due to its ephemeral nature. Thus, the charter details the need for digital preservation principles and strategies to ensure that this heritage is available to all now and into the future.

Aside from digitization of indigenous cultural artefacts, ICTs provide a means for cultural communities to strengthen cultural ties. To cite an example, the Internet is a means to unite the more than five million Assyrians who are scattered all over the U.S., Europe and Australia. The Assyrians are the direct descendants of the ancient Assyrian and Babylonian empires. The Internet is finally uniting Assyrian communities, regardless of their geographic, educational, and economic backgrounds (Albert).

ICTs can either homogenize cultures or provide an opportunity to celebrate the diversity of culture. Whichever outcome prevails depends on how ICTs are used. Among the few experimental ICT projects involving ethnic indigenous people, short-term thinking and the pressure for tangible results (deliverables) cause donors to focus on poverty alleviation outcomes alone. However, when you talk to members of the communities themselves, it is easy to find considerable interest in using the technology for preserving and strengthening their cultural heritage.

'''Supporting agriculture''' &lt;br&gt;
Research suggests that increasing agricultural productivity benefits the poor and landless through increased employment opportunities. Because the vast majority of poor people live in rural areas and derive their livelihoods directly or indirectly from agriculture, support for farming is a high priority for rural development. ICTs can deliver useful information to farmers in the form of crop care and animal husbandry, fertilizer and feedstock inputs, drought mitigation, pest control, irrigation, weather forecasting, seed sourcing and market prices. Other uses of ICTs can enable farmers to participate in advocacy and cooperative activities.

To illustrate how useful ICTs can be for farmers, consider the case of farmers in India who in the past were harvesting their tomatoes at the same time, giving rise to a market glut that pushed prices to rock bottom. At other times, when tomatoes weren’t available and the prices shot up, the farmers had none to sell. Now, they use a network of telecentres to coordinate their planting so that there is a steady supply to the markets and more regulated and regular prices.

The Maharashtra State government has plans of linking 40,000 villages with Agronet, a specially developed software package for farmers that aims to provide the latest information on agriculture.

Samaikya Agritech P. Ltd. in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh operates 18 “Agritech Centres”, which provide agricultural support services to farmers on a commercial basis. They are permanently operated by qualified agricultural graduates called Agriculture Technical Officers (ATO) and are equipped with computers linked to the head office in Hyderabad through a modem-to-modem telephone connection. Through these centres Samaikya provides technical assistance to member farmers; inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and pesticide, machinery hire, tools and spares for sale; soil and water analyses; weather monitoring; field mapping; weekly field inspections and field visits by specialists.

Farmers register with centres and pay per growing season (two or three seasons per year) a fee of Rs.150 (about US$3) per acre/crop. A farmer registers by the field and receives support services that are specific to the fields registered. On registration, the farmer provides detailed information concerning his farming activities; the information is kept in the centre’s database, providing the basis for the technical support provided. The centre in the village of Choutkur has 53 registered farmers, covering 110 acres of registered land. This is out of a total of around 1,000 farmers within the centre’s catchment area. Major crops include sugar cane, padi and pulses.

Advice from the centres is based on data generated from pre-validated crop cultivation practices adopted in the State and provided by government agricultural services and local institutions. Farming information is up-linked from headquarters to the computers at the centres. If farmers have specific needs for information that cannot be satisfied immediately by the ATO at the centre, then the technician completes an on-line enquiry form on the computer and transmits this via modem to the headquarters. At the headquarters, specialists with more experience and qualifications organize and coordinate replies, which are typically transmitted back to the centre within 24 hours. The database and information systems are operated in the English language. Information is interpreted for the farmer by the ATO. Because some farmers are illiterate, the technicians have to spend time with explanations and descriptions. There is no standard for a computerized Telegu script.

Prior to setting up a centre, Samaikya performs a survey of local farming and cultivation practices and ascertains the political and cultural context of the potential centre. It conducts a pre-launch programme to familiarize farmers with the services. One centre closed down within three months of opening as no farmers registered for the service. This was due to the pressure placed on them by local marketeers, financiers and suppliers of inputs who perceived a threat to their livelihoods from the competing Samaikya services. Farmers were told that anyone who registered with the centre would not receive credit or essential supplies.

'''Creating employment opportunities''' &lt;br&gt;
Two areas of employment opportunity arise from the deployment of ICTs. First, unemployed people can use ICTs to discover job opportunities. Second, they can become employed in the new jobs that are created through the deployment of ICTs.

Poor people in rural localities lack opportunities for employment because they often do not have access to information about them. One use of ICTs is to provide on-line services for job placement through electronic labour exchanges in public employment service or other placement agencies. Normally, job brokering is carried out as a closed system involving intermediaries on behalf of their clients. The greater transparency enabled by ICT opens up possibilities for more precise information seeking. Through open job seeker banks, for example, employers can search and directly access résumés, which in turn are linked electronically to job vacancy banks. Tools have been developed to assist employers in screening résumés, or to send e-mails automatically to jobseekers when job vacancy announcements fitting certain pre-selected criteria are posted.

The ILO notes that some developing countries have been able to create employment for thousands of women and men through community-access points and telecentres. One common option is to purchase a mobile phone through a micro credit program and to earn income by providing low cost phone calls to others (Curtain, 2001). Telecentres can also offer use of ICT facilities for business purposes to small and micro-enterprises that do not have their own private facilities.

In some countries in the region, telecentres are being set up through public and private initiatives in telephone shops, schools, libraries, community centres, police stations and clinics. Sharing the expense of equipment, skills and access among an ever-increasing number of users also helps to cut costs and make these services viable in remote areas. India, for example, has seen rapid growth in cyber kiosks that provide access to social communication as well as business support services for underprivileged groups. The kiosks are often upgraded Subscriber Trunk Dialling booths that are widely found in all parts of the countryside in India. These are small street shops, offering access to public phones for long distance calls. They number about 300,000 and have generated more than 600,000 jobs. Youth unemployment constitutes over 30% of total unemployment in Asia Pacific and young people are particularly well placed to take advantage of such growth areas.

People with appropriate skills, possibly obtained from ICT-based learning facilities, may gain employment as a result of the growth in remote ICT processing facilities that are located outside high-income countries. The facilities provide a range of services, including help lines, technical support, reservations handling, sales, data conversion, as well as voice and data transcription. Other remote processing services are payroll accounting, internal auditing and credit appraisals. High-end remote processing includes creating digitized maps of townships, utilities, roads and other facilities. It is claimed that back office functions that are likely to grow in importance are settling insurance claims and summarizing legal documents, such as witness depositions.

The widespread use of English on the Internet has created the need for local content and applications for non-English speakers. For the poor in particular, the vast amount of information on the Internet requires an intermediary to sift through it to identify what is relevant and then to interpret it in the light of the local context. People with language and ICT skills are well placed to perform this role of ‘information intermediary.’

A related source of ICT-generated employment for young people is through Call Centres. These offer telephone-based services from a central office to customers in a variety of business sectors. Call Centres handle telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other types of customer contact, in live and automated formats. They have expanded rapidly in Europe and are important sources of work in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines.

The Internet can also play a pre-eminent role in a pro-poor tourism marketing strategy by providing information about remote tourist locations, including photos of key features, and by providing a ready means of low cost communication via e-mail. The Namibia Community-Based Tourism Association in southwest Africa assists local communities to set up tourism enterprises in the previously neglected rural areas of Namibia. The Association has set up a web site with detailed information, including a map about each of the seven regions in rural Namibia and the community-based tourism facilities in each region.

An example of the use of ICT to help bridge the gap between employment in the informal sector and the mainstream economy is India’s Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA). Its 220,000 members are women and young women who earn a living through their own labour or through small businesses. SEWA was one of the first organizations in India to realize the potential for harnessing ICT to help women in the informal sector. It has sought to develop the organization’s capacity to use computers by conducting awareness programs and imparting basic computer skills to its team leaders, “barefoot” managers and members of its various member associations. Many of SEWA’s member organizations have launched their own web sites to sell their products in the global virtual market place.

'''Reinforcing social mobilization''' &lt;br&gt;
Social mobilization is a process for harnessing local resources that can foster sustainable forms of community self-development. This was pioneered by the UNDP South Asia Poverty Alleviation Programme (SAPAP), which was established in 1993 to enhance national capacities for integration of growth and poverty alleviation policies and to demonstrate the feasibility of functioning social mobilization mechanisms in each of the participating countries. SAPAP is UNDP’s largest regional programme in Asia, with an allocation of $11.3 million. The programme is operating in six of the seven SAARC countries: in the Syangja District in Nepal, in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India, in the Kishorganj Sadar Thana in Bangladesh, in the Kohat District of the North West Frontier Province in Pakistan, in the Nuwera-Eliya District in Sri Lanka and on the Noonu Atoll in Maldives.

The programme’s major aim is to help remove the constraints that poor rural communities face in harnessing their potential to develop themselves. To this end, a three-tier strategy is followed, based on social organization, capital formation and human resource development. First, villagers are brought together to discuss local development issues of common interest and to initiate local development initiatives. Second, they are persuaded of the need to save, which after some time becomes an important source for credit operations. Third, they are trained, mainly in management techniques and income generating activities, in order to create the foundation for grass-roots institutional development, to improve sectoral service delivery and to support those who want to undertake socio-economic activities.

What is relevant here is not just that all these activities can be facilitated through the use of ICTs, but that such activities have been demonstrated to be instrumental in helping communities make the most out of ICTs. A study of the Nepal component</text>

'''Herbicides''' are substances used to kill unwanted plants, often used in modern gardens in lieu of or alongside other weed control techniques. The use of herbicides has benefits in terms of saving labor and time, but can also cause some problems by killing non-target plants or other organisms, contaminating the environment, and in some cases may have toxic effects on humans and other animals.

==Types of herbicides==
Herbicides are classified in several ways, including effect, selectivity, persistence, application, and action. They are also further divided into herbicides that are acceptable in organic growing methods and non-organic growing methods.

===Effect===
*'''Pre-emergent herbicides''' work by interfering with the germination of seeds. Pre-emergents must be well-timed according to the germination time of the weed being controlled, but when timed correctly they provide the best solution to the problem, as a preventative rather than a cure.
::''(see [[../Pre-emergent Herbicides/]] for details on particular pre-emergents)''
*'''Contact herbicides''' work by killing any part of the plant they come in contact with. In most cases these will not kill the entire plant and will need to be reapplied periodically, eventually draining the plant's energy stores and killing it after several applications.
*'''Systemic herbicides''' work by killing the entire plant over a short period of time, and are conducted throughout the plant through the vascular system. Many weeds are resistant to these herbicides however, so repeat applications are often needed.
*'''Drench herbicides''' are applied to the soil, rather than or along with application to the plant. Most of these herbicides are long-lasting, and therefore not appropriate for use in places where plants are to be grown.

===Selectivity===
Selective herbicides kill specific target plants while leaving the desired plants relatively unharmed. Herbicides used to control lawn weeds are in most cases selective herbicides.

Non-selective herbicides kill any plant they come in contact with (though some plants are resistant to various herbicides).

===Persistence===
Different herbicides have various &quot;persistence&quot;, meaning some stay active over a long period of time, while others become inactive shortly after application.

===Application===
Herbicides can be applied in one of a few ways. Some are sprayed as a liquid, some applied as granules, some applied through irrigation systems or fumigation (though rarely done in gardens), and some are painted directly onto plant parts. Most herbicides can be applied using more than one method, depending on what they are being used for.

===Action===
Their classification by mechanism of action (MOA) indicates the first enzyme, protein, or biochemical step affected in the plant following application. The main mechanisms of action are:

* '''Dessicators''' work by removing the water from plant cells, causing cell death.

* '''Acids and bases''' work similarly to dessicators, by chemically &quot;burning&quot; plant cells. These are substances that are extremely acidic or alkaline.

* '''Nutritional controls''' work by shifting the balance of nutrients, either providing too much of a particular nutrient, or restricting the availability of other nutrients. This most commonly involves slatering the soil pH, but in some cases certain nutrients can be used to control specific species of plants.

* '''ACCase inhibitors''' are compounds that kill grasses. Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) is part of the first step of lipid synthesis. Thus, ACCase inhibitors affect cell membrane production in the meristems of the grass plant. The ACCases of grasses are sensitive to these herbicides, whereas the ACCases of dicot plants are not.

* ''' ALS inhibitors''': the acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme (also known as acetohydroxyacid synthase, or AHAS) is the first step in the synthesis of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine). These herbicides slowly starve affected plants of these amino acid]]s which eventually leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis. They affect grasses and dicots alike. The ALS inhibitor family includes sulfonylureas (SUs), imidazolinones (IMIs), triazolopyrimidines (TPs), pyrimidinyl oxybenzoates (POBs), and sulfonylamino carbonyl triazolinones (SCTs).

* '''EPSPS inhibitors''': The enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase enzyme EPSPS is used in the synthesis of the amino acids tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine. They affect grasses and dicots alike. [[../Glyphosate/]] is a systemic EPSPS inhibitor but inactivated by soil contact.

* '''Synthetic auxin''' inaugurated the era of organic herbicides. They were discovered in the 1940s after a long study of the plant growth regulator auxin. Synthetic auxins mimic this plant hormone. They have several points of action on the cell membrane, and are effective in the control of dicot plants. 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin herbicide.

* '''Photosystem II inhibitors''' reduce electron flow from water to NADPH2+ at the photochemical step in photosynthesis. They bind to the Qb site on the D2 protein, and prevent quinone from binding to this site. Therefore, this group of compounds cause electrons to accumulate on chlorophyll molecules. As a consequence, oxidation reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur, and the plant dies. The triazine herbicides (including atrazine) are PSII inhibitors.

===Acceptability for organic growing===
By [[organic]] is meant a herbicide that can be used in a farming enterprise that has been classified as organic. Organic herbicides are expensive and may not be affordable for commercial production. They are much less effective than synthetic herbicides but of course do not inject unnatural chemicals into the environment.

Organic herbicides include:
*[[Vinegar]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2002/020515.htm Spray Weeds With Vinegar?]&lt;/ref&gt; - effective for 5-20% solutions of acetic acid with higher concentrations most effective but mainly destroys surface growth and so respraying to treat regrowth is needed. Resistant plants generally succumb when weakened by respraying.

*[[Steam]] - has been applied commercially but now considered uneconomic and inadequate &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7441.html Weed Management in Landscapes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nswg.org/tomlanini.htm Organic Weed Management in Vineyards]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Kolberg, Robert L., and Lori J. Wiles. 2002. Effect of steam application on cropland weeds.
Weed Technology. Vol. 16, No. 1. p. 43–49&lt;/ref&gt;. Kills surface growth but not underground growth and so respraying to treat regrowth of perennials is needed.

*[[Flame]] - considered more effective than steam but suffers from the same difficulties &lt;ref&gt;[http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/flameweedveg.html Flame Weeding for Vegetable Crops]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Common herbicides==

*[[../2,4-D/]], a broadleaf herbicide in the phenoxy group used in turf and in no-till field crop production.  Now mainly used in a blend with other herbicides that act as synergists, it is the most widely used herbicide in the world, third most commonly used in the United States. It is an example of synthetic auxin.
*[[../Atrazine/]], a triazine herbicide used in corn and sorghum for control of broadleaf weeds and grasses.  Still used because of its low cost and because it works as a synergist when used with other herbicides, it is a photosystem II inhibitor.
*[[../Clopyralid/]], is a broadleaf herbicide in the pyridine group, used mainly in turf, rangeland, and for control of noxious thistles.  Notorious for its ability to persist in compost. It is another example of synthetic auxin.
*[[../Dicamba/]], a persistent broadleaf herbicide active in the soil, used on turf and field corn. It is another example of synthetic auxin.
*[[../Glyphosate/]], a systemic nonselective (it kills any type of plant) herbicide used in no-till burndown and for weed control in crops that are genetically modified to resist its effects. It is an example of an EPSPs inhibitor.
*[[../Imazapyr/]], is a non-selective herbicide used for the control of a broad range of weeds including terrestrial annual and perennial grasses and broadleaved herbs, woody species, and riparian and emergent aquatic species.
*[[../Imazapic/]], is a selective herbicide for both the pre- and post-emergent control of some annual and perennial grasses and some broadleaf weeds.  Imazapic kills plants by inhibiting the production of branched chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine), which are necessary for protein synthesis and cell growth.
*[[../Metoalachlor/]], a pre-emergent herbicide widely used for control of annual grasses in corn and sorghum; it has largely replaced [[../Atrazine|atrazine]] for these uses.
*[[../Paraquat/]], a nonselective contact herbicide used for no-till burndown and in aerial destruction of marijuana and coca plantings.  More acutely toxic to people than any other herbicide in widespread commercial use.
*[[../Picloram/]], a pyridine herbicide mainly used to control unwanted trees in pastures and edges of fields. It is another synthetic auxin.
*[[../Triclopyr/]]

== History ==
Prior to the widespread use of chemical herbicides, cultural controls, such as altering soil pH, salinity, or fertility levels, were used to control weeds. Mechanical control (including tillage) was also (and still is) used to control weeds. 

The first widely used herbicide was [[../2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid/]], often abbreviated 2,4-D.  It was developed by a British team during World War II and first saw widespread production and use in the late 1940s.  It is easy and inexpensive to manufacture, and kills many broadleaf plants while leaving grasses largely unaffected (although high doses of 2,4-D at crucial growth periods can harm grass crops such as maize or cereals).  2,4-D's low cost has led to continued usage today and it remains one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world.  Like other acid herbicides, current formulations utilize either an amine salt (usually trimethyl amine) or one of many esters of the base compound.  These are easier to handle than the acid.

2,4-D exhibits relatively poor ''selectivity'', meaning that it causes stress to non-target plants.  It is also less effective against some broadleaf weeds, including many vinous plants, and sedges.  A herbicide is termed selective if it affects only certain types of plants, and nonselective if it inhibits most any type of plant. Other herbicides have been more recently developed to achieve desired selectivities.

The 1970s saw the introduction of [[../Atrazine/]], which has the dubious distinction of being the herbicide of greatest concern for groundwater contamination.  Atrazine does not break down readily (within a few weeks) after being applied.  Instead it is carried deep into the soil by rainfall causing the aforementioned contamination.  Atrazine is said to have ''high carryover'', a very undesirable property for herbicides.

[[../Glyphosate/]], frequently sold under the brand name Roundup, was introduced in the late 1980s for non-selective weed control. It is now a major herbicide in selective weed control in growing crop plants due to the development of crop plants that are resistant to it. The pairing of the herbicide with the resistant seed contributed to the consolidation of the seed and chemistry industry in the late 1990s.

Many modern chemical herbicides for agriculture are specifically formulated to decompose within a short period after application.  This is desirable as it allows crops which may be affected by the herbicide to be grown on the land in future seasons. However, herbicides with low residual activity (i.e. decompose quickly) often do not provide season-long weed control.

==Health effects==

Herbicides have been alleged to cause a variety of health effects ranging from skin rashes to death.  The pathway of attack can arise from improper applicatrion resulting in direct contact with field workers, inhalation of aerial sprays, food consumption and from contact with residual soil contamination.  Herbicides can also be transported via surface runoff to contaminate distant surface waters and hence another pathway of ingestion through extraction of those surface waters for drinking. Some herbicides decompose rapidly in soils and other types have more persistent characteristics with longer environmental half-lives.  Other alleged health effects can include chest pain, headaches, nausea  and fatigue.  Most herbicides (primarily the non-organic) must be extensively tested prior to labeling by the Environmental Protection Agency.  However, because of the large number of herbicides in use, many are concerned about potential health effects.  Some of the substances in use are alleged to be mutagenic, carcinogenic or teratogenic.

Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D, or C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a common systemic herbicide used in the control of broadleaf weeds. It is the third-most widely used herbicide in North America and the most widely used herbicide in the world. It was developed during World War II by a British team at Rothamsted Experimental Station, under the leadership of Judah Hirsch Quastel, aiming to increase crop yields for a nation at war. When it was commercially released in 1946, it became the first successful selective herbicide and allowed for greatly enhanced weed control in wheat, maize (corn), rice, and similar cereal grass crop, because it only kills dicots, leaving behind monocots.

2,4-D is sold in various formulations under a wide variety of brand names. It continues to be used for its low cost, despite the availability of more selective, more effective, and less toxic products.

2,4-D is a member of the phenoxy family of herbicides, which include:

* 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T)
* 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA)
* 2-(2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy)propionic acids (mecoprop, MCPP)
* 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (dichloroprop, 2,4-DP)
* (2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid (2,4-DB)

2,4-D is manufactured from chloroacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenol, which is itself produced by chlorination of phenol.  The production process creates several contaminants including isomers, monochlorophenol, and other polychlorophenols and their acids.

The powerful defoliant and herbicide Agent Orange, used extensively throughout the Vietnam War, contained 2,4-D. However, the controversies associated with the use of Agent Orange were associated with a contaminant (dioxin) in the 2,4,5-T component.

==Uses==
2,4-D is most commonly used for:

* Weed control in lawns and other turf
* No-till burndown
* Control of weeds and brush along fences and highway and railroad rights of way
* Conifer release (control of broadleaf trees in conifer plantings)
* Grass hayfields and pastures
* Cereal grains
* Corn and sorghum (occasionally)

Over 1500 herbicide products contain 2,4-D as an active ingredient

==Action==
2,4-D is a synthetic auxin, which is a class of plant growth regulators.

==Application==
&lt;!--how it is applied--&gt;

==Precautions==
The [[../LD50|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] in rats has been reported as 375 and 666 mg/kg in two different studies.  Single oral doses of 5 and 30 mg/kg body weight did not cause any acute toxic effects in human volunteers.

The amine salt formulations can cause irreversible eye damage.

For some widely divergent views on 2,4-D, compare [http://www.24d.org the industry's web site] to the [http://www.beyondpesticides.org/pesticides/factsheets/2,4-D.pdf fact sheet] from an anti-pesticide group:

2,4-D has been evaluated by the European Union and included on its list of approved pesticides.  The [http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/plant/protection/evaluation/exist_subs_rep_en.htm evaluation report] contains a large quantity of data on the properties (phys-chem, toxicity, environmental fate) of 2,4-D.

2, 4-D is a known [[teratogen]] so how come there are no controversies associated with it also?

== Auxin activity ==

I think that there should be mention about physiologic activity of that molecul in plant body. I am not sure, what effect kill the plant, but I am sure that 2,4-D has strong activity of auxin molecules.
In fact it is classified as synthetic [[auxin]] (but with some special effects). [[User:Reo On|Reo On]] 22:36, 20 June 2005 &lt;small&gt;(Discussion moved - [[User:Reo On|Reo On]] 20:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC))&lt;/small&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Information and Communication Technologies for Poverty Alleviation}}

== What lessons can be learned so far? ==

It should be evident from the examples that where demonstrable results have emerged, it has been because of a clear focus on the development strategy. As the G8 DOT Force states, “Efforts to increase access to ICTs should be rooted in a broader strategy to combat poverty.” From the examples cited, we can make the following observations:

'''ICTs will not transform bad development into good development, but they can make good development better.''' &lt;br&gt;
ICTs act as an amplifier of underlying processes. What makes development work well will be made to work better by using ICTs. On the other hand, if used inappropriately, ICTs add unnecessary costs to the process. Also, users and promoters could get disillusioned when expected benefits from ICT use fail to emerge, which in turn could hinder subsequent efforts to use ICTs appropriately.

'''Effective applications of ICTs comprise both a technological infrastructure and an information infrastructure.''' &lt;br&gt;
The information infrastructure includes all that is required to make the ICTs relevant to their context, including all sources of information and its consumers. Mobilizing them into a coherent infrastructure requires methods and skills that are quite different from those required to assemble the technology infrastructure. While ICTs can be effective tools for tackling poverty, the spread of technology should not be an objective in itself. Poverty, not the digital divide is the problem.

'''The application of ICTs in the absence of a development strategy that makes effective use of them will inevitably result in sub-optimal outcomes.''' &lt;br&gt;

It is important to be able to differentiate between types of outcomes and to balance them against the intentions, aspirations and potential of the technology and its users. At the same time, it is important to recognize that unexpected outcomes can turn out to be more desirable than those that were expected. ICT implementations have their own dynamics, and projects should acknowledge that introducing technology itself changes the dynamics of the problem that the technology is intended to solve. Sub-optimal outcomes are often a product of failing to respond to system dynamics in a way that would have directed the technology more closely towards better development, and failure to adapt to the dynamics of a responsive development strategy.

'''While ICTs provide opportunities for development, desirable outcomes always arise from the actions of people.''' &lt;br&gt;
The information infrastructure, and especially the people in it, makes up the key enabling environment that will determine the nature of the outcomes. When the main focus is on technology, there is a tendency to leave the people issues to chance. However, the enabling environment is crucial to providing information and communication services, innovation and entrepreneurship, and free flow of information. Education and skills are key enablers of the effective use of ICTs.

== What are the key social dimensions to ICTs for poverty alleviation? ==

Research from Latin America advocates a social vision for using ICTs to eliminate and/or redress the deeply rooted inequalities of modern societies.{{ictpacite|6}} The vision is based on the following premises:

* Connectivity is important, but it is not sufficient to contribute to development.

* Equitable access, meaningful use and social appropriation of ICT resources are all necessary to take advantage of available opportunities and achieve positive results.

* Certain enabling environments must exist for ICTs to contribute effectively to development.

* Risks and threats exist in the use of ICTs for development and should be avoided or minimized.

In this vision, ICTs are neither positive nor negative in themselves, but they are not neutral either. ICT deployment could end up reproducing and deepening existing inequalities in society. The term social appropriation is used to describe the process that leads to the social transformations that occur as a result of using ICTs. Social appropriation occurs when Internet resources help transform daily life by contributing to the solution of concrete problems. Evidence of appropriation is not found in the use of ICTs, but rather in the changes that they have brought about in the real world.

The social appropriation of ICTs for development can be demonstrated in a number of ways, such as by offering better medical information to patients; improving the quality of education through the use of innovative teaching resources; introducing varied, relevant programming into community radio broadcasting; increasing sales of local products in the marketplace; disseminating the results of local research; and coordinating action among diverse groups with common goals.

One way of achieving social appropriation is the methodology known as infomobilization. This methodology is based on socio-technical systems theory, which claims that separate efforts to optimize the technical system and the social system will lead to sub-optimal results, and can even be infeasible. The same information system can be a success in one organization/community but a failure in another, while the same organization/community can experience success with one information system but fail with another. Hence, the information system and its context must be studied, understood and managed together, not separately. Infomobilization applies these theories to rural communities in a developing country.

Infomobilization is concerned with the information requirements of communities. It addresses the design, delivery and utilization of community information systems by:

* Defining community information requirements based on needs and priorities that have been expressed by the communities themselves;

* Igniting community aspirations and empowering communities with appropriate skills for fostering local development that is information-based;

* Expanding a community’s social capital through enhanced access to communication facilities and information resources;

* Embedding community-based ICT services within existing economic, governance and social structures;

* Infusing enhanced capability for information access within communities;

* Achieving sustainability of financing, service delivery and operating functionality;

* Ensuring that benefits arising are not usurped by existing elites, and are equitably disseminated among the socially and economically disadvantaged groups; and

* Extending and intensifying existing development programmes that carry a significant potential for additional community benefit from enhanced information management capabilities that are based on ICTs.

The methodology consists of the actions necessary to ensure that ICTs have optimal impacts for development within rural communities in developing countries. The process is made up of techniques for

* Familiarizing communities with their existing use and sources of information as well as with the gaps that exist between existing and desired information resources;

* Alerting communities to the potential application of information to their problem-solving efforts and to their development aspirations;

* Sensitizing communities to the existence and accessibility of abundant information resources and to the capabilities of ICTs for accessing and manipulating information;

* Propelling communities towards the acquisition of the new knowledge they will require in order to exploit the power of ICTs;

* Empowering communities with information literacy, the skills necessary for the mastery of new media, the Internet and multimedia;

* Motivating communities to apply ICTs to the new opportunities that become possible from their relationship with ICTs;

* Encouraging the collection, classification, preservation and dissemination of indigenous knowledge and cultural information artefacts; and

* Fostering appropriate local mechanisms for sustaining the equipment, services and operations of community-based ICTs.

These techniques comprise a community learning system, whereby the community starts by learning about its information needs, and then begins to satisfy those needs and, as a result of the experience, becomes increasingly capable of understanding and satisfying information needs of an increasingly higher order.

== How should project implementers engage with communities? ==
The World Bank’s advice regarding a participatory style of community engagement is relevant for ICT implementation methodologies:

* Methodologies for designing and implementing useful information systems should emerge from participatory action-oriented analytical activities

* Data should be obtained using a combination of surveys, direct interviews, workshops and discussion groups

* Useful information systems should be embedded within the needs of the community

* Specific actions are required by both the implementers and the community in order to articulate those needs

* The implementers should learn about life in the beneficiary communities

* The community should learn about ICTs from the implementers

* Community members should perform major portions of the implementation

* The implementers should be able to identify with the community

* As a team, the community-implementers should be capable of critically reflecting on iterative cycles of action in order to achieve beneficial outcomes from the project

Participatory forms of analysis in which community aspirations and development activities are moulded and tracked in a cyclic manner are more likely to achieve desirable results than technology implementation that is predicated on fixed expectations and inflexible assumptions of what outcomes should look like.

== What are other project implementation considerations? ==

'''Unexpected outcomes''' &lt;br&gt;

The social dynamics of communities, when combined with the characteristic of ICTs as intellectual (as opposed to industrial) technologies, can lead to unexpected outcomes of ICT implementation. In some cases, these can turn out to be more desirable than those that were targeted, and they are to be encouraged. Figure 7 illustrates a combination of possibilities:

'''Figure 7: Project Outcomes'''

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:eprimer_pov_figure_7.jpg|500px]]
|}

'''Evaluation''' &lt;br&gt;
Monitoring and evaluation of social interventions tend to be too quantitative. Evaluation can benefit from the richness of qualitative approaches, such as story telling. Stories are based on experience and they represent empirical evidence of events. They capture the richness of events and the circumstances of the people involved in the events, their emotions and perspectives of reality. They also reveal life histories and the connection between personalities and events. In describing how things actually happened, stories offer learning opportunities for understanding causalities and the shifting dynamics that occur between people, events, technology, institutions and the environment. Besides, stories evoke a response from the listener, and this can add depth to the communication that is taking place during the re-telling.

Also, stories can summarize multiple events that are linked in some meaningful way in a cumulative manner that helps to identify trends so that future behaviour can be directed towards desirable outcomes. Hence, stories cultivate social change, becoming part of the intervention rather than being separate from it. As the outcome of story telling is in large part determined by the context of the telling, stories can be re-used within multiple contexts, thereby serving multiple purposes. While it is improbable that statistical analyses would contain stories, it is possible for stories to contain statistical analyses. Moreover, stories collect data that are difficult to represent in statistics, such as emotions, and evidence suggests that such factors are influential in determining community-based reactions to social interventions.

'''Time scales''' &lt;br&gt;
Donors and implementers often set the time scales for ICT projects with little reference to the recipient community. In some cases the time scales are determined within frameworks of national or international budgeting that have no bearing on the conduct of the project. Experience suggests that communities will determine for themselves the rate at which they take up innovations, and project implementers should be prepared for this. In the case of the Gujarat Milk Co-operative, implementation efforts spanned 10 years before the full potential of the application was achieved. Sometimes a focus on “deliverables” denies the dynamics of the social context of the project. Even use of the term “project” can be problematic. Projects have definite start and end points, which are important milestones for management, but the activity is often regarded by the recipient community more as a continuous process, with no ending in sight. These different perspectives can create tension between implementers and recipients.

'''Top-down or bottom-up''' &lt;br&gt;
ICT deployment tends to fall into one of two categories: top-down projects by central or state governments and bottom-up grass-roots initiatives by local communities and NGOs. Top-down national programmes have difficulty incorporating the specifics of the local context of a rural community. On the other hand, scaling up the successes of focused grass-roots initiatives is also proving to be a challenge.

There is a need for a methodology that will enable field workers involved with ICT projects to mobilize communities towards achieving optimum outcomes from them. If a detailed methodology can be formulated, tested and documented, then large numbers of field operatives can be trained to implement it across many communities. Such a capability would enhance the likelihood of optimal development outcomes from a nationwide implementation, effectively incorporating the benefits of focused small-scale grass-roots projects into a large-scale national programme.

Social mobilization has already been demonstrated to be an efficient means of alleviating poverty on a wide scale, using methods based on the exploitation of physical assets. An equivalent technique that focuses on exploiting information assets is now required. Methodologies are important for ICT professionals as they bring together simple tools and techniques that are useful in assuring a high degree of success with ICT implementation. Methodologies for the analysis, design and implementation of information systems account for all of the logical processes that need to be considered for an ICT project to achieve, or exceed, its objective. They go beyond the mere installation of technology by addressing the behavioural changes of technology users that are known to be necessary for technology to fulfil its potential. The most useful methodologies are those that can accomplish this aside from being easily taught to operatives who need not be highly qualified. Such methodologies incorporate simple-to-use tools and techniques that are structured together in such a way as to ensure that all aspects of the system problem are properly addressed.</text>

__TOC__

== What are the policy dimensions relating to ICTs for poverty alleviation? ==

'''Telecommunications reform''' &lt;br&gt;
Most developing countries are adopting policies to break down the monopoly provision of telecommunications services, with rural development as a target outcome. Despite limited understanding of the relationship between ICTs and rural development, as well as deficiencies in key resources, governments are generally enthusiastic about the prospects for rural development through the widespread deployment of ICTs. ICT policy formulation and implementation for rural development at the national level typically involves:

* A high-level authority, often under the direct control of the head of government
* Telecommunications reform
* Expansion of the physical infrastructure
* Focus on e-government and e-commerce
* Revised regulatory environment and legal framework
* Private sector participation
* Universal service arrangements
* Pilot projects

'''Rural development'''&lt;br&gt;
The largest numbers of poor people in Asia live in rural settings. Consequently, poverty alleviation is inextricably interwoven with rural development, and urban development without rural development is ill advised. Most rural areas are typified by scattered settlements, villages and small towns, which may be hundreds of kilometres from the nearest major urban centre. Rural and remote areas share some or all of the following characteristics:

* Shortage or absence of public services and health and education services;
* Shortage of qualified technical staff;
* Geographical or topological features that militate against the establishment of a telecommunication network at affordable cost;
* Harsh climatic conditions that impose severe equipment constraints;
* Limited economic activity, centred primarily on agriculture, fishing and cottage industries;
* Low per capita incomes, generally well below those in urban areas;
* Low population density; and
* High levels of traffic per telephone line due to the inadequacy of telecommunication services and the large numbers of users per line.

Accordingly, policy making for rural development must take each of these aspects of rural life into account.

Many of the examples included here demonstrate that ICTs can be used to alleviate the adverse impact of most or all of these negative aspects of rural life. For example, in the majority of developing countries, teledensity (expressed as the number of lines per 100 inhabitants) is low and in some cases very low in rural remote and poorly served areas. One of the prime causes of low teledensity is the high cost of installing equipment in return for low usage. However, new technologies already available or in an advanced stage of development offer scope for marked improvement. Benefits to be derived from the improvement of rural teledensity include the following:

* Integration of the rural population into national economic, social and political life
* Regional decentralization
* Improved effectiveness of government programmes
* Improvements in social welfare

Apart from the disparities between developed and developing nations, the rural-urban divide in most Asian developing countries leaves the majority of poor people at a huge disadvantage. For serious and measurable alleviation of poverty to occur, effective policies that specifically target rural development are necessary. By adopting and promoting ICTs for poverty alleviation, governments can make such policies more effective, increasing their scope of application across broad sections of the population, deepening their impact within narrow sections of the population, and generally making development more efficient.



== Is there a general framework describing poverty alleviation with ICTs? ==

From an examination of the examples quoted here, it is possible to trace events and influences backward from beneficiary to inception and to suggest a framework of ICT implementation that is engaged with relevant processes and principles of poverty alleviation. The framework so derived facilitates an understanding of how ICT can help alleviate poverty.

A pro-poor ICT policy begins with a development commitment that targets poverty alleviation, with government acknowledging its role as a major employer and user of ICTs. This leads to the infrastructure development that will be required to achieve widespread poverty alleviation through local access combined with suitable methods to ensure that access is used to the best effect. Government also encourages institution reform leading to the delivery of effective services capable of exploiting the infrastructure. The services are directed towards and delivered to the local access points of the poor people who need them.

'''ICT policy''' &lt;br&gt;
ICT policies should be concerned both with ICT production and ICT use. The concern here is for policies for ICT use that specifically target poverty alleviation, as opposed to e-commerce, e-government, e-learning, and the like. Although these carry the potential for poverty alleviation, they directly benefit better-off citizens and may not necessarily deliver benefits to poor people. ICT policies for poverty alleviation should directly address the causes of poverty.

'''Development strategies''' &lt;br&gt;
Specific strategies need to articulate how poverty alleviation will occur, for instance through enterprise development, micro-credit programmes, social mobilization, pro-poor tourism and HIV/AIDS awareness. Priorities reflecting needs that have been articulated by poor people themselves usually result in implementation that is more effective at alleviating poverty than those that are decided by governments or their advisers.

'''Local access''' &lt;br&gt;
Access to technologies has to be planned, organized and well managed. This is likely to be some form of shared access, perhaps through existing institutions such as libraries or post offices, or through the creation of new institutions such as multi-purpose community telecentres. Sharing access implies organizational arrangements that are not present when access is predominantly one-to-one, as in the rich countries, which means that modalities for shared access will be exclusively generated in developing countries.

'''Government as a user''' &lt;br&gt;
Governments typically control half of the ICT assets in developing countries. They are a major employer and a major supplier of public services. Their role as users of ICTs is critical to the national response to ICT-based opportunities and the rate of ICT adoption. They are also responsible for actually implementing policy, which is different from merely stating it.

'''Information and physical infrastructures''' &lt;br&gt;
The physical infrastructure is concerned primarily with the diffusion of telecommunications to rural and under-served populations, usually in some form of universal service scheme. Information infrastructures include existing media that serve to mobilize information within the country. ICTs open opportunities for new forms of information delivery that can be complementary to existing flows, without rendering them obsolete.

'''Methods''' &lt;br&gt;
Experience indicates that bottom-up approaches to the design of information systems for community development are superior to alternatives. Development that is demand-driven has a far greater likelihood of achieving its aims, and methods that foster listening to the poor and factoring their wishes into the design of solutions are usually more sustainable and more substantial. Policies have to cater for the inclusion of such methods.

'''Institutions'''&lt;br&gt;
Significant returns from ICTs are achieved when institutions adopt transformational approaches to service delivery, which often completely change the nature of the organization and revitalize its purpose and goals. If new technology is used merely as a substitute for old technology, without affecting existing patterns of behaviour, organization and relationship management, then sub-optimal outcomes can be expected.

'''Specific purposes'''&lt;br&gt;
Here the concern is what services ICTs are directed at—for example, education, health, and commerce—and how stakeholders are drawn into productive relationships that result in poverty alleviation. Looking at specific purposes includes determining who is responsible for what, and how activities are coordinated.

'''People'''&lt;br&gt;
The target population for policy-making for poverty alleviation must be known in relation to each specific service. Service must be capable of differentiating between the poor and the not-so-poor, so that benefits can be directed to their intended recipients.</text>

A Business Continuity Planning (BCP)  methodology is used to produce a plan to enable an organization to continue in operation in the face of some kind of interruption to its normal operation. The methodology needs to be scalable for an organization of any size and complexity.  Even though the methodology has roots in regulated industries, any type of organization may create a BCP manual, and arguably every organization ''should'' have one in order to ensure the organization's longevity.  Evidence that firms do not invest enough time and resources into BCP preparations are evident in disaster survival statistics.  Fires permanently close 44% of the business affected.  In the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, 150 businesses out of 350 affected failed to survive the event.  Conversely, the firms affected by the Sept 11 attacks with well-developed and tested BCP manuals were back in business within days.
 
A BCP manual for a small organization may be simply a printed manual stored safely away from the primary work location, containing the names, addresses, and phone numbers for crisis management staff, general staff members, clients, and vendors along with the location of the off-site data backup storage media, copies of insurance contracts, and other critical materials necessary for organizational survival.  At its most complex, a BCP manual may outline a secondary work site, technical requirements and readiness, regulatory reporting requirements, work recovery measures, the means to re-establish physical records, the means to establish a new supply chain, or the means to establish new production centers.  Firms should ensure that their BCP manual is realistic and easy to use during a crisis. As such, BCP sits along side crisis management and disaster recovery planning and is a part of an organization's overall [[/Risk management|risk management]].

The development of a BCP manual has five main phases: analysis, solution design, implementation, testing and organization acceptance, and maintenance.

Much of the BCP material on the Internet is sponsored by consultancies who offer fee-based services for BCP solution development, however basic tutorials are freely available on the Internet for properly motivated organizations.

== Analysis ==
The analysis phase in the development of a BCP manual consists of an impact analysis, threat analysis, and impact scenarios with the resulting BCP plan requirement documentation.

=== Impact analysis ===
An impact analysis results in the differentiation between critical and non-critical organization functions.  A function may be considered critical if the implications for stakeholders of damage to the organization resulting are regarded as unacceptable. Perceptions of the acceptability of disruption may be modified by the cost of establishing and maintaining appropriate business or technical recovery solutions.  A function may also be considered critical if dictated by law.  Next, the impact analysis results in the recovery requirements for each critical function.  Recovery requirements consist of the following information:

* The time frame in which the critical function must be resumed after the disaster
* The business requirements for recovery of the critical function, and/or
* The technical requirements for recovery of the critical function

=== Threat analysis ===
After defining recovery requirements, documenting potential threats is recommended to detail a specific disaster’s unique recovery steps.  Some common threats include the following:

* [[/Natural disasters/]] (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, fires)
* [[/Disease/]] 
* [[/Hacking/]]
* [[/Power outage/]]
* [[/Terrorism/]]

All threats in the examples above share a common impact - the potential of damage to organizational infrastructure - except one, disease.  The impact of diseases is initially purely human, and may be alleviated with technical and business solutions.  During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, some organizations grouped staff into separate teams, and rotated the teams between the primary and secondary work sites, with a rotation frequency equal to the incubation period of the disease.  

The organizations also banned face-to-face contact between opposing team members during business and non-business hours.  With such a split, organizations increased their resiliency against the threat of government-ordered quarantine measures if one person in a team contracted or was exposed to the disease.

Damage from flooding also has a unique characteristic. If an office environment is flooded with non-saline and contamination-free water (e.g., in the event of a pipe burst), equipment can be thoroughly dried and may still be functional.

=== Definition of impact scenarios ===
After defining potential threats, documenting the impact scenarios that form the basis of the business recovery plan is recommended.  In general, planning for the most wide-reaching disaster or disturbance is preferable to planning for a smaller scale problem, as almost all smaller scale problems are partial elements of larger disasters.  A typical impact scenario like 'Building Loss' will most likely encompass all critical business functions, and the worst potential outcome from any potential threat.  A business continuity plan may also document additional impact scenarios if an organization has more than one building.  Other more specific impact scenarios - for example a scenario for the temporary or permanent loss of a specific floor in a building - may also be documented.

=== Recovery requirement documentation ===
After the completion of the analysis phase, the business and technical plan requirements are documented in order to commence the implementation phase.  For an office-based, information technology intensive business, the plan requirements may cover the following elements which may  be classed as ICE (In Case of Emergency) data:

* The numbers and types of desks, whether dedicated or shared, required outside of the primary business location in the secondary location
* The individuals involved in the recovery effort along with their contact and technical details
* The applications and application data required from the secondary location desks for critical business functions
* The manual workaround solutions
* The maximum outage allowed for the applications
* The peripheral requirements like computer printers, copiers, fax machines, calculators, paper, pens etc.

Other business environments, such as production, distribution, warehousing, etc., will need to cover these elements, but are likely to have additional issues to manage following a disruptive event.

== Solution design ==
The goal of the solution design phase is to identify the most cost effective disaster recovery solution that meets two main requirements from the impact analysis stage. For IT applications, this is commonly expressed as:

# The minimum application and application data requirements
# The time frame in which the minimum application and application data must be available

Disaster recovery plans may also be required outside the IT applications domain, for example in preservation of information in hard copy format, or restoration of embedded technology in process plant.
This BCP phase overlaps with the disaster recovery planning methodology.  The solution phase determines:

* the crisis management command structure
* the location of a secondary work site (where necessary)
* telecommunication architecture between primary and secondary work sites
* data replication methodology between primary and secondary work sites
* the application and software required at the secondary work site, and
* the type of physical data requirements at the secondary work site.

== Implementation ==
The implementation phase, quite simply, is the execution of the design elements identified in the solution design phase.  Work package testing may take place during the implementation of the solution, however; work package testing does not take the place of organizational testing.

== Testing and organizational acceptance ==
The purpose of testing is to achieve organizational acceptance that the business continuity solution satisfies the organization's recovery requirements.  Plans may fail to meet expectations due to insufficient or inaccurate recovery requirements, solution design flaws, or solution implementation errors.  Testing may include:

* Crisis command team call-out testing
* Technical swing test from primary to secondary work locations
* Technical swing test from secondary to primary work locations
* Application test
* Business process test

At minimum, testing is generally conducted on a biannual or annual schedule. Problems identified in the initial testing phase may be rolled up into the maintenance phase and retested during the next test cycle.

== Maintenance ==
Maintenance of a BCP manual is broken down into three periodic activities.  The first activity is the confirmation of information in the manual.  The second activity is the testing and verification of technical solutions established for recovery operations.  The third activity is the testing and verification of documented organization recovery procedures.  A biannual or annual maintenance cycle is typical.

=== Information update and testing ===
All organizations change over time, therefore a BCP manual must change to stay relevant to the organization.  Once data accuracy is verified, normally a call tree test is conducted to evaluate the notification plan's efficiency as well as the accuracy of the contact data.  Some types of changes that should be identified and updated in the manual include:

* Staffing changes
* Staffing persona
* Changes to important clients and their contact details
* Changes to important vendors/suppliers and their contact details
* Departmental changes like new, closed or fundamentally changed departments.

=== Testing and verification of technical solutions ===
As a part of ongoing maintenance, any specialized technical deployments must be checked for functionality.  Some checks include:

* Computer virus definition distribution
* Application security and service patch distribution
* Hardware operability check
* Application operability check
* Data verification

=== Testing and verification of organization recovery procedures ===
As work processes change over time, the previously documented organizational recovery procedures may no longer be suitable.  Some checks include:

* Are all work processes for critical functions documented?
* Have the systems used in the execution of critical functions changed?
* Are the documented work checklists meaningful and accurate for staff?
* Do the documented work process recovery tasks and supporting disaster recovery infrastructure allow staff to recover within the predetermined recovery time objective?

=== Treatment of test failures ===
As suggested by the diagram included in this article, there is a direct relationship between the test and maintenance phases and the impact phase.  When establishing a BCP manual and recovery infrastructure from scratch, issues found during the testing phase often must be reintroduced to the analysis phase.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Before Starting To Optimise ==

When the database seems to be &quot;slow&quot; first consider all of the following points as 
e.g. making a certain query absolutely unnecessary by simply using a more sophisticated 
algorithm in the application is always the most elegant way of optimising it :)
# Finding the bottleneck (CPU, memory, I/O, which queries)
# Optimising the application (remove unnecessary queries or cache PHP generated web pages)
# Optimising the queries (using indices, temporary tables or different ways of joining)
# Optimising the database server (cache sizes etc)
# Optimising the system (different filesystem types, swap space and kernel versions)
# Optimising the hardware (sometimes indeed the cheapest and fastest way)

To find those bottlenecks the following tools have been found to be helpful:
; vmstat
: to quickly monitor cpu, memory and I/O usage and decide which is the bottleneck
; top
: to check the current memory and cpu usage of mysqld as well as of the applications
; mytop
: to figure out which queries cause trouble
; mysql-admin (the GUI application, not to confuse with mysqladmin)
: to monitor and tune mysql in a very convenient way
; [http://hackmysql.com/mysqlreport '''mysqlreport''']
: which output should be use as kind of step by step check list

Using these tools most applications can also be categorised very broadly using the following groups:
* I/O based and reading (blogs, news)
* I/O based and writing (web access tracker, accounting data collection)
* CPU based (complex content management systems, business apps)


== Optimising The Queries ==

=== Comparing functions with BENCHMARK ===

The BENCHMARK() function can be used to compare the speed of MySQL functions or operators. For example:
 mysql&gt; SELECT BENCHMARK(100000000, CONCAT('a','b'));
 +---------------------------------------+
 | BENCHMARK(100000000, CONCAT('a','b')) |
 +---------------------------------------+
 |                                     0 |
 +---------------------------------------+
 1 row in set (21.30 sec)

However, this cannot be used to compare queries:
 mysql&gt; SELECT BENCHMARK(100, SELECT `id` FROM `lines`);
 ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax;
 check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for
 the right syntax to use near 'SELECT `id` FROM `lignes`)' at line 1

As MySQL needs a fraction of a second just to parse the query and the system is probably busy doing other things, too,
benchmarks with runtimes of less than 5-10s can be considered as totally meaningless and equally runtimes differences
in that order of magnitude as pure chance.

=== Analysing functions with EXPLAIN ===

When you precede a SELECT statement with the keyword EXPLAIN, MySQL explains how it would process the SELECT,
providing information about how tables are joined and in which order.

Using and understanding EXPLAIN is essential when aiming for good performance therefore the relevant chapters
of the official documentation are a mandatory reading!

==== A simple example ====

The join of two table that both do not have indices:

 mysql&gt; explain SELECT * FROM a left join b using (i) WHERE a.i &lt; 2;
 +----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+-------------+
 | id | select_type | table | type | possible_keys | key  | key_len | ref  | rows | Extra       |
 +----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+-------------+
 |  1 | SIMPLE      | a     | ALL  | NULL          | NULL | NULL    | NULL |    4 | Using where |
 |  1 | SIMPLE      | b     | ALL  | NULL          | NULL | NULL    | NULL |    3 |             |
 +----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+-------------+
 2 rows in set (0.01 sec)

Now the second table gets an index and the explain shows that MySQL now knows that only 2 of the 3 rows
have to be used.

 mysql&gt; ALTER TABLE b ADD KEY(i);
 Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.01 sec)
 Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

 mysql&gt; explain SELECT * FROM a left join b using (i) WHERE a.i &lt; 2;
 +----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+------+---------+----------+------+-------------+
 | id | select_type | table | type | possible_keys | key  | key_len | ref      | rows | Extra       |
 +----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+------+---------+----------+------+-------------+
 |  1 | SIMPLE      | a     | ALL  | NULL          | NULL | NULL    | NULL     |    4 | Using where |
 |  1 | SIMPLE      | b     | ref  | i             | i    | 5       | test.a.i |    2 |             |
 +----+-------------+-------+------+---------------+------+---------+----------+------+-------------+
 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

Now the first table also gets an index so that the WHERE condition can be improved and MySQL knows that
only 1 row from the first table is relevant before even trying to search it in the data file.

 mysql&gt; ALTER TABLE a ADD KEY(i);
 Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.00 sec)
 Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

 mysql&gt; explain SELECT * FROM a left join b using (i) WHERE a.i &lt; 2;
 +----+-------------+-------+-------+---------------+------+---------+----------+------+-------------+
 | id | select_type | table | type  | possible_keys | key  | key_len | ref      | rows | Extra       |
 +----+-------------+-------+-------+---------------+------+---------+----------+------+-------------+
 |  1 | SIMPLE      | a     | range | i             | i    | 5       | NULL     |    1 | Using where |
 |  1 | SIMPLE      | b     | ref   | i             | i    | 5       | test.a.i |    2 |             |
 +----+-------------+-------+-------+---------------+------+---------+----------+------+-------------+
 2 rows in set (0.02 sec)

== Optimising The MySQL Server ==

=== Status and server variables ===

MySQL can be monitored and tuned by watching the '''status-variables''' and setting the '''server-variables''' which can both be global or per session.
The status-variables can be monitored by ''SHOW [GLOBAL|SESSION] STATUS [LIKE '%foo%']'' or ''mysqladmin [extended-]status''.
The server-variables can be set in the ''/etc/mysql/my.cnf'' file or via ''SET [GLOBAL|SESSION] VARIABLE foo := bar'' and be shown with ''mysqladmin variables'' or ''SHOW [GLOBAL|SESSION] VARIABLES [LIKE '%foo%']''.

Generally status variables start with a capital letter and server variables with a lowercase one.

When dealing with the above mentioned per-session system variables it should always be considered 
that those have to be multiplied by ''max_connections'' to estimate the maximal memory consumption. 
Failing to do so can easily lead to server crashes at times of load peaks when more than usual 
clients connect to the server! A quick and dirty estimation can be made with the following formular:

    min_memory_needed = global_buffers + (thread_buffers * max_connections)

    global_buffers:
        key_buffer
        innodb_buffer_pool
        innodb_log_buffer
        innodb_additional_mem_pool
        net_buffer

    thread_buffers:
        sort_buffer
        myisam_sort_buffer
        read_buffer
        join_buffer
        read_rnd_buffer

'''Note:''' Especially when dealing with server settings, all information should be
verified in the respective chapters of the official documentation as these are subject
of change and the authors of this text lack confirmed knowledge about how the server 
works internally.



=== Index / Indices ===

Indices are a way to locate elements faster. This works for single elements as well as range of elements.

==== Experiment ====

Note: when you make your time tests, make sure the query cache is disabled (&lt;code&gt;query_cache_type=0&lt;/code&gt; in my.cnf) to force recomputing your queries each time you type them instead of just taking the pre-computed results from the cache.


Let's run the following Perl program:
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;

print &quot;DROP TABLE IF EXISTS weightin;\n&quot;;
print &quot;CREATE TABLE weightin (
	id INT PRIMARY KEY auto_increment,
	line TINYINT,
	date DATETIME,
	weight FLOAT(8,3)
);\n&quot;;


# 2 millions records, interval = 100s
for (my $timestamp = 1000000000; $timestamp &lt; 1200000000; $timestamp += 100) {
    my $date = int($timestamp + rand(1000) - 500);
    my $weight = rand(1000);
    my $line = int(rand(3)) + 1;
    print &quot;INSERT INTO weightin (date, line, weight) VALUES (FROM_UNIXTIME($date), $line, $weight);\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

What does it do?
It simulate the data feeds from an industrial lines that weight stuff at regular intervals so we can compute the average material usage. Over time lots of records are piling up.

How to use it?
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
 mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE industrial
 $ perl generate_huge_db.pl | mysql industrial
 real	6m21.042s
 user	0m37.282s
 sys	0m51.467s
&lt;/source&gt;
We can check the number of elements with:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
 mysql&gt; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM weightin;
 +----------+
 | count(*) |
 +----------+
 |  2000000 | 
 +----------+
 1 row in set (0.00 sec)
&lt;/source&gt;
The size must be important:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 $ perl generate_huge_db.pl &gt; import.sql
 $ ls -lh import.sql
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 189M jun 15 22:08 import.sql
 
 $ ls -lh /var/lib/mysql/industrial/weightin.MYD
 -rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql 35M jun 15 22:17 /var/lib/mysql/industrial/weightin.MYD
 
 $ time mysqldump industrial &gt; dump.sql 
 real	0m9.599s
 user	0m3.792s
 sys	0m0.616s
 $ ls -lh dump.sql
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 79M jun 15 22:18 dump.sql
 
 $ time mysqldump industrial | gzip &gt; dump.sql.gz 
 real	0m17.339s
 user	0m11.897s
 sys	0m0.488s
 $ ls -lh dump.sql.gz  
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 22M jun 15 22:19 dump.sql.gz
&lt;/source&gt;
Incidentally restoring from the dump is way faster, because it uses extended inserts!
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 # time zcat dump.sql.gz | mysql industrial
 real	0m31.772s
 user	0m3.436s
 sys	0m0.580s
&lt;/source&gt;

This SQL command will scan all records to get a total sum:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
 mysql&gt; SELECT SUM(*) FROM weightin;
&lt;/source&gt;
Let's say we need to compute the total material used during January 1st 2008:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
 mysql&gt; SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(poids) FROM pesee WHERE date &gt;= '2008-01-01' AND date &lt; '2008-01-02';
&lt;/source&gt;
MySQL will also need to browse the entire database, even for this tiny amount of records. This is because records can be anywhere: at the bottom, at the end, in the middle, nothing guarantees that the records are ordered.

To improve this, we can add an index to the 'date' field. This means MySQL will create a new hidden table with all the date sorted chronologically, and store their offset (position) in the 'weightin' table to retrieve the full record.

Because the index is sorted, it's way faster for MySQL to locate a single record (using a binary search algorithm) or even a range of data (find the first and last element, the range is in-between).

To add the index:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
 ALTER TABLE weightin ADD INDEX (date);
&lt;/source&gt;
The index doesn't work if the query needs computer on the field (e.g. &lt;code&gt;TIME(date)&lt;/code&gt;) but works for ranges (e.g. &lt;code&gt;WHERE date &lt; '2008-01-02'&lt;/code&gt;).

You can notice that the .MYD file grew:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 $ ls -lh /var/lib/mysql/industrial/
 -rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql  49M jun 15 22:36 weightin.MYI
&lt;/source&gt;
That's were MySQL stores the indices. Initially there was an index for the 'id' field, which the case for all primary keys.


==== Another example ====
Another example: let's say we want to optimise this query:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
 mysql&gt; SELECT DISTINCT line FROM weightin;
&lt;/source&gt;

We can do so by adding an index on the 'line' field, in order to group the doubles together, which will avoid the query to rescan the whole table to localize them:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
 ALTER TABLE weightin ADD INDEX (line);
&lt;/source&gt;

The index file grew:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 -rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql  65M jun 15 22:38 weightin.MYI
&lt;/source&gt;

==== General considerations ====

The first and foremost question that is always asked for SELECT queries is always if 
indices (aka &quot;keys&quot;) are configured and if they are, whether or not they are actually 
be used by the database server.



; 1. Check if the indices are actually used
Individual queries can be checked with the &quot;EXPLAIN&quot; command. For the whole server 
the &quot;Sort_%&quot; variables should be monitored as they indicate
how often MySQL had to browse through the whole data file because there was no usable index available.

; 2. Are the indices buffered
Keeping the indices in memory improves read performance a lot.
The quotient of &quot;Key_reads / Key_read_requests&quot; tells how often MySQL actually accessed
the index file on disk when it needed a key. Same goes for Key_writes, use mysqlreport 
to do the math for you here. If the percentage is too high, key_buffer_size for MyISAM and
innodb_buffer_pool_size for InnoDB are the corresponding variables to tune.

The Key_blocks_% variables can be used to see how much of the configured key buffer is actually used. The unit is 1KB if not set otherwise in key_cache_block_size. As MySQL uses some blocks internally, key_blocks_unused has to be checked. To estimate how big the buffer should be,
the sizes of the relevant .MYI files can be summed up. For InnoDB there is innodb_buffer_pool_size although in this case not only the indices but also the data gets buffered.

; 3. Further settings

sort_buffer_size (per-thread) is the memory that is used for ORDER BY and GROUP BY. myisam_sort_buffer_size is something completely different and should not be altered.

read_buffer_size (per-thread) is the size of memory chunks that are read from disk into memory at once when doing a full table scan as big tables do not fit into memory completely. This seldomly needs tuning.

=== Query cache ===

The main reason not to use any MySQL version below 4.0.1 if you have read-based applications is that beginning with that version, MySQL has the ability to store the result of SELECT queries until their tables are modified.

The Query Cache can be configured with the '''query_cache_%''' variables. Most important here are the global '''query_cache_size''' and
'''query_cache_limit''' which prevents single queries with unusual big results larger than this size to use up the whole cache.

Note that the Query Cache blocks have a variable size whose minimum size is query_cache_min_res_unit, so after a complete cache
flush the number of free blocks is ideally just one. A large value of Qcache_free_blocks just indicates a high fragmentation.

Worth monitoring are the following variables:
* '''Qcache_free_blocks'''
: If this value is high it indicates a high fragmentation which does not need to be a bad thing though.
* '''Qcache_not_cached'''
: If this value is high there are either much uncachable queries (e.g. because they use functions like now()) or the value for query_cache_limit is too low.
* '''Qcache_lowmem_prunes'''
: This is the amount of old results that have been purged because the cache was full and not because their underlying tables have been modified. query_cache_size must be increased to lower this variable.

Examples:

An empty cache:
 mysql&gt; SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'query_cache_type';
 +------------------+-------+
 | Variable_name    | Value |
 +------------------+-------+
 | query_cache_type | ON    |
 +------------------+-------+
 1 row in set (0.00 sec)
 
 mysql&gt; SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'query_cache_size';
 +------------------+-------+
 | Variable_name    | Value |
 +------------------+-------+
 | query_cache_size | 0     |
 +------------------+-------+
 1 row in set (0.00 sec)
 
 mysql&gt; SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Qcache%';
 +-------------------------+-------+
 | Variable_name           | Value |
 +-------------------------+-------+
 | Qcache_free_blocks      | 0     |
 | Qcache_free_memory      | 0     |
 | Qcache_hits             | 0     |
 | Qcache_inserts          | 0     |
 | Qcache_lowmem_prunes    | 0     |
 | Qcache_not_cached       | 0     |
 | Qcache_queries_in_cache | 0     |
 | Qcache_total_blocks     | 0     |
 +-------------------------+-------+
 8 rows in set (0.00 sec)

A used cache (savannah.gnu.org):
 mysql&gt; SHOW VARIABLES LIKE &quot;query_cache_size&quot;;
 +------------------+----------+
 | Variable_name    | Value    |
 +------------------+----------+
 | query_cache_size | 33554432 |
 +------------------+----------+
 1 row in set (0.00 sec)

 mysql&gt; SHOW STATUS LIKE &quot;Qcache%&quot;;
 +-------------------------+----------+
 | Variable_name           | Value    |
 +-------------------------+----------+
 | Qcache_free_blocks      | 1409     |
 | Qcache_free_memory      | 27629552 |
 | Qcache_hits             | 7925191  |
 | Qcache_inserts          | 3400435  |
 | Qcache_lowmem_prunes    | 2946778  |
 | Qcache_not_cached       | 71255    |
 | Qcache_queries_in_cache | 4546     |
 | Qcache_total_blocks     | 10575    |
 +-------------------------+----------+
 8 rows in set (0.00 sec)

The matching &lt;code&gt;my.cnf&lt;/code&gt; configuration parameter is:
 query_cache_size = 32M

To clear the cache (useful when testing a new query's efficiency):
 mysql&gt; RESET QUERY CACHE;
 Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

=== Waiting for locks ===

The '''Table_locks_%''' variables show the number of queries that had to wait because the tables they tried to access where currently locked by
other queries. These situations can be caused by &quot;LOCK TABLE&quot; statements and also by e.g. simultaneous write accesses to the same table.


=== Table cache ===

MySQL needs a certain time just to &quot;open&quot; a table and read its meta data like column names etc.
If many threads are trying to access the same table, it is opened multiple times.
To speed this up the meta data can be cached in the '''table_cache'''. 
A good value for this setting is the number of max_connections multiplied with the number of usually used tables per SELECT.

Using mysqlreport or by looking at the currently '''Open_tables''' and ever since '''Opened_tables''' as well as the '''Uptime'''
the number of necessary table opens per second can be calculated (consider the off-peak times like nights though).


=== Connections and threads ===

For every client connection (aka session) MySQL creates a separated thread under the main mysqld process. For big sites with several hundred new
connections per second, creating the threads itself can consume a significant amount of time. To speed things up, idle threads can be cached after
their client disconnected. As a rule of thumb not more than one thread per second should be newly created.
Clients that send several queries to the server should use '''persistent connections''' like with PHPs mysql_pconnect() function.

This cache can be configured by '''thread_cache_size''' and monitored with the '''threads_%''' variables.

To avoid overloads MySQL blocks new connections if more than '''max_connections''' are currently in use. Start with '''max_used_connections''' and monitor the number of connection that were rejected in '''Aborted_clients''' and the ones that timed out in '''Aborted_connections'''.
Forgotten disconnects from clients that use persistent connections can easily lead to a denial of service situation so be aware! Normally connections are closed after '''wait_timeout''' seconds of being idle.


=== Temporary tables ===

It is perfectly normal that MySQL creates temporary tables while sorting or grouping results. Those tables are either be held in memory
or if too large be written to disk which is naturally much slower.
The number of disk tables among the '''Created_tmp_%''' variables should be neglectible or else the settings in '''max_heap_table_size''' and '''tmp_table_size''' be reconsidered.

=== Delayed writes ===

In situations like writing webserver access log files to a database, with many subsequent INSERT queries for rather unimportant data into the same table, the performance can be improved by advising the server to cache the write requests a little while and then send a whole batch of data
to disk.

Be aware though that all mentioned methods contradicts ACID compliance because INSERT queries are acknowledged with OK to the client before the data has actually be written to disk and thus can still get lost in case of an power outage or server crash. Additionally the side effects mentioned in the documentation often reads like a patient information leaflet of a modern medicament...

MyISAM tables can be given the '''DELAY_KEY_WRITE''' option using CREATE or ALTER TABLE. The drawback is that after a crash the table is automatically marked as corrupt and has to be checked/repaired which can take some time.

InnoDB can be told with '''innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit''' to delay writing the data a bit. In case of a server crash the data itself is supposed
to be still consistent, just the indices have to be rebuilt.

'''INSERT DELAYED''' works on main Storage Engines on a per query base.

== Conclusion ==

Alleviating poverty with ICTs is not as straightforward as merely installing the technology, but it is not conceptually complex either. Provided a few relatively simple principles can be followed, it seems likely that widespread poverty alleviation can be achieved with ICTs. The main challenges are not actually in the technology; they lie in the coordination of a disparate set of local and national factors, each of which can derail efforts if not taken into account.

In summary, the following five principles emerge from the ICT for Poverty Alleviation Framework described above:

* Strategize for poverty alleviation, not for ICT
* Reform telecommunications through privatization, competition and independent regulation
* Promote public access: aggregate demand for sustainability (which is not only financial)
* Reform institutions to achieve transformational benefits
* Develop appropriate approaches for listening to the poor

As a crosscutting multidimensional approach to development, ICTs can stretch implementation energies to the full. They also challenge traditional approaches to development. But they promise substantial improvements in the daily lives of millions of poor people. The framework for poverty alleviation is offered as a tool for guiding efforts towards achieving this potential. The framework allows for a full consideration of the range of relevant critical factors prior to embarking on implementation as well as for post-hoc reflections on outcomes. It represents a first effort, and it is acknowledged that other, similar tools exist. Through a combination and further synthesis of experiences and observations, the framework can become a practical tool for use by planners and policy-makers with general applicability in multiple contexts.

===Painting===
By overriding the &lt;code&gt;update(Graphics g)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;paint(Graphics g)&lt;/code&gt; methods of an Applet (or one of it's sub-components), you can have fairly direct control over the rendering of an Applet.  The Graphics object provides various primitives for working for two-dimensional graphics.

{{recipe}}

A '''chokladboll''' (literally meaning ''chocolate ball'') is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Sweden|Swedish]] pastry often eaten with [[Cookbook:Coffee|coffee]] during [[w:Fika_(coffee_break)|fika]]. They are quick and easy to prepare, since they require no baking and only a few, common ingredients.

== Ingredients ==
* 8 [[Cookbook:dL|dl]] (3 1/4 cups) [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]]
* 3 dl (1 1/4 cups) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 6 [[Cookbook:Tbsp|Tbsp]] (90 ml) [[Cookbook:Cocoa|cocoa]]
* 1 Tbsp (15 ml) [[Cookbook:Vanilla Sugar|vanilla sugar]] (or 1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla extract, added with the coffee)
* 150 g (2/3 cup) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 6 Tbsp (90 ml) cold [[Cookbook:Coffee|coffee]]
* flaked [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]] or [[Cookbook:Pearl Sugar|pearl sugar]]

== Procedure ==
{{Wikipedia|Chokladboll}}
# Mix oats (Instant Oats will give a better texture and flavor and is recommended), sugar, vanilla sugar, and cocoa in a large bowl.
# Using your hands or a [[Cookbook:Potato Masher|potato masher]], incorporate the butter into the dry ingredients until the dough has an even consistency.  It will aid mixing if the butter has been allowed to soften slightly rather than being fridge-cold.
# Add the coffee and mix until incorporated.
# Fill a small bowl with flaked coconut or pearl sugar.
# With your hands, roll the dough into 3 cm (1 inch) diameter balls.
# Roll each ball in the coconut or pearl sugar and place on a tray.
# Chill chocolate balls for at least one hour before serving.

      <text xml:space="preserve">*'''What is ASIMO?'''

ASIMO is a humanoid robot which can simulate the motions of the human body. ASIMO is designed by the Honda corporation and has been under development since 1986. ASIMO initially started off as a set of legs to simulate walking and since than has come under change into a complete robot with legs, a core unit, arms and head. 


*'''How ASIMO moves'''

ASIMO moves through the use of a Prediction Movement Control system. This system allows ASIMO to anticipate it’s next step and even shifts it’s center of gravity to maintain balance these adjustments can all occur within real time. Although  ASIMO’s legs are important , they are not the only part which enables ASIMO to move dynamically. The hips which ASIMO uses are specially design to flex for quick adjustments in movements.


*'''Other functions of ASIMO'''

Other functions of ASIMO include climbing stairs, face recognition, voice recognition and the ability to grasp objects. All of these functions have been developed over years of modification to ASIMO. The current development is the ability for ASIMO to run and maintain balance. Even though the pace of the run is quiet slow compared to a person, ASIMO can run at a pace of one mile per hour. 


*'''The future of ASIMO'''

The future of ASIMO is further development into complete dynamic movements along with prolonged battery life. ASIMO is expected within the next thirty to forty years to be released to the public for everyday use and assistance. Already ASIMO has been incorporated into specific companies and museums as greeters, and has made it’s way over into North .Where it currently is involved in a fifteen minute show  that introduces ASIMO to people and the benefits of ASIMO’s capabilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">;King Harold: The wireless technology called Bluetooth is named after the Danish King Harold Blatand (Harold Bluetooth). As Harold was largely responsible for the unification of warring parties of Sweden,Denmark, and Norway, similarly,the modern Bluetooth is responsible for the unification or better yet communication of businesses worldwide.
;Bluetooth more specifically
:Bluetooth is a wireless short range communications specification supported by a special interest group comprised of Ericsson, Nokia, Intel, IBM and Toshiba. It allows cable free connectivity between mobile phones, mobile PCs, printers, and hand helds. The range of Bluetooth is 10 meters (30 feet).It supports voice or data transmissions at a rate of up to 1Mbps and has a frequency range of 2.4 to 2.4835 GHz. It is specifically designed to replace the use of cables between devices, such as to connect wireless keyboard or wireless mouse to the desktop computer. Bluetooth technology is even used to send print job wirelessly from a portable computer to a printer or it is used to connect two mobile phones for transferring certain data like music or files. In today’s world Bluetooth Technology is available in cars too, so that the mobile phone is connected to car Bluetooth and it enables the driver to receive or make calls or even connect his music files to the car stereo system. The signals of Bluetooth can transmit through clothing or other non-metallic objects; hence it can connect directly to any Bluetooth Technology encrypted device.
                                                                               [[File:Tecnologia bluetooth.jpg|thumb|Tecnologia bluetooth]]
;More on Bluetooth
:Bluetooth is a radio technology that allows exchange of communications even in areas with electromagnetic disturbances. It is replacing cable or infrared devices by making use of low cost transceiver chips that are embedded in the mobile devices. It also makes use of built in encryption and verification codes which allow the secure transfer of information.

'''''&lt;u&gt;Telemedicine&lt;/u&gt;'''''
[[File:Unm telemedicineprogram.jpg|left|100px|thumb|Telemedicine Program]]

Telemedicine Today is the leading news and information source for the telemedicine industry, with a readership that includes telemedicine practitioners, physicians, hospital administrators, healthcare information specialists, vendors, consultants, policy makers, and others interested in this dynamic field.
Telemedicine is the use of networking technology to provide medical information and services and is mosIt is specifically designed to replace the use of cables between devices, such as to connect wireless keyboard or wireless mouse to the desktop computer. Bluetooth technology is even used to send print job wirelessly from a portable computer to a printer or it is used to connect two mobile phones for transferring certain data like music or files. In today’s world Bluetooth Technology is available in cars too, so that the mobile phone is connected to car Bluetooth and it enables the driver to receive or make calls or even connect his music files to the car stereo system. The signals of Bluetooth can transmit through clothing or other non-metallic objects; hence it can connect directly to any Bluetooth Technology encrypted device.t often used to provide care to individuals who live in remote areas to consult with a specialist. For example, physician can use Videoconferencing to communicate remotely with other physician or with hospitalized patients.  Physicians can also use telemedicine to perform remote diagnosis of patients. For example, healthcare workers at rural locations, childcare facilities, and other locations can use video cameras, electronic stethoscopes, and other devices to send images and vital statistics of a patient to a physician located at a medical facility.  There is another example of telemedicine is telesurgery - a form of robot assisted surgery where a robot controlled by a physician operates on the patient.  At least one of the surgeons performs the operation by controlling the robot remotely over the Internet or another network. Robot assisted surgery systems typically use cameras to give human surgeon an extremely close view of the surgical area. 
Telemedicine has a huge potential for providing quality medical care to individuals who live in rural areas or underdeveloped areas that do not have access to medical care.  It will also be necessary for future long-term space explorations. NASA astronauts and physicians recently performed telesurgery experiments in the Aquarius Undersea Laboratory 50 feet below the ocean surface to help in the development of a robotic unit that will allow physicians to perform surgery remotely on patients who are in outer space.  Telemedicine is not a separate medical specialty. Products and services related to telemedicine are often part of a larger investment by health care institutions in either information technology or the delivery of clinical care.

'''''&lt;u&gt;Telepharmacy&lt;/u&gt;'''''

Just like telemedicine, the goal of telepharmacy is to bring healthcare services to remote locations where these services are needed. Telepharmacy takes advantage of network technology to bring pharmacy services to those remote areas where a pharmacist is needed. Telepharmacies can stock typical inventory of prescription as well as over-the-counter medications and appear just like full-service retail pharmacies or they can exist within institutional settings such as hospitals. The way telepharmacy works is that the telepharmacy is always staffed by a pharmacy technician who can accept prescription orders from patients. The order is then prepared by the technician for final check by the pharmacist. The pharmacist will then review the patient's profile of concurrent medications to identify any issues such as drug interactions or allergies and will also check the prescription order prepared by the technician using the same network technology. Patient counseling is also conducted via videoconferencing which is conducted inside a private consultation room where the technician will direct the patient to speak with the pharmacist privately. From start to finish, the same pharmacy services can be provided to patients through the use of videoconferencing and the safe delivery of pharmacy services still remains the responsibility of the pharmacist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Test in at least four browser engines (Gecko, Webkit, Trident, Presto) each time you make a change
to avoid massive debugging efforts at the &quot;end&quot; of a layout styling task

Only use classes for a collection of elements that may appear in multiple sections of a single page, otherwise just reference the collection using the ID of their container

Validate the HTML and CSS code to make sure the markup is not breaking the layout and the style rules do not contain any syntax errors

Make sure that margins and paddings have been reset if there is mysterious whitespace between elements

Make sure that there are no line breaks or whitespace between an anchor tag and a nested image or span if the layout is mysteriously broken

Make sure that all four corners of each element is visible using the a browser-based box model tool (Web Developer Toolbar, IE Developer Toolbar, Dragonfly, Display Element Info Bookmarket) to identify overflow related issues. If the width is too large and the right border is missing, reduced the fixed width of the element. If the height is too large and the bottom border is missing, turn off overflow if the content is not truncated, otherwise reduce the height or reposition any neighboring elements with absolute positioning, relative positioning, or negative margins that are obscuring the content

Use applied styles context menu in the IE Developer Toolbar to see which rules in the cascade are overwriting the ones you want

Make sure the parent element used to increase specificity is available in all templates

Copy and paste generated source in HTML validator for pages where the validator doesn't work on the URL

Make sure that padding for any child elements is not forcing the container to expand outside of its defined dimensions, and reduce the dimensions accordingly if you cannot avoid setting both padding and width or height on the same element

Make sure to test the layout with and without toolbars in the browser chrome to make sure no min-height bugs are triggered by adding or removing menus from the browser

Make sure that styles you have defined are not being overwritten by existing styles with more specificity or those defined later in the CSS code by increasing the selector weight using references to parent classes or IDs

Make sure to use Firebug or Web Inspector to verfiy mini-resets of localized CSS rules and increase the selector weight if necessary to override cascading that may inadvertently cause mysterious layout issues

Make sure to increase the selector weight of IE specific CSS rules when doing so for universal styles

Make sure that the width and height dimensions of the container allow enough space to provide the vertical or horizontal positioning declared in the CSS code

Make sure that the width and height dimensions of all floated elements fit within the constraints of the container

Make sure that the width of right aligned content such as label copy is only as large as needed to avoid using left margins or padding for alignment since it may not be consistent across browsers

Make sure that floated elements with wrapping content have a defined width and proper text alignment

Make sure that any containers that expand on :hover have the a default width and height which is greater than or equal to the size of any nested elements

Make sure that fixed-width containers use overflow:hidden so shrinkwrapped nested blocks don't cause margin collapsing in older versions of Firefox

Make sure that all inline elements are absolutely positioned or contained in block level elements
 
Change the position attributes of the container to make sure it allows absolute or relative placement of nested elements  

Create a copy of the template and remove all divs except the misaligned one and its adjacent divs to debug positioning issues

Put a container div around block level elements that don't respond to display:inline or display:inline-block declarations

Remove margins from inner divs when debugging ignored positioning values in absolutely positioned divs
 
Remove all inline text and start with a non-breaking space as the placeholder content to debug width and height issues

Set margin, padding, font-size, and border size to zero for debugging unseen inheritance issues

Use display:block with a fixed height if margins are inconsistent for inline text in situations such as creating a header using markup and one-pixel high element with margin offsets to create rounded corners 

Use a unique fixed width for each row instead of margin offsets to create rounded corners inside of inline-block containers for IE6 and IE7
 
Use a unique background-position for each row to create rounded corners with a background image covering half of the container but not the other

Use IE specific styles when absolutely positioned elements or margins are inconsistent with other browsers

Use a fixed width container when absolutely positioned elements do not appear within the correct relatively positioned parent in IE

Use position:relative on a container with overflow:scroll or auto if content with position:absolute or relative behaves like position:fixed upon scrolling in IE

Use obvious background colors to highlight misplaced or misaligned nested elements when debugging
inner divs

Use inline styles and remove ID and class references to display elements that are invisible due to an unknown CSS error

Use word-wrap:break-word(CSS3 Property) or wbr(and its alternatives) to break lines within long words to prevent overflow of an unbreakable string from causing horizontal scrollbars or inadvertent wrapping of blocks to a new line 

Use table specific font rules in IE5 set since those applied to html and body tags do not cascade to table elements

Use divs instead of paragraphs when margins don't take effect

Use divs instead of paragraphs to avoid the inherit vertical margins between paragraphs

Use display:inline on an absolutely positioned elements to avoid hasLayout issues

Use margins to move absolutely positioned elements instead of directional shifts

Use border-collapse: collapse; and border-spacing:0 to remove gaps between table columns

Use border styling on the td element instead of the tr element after doing the above to create grid lines on a table

Use empty-cells: hide to remove borders from empty table cells

Use position:relative on inline text and position:absolute on block-level containers and media

Use inline-block to give hasLayout to a relatively positioned container

Make sure class selectors aren't inadvertently overridden by default values of ID selectors, 
especially background-position changes for sprites, by dividing the properties of ID selectors using longhand notation

Use vertical-align middle to line up inline-block elements in IE; use vertical-align:top for form elements

Use overflow:visible on parent elements if negative margins don't reveal overflow content

Create more classes with specific names instead of creating more complex parent=&amp;gt;child references

Make sure there's not a more specific CSS rule or one that comes later in the style sheet which is overriding the desired effect

Make sure the there's not a number at the beginning of the ignored class or ID name

IE will only change the state of a hovered child element when something changes on the anchor tag, so use a redundant effect like a:hover{ visibility:visible; } if something like a:hover span { display:block; } doesn't work

IE will only change the state of a hovered child element that is referenced using a parent class or id if a property is set on the anchor tag that hasn’t been declared in any other pseudo classes for that anchor, such as text indent:0, float:none, direction:inherit, visibility:inherit, white-space:normal, etc
ex. 
.class a:hover span{} needs .class a:hover{visibility:inherit;}

IE will increase the width of a container with an italicized font style so use overflow:hidden to avoid inconsistent wrapping if possible

If links on a page are clickable in IE only, look for an absolutely positioned element that overlaps the links and raise the z-index value of the link container or reposition the layout so the overlap does not happen

If the property value for a group of elements doesn't work, redefine that property value for one of those elements to see if a comma is missing or an unsupported selector nullified the entire rule 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
#business_photo, .sentence, .instruction, .list &amp;amp;gt; li { padding-bottom: 24px; }

/* Redefine the same padding value because the descendant selector nullifies the above line in IE6 */
#business_photo { padding-bottom: 24px; }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If neighboring elements are mysteriously repositioned when an event or hover triggers the display or a submenu or other hidden content, make sure that content is not relatively positioned in external CSS, inline CSS, or generated JavaScript attributes.

If margins between a series of lists with headers are inconsistent due to special cases such as scrollbars for overflow in long lists or different margins for the first or last list, remove margins from the lists themselves and put them on the headers and use padding at the top and bottom of the container to handle spacing between the first or last list and the borders

If a border does not show up on around an element, make the color black or white to see if the color is too light or dark to distinguish from the background

If a div is being pushed beneath its specified position to a new line, use the mouse to select the content within the div to see if the dimensions of a block element within it are causing overflow outside the container. Make sure to set the width of any forms within the container in addition to validating the HTML to make sure no block tags are missing or inline tags have block tags nested within them.

If a hover or visited state of a hyperlink is not working correctly, do the following checks:
-Make sure the pseudo classes are defined in the correct order
-Make sure the pseudo classes don't share the same definition as a less-specific element, like a:hover{color: #ccc;} and .mylink:hover{color: #ccc;} since the browser will group them together and parse the less-specific rules in the cascade before the more specific rule, such as .mysite{color: #eee;}. If this is the case, add a reference to the parent container to the pseudo class rules, for example .mymenu .mylink:hover{color: #ccc;} to increase the selector weight.
-Make sure the pseduo classes are defined or the element selector instead of the class selector, for example .nav a:hover vs nav a.submenu:hover. This may not work in IE6.
-Make sure the rules are defined in the proper order, which is the following:
1. :link, :visited 
2. :hover, :focus
3. :active

Since a link can simultaneously be in the :visited, :hover, and :active states, and they have the same specificity, the last one listed wins.
  
Increase or decrease the text inside a container to make sure it wraps text and resizes properly

Increase or decrease the font size of the browser a few times to see how it affects your backgrounds and margins, especially for text used in headings and navigation

Apply classes to different elements to make sure each class is not dependent upon a specific tag 

Include several block elements such as a few paragraphs and a large list inside a div to see if it breaks the flow of the container

Set position:relative on floated elements if they are not visible in IE6 or IE7

Set a fixed width or height for a data table cell if word wrapping causes any nested containers with relative dimensions to expand. If there is a div container with a percentage width inside any table cell, content that forces word wrapping in another cell causes the relative width of the div will grow in IE6 and IE7 to match the overflow width of the table cell if an explicit width or height is not set on the cell to contain the content

Reset the line-height of an element if it stretches larger than its defined height in IE

Use clear to break an element away from a floated sibling and wrap it to a new line

Separate HTML structure and CSS design by developing the naming conventions and organization of the container styles without thinking about the content

Create a reusable library of headers, footers, submenus, navigation bars, lists, forms, and grid layouts

Use consistent semantic style names for classes and IDs

Design modules to be transparent on the inside

Extend objects by applying multiple classes to an element

Use CSS reset styles, web-safe fonts, and grids on all projects

Avoid location dependent styles that break outside of the cascade   

Avoid using a class name that describes the tag or property it is mapped to, such as .hidediv or .floatleft

Avoid using IDs to style content within the main layout containers

Avoid using images to replace text

Avoid drop shadows and rounded corners over irregular backgrounds

Avoid nesting divs inside of spans or having spans adjacent to divs to prevent triggering side-effects caused by the behavior of anonymous block boxes

Using 1px dotted borders in IE6 is buggy and will display a dashed border. Use an IE6 specific style of 2px border-width and a lighter shade of the desired color to offset the larger pixel size.

Any vertical-align value besides top or bottom will be rendered inconsistenly across browsers for form elements

Only use the !important declaration to create user style sheets or to override an inline style if the HTML markup is not editable. The !important declaration must follow the value of the property that it intends to give weight to. Since inline styles can be added to any HTML tag, using the style attribute selector is the only way to override those styles if a class or ID attribute is not defined for the element, as in the following example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
div[style]{ background-color: #f00 !important; }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

When using abs pos elements, make them the last child element of the rel pos container in the HTML source order for IE6

Use an abs pos span nested inside an href to create dropdowns that show up in different places

Use the nested span trick to highlight the parent container of a nav list by setting it's background color to the desired nav background and making it visible on hover. Make the ul the rel pos parent and give it overflow hidden, and make the empty span bottom:0; z-index:-1; height: 99em; and width equal to the nav
&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;ul id=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Test 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Use the nested span trick to create polygonal shaped links by offsetting their background positioning and placing them over the desired content

Use a:focus{width:0,height:0,outline:0} to remove dotted borders

Use abs/rel positioning to emulate outlines in IE6/7

Use resets to debug margin/padding issues

Use margins is remove padding and top/bottom positioning for abs positioned elements if spacing is off

Use :default to select all radio button sets

Use :active as :focus in IE6

Make sure parent div used for specificity is available in all templates

Use relative/absolute div with a background color to replace text with ellipsis using the follwing steps:

Create a content div with the original content and a height equal to the font-size * the number of rows you want visible

When a JavaScript event is triggered, reduce the height to the new number of rows you want visible by adding a class with that setting

Make sure class selectors aren't inadvertently overridden by default values of ID selectors, especially background-position changes for sprites, by dividing the properties of ID selectors into pieces

Use vertical-align middle to line up inline-block elements in IE; use vertical-align:top for form elements

Use change events to delegate input and select elements

Use active link states and relative positioning to respond to link clicks

Use the following alternatives for buffering offscreen content:
-Negative margins instead of display:none
-Relative positioning offsets instead of visibility:hidden for text
-background-position instead of visibility:hidden for images
-display:inline block instead of display:table
-clip:rect instead of max-width/height

Absolutely positioned elements moved outside of their relatively positioned parents in Firefox 2 cause the containers to stretch

Use margins for the outermost elements

Use padding for elements that have a background color or image

:-moz-only-whitespace matches an element that has no child nodes at all or empty text nodes or text nodes that have only white-space in them. Only when there are element nodes or text nodes with one or more characters inside the element, the element doesn't match this pseudo-class anymore.

::-moz-selection (::selection) pseudo-element applies to the portion of a document that has been highlighted (e.g. selected with the mouse) by the user.

The :-moz-first-node pseudo-class matches an element that is the first child node of some other element. It differs from :first-child because it does not match a first child element with (non-whitespace) text before it.

The :-moz-last-node pseudo-class matches an element that is the last child node of some other element. It differs from :last-child because it does not match a last child element with (non-whitespace) text after it.

The ::-moz-list-bullet pseudo-class is used to edit the bullet of a list element.

The :default pseudo-class is used to identify a user interface element that is the default among a group of similar elements

Use -ms-text-align-last for orphan lines at the end of paragraphs

Use xsl:number to mimic generated content for counters in IE

Use outlines to style buttons with white accents

Use  q { quotes: '&quot;' '&quot;' } to define quote characters

Use the following to trigger quote character display:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
q:before { content: open-quote }
q:after  { content: close-quote }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Use fixed positioning with @media print to show header and footer containers on every page

Use absolute:positioning instead of fixed positioning to avoid showing header and footer containers on every page

I propose that we either delete this page since it does little other than repeat a part of the contents page, or remove the page list and include it there to make creating single page documents easier. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:53, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== Introduction ==

In the emerging global economy, e-commerce and e-business have increasingly become a necessary component of business strategy and a strong catalyst for economic development. The integration of information and communications technology (ICT) in business has revolutionized relationships within organizations and those between and among organizations and individuals. Specifically, the use of ICT in business has enhanced productivity, encouraged greater customer participation, and enabled mass customization, besides reducing costs.

With developments in the Internet and Web-based technologies, distinctions between traditional markets and the global electronic marketplace-such as business capital size, among others-are gradually being narrowed down. The name of the game is strategic positioning, the ability of a company to determine emerging opportunities and utilize the necessary human capital skills (such as intellectual resources) to make the most of these opportunities through an e-business strategy that is simple, workable and practicable within the context of a global information milieu and new economic environment. With its effect of leveling the playing field, e-commerce coupled with the appropriate strategy and policy approach enables small and medium scale enterprises to compete with large and capital-rich businesses.

On another plane, developing countries are given increased access to the global marketplace, where they compete with and complement the more developed economies. Most, if not all, developing countries are already participating in e-commerce, either as sellers or buyers. However, to facilitate e-commerce growth in these countries, the relatively underdeveloped information infrastructure must be improved. Among the areas for policy intervention are:

* High Internet access costs, including connection service fees, communication fees, and hosting charges for websites with sufficient bandwidth;

* Limited availability of credit cards and a nationwide credit card system;

* Underdeveloped transportation infrastructure resulting in slow and uncertain delivery of goods and services;

* Network security problems and insufficient security safeguards;

* Lack of skilled human resources and key technologies (i.e., inadequate professional IT workforce);

* Content restriction on national security and other public policy grounds, which greatly affect business in the field of information services, such as the media and entertainment sectors;

* Cross-border issues, such as the recognition of transactions under laws of other ASEAN member-countries, certification services, improvement of delivery methods and customs facilitation; and

* The relatively low cost of labor, which implies that a shift to a comparatively capital intensive solution (including investments on the improvement of the physical and network infrastructure) is not apparent.

It is recognized that in the Information Age, Internet commerce is a powerful tool in the economic growth of developing countries. While there are indications of e-commerce patronage among large firms in developing countries, there seems to be little and negligible use of the Internet for commerce among small and medium sized firms. E-commerce promises better business for SMEs and sustainable economic development for developing countries. However, this is premised on strong political will and good governance, as well as on a responsible and supportive private sector within an effective policy framework. This primer seeks to provide policy guidelines toward this end.</text>

== What is e-commerce? ==

Electronic commerce or e-commerce refers to a wide range of online business activities for products and services.{{ecebcite|1}} It also pertains to “any form of business transaction in which the parties interact electronically rather than by physical exchanges or direct physical contact.”{{ecebcite|2}}

E-commerce is usually associated with buying and selling over the Internet, or conducting any transaction involving the transfer of ownership or rights to use goods or services through a computer-mediated network.{{ecebcite|3}} Though popular, this definition is not comprehensive enough to capture recent developments in this new and revolutionary business phenomenon. A more complete definition is: E-commerce is the use of electronic communications and digital information processing technology in business transactions to create, transform, and redefine relationships for value creation between or among organizations, and between organizations and individuals.{{ecebcite|4}}

International Data Corp (IDC) estimates the value of global e-commerce in 2000 at US$350.38 billion. This is projected to climb to as high as US$3.14 trillion by 2004. IDC also predicts an increase in Asia’s percentage share in worldwide e-commerce revenue from 5% in 2000 to 10% in 2004 (See Figure 1).

'''Figure 1: Worldwide E-Commerce Revenue, 2000 and 2004 (as a % share of each country/region)'''

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:eprimer_ecom_figure_1.jpg|500px]]
|}


Asia-Pacific e-commerce revenues are projected to increase from $76.8 billion at year-end of 2001 to $338.5 billion by the end of 2004.

''Is e-commerce the same as e-business?'' &lt;br&gt;

While some use e-commerce and e-business interchangeably, they are distinct concepts. In e-commerce, information and communications technology (ICT) is used in inter-business or inter-organizational transactions (transactions between and among firms/organizations) and in business-to-consumer transactions (transactions between firms/organizations and individuals).

In e-business, on the other hand, ICT is used to enhance one’s business. It includes any process that a business organization (either a for-profit, governmental or non-profit entity) conducts over a computer-mediated network. A more comprehensive definition of e-business is:

:''“The transformation of an organization’s processes to deliver additional customer value through the application of technologies, philosophies and computing paradigm of the new economy.”''

Three primary processes are enhanced in e-business:{{ecebcite|5}}

1. '''Production processes''', which include procurement, ordering and replenishment of stocks; processing of payments; electronic links with suppliers; and production control processes, among others;

2. '''Customer-focused processes''', which include promotional and marketing efforts, selling over the Internet, processing of customers’ purchase orders and payments, and customer support, among others; and

3. '''Internal management processes''', which include employee services, training, internal information-sharing, video-conferencing, and recruiting. Electronic applications enhance information flow between production and sales forces to improve sales force productivity. Workgroup communications and electronic publishing of internal business information are likewise made more efficient.{{ecebcite|6}}

== Is the Internet economy synonymous with e-commerce and e-business? ==

The Internet economy is a broader concept than e-commerce and e-business. It includes e-commerce and e-business.

The CREC (Center for Research in Electronic Commerce) at the University of Texas has developed a conceptual framework for how the Internet economy works. The framework shows four layers of the Internet economy-the three mentioned above and a fourth called intermediaries (see Table 1).

== What are the different types of e-commerce? ==

== The major different types of e-commerce are: business-to-business (B2B); business-to-consumer (B2C); business-to-government (B2G); consumer-to-consumer (C2C); and mobile commerce (m-commerce). ==

''What is B2B e-commerce?''

B2B e-commerce is simply defined as e-commerce between companies. This is the type of e-commerce that deals with relationships between and among businesses. About 80% of e-commerce is of this type, and most experts predict that B2B e-commerce will continue to grow faster than the B2C segment. The B2B market has two primary components: e-frastructure and e-markets. E-frastructure is the architecture of B2B, primarily consisting of the following:

* logistics - transportation, warehousing and distribution (e.g., Procter and Gamble);

* application service providers - deployment, hosting and management of packaged software from a central facility (e.g., Oracle and Linkshare);

* outsourcing of functions in the process of e-commerce, such as Web-hosting, security and customer care solutions (e.g., outsourcing providers such as eShare, NetSales, iXL Enterprises and Universal Access);

* auction solutions software for the operation and maintenance of real-time auctions in the Internet (e.g., Moai Technologies and OpenSite Technologies);

* content management software for the facilitation of Web site content management and delivery (e.g., Interwoven and ProcureNet); and

* Web-based commerce enablers (e.g., Commerce One, a browser-based, XML-enabled purchasing automation software).

E-markets are simply defined as Web sites where buyers and sellers interact with each other and conduct transactions.10

The more common B2B examples and best practice models are IBM, Hewlett Packard (HP), Cisco and Dell. Cisco, for instance, receives over 90% of its product orders over the Internet.

Most B2B applications are in the areas of supplier management (especially purchase order processing), inventory management (i.e., managing order-ship-bill cycles), distribution management (especially in the transmission of shipping documents), channel management (i.e., information dissemination on changes in operational conditions), and payment management (e.g., electronic payment systems or EPS).11

eMarketer projects an increase in the share of B2B e-commerce in total global e-commerce from 79.2% in 2000 to 87% in 2004 and a consequent decrease in the share of B2C e-commerce from 20.8% in 2000 to only 13% in 2004 (Figure 3).

'''Figure 3. Share of B2B and B2C E-Commerce in Total Global E-Commerce (2000 and 2004)'''

Likewise B2B growth is way ahead of B2C growth in the Asia-Pacific region. According to a 2001 eMarketer estimate, B2B revenues in the region are expected to exceed $300 billion by 2004.

Table 2 shows the projected size of B2B e-commerce by region for the years 2000-2004.

:'''Box 1. Benefits of B2B E-Commerce in Developing Markets'''
{{TextBox|The impact of B2B markets on the economy of developing countries is evident in the following:

''Transaction costs''. There are three cost areas that are significantly reduced through the conduct of B2B e-commerce. First is the reduction of search costs, as buyers need not go through multiple intermediaries to search for information about suppliers, products and prices as in a traditional supply chain. In terms of effort, time and money spent, the Internet is a more efficient information channel than its traditional counterpart. In B2B markets, buyers and sellers are gathered together into a single online trading community, reducing search costs even further. Second is the reduction in the costs of processing transactions (e.g. invoices, purchase orders and payment schemes), as B2B allows for the automation of transaction processes and therefore, the quick implementation of the same compared to other channels (such as the telephone and fax). Efficiency in trading processes and transactions is also enhanced through the B2B e-market’s ability to process sales through online auctions. Third, online processing improves inventory management and logistics.

''Disintermediation''. Through B2B e-markets, suppliers are able to interact and transact directly with buyers, thereby eliminating intermediaries and distributors. However, new forms of intermediaries are emerging. For instance, e-markets themselves can be considered as intermediaries because they come between suppliers and customers in the supply chain.

''Transparency in pricing''.Among the more evident benefits of e-markets is the increase in price transparency. The gathering of a large number of buyers and sellers in a single e-market reveals market price information and transaction processing to participants. The Internet allows for the publication of information on a single purchase or transaction, making the information readily accessible and available to all members of the e-market. Increased price transparency has the effect of pulling down price differentials in the market. In this context, buyers are provided much more time to compare prices and make better buying decisions. Moreover, B2B e-markets expand borders for dynamic and negotiated pricing wherein multiple buyers and sellers collectively participate in price-setting and two-way auctions. In such environments, prices can be set through automatic matching of bids and offers. In the e-marketplace, the requirements of both buyers and sellers are thus aggregated to reach competitive prices, which are lower than those resulting from individual actions.

''Economies of scale and network effects''. The rapid growth of B2B e-markets creates traditional supply-side cost-based economies of scale. Furthermore, the bringing together of a significant number of buyers and sellers provides the demand-side economies of scale or network effects. Each additional incremental participant in the e-market creates value for all participants in the demand side. More participants form a critical mass, which is key in attracting more users to an e-market.

''What is B2C e-commerce?''

Business-to-consumer e-commerce, or commerce between companies and consumers, involves customers gathering information; purchasing physical goods (i.e., tangibles such as books or consumer products) or information goods (or goods of electronic material or digitized content, such as software, or e-books); and, for information goods, receiving products over an electronic network.12

It is the second largest and the earliest form of e-commerce. Its origins can be traced to online retailing (or e-tailing).13 Thus, the more common B2C business models are the online retailing companies such as Amazon.com, Drugstore.com, Beyond.com, Barnes and Noble and ToysRus. Other B2C examples involving information goods are E-Trade and Travelocity.

The more common applications of this type of e-commerce are in the areas of purchasing products and information, and personal finance management, which pertains to the management of personal investments and finances with the use of online banking tools (e.g., Quicken).14

eMarketer estimates that worldwide B2C e-commerce revenues will increase from US$59.7 billion in 2000 to US$428.1 billion by 2004. Online retailing transactions make up a significant share of this market. eMarketer also estimates that in the Asia-Pacific region, B2C revenues, while registering a modest figure compared to B2B, nonetheless went up to $8.2 billion by the end of 2001, with that figure doubling at the end of 2002-at total worldwide B2C sales below 10%.

B2C e-commerce reduces transactions costs (particularly search costs) by increasing consumer access to information and allowing consumers to find the most competitive price for a product or service. B2C e-commerce also reduces market entry barriers since the cost of putting up and maintaining a Web site is much cheaper than installing a “brick-and-mortar” structure for a firm. In the case of information goods, B2C e-commerce is even more attractive because it saves firms from factoring in the additional cost of a physical distribution network. Moreover, for countries with a growing and robust Internet population, delivering information goods becomes increasingly feasible.

''What is B2G e-commerce?''

Business-to-government e-commerce or B2G is generally defined as commerce between companies and the public sector. It refers to the use of the Internet for public procurement, licensing procedures, and other government-related operations. This kind of e-commerce has two features: first, the public sector assumes a pilot/leading role in establishing e-commerce; and second, it is assumed that the public sector has the greatest need for making its procurement system more effective.15

Web-based purchasing policies increase the transparency of the procurement process (and reduces the risk of irregularities). To date, however, the size of the B2G e-commerce market as a component of total e-commerce is insignificant, as government e-procurement systems remain undeveloped.

''What is C2C e-commerce?''

Consumer-to-consumer e-commerce or C2C is simply commerce between private individuals or consumers.

This type of e-commerce is characterized by the growth of electronic marketplaces and online auctions, particularly in vertical industries where firms/businesses can bid for what they want from among multiple suppliers.16 It perhaps has the greatest potential for developing new markets.

This type of e-commerce comes in at least three forms:

* auctions facilitated at a portal, such as eBay, which allows online real-time bidding on items being sold in the Web;

* peer-to-peer systems, such as the Napster model (a protocol for sharing files between users used by chat forums similar to IRC) and other file exchange and later money exchange models; and

* classified ads at portal sites such as Excite Classifieds and eWanted , Pakwheels.com (an interactive, online marketplace where buyers and sellers can negotiate and which features “Buyer Leads &amp; Want Ads”).

Consumer-to-business (C2B) transactions involve reverse auctions, which empower the consumer to drive transactions. A concrete example of this when competing airlines gives a traveler best travel and ticket offers in response to the traveler’s post that she wants to fly from New York to San Francisco.

There is little information on the relative size of global C2C e-commerce. However, C2C figures of popular C2C sites such as eBay and Napster indicate that this market is quite large. These sites produce millions of dollars in sales every day.

''Advantages of C2C sites''

Consumer to consumer ecommerce has many benefits. The business model of C2C is very interesting.The primary benefit which consumers get is reduction in cost  as compared to buying space of their adds on other ecommerce sites which seem to be quite expensive.People interested in selling their items can post their respective items for free or with minimal charge depending on the c2c website.This leads to formation of a profitable customer base. C2C websites form a perfect platform for buyers and sellers who wish to buy and sell products of similar interest.This leads to increase in visitor to customer conversion ratio.Another benefit is that business owners can easily afford the low cost of maintaining C2C websites and earn good profits instead of buying or hiring a shop which could cost a lot.Another major plus point these websites have is that personal items like watch ,shoes etc can be purchased and sold with ease which is not in case of other types of ecommerce.

''Disadvantages of C2C sites''

There are a couple of disadvantages to these type of sites as well.Doing transaction on these type of websites requires co-operation between the buyer and seller.It has been noted many times that these two do not co-operate with each other after a transaction has been made.They do not share the transaction information which may be via credit or debit card or internet banking.This can result in online fraud since the buyer and seller are not very well versed with each other.This can lead to lawsuit being imposed on either ends or also on the site if it has not mentioned the disclaimer in it’s terms and conditions.This may also hamper the c2c website's reputation.Companies which handle consumer to consumer [http://www.techved.com/best-company-for-e-commerce-uae-and-dubai ecommerce websites] seem to have becoming very cautious to prevent online scams. 

''What is m-commerce?''

M-commerce (mobile commerce) is the buying and selling of goods and services through wireless technology-i.e., handheld devices such as cellular telephones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Japan is seen as a global leader in m-commerce.

As content delivery over wireless devices becomes faster, more secure, and scalable, some believe that m-commerce will surpass wireline e-commerce as the method of choice for digital commerce transactions. This may well be true for the Asia-Pacific where there are more mobile phone users than there are Internet users.

Industries affected by m-commerce include:

* '''Financial services''', including mobile banking (when customers use their handheld devices to access their accounts and pay their bills), as well as brokerage services (in which stock quotes can be displayed and trading conducted from the same handheld device);

* '''Telecommunications''', in which service changes, bill payment and account reviews can all be conducted from the same handheld device;

* '''Service/retail''', as consumers are given the ability to place and pay for orders on-the-fly; and

* '''Information services''', which include the delivery of entertainment, financial news, sports figures and traffic updates to a single mobile device.17

Forrester Research predicts US$3.4 billion sales closed using PDA and cell phones by 2005 (See Table 3).

== What forces are fueling e-commerce? ==

There are at least three major forces fueling e-commerce: economic forces, marketing and customer interaction forces, and technology, particularly multimedia convergence.18

'''Economic forces'''.One of the most evident benefits of e-commerce is economic efficiency resulting from the reduction in communications costs, low-cost technological infrastructure, speedier and more economic electronic transactions with suppliers, lower global information sharing and advertising costs, and cheaper customer service alternatives.

Economic integration is either external or internal. External integration refers to the electronic networking of corporations, suppliers, customers/clients, and independent contractors into one community communicating in a virtual environment (with the Internet as medium). Internal integration, on the other hand, is the networking of the various departments within a corporation, and of business operations and processes. This allows critical business information to be stored in a digital form that can be retrieved instantly and transmitted electronically. Internal integration is best exemplified by corporate intranets. Among the companies with efficient corporate intranets are Procter and Gamble, IBM, Nestle and Intel.

:'''Box 2. SESAMi.NET.: Linking Asian Markets through B2B Hubs '''
{{TextBox|SESAMi.NET is Asia’s largest B2B e-hub, a virtual exchange integrating and connecting businesses (small, medium or large) to trading partners, e-marketplaces and internal enterprise systems for the purpose of sourcing out supplies, buying and selling goods and services online in real time. The e-hub serves as the center for management of content and the processing of business transactions with support services such as financial clearance and information services.

It is strategically and dynamically linked to the Global Trading Web (GTW), the world’s largest network of trading communities on the Internet. Because of this very important link, SESAMi reaches an extensive network of regional, vertical and industry-specific interoperable B2B e-markets across the globe.
|}}
'''
''' Market forces.''' Corporations are encouraged to use e-commerce in marketing and promotion to capture international markets, both big and small. The Internet is likewise used as a medium for enhanced customer service and support. It is a lot easier for companies to provide their target consumers with more detailed product and service information using the Internet.

:'''Box 3. Brazil’s Submarino19: Improving Customer Service through the Internet'''
{{TextBox|Brazil’s Submarino is a classic example of successful use of the Internet for improved customer service and support. From being a local Sao Paulo B2C e-commerce company selling books, CDs, video cassettes, DVDs, toys, electronic and computer products in Brazil, it expanded to become the largest company of its kind in Argentina, Mexico, Spain and Portugal. Close to a third of the 1.4 million Internet users in Brazil have made purchases through this site. To enhance customer service, Submarino has diversified into offering logistical and technological infrastructure to other retailers, which includes experience and expertise in credit analysis, tracking orders and product comparison systems.
|}}

'''Technology forces'''. The development of ICT is a key factor in the growth of e-commerce. For instance, technological advances in digitizing content, compression and the promotion of open systems technology have paved the way for the convergence of communication services into one single platform. This in turn has made communication more efficient, faster, easier, and more economical as the need to set up separate networks for telephone services, television broadcast, cable television, and Internet access is eliminated. From the standpoint of firms/businesses and consumers, having only one information provider means lower communications costs.20

Moreover, the principle of universal access can be made more achievable with convergence. At present the high costs of installing landlines in sparsely populated rural areas is a disincentive to telecommunications companies to install telephones in these areas. Installing landlines in rural areas can become more attractive to the private sector if revenues from these landlines are not limited to local and long distance telephone charges, but also include cable TV and Internet charges. This development will ensure affordable access to information even by those in rural areas and will spare the government the trouble and cost of installing expensive landlines.21

== What are the components of a typical successful e-commerce transaction loop? ==

E-commerce does not refer merely to a firm putting up a Web site for the purpose of selling goods to buyers over the Internet. For e-commerce to be a competitive alternative to traditional commercial transactions and for a firm to maximize the benefits of e-commerce, a number of technical as well as enabling issues have to be considered. A typical e-commerce transaction loop involves the following major players and corresponding requisites:

The ''Seller'' should have the following components: 

* A corporate Web site with e-commerce capabilities (e.g., a secure transaction server);
* A corporate intranet so that orders are processed in an efficient manner; and
* IT-literate employees to manage the information flows and maintain the e-commerce system.

''Transaction partners'' include:

* Banking institutions that offer transaction clearing services (e.g., processing credit card payments and electronic fund transfers);
* National and international freight companies to enable the movement of physical goods within, around and out of the country. For business-to-consumer transactions, the system must offer a means for cost-efficient transport of small packages (such that purchasing books over the Internet, for example, is not prohibitively more expensive than buying from a local store); and
* Authentication authority that serves as a trusted third party to ensure the integrity and security of transactions.

''Consumers'' (in a business-to-consumer transaction) who:

* Form a critical mass of the population with access to the Internet and disposable income enabling widespread use of credit cards; and
* Possess a mindset for purchasing goods over the Internet rather than by physically inspecting items.

''Firms/Businesses'' (in a business-to-business transaction) that together form a critical mass of companies (especially within supply chains) with Internet access and the capability to place and take orders over the Internet. 

''Government'', to establish:

* A legal framework governing e-commerce transactions (including electronic documents, signatures, and the like); and
* Legal institutions that would enforce the legal framework (i.e., laws and regulations) and protect consumers and businesses from fraud, among others.

And finally, ''the Internet'', the successful use of which depends on the following: 

* A robust and reliable Internet infrastructure; and
* A pricing structure that doesn’t penalize consumers for spending time on and buying goods over the Internet (e.g., a flat monthly charge for both ISP access and local phone calls).

For e-commerce to grow, the above requisites and factors have to be in place. The least developed factor is an impediment to the increased uptake of e-commerce as a whole. For instance, a country with an excellent Internet infrastructure will not have high e-commerce figures if banks do not offer support and fulfillment services to e-commerce transactions. In countries that have significant e-commerce figures, a positive feedback loop reinforces each of these factors.22

== How is the Internet relevant to e-commerce? ==

The Internet allows people from all over the world to get connected inexpensively and reliably. As a technical infrastructure, it is a global collection of networks, connected to share information using a common set of protocols. Also, as a vast network of people and information, the Internet is an enabler for e-commerce as it allows businesses to showcase and sell their products and services online and gives potential customers, prospects, and business partners access to information about these businesses and their products and services that would lead to purchase.

Before the Internet was utilized for commercial purposes, companies used private networks-such as the EDI or Electronic Data Interchange-to transact business with each other. That was the early form of e-commerce. However, installing and maintaining private networks was very expensive. With the Internet, e-commerce spread rapidly because of the lower costs involved and because the Internet is based on open standards.25

== How important is an intranet for a business engaging in e-commerce? ==

An intranet aids in the management of internal corporate information that may be interconnected with a company’s e-commerce transactions (or transactions conducted outside the intranet). Inasmuch as the intranet allows for the instantaneous flow of internal information, vital information is simultaneously processed and matched with data flowing from external e-commerce transactions, allowing for the efficient and effective integration of the corporation’s organizational processes. In this context, corporate functions, decisions and processes involving e-commerce activities are more coherent and organized.

The proliferation of intranets has caused a shift from a hierarchical command-and-control organization to an information-based organization. This shift has implications for managerial responsibilities, communication and information flows, and workgroup structures.

== Aside from reducing the cost of doing business, what are the advantages of e-commerce for businesses? ==

'''E-commerce serves as an “equalizer”'''. It enables start-up and small- and medium-sized enterprises to reach the global market.

{{TextBox|Amazon.com is a virtual bookstore. It does not have a single square foot of bricks and mortar retail floor space. Nonetheless, Amazon.com is posting an annual sales rate of approximately $1.2 billion, equal to about 235 Barnes &amp; Noble (B&amp;N) superstores. Due to the efficiencies of selling over the Web, Amazon has spent only $56 million on fixed assets, while B&amp;N has spent about $118 million for 235 superstores. (To be fair, Amazon has yet to turn a profit, but this does not obviate the point that in many industries doing business through e-commerce is cheaper than conducting business in a traditional brick-and-mortar company.)

However, this does not discount the point that without a good e-business strategy, e-commerce may in some cases discriminate against SMEs because it reveals proprietary pricing information. A sound e-business plan does not totally disregard old economy values. The dot-com bust is proof of this.

:'''Box 5. Lessons from the Dot Com Frenzy'''
{{TextBox|According to Webmergers.com statistics, about 862 dot-com companies have failed since the height of the dot-com bust in January 2000. Majority of these were e-commerce and content companies. The shutdown of these companies was followed by the folding up of Internet-content providers, infrastructure companies, Internet service providers, and other providers of dial-up and broadband Internet-access services.26

From the perspective of the investment banks, the dot-com frenzy can be likened to a gamble where the big money players were the venture capitalists and those laying their bets on the table were the small investors. The bust was primarily caused by the players’ unfamiliarity with the sector, coupled with failure to cope with the speed of the Internet revolution and the amount of capital in circulation.27

Internet entrepreneurs set the prices of their goods and services at very low levels to gain market share and attract venture capitalists to infuse funding. The crash began when investors started demanding hard earnings for sky-high valuations. The Internet companies also spent too much on overhead before even gaining a market share.28

'''E-commerce makes “mass customization” possible'''. E-commerce applications in this area include easy-to-use ordering systems that allow customers to choose and order products according to their personal and unique specifications. For instance, a car manufacturing company with an e-commerce strategy allowing for online orders can have new cars built within a few days (instead of the several weeks it currently takes to build a new vehicle) based on customer’s specifications. This can work more effectively if a company’s manufacturing process is advanced and integrated into the ordering system.

'''E-commerce allows “network production.'''” This refers to the parceling out of the production process to contractors who are geographically dispersed but who are connected to each other via computer networks. The benefits of network production include: reduction in costs, more strategic target marketing, and the facilitation of selling add-on products, services, and new systems when they are needed. With network production, a company can assign tasks within its non-core competencies to factories all over the world that specialize in such tasks (e.g., the assembly of specific components).

== How is e-commerce helpful to the consumer? ==
In C2B transactions, customers/consumers are given more influence over what and how products are made and how services are delivered, thereby broadening consumer choices. E-commerce allows for a faster and more open process, with customers having greater control.

E-commerce makes information on products and the market as a whole readily available and accessible, and increases price transparency, which enable customers to make more appropriate purchasing decisions.

== How are business relationships transformed through e-commerce? ==
E-commerce transforms old economy relationships (vertical/linear relationships) to new economy relationships characterized by end-to-end relationship management solutions (integrated or extended relationships).

== How does e-commerce link customers, workers, suppliers, distributors and competitors? ==
E-commerce facilitates organization networks, wherein small firms depend on “partner” firms for supplies and product distribution to address customer demands more effectively.

To manage the chain of networks linking customers, workers, suppliers, distributors, and even competitors, an integrated or extended supply chain management solution is needed. ''Supply chain management'' (SCM) is defined as the supervision of materials, information, and finances as they move from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to consumer. It involves the coordination and integration of these flows both within and among companies. The goal of any effective supply chain management system is timely provision of goods or services to the next link in the chain (and ultimately, the reduction of inventory within each link).29

There are three main flows in SCM, namely:

* The product flow, which includes the movement of goods from a supplier to a customer, as well as any customer returns or service needs;

* The information flow, which involves the transmission of orders and the update of the status of delivery; and

* The finances flow, which consists of credit terms, payment schedules, and consignment and title ownership arrangements.

Some SCM applications are based on open data models that support the sharing of data both inside and outside the enterprise, called the extended enterprise, and includes key suppliers, manufacturers, and end customers of a specific company. Shared data resides in diverse database systems, or data warehouses, at several different sites and companies. Sharing this data “upstream” (with a company’s suppliers) and “downstream” (with a company’s clients) allows SCM applications to improve the time-to-market of products and reduce costs. It also allows all parties in the supply chain to better manage current resources and plan for future needs.30

== What is Google AdSense and how does it work for e-commerce ==

Google AdSense is a service offered by Google that allows website publishers to advertise on Google. It is Google's number 1 source of revenue. AdSense is used to advertise when users type in key words in Google's search engine. Ads are placed on the right hand side of the screen. The ads are text based and allow for links to the website on the advertisement as well.

The AdWords program determines the pricing for key words. AdWords is based on a Vickrey auction system. It is a sealed-bid auction, users submit bids not knowing what other users bid. The highest bidder wins but the second place person's bid is paid. There are pros and cons to this type of auction. The winners the vast majority of the time are the ones who bid the highest. A downside to this type of system is that there is no price discovery, which is a market failure known as imperfect information. 

AdSense users generate revenue by having users click on their links and by having them buy what is offered on their website. AdSense has been a huge success for Google and the users of the system.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About this Unit==
From the [http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gceapplied/science.html AQA Specification]:

&lt;blockquote style='border: 1px solid blue; padding: 2em;'&gt;
In this unit you will learn about:
*how to take and prepare samples for analysis;
*the use of standard procedures to ensure that the results of analysis can be replicated;
*how to conduct qualitative analysis and a volumetric (quantitative) analysis;
*how a chromatographic analysis and colorimetric analysis are conducted;
*how to calculate a molar enthalpy change from experimentation and that energy changes take place during chemical reactions.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==How you will be assessed==

This unit is assessed through the work you complete for your portfolio.

The marking criteria are found in the AQA specification.

==Scenario 1: Richmond Mine Water==

&quot;The Richmond Mine of the Iron Mountain copper deposit contains some of the most acid mine waters ever reported. Values of pH have been measured as low as −3.6, combined metal concentrations as high as 200 g/liter, and sulfate concentrations as high as 760 g/liter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=34288|author=Nordstrom, DK and Alpers, CN|year=1999|title=Negative pH, efflorescent mineralogy, and consequences for environmental restoration at the Iron Mountain Superfund site, California.|publisher=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.|issue=96(7)|pages=3455–3462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Uses of qualitative analysis */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic question addressed by qualitative analysis is: Is there any X in the sample?

In contrast, ''quantitative'' analysis answers the question: How much X is there in the sample?

In practice, qualitative analysis records if the amount of X is above a certain threshold value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Uses of titration=
See also: [[w:Titration]]

Titration can produce one of two pieces of information:

#When both reagents are known, their reaction is known but only one concentration is known; titration can calculate the unknown concentration.
#When both reagents and their concentrations are known, but the reaction is unknown; titration can calculate the unknown reaction.

=Sample preparation=

Samples for titration must contain a known chemical so that a standard chemical can be chosen which will react with it.

The sample must not contain any impurities which would interfere with the main reaction.

Samples need to be in the form of solutions. To assay gases and solids the substances may be dissolved in a suitable solvent (e.g. water).

In some cases the sample is made to react with a solution and then the remaining reactant is titrated. This is known as a '''back reaction'''.

Example: 1.00 g of impure calcium carbonate reacted with 100 cm³ of 0.4 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; hydrochloric acid. The acid concentration was found by titration to be 0.21 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies that only 0.0095 mol of carbonate reacted. This amount of carbonate would have a mass of 0.95 g so we can say that the calcium carbonate has 5 % impurities.

=Standard procedures and equipment=

==Standard Solution==

A standard solution is a solution of known concentration. Units of concentration are moles per cubic decimetre i.e. mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Primary Standard''' - This is a chemical which can be obtained in a pure state. It is the basis upon which the concentration of other solutions can be measured and it must possess the following properties:
*it should not effloresce nor be deliquescent or hygroscopic
*it must remain stable in solution for a sufficient length of time
*it must possess a fairly large molar mass to reduce errors in weighing

Passing the mine water sample through an ion exchange resin can replace the metal ions with sodium ions. This process converts all the sulphate salts to sodium sulphate. The acid concentration is in the range 0.6-0.7 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, but we need to measure it exactly by titration.

Experiment 1: Preparing the primary standard (sodium carbonate 0.5 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;)
#Place a weighing bottle on the balance and tare to obtain a zero reading. Weigh approximately 5.3g the sodium carbonate.
#Remove the weighing bottle from the balance, zero the balance, and weigh the full bottle.
#Tip the contents of the bottle into a clean beaker (100 cm³)- it doesn't have to be dry.
#Weigh the emptied bottle.
#Add deionised water to the beaker (about 50cm³) and stir to dissolve the sodium carbonate. Leave the glass rod in the solution at all times - you will lose some to the bench if you put it down.
#Now transfer the solution via a funnel into a volumetric flask (100 cm³) and wash all remaining drops of solution into the flask with a wash bottle. Wash also the rod and funnel into the flask.
#Remove the funnel and make up the solution to the graduation mark i.e. until the bottom of the meniscus is just in line with the graduation mark on the neck of the flask - use a dropping pipette for this. Stopper the flask and mix the solution by inverting the flask at least 10 times (shaking is no good).
#Carefully top up the solution to 100 cm³ again if necessary.
#Label the flask immediately with your name, name of solution and its concentration.

==Weighing Results==

*Mass of bottle with sample: ________ g
*Mass of bottle empty:  ________ g
*Mass of sample: ________ g
*Concentration of solution _________ g dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;
*M&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of sodium carbonate: _________
*Molar concentration of solution: _________ mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;

==Titration==
Using standard solution of sodium carbonate (0.5 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) titrate this against the mine water in order to determine its acid content. 

#Use the pipette to measure 25 cm³ aliquots of your mine water into 4 conical flasks.
#Add a few drops of methyl red or screened methyl orange indicator.
#Fill the burette with the sodium carbonate (0.5 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;)
#Titrate to obtain concordant results.
#Record the results in the table below

=Interpretation, calculation and evaluation of results=

==Exercise based on minewater scenario==

The mine water sample can be purified by a cation-exchange resin so that it contains only sulphuric acid and sodium sulphate, which does not interfere with acid-base titrations.

The acid concentration is very high, so before titration it is diluted by pipetting 25 cm3 into a volumetric flask and making the solution up to 250 cm3.

The following data were obtained by six students:

A. 2.240 g of sodium carbonate decahydrate were dissolved to make 250 cm3 of solution. When this solution was titrated against 25 cm3 of mine water residue, 49.50 cm3 were required to neutralise the acid. What is the acid concentration?

B. 2.426 g of sodium carbonate decahydrate were dissolved to make 250 cm3 of solution. When this solution was titrated against 25 cm3 of mine water residue, 44.85 cm3 were required to neutralise the acid. What is the acid concentration?

C. 3.205 g of sodium carbonate decahydrate were dissolved to make 250 cm3 of solution. When this solution was titrated against 25 cm3 of mine water residue, 34.60 cm3 were required to neutralise the acid. What is the acid concentration?

D. 4.730 g of sodium carbonate decahydrate were dissolved to make 250 cm3 of solution. When this solution was titrated against 25 cm3 of mine water residue, 24.25 cm3 were required to neutralise the acid. What is the acid concentration?

E. 4.95 g of sodium carbonate decahydrate were dissolved to make 250 cm3 of solution. When this solution was titrated against 25 cm3 of mine water residue, 32.70 cm3 were required to neutralise the acid. What is the acid concentration?

F. 5.700 g of sodium carbonate decahydrate were dissolved to make 250 cm3 of solution. When this solution was titrated against 25 cm3 of mine water residue, 19.15 cm3 were required to neutralise the acid. What is the acid concentration?

Plot a graph of the mass of carbonate in 250 cm3 against the volume of carbonate used in the titration.

From the graph, identify which, if any, results is/are unreliable.

From the graph, estimate the average mass of carbonate and the average volume of carbonate required.

From your estimates, calculate the concentration of sulphuric acid.

Find out what percentage errors are associated with the apparatus used in the experiment.

Apparatus:
*Burette error: 0.1 cm3
*Pipette error: 0.06 cm3 out of 25 cm3.
*Volumetric flask: 0.3 cm3 out of 250 cm3.
*Top-pan balance error: 0.001 g

What is the percentage variation in the students’ estimates of the acid concentration?

Estimate the total error for this experiment.

=Experimental work for Scenario 1=

'''Analysis of the acid content of the mine water sample.'''

Passing the mine water sample through an ion exchange resin can replace the metal ions with sodium ions. This process converts all the sulphate salts to sodium sulphate. The acid concentration is in the range 0.6 - 0.7 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, but we need to measure it exactly by titration.

==Experiment 1: Preparing the primary standard==

(sodium carbonate 0.064mol dm-3)

Notes: 

Standard Solution - This is a solution of known concentration. Units of concentration are moles per cubic decimetre i.e. mol dm-3

Primary Standard - This is a chemical which can be obtained in a pure state. It is the basis upon which the concentration of other solutions can be measured and it must possess the following properties

*it should not effloresce nor be deliquescent or hygroscopic
*it must remain stable in solution for a sufficient length of time
*it must possess a fairly large molar mass to reduce errors in weighing

===Method For Preparing A Standard Solution===
1. Place a weighing bottle on the balance and tare to obtain a zero reading. Weigh approximately 4.55 g of the sodium carbonate.

2. Remove the weighing bottle from the balance, zero the balance, and weigh the full bottle.

3. Tip the contents of the bottle into a clean beaker (100 cm3)- it doesn't have to be dry.

4. Weigh the emptied bottle.

5. Add deionised water to the beaker (about 50cm3) and stir to dissolve the sodium carbonate. Leave the glass rod in the solution at all times - you will lose some to the bench if you put it down.

6. Now transfer the solution via a funnel into a volumetric flask (250 cm3) and wash all remaining drops of solution into the flask with a wash bottle. Wash also the rod and funnel into the flask.

7. Remove the funnel and make up the solution to the graduation mark i.e. until the bottom of the meniscus is just in line with the graduation mark on the neck of the flask - use a dropping pipette for this. Stopper the flask and mix the solution by inverting the flask at least 10 times (shaking is no good).

8. Carefully top up the solution to 250 cm3 again if necessary.

9. Label the flask immediately with your name, name of solution and its concentration.

Weighing Results
*Mass of bottle with sample ________ g
*Mass of bottle empty  ________ g
*Mass of sample ________ g
*Concentration of solution _________ g per 100 cm3
* _________ g dm-3
*Mr of sodium carbonate _________
*Molar concentration of solution _________ mol dm-3

==Titration==

Using standard solution of sodium carbonate (approx 0.064 mol dm-3) titrate this against the mine water in order to determine its acid content. 

===Procedure===
'''Dilution'''

1. Use the pipette to measure a 25cm3 sample of your mine water into a clean 250 cm3 volumetric flask.

2. Add water to make the solution up to 250 cm3

'''Titration'''

*Solution in burette: (give concentration) 
*Solution in pipette: 
*Volume of pipette: 
*Indicator: 
*Colour change: 
*Other details:
 
3. Use the pipette to measure 25cm3 samples of your diluted mine water into 4 conical flasks.

4. Add a few drops of methyl red or screened methyl orange indicator.

5. Fill the burette with the sodium carbonate (0.064 mol dm-3)

6. Titrate to obtain concordant results.

7. Record the results in the table below

===Calculations===
The acid contaminating the water is sulphuric acid.

In your report of this practical:

1. Write the balanced equation for the reaction of sodium carbonate with hydrochloric acid.

2. Calculate the concentration of the acid from the mean titre.

Mean titre  =                    cm3 
    
Percentage error: (show calculation)

Your report should include:
*A description of the sample and its preparation for the titration (ion-exchange resin, dilution).
*An account of the methods you used to estimate the acid concentration
*Calculation of the concentration of acid and an evaluation of the method and results.

=Errors=

The equipment we use in titration has the following tolerances:
*Burette 0.1 cm3
*25 cm3 pipette 0.06 cm3
*250 cm3 volumetric flask 0.3 cm3
*3 decimal place balances: 0.001 g

Each item of equipment will introduce a random error to the result. The only way to reduce this error is to repeat the experiment or use more accurate equipment – and we do not have the time or the money.

To calculate the total error we can add the errors from each item of equipment. First the errors must be written as percentages:

23.2 cm3 reading on burette – error is 0.1 cm3, which is _________ %

25 cm3 pipette with a tolerance of 0.06 cm3; __________ %

1.372 g reading on balance with accuracy of ± 0.001 g; _________ %

250 cm3 volumetric flask used to make up solution; __________ %

So, the answer to question (3) has a total error of ___________ %

Errors in the way you perform the experiment are less easy to spot, but if you take several titration readings, you can estimate the random error you have caused by the way you titrate:

The simplest way of considering the uncertainty in the final results is to look at the deviation of the titrations from the average value, so that, for example, a deviation of 0.15 cm3 in 25.15 cm3 leads to an uncertainty of 0.6%. 

Readings used to calculate mean titre:

25.0	25.1	25.2	25.3

Precision is best given as the ‘spread’ of possible values e.g. 25.15 ± 0.15 or 25.15 ± 0.6 %. The ‘spread’ is usually the ‘standard deviation’, which can be estimated from the range: Divide the range by a conversion factor from the following table:

{|
|Sample Size
|Conversion factor
|-
|2
|1.5
|-
|3-6
|2.5
|-
|7-12
|3
|-
|13-30
|4
|-
|31-150
|5
|-
|151-500
|6
|501+
|6.5
|}

[http://www.uop.edu/cop/psychology/Statistics/range_method.html]

So, for our four values:
25.0	25.1	25.2	25.3

The range is 0.3, so the standard deviation is 0.3/2.5 = 0.12 cm3 or 0.48 %

Result: 25.15 ± 0.12 cm3 or 25.15 cm3 ± 0.48 %

What is the standard deviation for these values:

23.1	23.3

What is the standard deviation for these values:

23.1	23.3	23.2	23.1	23.3	23.2	23.1	23.3	23.2

Notice how, with more readings, the standard deviation decreases.
Notice also that the error calculated in this way can be added to the equipment errors to estimate the total error.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Important note=

The experimental details given here are given in good faith and are believed to be safe and workable methods. However, '''the authors cannot take responsibility for the consequences of performing these experiments.''' 

The experiments are written for experienced science teaching staff to use as instructions for a supervised class of students. The experiments are not designed for students or inexperienced members of the public to perform without supervision. If you wish to attempt the experiments, ensure that you have completed a legally adequate risk assessment beforehand and that you work within the constraints of the risk assessment.

=Uses of chromatography=

Chromatography separates a mixture of solutes in a solution. The solvent may be water, but it is often a buffer solution, a mixture of organic solvents, or even a gas.

Separation can be used to identify the components of the mixture, or it can be used to isolate pure chemicals.

=Sample preparation=

Sample preparation varies widely from one type of chromatography to the next, but all types of chromatography require the sample to have a small volume and therefore a high concentration. This is because the separation is done by allowing the solutes to move apart. If they are in a small volume to begin with, it does not take much movement to separate the mixture.

In paper and thin-layer chromatography, the sample is often applied many times to the same spot, and the solvent is allowed to evaporate between applications. This concentrates the sample at that point.

In gas and column chromatography it is usually necessary to concentrate the sample as much as possible before application. Some chromatography columns will adsorb the solutes strongly at the top of the column if the sample solvent is chosen carefully. This process concentrates the sample at the top of the column before a second solvent is used to move the solutes through the column to achieve separation.

The [[A-level_Applied_Science/Finding_out_about_Substances#Scenario_1:_Richmond_Mine_Water|mine water sample]] consists of a number of metal ions in the form of their sulphate salts. To separate them, we can use paper chromatography.

===Solvent===
Diethyl ether: Methanol: Water: conc HCl (50: 30: 15: 4 by volume). To minimise esterification, mix the reagents in the order water, acid, ether, alcohol. Measure water and acid using burettes or pipettes.

===Method===

Place 50 cm³ solvent in the bottom of the tank.

The solvent is very volatile and will saturate the air in the tank (‘equilibration’). Improved separation is obtained if the solvent is allowed to equilibrate with the tank atmosphere for one hour.

Spot the solutions along the starting line of the chromatography paper. Each solution should be spotted twice so that the chromatogram can be cut into two halves afterwards.

Spot two samples for the minewater, one with a single addition of solution and one with multiple additions. For the standards, use multiple additions to create 5 mm spots.

Form the paper into a cylinder. Place the cylinder, spotted end down, into the tank. Make sure the paper does not touch the sides of the tank.

Close the lid of the tank.

Prepare the locating reagents.

After three hours, remove the chromatogram from the tank. Open out the paper. Mark the solvent front with a pencil. Leave to dry.

Cut the chromatogram into two and treat the two halves as follows. Spray both sides of the paper. Take great care to avoid excessive spraying. An assistant will use the spray in a fume cupboard:

1) Spray with potassium thiocyanate in acetone. (50 cm³ saturated KCNS in water [200 g in 100 cm³ water], 50 cm³ propanone).

2) Spray with oxine (8-hydroxyquinoline – 0.5 g in 80:20 ethanol:water). Hold over '880' ammonia fumes. Place under UV light to observe fluorescence.

=The underlying scientific principles behind chromatography=

'''Chromatography''' involves the physical separation of a mixture of compounds.  Chromatography can be used as a purification method but also sees wide use for the identification of compounds based on their chromatographic behavior.

==Theory==

There are many variations of chromatography, but all involve the dissolution of an analyte into a fluid known as the '''mobile phase''' and the passage of this fluid solution across a '''stationary phase''', often a solid or liquid-coated solid.

As the mobile phase comes into contact with the stationary phase, some of the analyte molecules dissolve or adsorb onto the mobile phase.  The more the molecules of that substance are retained, the slower their progress through the chromatographic apparatus.  Different substances will then move through at different rates, ideally resulting in distinctly identifiable '''retention times''' for each substance.

Alternatively, if the solutes are retained on the chromatogram instead of eluted from its far end, one can calculate the ratio of the distance traveled by the solute compared to the distance traveled by the solvent. The is the '''R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''' value.

Commonly used chromatographic techniques are identified through the nature of the stationary and mobile phases used, the method for passing the mobile phase through the apparatus, and how separated components are identified.

&lt;center&gt;

|}

''As the chromatogram develops (l-r) the two components of the mixture separate.''

&lt;/center&gt;

==Paper chromatography==

In '''paper chromatography''' the stationary phase is paper and the mobile phase is generally some liquid that will dissolve the analyte and wet the paper, often water or an aqueous solution.

==Thin layer chromatography==

In '''thin layer chromatography''' (TLC) a plastic or glass plate is coated with the stationary phase, often alumina, silica, or alkylated silica.  The analyte is dissolved in a quick-drying solvent and spotted near the bottom of the plate.  The edge of the plate beneath the spot or spots is then dipped and left in a solution of the mobile phase, either an organic solvent or aqueous solution (depending on the nature of the analyte and stationary phase).  Capillary action is then allowed to draw the '''solvent front''' through the spotted analyte, carrying with it and in the process separating out the analyte's components.

==Gas chromatography==

In '''gas chromatography''' (GC) the analyte and mobile phase must both be gases or be readily introduced into the gas phase by heating. The mobile phase gas must be inert and not reacting with the sample to be analysed. Examples of inert gases are helium and nitrogen gas.

The gases are passed through a long, narrow (and most often, coiled) tube either packed with a porous stationary phase or whose inner walls are coated with a stationary phase, and the analyte components are detected as they emerge from the far end of the tube. The tube is commonly known as GC column.

Often a time-varying temperature gradient, from lower temperature to higher temperature, is applied to the tube.  This first allows the analyte components to partition into the stationary phase and then, as the temperature rises, to differentially force them back into the mobile phase.

Common detectors for gas chromatography are flame ionization detector (FID), electron capture detector (ECD) and mass spectrometry (MS). Different types of sample analysis would require the use of a different type of detectors.

[[Image:SchemaGC.png]]

==Column chromatography==

Column chromatography, like gas chromatography, uses a tube packed with a stationary phase, but the mobile phase is a liquid instead of a gas (It is sometimes known as '''liquid chromatography'' or LC). Instead of temperature gradients, a gradient in the composition of the liquid phase can be used to separate components.

Column chromatography can be performed on larger molecules which may not be readily introduced into the gas phase.  On the other hand, because of the increased viscosity of liquids compared with gases, liquid chromatography can be a more ponderous process.  '''HPLC''' (variously '''high-pressure liquid chromatography''' or '''high-performance liquid chromatography''') speeds the process and improves its selectivity and sensitivity to a significant degree by forcing the mobile phase through the chromatographic column with high-pressure pumps.

[[Image:Chromatography column.PNG]]

==Detection methods==

The first root of the word '''chromatography''', ''chroma'', indicates that the separated components in some forms of the technique can be identified by their colour alone.  But chromatography has now long been performed on colourless compounds that can be identified in other ways.

Analyte components on thin-layer chromatography plates are often identified under ultraviolet light, or by chemical staining in, for example, an iodine chamber or potassium permanganate.  Gas chromatographic analytes are detected by changes in the ionisation levels of a flame at the output end of the column or by changes in the electrical conductivity of the gas mixture at the end of the column.  Liquid chromatography fractions are often analysed through spectrophotometric techniques, notably UV-visible spectroscopy. When separation with GC or LC is performed in tandem with mass spectrometry (the &quot;hypenated&quot; techniques of GC-MS and LC-MS), masses of individual fractions is rapidly determined. These methods are frequently employed in analytical and forensic science.

Colorimetry is used in chemistry and in other sorts of places such as in industries like colour printing, textile manufacturing, paint manufacturing and in food industries. Colorimetry is also used in asprin. 

Colorimetery can detect the smallest colour diffrence that the human eye can not pick up.
Under the action of chemical agents, samples develop a specific colour that shows the concentration of the substance being tested. 

Colorimetry is just one of the types of photometric analysis techniques i.e. it is a way of measuring light. 

Below are most possible colorimetric tests:

Colorimetry measurements are made by using a light which passes through a colour filter. The light then passes through a little box (cuvette) with the actual chemical substance. The light leaving the actual sample should be less that the light with actually entered the compound. The loss of light always reflects the concentration of the compound. 

Colorimetry can only be done to measurements which are within the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is 380 – 780 nm. The main general factors which affect the amount of light absorbed by the sample are the wavelength of the light and the colour of the solution. 

When manufactures are using a colorimeter, they have a choice of which wavelength they use. The options are 

Gelatin filters
Interference filters
Grating Monochromators
Prisms

==Colorimetric Measurement of Iron Concentrations==

By making several solutions of iron (III) sulphate with known concentrations, the absorbance of each can be determined and a calibration curve can be constructed. Given a solution of unknown concentration, its concentration can be determined from its absorbance.

You will be given iron (III) sulphate solution of known concentration.

===Apparatus===
*Volumetric flasks, 100cm³
*Burettes, 50 cm³
*Colorimeter
* Pippette 
* Pippette filler

===Reagents===
*Iron (III) sulphate (0.100 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;)	 

===Precautions===
Wear eye protection, protective gloves and laboratory coat at all times.

==Procedure==
#Use the colorimeter to measure the absorbance of the mine water sample and the standard solutions across a range of wavelengths. Choose a suitable wavelength for the rest of the experiments.
#As a group, decide on how you will need to dilute the standard solutions. You will need to make a series of dilutions which will have absorbances similar to the mine water sample.
#Use a colorimeter to determine the absorbance, at the appropriate wavelength of every diluted standard solution made.

==Results==

Plot a graph of absorbance against wavelength for the unknown sample and the standard solutions.

Explain your choice of wavelength.

Plot a graph of absorbance against concentration for the diluted standard solutions.

Calculate the concentration of the unknown solution.

Comment on the shape of the graph: According to the Beer Lambert Law it should be a straight line passing through the origin (i.e. directly proportional).

=Scientific principles behind colorimetry=

Colorimetry is the science that describes colours in numbers. It is used in chemistry, and in industries such as colour printing, textile manufacturing, and paint manufacturing.

A colorimeter measures the intensity of light shining through a coloured solution compared to the intensity of light passing into the solution. A detector measures the transmittance (T) (% of light passing through) of the solution. This is mathematically converted to absorbance (A = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;T). The absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration (Beer-Lambert law).

=Carrying out the reaction following standard procedure=
=Taking appropriate measurements=
=Calculating the molar enthalpy change=

A simple method to calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction is to measure the temperature change caused by the reaction. The '''temperature decrease''', '''ΔT''' depends on:

*'''ΔH''', the '''enthalpy''' of the reaction.
*'''m''', the '''mass''' of the sample which changes temperature.
*'''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''', the '''heat capacity''' of the substance which changes temperature.

The heat capacity measures how much energy is required to change the temperature of 1 g of the substance by 1 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.

&lt;center&gt;
ΔH = m c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ΔT
&lt;/center&gt;

This will give the energy released during the reaction i.e. kJ. To calculate the ''molar'' enthalpy change, kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, we have to divide by the number of moles used in the reaction.

=Bond breaking and bond formation=

Consider the enthalpy change which accompanies the reaction occurring when a particular bond is broken in a molecule: e.g. in the methane molecule there are four carbon - hydrogen bonds and each could be broken in turn. The energy required at each stage is different since the C-H bond is in a different molecular species i.e. a different atomic environment.

:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + H(g) 	ΔH = 435 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + H(g) 	ΔH = 444 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → CH(g) + H(g)	ΔH = 440 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
:CH(g) → C(g) + H(g) 	ΔH = 343 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

Since '''bond enthalpy is defined as the enthalpy required to break a bond''', all values will be positive.

Now the C-H bond enthalpy will be slightly different in particular molecules e.g. methane, ethane, benzene, ethanol etc. However these differences are not significantly large and we are able to use bond energy terms to make useful predictions.

The average bond enthalpy is the average of the bond enthalpies as measured for the particular bond in a wide variety of “representative” molecules. It is also known as the bond energy term. (See table below).

To estimate the reaction enthalpy from bond enthalpies:
i)	Add the energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants. This is an endothermic process.
ii)	Subtract the energy released when the bonds of the products form. Bond formation is exothermic.
&lt;center&gt;
e.g. 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)
&lt;/center&gt;
*2 H-H bonds and one O=O are broken:
*2 x 436 + 496 = + 1368 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
*4 O-H bonds are formed:
*4 x –463 = -1858 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

Summing the two processes: 1368-1858 = -490 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

This is a good estimate of the enthalpy of formation of two moles of water. The experimental enthalpy of formation of water is –285.9 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; i.e. -571.8 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for two moles of water.
*Estimate the enthalpy of formation of hydrogen peroxide. The O-O bond energy is 146 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The bond enthalpies for the formation of HI are as follows:

:H-H	436 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
:I-I	151 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
:H-I	299 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 HI
&lt;/center&gt;

*Bonds broken: 436 + 151 = 587 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

*Bonds formed: -2 x 299 = 598 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
	
*The overall reaction has an enthalpy change of –11  kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, according to this calculation. This compares well with the experimental value of +26.5  kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (value has to be multiplied by 2 because 2 moles HI are formed in the reaction). In the experimental value the sublimation energy is also included:  I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) -&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(v) -63 kJmol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Taken this into account will show only minor differences between the calculation and the experimental values. But errors of a few tens of  kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; are expected because the bond enthalpies are average values.
A bond consists of two molecules e.g. carbon or hydrogen and the overall reaction has an enthalpy change of 11.

==Examples==
1.	(i) Using the average bond enthalpy values, calculate a value for the enthalpy change of the following reaction.	[5]
&lt;center&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH + HBr → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
&lt;/center&gt;
(ii) The value for this reaction was experimentally determined. It was found to be significantly different from the value you have calculated in (i). By significantly different we mean that the difference is greater than the experimental errors (precision / tolerance). Suggest two different possible reasons for this. 	[2]
(iii) Which would you say is the correct value – that calculated in (i) or that given in (ii)?	[1]
2.	For the combustion of propane, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;:
(i)	Describe the changes in bonding that take place during this reaction.	[4]
(ii)	Write a balanced equation for this reaction and calculate the enthalpy change using the bond enthalpies below.	[6]

=Uses of combustion reactions=

Combustion reactions have been used as a source of heat and light throughout human history. Fire has also been used in warfare, to clear forested areas, in metallurgy and as a source of smoke. Since the Industrial Revolution, combustion reactions have also been used to power machinery and vehicles. Electricity is generated by combustion of fuels such as gas, oil and coal. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire#Controlling_fire]

In the blast furnace reaction, combustion creates carbon monoxide as well as heat. CO is the reducing agent which converts iron ore to iron. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace]

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:36, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Wikibooks gazette home]] | [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks gazette|Discuss]] | [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Bulletin board]] | [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|Subscription list]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== Blanking pages ==

Please don't remove content without explanation. If you want a page deleted, please add {{tlx|delete|''reason''}} to the top of the page. Thanks. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:52, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== Tip ==

If you want something to not be formatted, you can put ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' around whatever it is. This way you could have written ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|reason}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' on Mike's page, and it would have ended up saying ''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|reason}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' without tagging Mike's page for deletion.

''Celastrus orbiculatus'', '''Chinese Bittersweet''', '''Oriental Bittersweet''', or '''Oriental Staff Vine''' is a twining woody vine native to East Asia, but naturalised in other parts of the world, and invasive in a large region of North America. The vine was introduced into North America in 1879, and has since become a damaging weed.

==Description==
The defining characteristic are the vines themselves. Young vines are thin spindly, with silver to reddish brown bark.  Older vines become thick and trunk-like, with a somewhat shiny gray bark with prominent dots (lenticels).  When growing without supports to climb it forms shrubby thickets, but more commonlty is found growing over trees or shrubs climbing by twisting around the branches or trunks&lt;ref name=&quot;uva&quot;&gt;Richard H. Uva, Joseph C. Neal and Joseph M. Ditomaso, ''Weeds of The Northeast'', (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1997), Pp. 336-337.&lt;/ref&gt;. The encircling vines frequently girdle the supporting tree or branch&lt;ref name=&quot;uva&quot; /&gt;.

The leaves are round and glossy, 2-12 cm long, have toothed margins and grow in alternate patterns along the vines&lt;ref name=&quot;uva&quot; /&gt;.  Small green flowers produce the distinctive red seeds.  The seeds are encased in yellow pods that break open during autumn. All parts of the plant are poisonous.

==Ecology==

Before it was recognized as a destructive invasive species, Oriental staff vine was planted along roadsides to help control soil erosion&lt;ref&gt;[http://site.www.umb.edu/conne/jennjim/celastrus.html ''Celastrus orbiculatus'' - Oriental Bittersweet Vine]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The orange red berries and the vines that hold them are popular as holiday decorations.

Because of these uses, Oriental staff vine has taken over landscapes, roadsides, and woods.  In the United States it can be found as far south as Virginia, as far north as New York, and as far west as the Rocky Mountains&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchison&quot;&gt;Max Hutchison, [http://www.inhs.uiuc.edu/chf/outreach/VMG/rlbitter.html VEGETATION MANAGEMENT GUIDELINE: ''Round-leaved bittersweet'' (Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb.)]&lt;/ref&gt;.  It prefers mesic woods, where it has been known to eclipse native plants.

==Uses==
&lt;!--garden, crop, fodder, medicinal, material etc.--&gt;

==Control==
Oriental staff vine has spread very quickly in the United States, and can be quite damaging to native plants and ecosystems.  The easiest way to get rid of a small infestation is by ripping the plants out of the ground by their roots.  If there is a large colony of them the recommended course of action is to cut at the root, and apply [[../Roundup|glyphosphate]], as most herbicides have no effect on the vine&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchison&quot; /&gt;.  The application of glyphosphate should be done at the beginning of winter&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchison&quot; /&gt;.

{{weedcontrol|
| Mowing    = Mowing is effective if done frequently (this is not a lawn weed)
| Cultivation   =  Effective for young plants only, and needs to be repeated, as the plant can grow back from small rootlets.
| Mulching (for prevention)   = Not effective (seeds will germinate beneath mulch)
| Girdling  = 
| Coppicing  = Effective to prevent seed production only
| Grinding  = Weakens the plant, but the outer roots will regrow
| Pulling  = Best done in moist soil, as the roots are fragile, and severed roots will grow new plants
| Flame  = effective as a burndown only
| Barriers  = not effective, in fact barriers can protect the plant and make later attempts to pull more difficult

      <text xml:space="preserve">While intelligence was being gathered, propaganda was being handed out, weapons were being developed, wars were breaking out across the globe, a totally different kind of conflict was happening above it. From 1957 to circa. 1975 the two superpowers were locked in a competition to be the first to explore outer space. The race to conquer space was dubbed as the &quot;Space Race&quot;. 

Apart from a few posters and articles, a television or a radio broadcast, both superpowers were convinced that the ultimate &quot;nuclear bomb&quot; of propaganda weapons was staying ahead in the Space Race, through magnificent and mouth-dropping accomplishments which showed to the world how modern and advanced their political system was.

==Background==
The world's first rockets were the V-6 and V-8 rockets, made by German rocket scientists in 1942 during World War Two. These were designed to carry 1000kg bombs over a long distance and were fired to a target where the the bombs would explode on impact. In 1944, Hitler decided to unleash his &quot;secret weapon&quot; and thousands of these rockets were launched at south-east Britain causing a lot of damage both physically and mentally.

But as the war was drawing to a close Germany was being squeezed from the Allies on one side and the Soviets on the other, hundreds of V-1 and V-2 rockets, and their scientists were captured by both sides and transported back to the home countries where they were &quot;encouraged&quot; to work and share their knowledge with them.

==Launch of Sputnik: The Space Race Begins==
The Soviet Union kick-started the Space Race when they launched the first ever satellite, called Sputnik 1 into orbit, on October 4th 1957. The event caused so much fear (Since in Soviet easily can replace the payload with warhead) and jealousy within the American public and government that the US government was forced to respond by revamping the whole education system and taking other desperate measures, in order to produce budding rocket scientists in the homeland. This was called the &quot;Sputnik Crisis&quot;.

After some embarrassing failures at trying to launch a rocket in Cape Canaveral, and after four months of waiting, the Americans finally managed to successfully launch their own satellite, Explorer 1.

While launching Explorer 1 the United States realized that what the Soviet Union did by deploying Sputnik 1 into orbit redefined the ability to cross another nations boarders without provoking military escalation.  Even though an aircraft could not cross the boarder of another nation, it was ok for a satellite to cross that line.  Thus the Soviet Union set the ground work for future spy satellite missions by the United States and within a few short years, [[w:Corona_%28satellite%29|Corona]] was born.

==First Man Enters Space==
On the 4th November 1957, a dog named Laika paved the way for man to enter space, which eventually happened on the 12th April 1961, when the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth, in the Vostok I spaceship. This was another embarrassing blow to the USA and showed to the world ''again'' how technologically advanced their country was. Then, in 1963, Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space.

The Americans put their own man in space a year later. The USA was lagging behind their communist rival in the Space Race and they were going to have to take the initiative soon.

==Moon Landings==
President John Kennedy famously predicted in 1961 that the Americans would put the first man on the moon before the end of the decade. The statement was a pretty daring one, especially at a time when the USA was being repeatedly humiliated by the Soviets in outer space. Some people were inspired by it while, to others, it was an empty promise that was just going to add to the long list of US embarrassments. But to the amazement of the world, his prediction turned into reality in 1969.

Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first people to set foot on the moon, on 21st July 1969. Over 300 million people around the world watched the event through their television screens. It was a terrific achievement that more than made up for the bad start in the Space Race. The first words of Neil Armstrong were:

{{cquote|One small step for '''a''' man, one giant leap for mankind}}

&quot;a&quot;- added in 2006 with the discovery of a blip in the recordings

The Soviets had to watch helplessly as all memory of their own accomplishments of putting man, woman and dog into space were all immediately washed away.

==End of the Space Race==
The cost of being in the Space Race was in the billions, and both the USA and the USSR knew that their economies wouldn't be able to handle this cost for long - each new achievement was even more expensive than the last one. After 1969, the Space Race was massively toned down and the idea that there was a &quot;Space Race&quot; going was starting to get out of date. Although the Sputnik launch obviously began the Space Race, what ended it is a matter of debate today. 

Most people accept that it ended in 1975, when Soviet and American astronauts met, shook hands and ate together in a friendly meeting during the Apollo-Soyuz mission. The act was a friendly gesture and symbolized the USA and USSR's strengthening relationship, during a 10-year period of 'peaceful co-existence', called &quot;Dètente&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Control Systems/Page|Nyquist Stability Criteria|System Specifications}}

== System Interaction ==

In the world of control engineering, there are a slew of systems available that need to be controlled. The task of a control engineer is to design controller and compensator units to interact with these pre-existing systems. However, some systems simply cannot be controlled (or, more often, cannot be controlled in specific ways). The concept of '''controllability''' refers to the ability of a controller to arbitrarily alter the functionality of the system plant. 

The state-variable of a system, ''x'', represents the internal workings of the system that can be separate from the regular input-output relationship of the system. This also needs to be measured, or ''observed''. The term '''observability''' describes whether the internal state variables of the system can be externally measured.

== Controllability ==

We will start off with the definitions of the term '''controllability''', and the related term '''reachability'''

{{TextBox|1=
;Controllability:A system with internal state vector ''x'' is called '''controllable''' if and only if the system states can be changed by changing the system input.

;Reachability:A particular state x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is called ''reachable'' if there exists an input that transfers the state of the system from the initial state x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in some finite time interval [t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, t).}}

We can also write out the definition of reachability more precisely:

{{TextBox|1=
A state x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is called '''reachable''' at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if for some finite initial time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; there exists an input u(t) that transfers the state x(t) from the origin at t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

A system is '''reachable''' at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if every state x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in the state-space is reachable at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.}}

Similarly, we can more precisely define the concept of controllability:

{{TextBox|1=
A state x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is '''controllable''' at time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if for some finite time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; there exists an input u(t) that transfers the state x(t) from x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to the origin at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

A system is called '''controllable''' at time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if every state x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the state-space is controllable.}}

=== Controllability Matrix ===

For LTI (linear time-invariant) systems, a system is reachable if and only if its '''controllability matrix''', &amp;zeta;, has a full row rank of ''p'', where ''p'' is the dimension of the matrix A, and ''p'' &amp;times; ''q'' is the dimension of matrix B.

{{eqn|Controllability Matrix}}
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \begin{bmatrix}B &amp; AB &amp; A^2B &amp; \cdots &amp; A^{p-1}B\end{bmatrix} \in R^{p \times pq}&lt;/math&gt;

A system is controllable or &quot;Controllable to the origin&quot; when any state x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be driven to the zero state ''x = 0'' in a finite number of steps. 

A system is controllable when the rank of the system matrix A is ''p'', and the rank of the controllability matrix is  equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;Rank(\zeta) = Rank(A^{-1}\zeta) = p&lt;/math&gt;

If the second equation is not satisfied, the system is not .

MATLAB allows one to easily create the controllability matrix with the '''ctrb''' command.  To create the controllabilty matrix &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; simply type

:zeta=ctrb(A,B)

where A and B are mentioned above.  Then in order to determine if the system is controllable or not one can use the rank command to determine if it has full rank.

If 

:&lt;math&gt;Rank(A) &lt; p&lt;/math&gt;

Then controllability does not imply reachability.

*Reachability always implies controllability.
*Controllability only implies reachability when the state transition matrix is nonsingular.

=== Determining Reachability ===

There are four methods that can be used to determine if a system is reachable or not:
#If the ''p'' rows of &lt;math&gt;\phi(t, \tau)B(t)&lt;/math&gt; are linearly independent over the field of complex numbers. That is, if the rank of the product of those two matrices is equal to ''p'' for all values of ''t'' and ''&amp;tau;''
#If the rank of the controllability matrix is the same as the rank of the system matrix A.
#If the rank of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}[\lambda I - A, B] = p&lt;/math&gt; for all eigenvalues &amp;lambda; of the matrix A.
#If the rank of the '''reachability gramian''' (described below) is equal to the rank of the system matrix A.

Each one of these conditions is both necessary and sufficient. If any one test fails, all the tests will fail, and the system is not reachable. If any test is positive, then all the tests will be positive, and the system is reachable.

=== Gramians ===

'''Gramians''' are complicated mathematical functions that can be used to determine specific things about a system. For instance, we can use gramians to determine whether a system is controllable or reachable. Gramians, because they are more complicated than other methods, are typically only used when other methods of analyzing a system fail (or are too difficult).

All the gramians presented on this page are all matrices with dimension ''p'' &amp;times; ''p'' (the same size as the system matrix A).

All the gramians presented here will be described using the general case of Linear time-variant systems. To change these into LTI (time-invariant equations), the following substitutions can be used:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t, \tau) \to e^{A(t-\tau)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi'(t, \tau) \to e^{A'(t-\tau)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where we are using the notation X' to denote the transpose of a matrix X (as opposed to the traditional notation X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;).

=== Reachability Gramian ===

We can define the '''reachability gramian''' as the following integral:
{{eqn|Reachability Gramian}}
:&lt;math&gt;W_r(t_0, t_1) = \int_{t_0}^{t_1}\phi(t_1, \tau)B(\tau)B'(\tau)\phi'(t_1, \tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

The system is reachable if the rank of the reachability gramian is the same as the rank of the system matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}(W_r) = p&lt;/math&gt;

=== Controllability Gramian ===

We can define the '''controllability gramian''' of a system (A, B) as:
{{eqn|Controllability Gramian}}
:&lt;math&gt;W_c(t_0, t_1) = \int_{t_0}^{t_1}\phi(t_0, \tau)B(\tau)B'(\tau)\phi'(t_0, \tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

The system is controllable if the rank of the controllability gramian is the same as the rank of the system matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}(W_c) = p&lt;/math&gt;

If the system is time-invariant, there are two important points to be made. First, the reachability gramian and the controllability gramian reduce to be the same equation. Therefore, for LTI systems, if we have found one gramian, then we automatically know both gramians. Second, the controllability gramian can also be found as the solution to the following Lyapunov equation:

:&lt;math&gt;AW_c + W_cA' = -BB'&lt;/math&gt;

Many software packages, notably MATLAB, have functions to solve the Lyapunov equation. By using this last relation, we can also solve for the controllability gramian using these existing functions.

== Observability ==

The state-variables of a system might not be able to be measured for any of the following reasons:

#The location of the particular state variable might not be physically accessible (a capacitor or a spring, for instance). 
#There are no appropriate instruments to measure the state variable, or the state-variable might be measured in units for which there does not exist any measurement device.
#The state-variable is a derived &quot;dummy&quot; variable that has no physical meaning.

If things cannot be directly observed, for any of the reasons above, it can be necessary to calculate or '''estimate''' the values of the internal state variables, using only the input/output relation of the system, and the output history of the system from the starting time. In other words, we must ask whether or not it is possible to determine what the inside of the system (the internal system states) is like, by only observing the outside performance of the system (input and output)? We can provide the following formal definition of mathematical observability:

{{TextBox|1=
;Observability:A system with an initial state, &lt;math&gt;x(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; is '''observable''' if and only if the value of the initial state can be determined from the system output y(t) that has been observed through the time interval &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;t&lt;t_f&lt;/math&gt;. If the initial state cannot be so determined, the system is '''unobservable'''.

;Complete Observability:A system is said to be '''completely observable''' if all the possible initial states of the system can be observed. Systems that fail this criteria are said to be '''unobservable'''.

;Detectability: A system is '''Detectable''' if all states that cannot be observed decay to zero asymptotically.

;Constructability:A system is '''constructable''' if the present state of the system can be determined from the present and past outputs and inputs to the system. If a system is observable, then it is also constructable. The relationship does not work the other way around.}}

A system state x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is unobservable at a given time t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; if the zero-input response of the system is zero for all time t. If a system is observable, then the only state that produces a zero output for all time is the zero state. We can use this concept to define the term '''state-observability'''.

{{TextBox|1=
;State-Observability: A system is completely '''state-observable''' at time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or the pair (A, C) is observable at t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if the only state that is unobservable at t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the zero state x = 0.}}

=== Constructability ===

A state ''x'' is '''unconstructable''' at a time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if for every finite time t &lt; t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the zero input response of the system is zero for all time t.

A system is completely '''state constructable''' at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if the only state ''x'' that is unconstructable at t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is ''x'' = 0.

If a system is observable at an initial time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,  then it is constructable at some time t &gt; t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, if it is constructable at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Observability Matrix ===

The observability of the system is dependant only on the system states and the system output, so we can simplify our state equations to remove the input terms:
{{Control Systems/Matrix Dim}}
:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = Ax(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = Cx(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we can show that the observability of the system is dependant only on the coefficient matrices A and C. We can show precisely how to determine whether a system is observable, using only these two matrices. If we have the '''observability matrix''' Q:

{{eqn|Observability Matrix}}
:&lt;math&gt;Q = \begin{bmatrix}C\\CA\\CA^2\\\vdots\\CA^{p-1}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

we can show that the system is observable if and only if the Q matrix has a rank of ''p''. Notice that the Q matrix has the dimensions ''pr'' &amp;times; ''p''.

MATLAB allows one to easily create the observability matrix with the '''obsv''' command.  To create the observabilty matrix &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; simply type

:Q=obsv(A,C)

where A and C are mentioned above.  Then in order to determine if the system is observable or not one can use the rank command to determine if it has full rank.

=== Observability Gramian ===

We can define an '''observability gramian''' as:

{{eqn|Observability Gramian}}
:&lt;math&gt;W_o(t_0, t_1) = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \phi'(\tau, t_0)C'(\tau)C(\tau)\phi(\tau, t_0)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

A system is completely state observable at time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; t &lt; t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if the rank of the observability gramian is equal to the size ''p'' of the system matrix A.

If the system (A, B, C, D) is time-invariant, we can construct the observability gramian as the solution to the Lyapunov equation:

:&lt;math&gt;A'W_o + W_oA = -C'C&lt;/math&gt;

=== Constructability Gramian ===

We can define a '''constructability gramian''' as:

{{eqn|Constructability Gramian}}
:&lt;math&gt;W_{cn}(t_0, t_1) = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \phi'(\tau, t_1)C'(\tau)C(\tau)\phi(\tau, t_1)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

A system is completely state observable at an initial time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if there exists a finite t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank} (W_0) = \operatorname{rank} (W_{cn}) = p&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the constructability and observability gramians are very similar, and typically they can both be calculated at the same time, only substituting in different values into the state-transition matrix.

== Duality Principle ==

The concepts of controllability and observability are very similar. In fact, there is a concrete relationship between the two. We can say that a system (A, B) is controllable if and only if the system (A', C, B', D) is observable. This fact can be proven by plugging A' in for A, and B' in for C into the observability Gramian. The resulting equation will exactly mirror the formula for the controllability gramian, implying that the two results are the same.

::*Products known to leave ammonia in the water when &quot;removing&quot; chloramine!!  Don't use.
:::*Hagen Exo-Terra Calcimize for Reptiles (removes chlorine and chloramine; neutralizes heavy metals; supplies high levels of calcium)
::* [[w:sea water|Sea water]] made with Tropic Marin Pharmaceutical Grade Sea Salt (consider [http://www.hermitcrabassociation.com/pages/saltwater.html mixing]&amp;nbsp;  it with distilled water to keep the proper mineral concentrations)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  [CAUTIONS: Salt does not evaporate.  If just replacing evaporated sea water, do so with distilled/fresh water to avoid increasing the salt concentration of the mix. Note that some salt mixes are high in [http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2003-03/rs/feature/index.php heavy metals.]&amp;nbsp;  ]
:*water bowls
::* large FMR (Florida Marine Research) Hermit Crab Pool (5&quot;L x 4&quot;W) - fresh water and sponges

In the US the term is Behaviorist, UK and elsewhere Behaviourist- not behavior(al)ist

:: I have added a few --[[User:Michaelwayw2|Michaelwayw2]] ([[User talk:Michaelwayw2|talk]]) 20:05, 23 December 2007 (UTC)

== This page has many errors ==
For example:
Spillane (2002) states, “the behaviorist perspective, associated with B. F. Skinner, holds that the mind at work cannot be observed, tested, or understood; thus, behaviorists are concerned with actions (behavior) as the sites of knowing, teaching, and learning” (p. 380)

Is wholly false except in the most literal interpretation of &quot;mind&quot; which Skinner asserts does not exist at all as a causal entity. SKinners Radical Behaviorism does allow for inner knowledge, does not assert truth by consensus (as the Methodological Behaviorists did or do) and so can allow for self-knowledge, self-perception, and the observation of thinking and so on. THis is explained in ''About Behaviorism'' and in numerous other places.

Which leads me to my second point. This text on Skinner's theories is comprised almost entirely of secondary texts - a hallmark of poor scholarship. Skinner's works are freely available, and numerous journal articles are available online, e.g. The Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis and the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, which are direct Skinnerian extensions of behaviorist learning theory. Use primary texts unless you want to repeat the obvious mistakes of people like Spillane, above. --[[User:Michaelwayw2|Michaelwayw2]] ([[User talk:Michaelwayw2|talk]]) 19:10, 23 December 2007 (UTC)

== Citation for Merriam ? ==

Is this the citation 

Learning in Adulthood: A Comprehensive Guide (Jossey Bass Higher and Adult Education Series) (Hardcover)
by Sharan B. Merriam (Author), Rosemary S. Caffarella (Author)

There is no listed reference for it, so I will move them into references using this cite.

== Simplistic or fundamental? ==

The problem with this entire section is that is segues off of the simplified presentation of &quot;behaviorist&quot; theorist to begin with.

Behavior Analysis is not simple. Verbal Behavior is not simple. However, the critics of behaviorism have consistently attacked human extensions of the theory and consistently presented it as a simple theory, mostly or entirely for animals. Thus, this is little more than the discussion of a straw man whether it is pro or con. The reflex only theories of Pavlov &amp; Watson proved insightful for some things but fell to the more powerful theories of learning like Skinner's. However, even Skinner realized that it couldn't account for language, so he proposed Verbal Behavior as a conceptual extension to his basic work. To discuss whether behavior analysis is simplistic requires that it be considered in a non-simplistic manner first. This article does not do that. I am inclined to delete this entire section. --[[User:Michaelwayw2|Michaelwayw2]] ([[User talk:Michaelwayw2|talk]]) 20:11, 23 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Metrication is needed if Wikipedia Cookbook is to be useful to people who don't live in the USA.  Many cookbook recipes use pounds, ounces and fluid ounces which are not a big problem to convert but some recipes use ''cups'' which can be extremely confusing because cup sizes vary from country to country and it's never clear where the original author of a recipe is from.  Non-metric recipes to be converted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Essentially English only has 2 tenses: past and present.  However, these tenses are used in a variety of ways so many people would say that there are many more tenses (or forms).


== List of English Forms ==

*Past Simple (PAST TENSE)
*Past Continuous (WAS/WERE + PARTICIPLE [ING])
*Past Perfect Simple (HAD + PAST PARTICIPLE)
*Past Perfect Continuous (HAD + BEEN + PARTICIPLE [ING])

*Present Simple (PRESENT TENSE)
*Present Continuous (AM/IS/ARE + PARTICIPLE [ING])
*Present Perfect Simple (HAS/HAVE + PAST PARTICIPLE)
*Present Perfect Continuous (HAS/HAVE + BEEN + PARTICIPLE [ING])

*Future with Will (WILL + INFINITIVE)
*Future with Going to (AM/IS/ARE + GOING + INFINITIVE)
*Future Continuous (WILL + BE + PARTICIPLE [ING])
*Future Perfect Simple (WILL + HAVE + PAST PARTICIPLE)
*Future Perfect Continuous (WILL + HAVE + BEEN + PARTICIPLE [ING])

== Notes ==

The &quot;Continuous&quot; forms are sometimes called &quot;progressive&quot;.  The past perfect form is sometimes referred to as &quot;pluperfect&quot;.  The &quot;participle&quot; of a verb is the form which ends with -ing, i.e. reading, listening, etc.  The &quot;past participle&quot; of a verb is sometimes called the &quot;3rd form&quot;.  The infinitive of a verb is the standard form found in the dictionary, i.e. be, have, like.

== Past Tenses ==

Typically the past tense is used to describe past states or actions.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

* The '''past simple''' is used for almost all past states and is used to describe past actions which have been completed at the point of reference in the past - e.g. &quot;I went to London on Saturday&quot; (this action was in the past and it is complete).
* The '''past continuous''' is used for past actions which were occurring at the point of reference in the past.  It is not normally used for past states [like, hate, see, etc.] - e.g. &quot;I was playing football this morning&quot; (this action was in the past and happening at the time we are talking about [this morning]).  It is frequently used for long past events.
* The '''past perfect simple''' is used for past states and actions which happened before the point of reference in the past - e.g. &quot;I had eaten my food when the door bell rang&quot; (the eating of the food happened before the door bell ringing).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

In addition to the previous forms used for talking about the past, it is also possible to use '''used to''' + infinitive to talk about past events which were habitual and no longer happen - e.g. &quot;I used to play football&quot;.  In the previous example this means that I regularly played football in the past and that I don't play football in the present.

== Present Tenses ==

Typically the present tenses are used to describe present actions or states and past actions and states which affect the present.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

* The '''present simple''' is used for states which are true at the present time - e.g. &quot;I like chocolate&quot;.  It is also used for habitual actions - e.g. &quot;I play football every day&quot;.  The present simple should not be used to describe actions which are happening at this moment - e.g. &quot;I am eating chocolate&quot; NOT &quot;I eat chocolate&quot;.
* The '''present continuous''' is used for actions which are happening at the present time - e.g. &quot;I am cooking food&quot;.  It is almost never used to describe states - e.g. &quot;I love it&quot; NOT &quot;I'm loving it (although McDonald's would disagree)&quot;.  The present continuous can also be used to talk about future arrangements provided you include some reference to the future in your sentence - e.g. &quot;I am visiting my Gran tomorrow&quot;.
* The '''present perfect simple''' is generally used to describe states and actions that started in the past and continue into the present and maybe into the future - e.g. &quot;I have eaten dinner&quot;.  It's also used to describe past events where it is unclear exactly when the event took place - e.g. &quot;I have been to New York&quot;.
* The '''present perfect continuous''' is used in a similar way to the present perfect simple but it's used more often for repeated events - e.g. &quot;I have been calling you all day&quot;.

== Future Tenses ==

* The most common forms for talking about the future in English are:

# WILL + BARE INFINITIVE
# BE + GOING TO + BARE INFINITIVE
# BE + PARTICIPLE (Present Continuous)

The form with '''will''' is generally used when we make immediate decision about the future - e.g. &quot;I'll answer the phone&quot;.  The form with '''going to''' is used when we talk about future plans and arrangements - e.g. &quot;I'm going to the zoo tomorrow&quot;.  The form using the '''present continuous''' can also be used with future arrangements provided that you use a time reference - e.g. &quot;I'm driving to work in 3 hours&quot;.

* '''Future Continuous''' is used to talk about the future in a similar way to how present continuous is used to talk about the present.  If you're talking about a future event that will be in progress at that time in the future then you should use future continuous.  As with all continuous tenses it is rare to use state verbs (like, hate, etc.) - e.g. &quot;I will be playing football at 5pm on Saturday&quot;.
* '''Future Perfect Simple''' is not a frequently used form in everyday English.  It is used to take about future events which are complete at that point in the future - e.g. &quot;I will have finished my exam by 2pm on Saturday&quot;.  In the previous example this suggests that the exam will happen on Saturday and that the finish of the exam is at or before 2pm.
* '''Future Perfect Continuous''' is not a frequently used form in everyday English.  It is used to take about future events which started before that point in the future and have not yet finished or will reoccur - e.g. &quot;I will have been teaching for 25 years in May&quot;.  The previous example suggests that I started teaching before that point in the future and that I will (probably) continue teaching beyond that point.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

In addition to the previous forms used to talk about the future, it is possible to use verbs like '''may''' and '''might''' to talk about more uncertain future events - e.g. &quot;I may go to London&quot;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Occasionally the '''present simple''' is used for referring to future events which are scheduled or timetabled.  This usage is not as common as the first future forms but it is especially used when talking about timetabled transport and events like exams and meetings - e.g. &quot;The exam starts at 5pm&quot;.

== Shepherd's Pie ==

Shepherd's Pie is a dish of lamb and potato. The ingredients are in no way precise and you can substitute the vegetables with whatever you have in your cupboard.

== Ingredients ==

* 100g minced lamb
* Clove of garlic
* Four large potatoes
* One carrot
* Some peas
* Some sweetcorn
* Mixed vegetables
* Small amount of tomato ketchup
* Beef stock cube or gravy
* 5g of flour
* 10ml of water
* 30ml of milk
* 30g of butter or margarine
* 5ml of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] or other cooking oil

== Procedure ==

# Peel and chop the potatoes.  Boil the potatoes for 20 minutes whilst preparing the rest of the meal.
# Cut the minced lamb and add the chopped garlic.
# Next gently heat some olive oil in a frying pan and add the meat and garlic
# Then add the vegetables, ketchup, stock cube (or gravy) and cook on a very low heat for 5 minutes
# Now add a touch of flour and the water and mix well.
# Cook the mixture for about 25 minutes and stir every few minutes
# Once the potatoes are ready drain them, add a touch of milk and butter (or margarine) and mash
# Pour the mixture into an oven dish then add the mashed potatoes on top.  Cover all of the lamb mixture

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hijab
Recently the dress code of Moslem women has been a hot issue for newspapers. The Washington Post on Sunday October 22/2006 had printed three different types of pictures of Moslem women. The first one belonged to Miss. Afghanistan in a two piece Red Hot Bikini. .The young lady was wearing a pair of pants (trousers). A long coast; and a scarf were covering her head. The final picture belonged to young lady not only covered from head to toe; she had covered her chest as well. She had another scarf covering her entire face. The only thing you were able to see was her beautiful eyes. This type of face covering is called Nikab.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 
These ladies were dressed according to the culture and the tradition of that region.    Hijab does not have anything to do with religion of Islam; anymore than wearing two piece of bikini have to do   with the Chris tiny. These women dressed up either by choice or by the cloture and the tradition of their land.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

When we take a look back in history as far back as the old Greek and Roman era; through paintings and art facts discovered by archeologists; it shows women dressed in a long dress; their hair is also covered. The religious painting of Virgin Mary (Lords’ peace upon her); the holy lady has shown covered from head to toe and so were ladies around this time. A little closer to our time takes us to 1770s and shows a picture of Ethan Allens’ wife riding a mule and is covered from head to toe.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Even right now in some African countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, both men and women wear long dress and use the hijab also. This is a tradition of that area and does not have anything to do with Islam. Ever since Prophet Muhammad, the last messenger of Gods’ birth, people of that region continue wearing the same type of dress for both sexes without any further change.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The 3 most respected religions of the world Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have instructions of the God in them for a better happier life. Anyone who needs advice of the Lord must refer to them and stay away from other books.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I have taken a look at the dress code in the Torah, Bible, and Quran .The following are the instructions of the Lord Almighty and not the authors’ instructions.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

== Judaism: ==

The Jewish scholars, after thorough research, had this to write:  “We do not find any direct command in Torah mandating that women cover their head, but we do know that this has been the continuing custom of thousand years.”

== Bible: ==

There are four rules at Deuteronomy: 

1)	“The women shall not wear that which pertainetch unto men.”
2)	“First Timothy 2:29 “that women adorn themselves in modest apparel.
3)	“They should not adorn themselves in modest apparel, but with shamfacness.” 
4)	“Not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.”

== Quran ==

* “O children of Adam, we have provided you to cover your bodies, as well for luxury. But the best garment is the garment of righteousness. There are some of Gods’ sign that may take heed.”

* “And tell, the believing women to subdue their eyes, and maintain their chastity. They shall not revel any parts of their bodies, except which is necessary. They shall cover their chest.”

* As you see Torah, Bible, as well as Quran is instructing women to be righteousness in their actions and cover their sensitive part of their body to ward off evil, lust, and wrong kind of man from themselves.

* The Lords’ instructions are handed down for the happiness of his people. The choice is yours.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Relative humidity gauges are called hygrometers and   their delicate mechanisms can be jarred out of adjustment.  As a result they must be calibrated before the readings can be trusted.

To do the calibration you need 
:*an &lt;u&gt;airtight&lt;/u&gt; container (mason jar, ziplock bag, plastic tub, etc.)
:*a small dish, bottle cap, or shot glass, 
:*1 tsp salt, 
:*water, and 
:*if the hygrometer is adjustable, a very small, screwdriver.
  
Put the salt in the dish and add just enough water to completely wet (not dissolve) the salt. Seal the dish and the hygrometer in the container.  (Optionally, put everything in a second, larger, airtight container to be confident that things are airtight.) After waiting at least 6 hours, note the reading on the hygrometer.  

If that test reading is not 75%, the screw on the back of an adjustable hygrometer can be used to gently correct the reading.  If the hydrometer is not adjustable, you will have to mentally adjust the reading every time you use the gauge [actual reading + (75 - test reading)].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial will take you step by step through the process of modelling several different types of traditional farm tools.

==Handle==

I apologize for the lack of pictures, I will try to get to those later...so either try to follow along the best you can or please come back when this page is more complete.

This section is designed to create a good looking, generic tool handle that for economy of time you can easily reuse with little or no modification for each different farm tool.


Blender should start out with the default cube and the 3D cursor in the center. Delete the cube. Make sure you are in top view ('''NUM7''') and add a cylinder ('''space''' + ''Add'' selection + ''Cylinder'' selection). A window should appear that says &quot;Vertices: 16&quot; (this determines how many individual sides the cylinder will have, typing &quot;4&quot; in the place of the 16 will create a cuboid, so you can determine the startout detail here), for the purposes of this tutorial a simpler mesh will suffice, so click '''OK'''.

You should be in EDIT MODE, hit the '''A''' key to deselect all vertices. Press '''NUM3''' to go to SIDE VIEW and press '''Z''' to go to WIREFRAME VIEW. Select the top vertices, either using BOX SELECT (press '''B''' and click and drag the cursor to include the intended selection), or LASSO SELECT (hold down '''CTRL''' while clicking and dragging around the intended selection. You may LASSO DESELECT by holding '''CTRL''' plus '''SHIFT''' and then clicking and dragging what you you want to deselect).

With the top vertices selected, use the EXTRUDE tool ('''E''') and select ''Region''. A purple line should appear and you may notice that moving the curser up and down will move the extension. Hold down '''CTRL''' to confine the movement to even increments and move the curser up 2 units (you should see this between the buttons window and the mesh window).

Hold '''CTRL''' and scale the selection ('''S''') to 90%(.9). Extrude again and move the selection up (along the ''Z'' or vertical dimension) 2 units. Press '''S''' and resize to 80%. Repeat the extrude/move, scaling to 90%. Extrude/move again, but do not scale this time.

== Snails &amp; crabs ==

OK - I don't know much about it but the work you are doing looks very good.  Looks like some more links from [[Animal Care]] would be good tho - there are &quot;back&quot; links from the snails &amp; crabs but I can't see them from the care page?

== Hermit crab care...from wikipedia? ==

Hi Jangim,

This looks like it was copied from wikipedia (judging by the large # of links)... for copyright reasons, we need to import pages that are copied from wikipedia to preserve the edit histories. No biggie, since it can still be done, just leave me a note on my talk page, or else request it at [[WB:RFI]]. Also, most of the links on the page are interwikis to wikipedia... if you'd like, I can import some of those pages too if they would be useful for your book. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:24, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

:Two reasons really. The first reason has to do with the copyrights... if you copy things from wikipedia, you're supposed to keep the edit history of the article that was copied (there's some subtle differences between the GFDL and public domain). 
:The second reason is that wikibooks are supposed to (in theory, at their best, etc.) be &quot;self-contained&quot;, so that someone who's starting out with their first hermit crab could just print out the chapters on hermit crab care and not need to also download wikipedia articles. In general wikilinks aren't used very much on wikibooks for this reason. Have a look at [[Wikibooks:Dewikify]] for details on that :-). For example: if you want, I could import the articles about the various species, and you could then merge them into a single page describing them and their potential/difficulty as pets.
:BTW, the reason I thought it might be copied wasn't because I don't think the chapter is great work (quite the contrary!), but large numbers of wikilinks in the first version of a page are usually a good sign that this is the case. I try to keep on top of the copyright stuff, because we've had some serious problems with it in the past :-(. 
:My daughter is a huge hermit crab fan (she's  almost 3)... are they safe for 3-yr-olds? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:55, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

::I am not really sure that I agree with the idea of trying to keep two different sets of encyclopedia info up-to-date.  Hermit crab biology is a work-in-progress right now.  

:::&lt;grinning&gt;...They're not &quot;two sets of articles&quot;, they're chapters and articles, which don't need to contain the same thing. I just thought maybe a chapter like [[Animal Care/Hermit Crab Species]] would be nice, because you could just have a quick discussion about how well each species is adapted for being a pet, special needs, etc. (which, as you may have found, is often considered &quot;unwelcome information&quot; on wikipedia because &quot;'''Wikipedia is not a how-to guide!!!'''&quot;). Then you could just add links to the wikipedia articles discussing the science of hermit crabs on that page. 

::However, once I finish the book/chapter and get it reviewed by a couple of &quot;crabbers&quot; AND get some more work done on the Wikipedia articles, I'll work on making the stuff more independent of Wikipedia.  This going to take a while.  &lt;grin&gt;

:::Oh most definitely... all books take a while :).

:::I wouldn't let Caroline handle the crab unsupervised, of course :). Though I'm surprised to think that they can be &quot;tamed&quot;... I didn't think they were smart enough to learn behaviors like that! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:21, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

== Diagrams ==

I think it would be very useful to have an appendix of diagrams.  [[:Image:Diagramme_bicyclette.svg]] was very useful in teaching me bicycle terms so if we had a diagram with translations below (if needed) for a variety of subjects (car, bike, house, computer, etc.) it could help people pick up vocabulary more quickly than a list. [[User:Grenavitar|gren]] [[User talk:Grenavitar|グレン]] 14:06, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
:Great idea!  If you've any skill with these, feel free to add some.  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] ([[User talk:Jade Knight|talk]]) 20:18, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

== PDF ==

So I am a mite confused. Why is the linked PDF (both the low-res and high-res) from ''2006''? That's a very long time ago. I worry that downloaders (such as myself) are getting an out-of-date product. --[[User talk:Gwern |Gwern]] [[Special:Contributions/Gwern | (contribs)]] 02:40, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

: The PDFs are old because there don't seem to have been any active contributors on this book for a while. In which case the text won't have changed much. You can see individual page histories to see how much they've changed since 2006. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:07, 28 January 2010 (UTC)

:I agree that PDF versions should be kept up to date and I have made a [[:Image:French.pdf|new PDF version]] from the print version. The old one was made with Latex formatting tools outside Wikibooks but as I have not done that with this one the presentation is not quite as polished. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:53, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

== Pronounciation ==

Back on topic of pronounciation, [[Talk:French/Archive_3#What needs to be done|see above]], I will agree that approximations are not always best.  I will agree that IPA and audio are nice.  I also will agree that .ogg files should be replaced.  I do however have two suggestions. 

#With IPA, have the corresponding letters.  Right now, it is only showing the phonemic inventory.
#HAVE ENGLISH APPROXIMATIONS!  They aren't always best, but work and all browsers and are easiest to understand.  For foreign sounds, do what my Chinese textbook does.  Example- IPA y, French u, Pinyin ü: shape your mouth like you are going to say bee, but say ooh.  This method works well.  Also look at [[Irish]], the pronounciation appendix.  It does a good job.

Finally, I am willing to renovate the French Pronounciation page if need be. 21:48, 5 October 2009 (UTC)

==&quot;Featured book&quot; status==
This book was removed from the list of featured books following the discussion [[Wikibooks:Featured_books/Nominations/Removal/French|here]]. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:07, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

==Templates for playing speech recordings==
(Note: This item was copied here from [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Technical_Assistance]] to remain accessible if that discussion is archived. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 15:09, 11 April 2010 (UTC))

At least 3 of the language books use a similar table template to play speech recordings, when you click on &quot;audio&quot; (French, Spanish &amp; German). This takes you to a new screen with a sound-to-light show. 
{| {{French Table|Grammar|The Definite Article|L'article défini|78|5}}
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | singular||feminine||la||la fille||the daughter
|-
|masculine||le||le fils{{ref|fils}}||the son
|-
|colspan=&quot;2&quot; | singular, starting with a vowel sound||l’||l’enfant||the child
|-
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | plural
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|les||les filles||the daughters
|-
|les fils||the sons
|-
|les enfants||the children
|}
I think it would be more useful to be able to stay on the original screen and read the text at the same time as listening to the recording. 
{{Listen
|filename=French_Grammar_-_The_Definite_Article.ogg
|title=info
|description=
|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The Listen template does something like this, but the icons and text layout are rather larger and do not fit into the tables so neatly. Would it be possible to combine the two templates so that the layout of the books is not significantly altered, but the audio can be played at the same time as reading the text? It's a bit too technical for me, so that's why I am asking here! [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 17:55, 4 February 2010 (UTC)
:I guess this issue is not really specific to Wikibooks, as Wikipedia and Wiktionary have similar templates with (IMO) similar room for improvement and perhaps more people available to spent time on it if they are interested. If I get any more joy over there, I'll announce further developments here. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 16:48, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

:I guess most readers just open the link in a new window with a right-click (but considering touch-based input devices this is something that probably should be avoided). Maybe the table template should be adjusted to include the play button (which can be configured to require less space, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Spanish_by_Choice/SpanishPod_newbie_lesson_A0001#Dialogue here] for examples). By the way, the Listen template has the problem that the built-in Firefox audio player ignores the horizontal HTML layout; thus, if it is used, there should be enough white space to the right of it. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:24, 2 March 2010 (UTC)
::Thanks for the help. The right clicking does work after a fashion, but as you say is not the ideal solution. I tried making a test template based the French_Table template, but so far have not achieved the compact layout I was aiming for as the audio player seems to be adding line-feeds to the layout. (see below) 
::{| {{Recent Runes Table|Grammar|The Definite Article|L'article défini|78|5}}
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | singular||feminine||la||la fille||the daughter
|-
|masculine||le||le fils{{ref|fils}}||the son. etc....
|}

:::I think you should give the player its very own table cell. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 07:07, 4 March 2010 (UTC)
::So far I have not managed to do this. Inserting | or || after the speaker image do not change the display as I expected.

[[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 15:13, 11 April 2010 (UTC)

: I've updated {{tl|French/Table}} to play speech on the page. In the current implementation, the speech box takes a large width if there is no title, and a small width if there is; some other formatting may work better. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 21:44, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
:: This looks pretty good now, giving easier use without upsetting the print-out. All we need now are some more French natives for new audio recordings! [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:10, 20 June 2010 (UTC)

==New Contributors Needed==
As far as I (Recent_Runes) can tell, the original authors stopped working on this book in 2006 or 2007. Since then, the addition of new material has been far slower. I occasionally feed back some material from the [[French For Football]] book into the appendices, but I do not plan to make any major updates to the lessons here. Basically then, if anyone else likes to contribute then you are free (within reason) to do as you please. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 15:30, 11 April 2010 (UTC)
:I'll see what I can do.  Haven't been around for a couple of years, hence I forgot the password to my old account.  There does seem quite a need for some rewrites on the parts I've seen.  I'm also trying to make a start on [[A-level French]] [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 13:04, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

::: I'm not going to be adding much content, so it seems Italienmoose will be the only major contributor. I had hoped someone would have fixed the book up over the years, and it's great that someone is finally up to it. Good luck! --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 20:22, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

==Overhaul==
As far as I've seen this seems to be my favourite looking languages book on here.  It could do with a bit of an overhall though.  Lessons seem to be detailed but from what I've seen don't have much sentence-written explanation.  This should be changed.  The reviews need to be completely redone and their aims reassessed.  Need to change the vocab lists a bit and grammar section needs work.  More appendices would be good.
I think I'm going to write some language book guidelines for my [[wikibooks:WikiProject Languages|languages project]] and presuming there aren't any complaints I'll transfer them onto here.  Contributions welcome of course. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 00:04, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

: That all sounds good; good luck. I may be doing gradual formatting updates, so let me know if it gets in your way. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 01:54, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::Currently, there is no link from the Contents to the [[French/Lessons/Planning|Planning]] page. I guess you will be putting this back at some point. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 12:47, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::: It's not very useful to readers, so I was thinking of referencing it from discussion pages, or maybe replacing it entirely with discussion pages so that there's more collaboration. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 13:23, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::::Nothing's really happened to it for a couple of years.  I'll have a look over it but I'll probably rewrite a large amount of it.  Probably just link at the top of the discussion page then. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 13:30, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::I noticed that many lessons have empty &quot;Dialogue&quot; sections - perhaps because these are difficult to write without sounding forced and artificial. An alternative could be to use short extracts from French Wikipedia articles instead, which could serve equally well as authentic samples of French to be analysed and expanded on in the later sections. Many of the lesson themes look suitable for this kind of treatment. There could also be an advantage in not requiring more than one voice for any audio recordings. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:48, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::: That's a very good idea. There's a similar user-written text at [[French/Lessons/The house]] that works well. The existing dialogue stubs are just there to encourage contributions. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 20:23, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: Well that's about the length I was thinking of, but more could be done in that example to link it with the rest of the lesson and generate some exercises. Another idea would be to produce dialogues in the style of brief radio reports or interviews. These often cover stories in quite a condensed format, and students would be able to relate the lesson to audio material that is readily available on-line. They can be a good source of &quot;inspiration&quot; for the author too. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:00, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::::: Also a good idea; [[n:fr:Wikinews:Radio]] is another possibility. The book is really lacking in this kind of content, so it will all help. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 05:42, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::: I hadn't noticed that site before and it looks interesting, although the articles might be longer and more advanced than we would want for most lessons. Perhaps some of the speakers over there could be persuaded to record some audio for us - once we are happy with the texts, of course. I have added some text to the Science lesson, and I am getting the feeling that the grammar that can be naturally linked to the text is not necessarily the material that is allocated to the lesson at the moment. If I carry on in the same direction, it might require some swapping around of the grammar between the lessons. I'll see how I get on, but we may need to discuss how to rearrange things if necessary. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 11:08, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::: Of course; it makes sense for the grammar and text to be linked. Some lessons work well for that now (such as ''acheter'' and ''payer'' for [[French/Lessons/Shopping|Shopping]], but others like [[French/Lessons/Science|Science]] are pretty arbitrary and should be improved. A lesson on using past participles as adjectives might work well. Relatedly, I was also thinking of introducing ''venir'' and ''mettre'' in some earlier lessons. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 15:34, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

==Frontpage==
The front page is nice and neat at the moment, but I think a better interface could make it more appealing to new viewers and easier to get around to edit for us.  I've used the front page template for the Miskito WikiBook.  Essentially what this changes is that there is a clear Getting Started section, listing the pages and subsections within it.  There is also a list of the 10 introductory books, and a short summary of each of their contents.  Also there's a project section for those who want to know more about the book.  There's also an author's section with a list of suggested pages to add to make collaboration easier.  The front page is a work in progress.  I haven't fully changed it to the French version yet, some of the links point to the miskito book still and quite a few of the suggested pages don't actually exist for this book yet.  But at the moment it's the thought that counts.  The link is [[French/Contents]].  I suggest that as full summaries of not all the lessons can go there we create a splash page featuring a title page and the lesson list, which then links into the real frontpage (or technically, contents page).  Comments please

[[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 14:39, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:The Miskito layout looks quite attractive, and perhaps it is an improvement. Personally, I am more interested in the educational material than how it is presented, but I thought splash pages were generally deprecated these days and that was why [[User:Swift|Swift]] moved the index onto the main page in January this year. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 15:13, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::Well the layout leads to the order the pages are likely to be read in and therefore the content of tha pages.  Although technically the order of the lessons will stay the same no matter what the layout is so it is a little irrelevant.  But as a reader I would prefer it to be easy to get around.  And if we 'borrow' some of the other aspects of the Miskito book aswell I think overall the improvement will be hugely beneficial to new readers, as well as editors. My aim is to rework the layout a little to make it easier to get around, and to avoid a huge layout change when more content is finished.  Then I'll work on the project pages so we have an idea of what's going on and then the more educational content. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 15:30, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

: Regarding the administrative/meta content, I would prefer it be limited to discussion pages, and perhaps one planning page, since it is not at all useful to readers and is something they would have to filter out. Having so many meta pages may also scare off new contributors, who may feel they have to read through them rather than being bold and contributing content.
: Regarding the getting started section, IMHO few people read prefaces and meta content at the start of books. Why not just present the list of introductory lessons?
: Regarding the lessons list, I think it is simply more content readers would have to filter out. The less superfluous meta information, the easier it is for readers to focus on the content. Specifically, I don't think &quot;Lesson #:&quot; adds anything, and most readers won't pay attention to the &quot;In this chapter&quot; subheadings. Rather than telling readers what they are going to learn , why not just take them to it as simply as possible? This is just my opinion from reading other books. 
: As an example, look at the [http://google.com Google] front page. It has very little secondary information and focuses on getting users to the content. Google limits the front page to around 30 words, so that the visual clutter is minimized. The Wikibooks analog is to simply present the table of contents as concisely as possible. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 15:51, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::Fair point about hiding the administrative content from readers.  I just thought it would be a better way to show new contributors how they could get involved, if they could find the administrative pages straight away.  Me personally, as a new contributor I would rather have the meta-pages easily visible to be able to get to grips with how to add new content properly quickly.  It would be possible to have a quick-start guide for new contributors and more in-depth guides for long-standing contributors to rework the layouts of the newer contributors into a more coherent structure.
::I was actually thinking the same about the getting started section, seeing as this wikibook was designed with the equivalent in the introductory lessons.
::I disagree about the &quot;in this chapter&quot; headings.  Admittedly with the ones that are there, they don't add much to it.  However, for the second half of introductory chapters, and especially for the more advanced lessons, I think it's important that readers can easily search through the included content on the contents page so that they can review whichever content they need to reread.  Removing them means that really they have to depend on the grammar appendix.  It would be especially important if we get review pages done for each lesson - then it's easy to find out what you'd be reviewing for each.  Remember that not except for beginners most people won't want to go through totally in order and many people want to relearn specific things in the context of a lesson. I suppose this could be shown purely on a more detailed contents page for just lessons. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 16:12, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::: That's a good point. How about a [[Miskito/Subject index|subject index]] like in Miskito, or a link which takes you to a page similar to [[French/Lessons/Level three]], say listed after the review/exercises links? Also, a contributing link would be helpful. How about a link to the main talk page, or perhaps some &quot;Meta&quot; page, added to a template like {{tlx|French}}, which would go at the top of each lesson. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 16:38, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:::: Aha.  That's more like it.  Yeah, I'd quite like to do a detailed lessons index I think, and also rework the level three style a bit.  That's what I had in mind.  I think maybe add a meta template and just stick it at the bottom of the contents page, and then on the discussion page.  Then it's at least easier to find than it is right now. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 16:50, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:::: And now my second attempt.  If you go on the main page you will notice I've added a project contents.  I will try to add the appropriate pages/add any similar that are already in existence.  I've used the original uncluttered style of the wikibook, which is quite nice.  If we go for this minimalist approach we can then have more detailed summaries of lessons etc. on other pages. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 19:15, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::::: As a temporary measure, I've added a &quot;detailed contents&quot; section to [[French/Lessons]]. An index sorted by topic would be much more useful for review, so feel free to create it; I may do it eventually once contents are more or less finalized. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 21:31, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

==Common European Framework ''breakthrough'' level==
I have seen some general discussion here on the [[W:Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages|CEFR]] by the [http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/default_en.asp Council of Europe] but nothing really detailed. Perhaps it would be useful to know the details of their lowest level (A1 / breakthrough), to use as a checklist to assess the progress of this book. A [http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Source/FinalBreakthrough%20specification_6Nov01.rtf document] about teaching EFL gives some idea of what is probably specified for French, but the definite information is only available in [http://www.editionsdidier.com/article/niveau-a1-pour-le-francais-un-referentiel-livre-cd/ book] form as far as I can tell. Has anyone seen any more detailed information on-line? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:43, 5 July 2010 (UTC)

: I don't know much about the framework, but using it as a checklist seems like a great idea to me. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 16:09, 10 July 2010 (UTC)

::Yes, I am just suggesting it could help review the overall progress. Although the specification above is for English, the general &quot;functions&quot; and &quot;notions&quot; should map fairly directly to French. The paper also lists a set of topics with associated vocabulary, which focuses on humdrum everyday life to the point of blandness in my opinion. There would be little to distinguish this book from the crowd, if we followed their prescribed vocabulary to the letter. I am dissecting some other French language books for beginners to draw up a table of core vocabulary against the CEFR functions and notions. I am not sure if this would count as OR, so I might make any results available on Google Docs or we could set up a Yahoo group for sharing spreadsheets. There is always Wikiversity too, but sometimes you need a real spreadsheet. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:17, 10 July 2010 (UTC)

::: Sounds good; I agree that we should include more interesting vocabulary. I've moved some vocabulary to &quot;supplementary vocabulary&quot; sections at the end of lessons, which we might use for both common lists as well as extra material for those interested on a topic. We can also look through [[wikt:fr:Wiktionnaire:Liste de 1750 mots français les plus courants]], which I've imported as an objective starting point to [[French/Lessons/Vocabulary to be added]]. Feel free to add to or remove from this list. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:37, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: Here is another list of [http://eduscol.education.fr/cid50486/vocabulaire.html vocabulary] aimed at French pupils up to 11 years old, which also has some grammar and word frequency data. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:44, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

== Auto-hide translations ==

In Firefox and perhaps other browsers, add
&lt;source lang='javascript'&gt;
if (window.frenchSettings === undefined) frenchSettings = {};
frenchSettings.englishVisibility = 'hidden'; // 'default', 'hidden', or 'visible'
&lt;/source&gt;
to [[Special:MyPage/per book/French.js|this page]] to always hide English translations in lessons, for example to review or to test yourself.

== Adding IPA ==

I'm trying to go through and add IPA pronunciations to as much vocabulary as I can. I'd like some confirmation that what I've done so far fits with the correct pronunciation. (I can say these words fine, but sometimes I don't transcribe them to IPA perfectly.) I've already caught my mistake on the 'r' sound -- the IPA is /ʁ/ and not /ʀ/. The [[French/Vocabulary/Basic/Family|Family vocabulary]] page I created shows how I'm doing IPA fairly well. Please inform me of any mistakes so I don't make them again! Merci bien, &lt;tt&gt;[[User:Chrishy|'''—''']][[Special:Contributions/Chrishy|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#4F00B0;&quot;&gt;'''C'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Chrishy|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8000FF;&quot;&gt;'''hrishy'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/tt&gt;  22:00, 2 January 2011 (UTC)

== Broken print version ==

The print version seems to be broken. Possibly an unintended side effect of changes made to some templates during 2010? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 00:01, 25 March 2011 (UTC)

: It is due to &quot;too many expensive parser function calls&quot; and exceeding the template include size, which is true of [[:Category:Pages where template include size is exceeded|other books]] as well. One option is to create several smaller print versions, one for each level ([[French/Lessons/Print version]] fails after nine lessons). Another is to &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; templates. Another is to deprecate the print version in favor of collections. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 01:36, 26 March 2011 (UTC)

:: Yes, collections might be a good option, although you don't seem to have quite so much control over the layout of things like page breaks. And I was puzzled as to why the PDF of the collection does not seem to contain any exercises. 

:: The problem with the &quot;template include size&quot; seems to have been around for a while - perhaps it is not being given much priority as Wikipedia pages are never as long as a wikibook. Another alternative might be to make some new templates with fewer optional parameters, and use different templates for the optional information only where it appears in the original text.

== &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags ==

Tags like '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div id='french-lui-and-leur'&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' appear in some sections on some pages. Can anyone tell me what they are for? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 18:37, 29 March 2011 (UTC)

: They denote review and supplementary sections, to enable hiding. Some documentation is at {{tl|French/Section}}. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 21:39, 30 March 2011 (UTC)

:: Thanks but I don't completely understand, as elsewhere there is hidden text without using these tags. For example in [[French/Lessons/People_and_things|French/Lessons/People_and_things]] where the exercises appear to be hidden without using these tags on the lesson page. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 19:12, 31 March 2011 (UTC)

::: {{tl|French/Exercise}} uses &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class='collapsible'&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Title&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='body'&gt;Hidden body&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to hide its content. In the case of sections, the section's heading must hide a separate element (the section's content), so a unique &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is used to match the content with the heading. (In the case of tables, it's always the third, fourth, and sixth columns of any table that uses {{tl|French/Translations table}} that are hidden, so unique &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;s are unnecessary.) --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 00:52, 2 April 2011 (UTC)

== Growing beyond the book format ==

My name is Ian and I'm from a project called Wikiotics, where we build free software tools for language instruction. We are starting to build collections of interactive language lessons that can serve as textbook replacements for students and this wikibook is the most comprehensive resource we have seen. If there is anyone here who is interested in expanding this content beyond a traditional text-based book format or who would like to incorporate interactive lessons we build based on the outline of this book, just chime in here or contact us at contact AT wikiotics DOT org or in irc at #wikiotics on freenode. 

As example of the kind of new materials you can make with our tools, here are examples our current lesson types:
* Picture choice lesson (http://wikiotics.org/en/Introduction), 
* Re-mixable Podcast (http://wikiotics.org/user/ian/FSI-Mandarin-Module01-Unit01), 
* Text multiple choice lesson (http://wikiotics.org/en/WANY_Hospital_grammar) 
* new Storybook lesson [''coming soon''](http://laurent.dev.wikiotics.net/en/storybook1).

'''Rumaki''' is a pūpū (hors d'œuvre) of [[cookbook:Cuisine of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] origin. Its ingredients and method of preparation vary, but usually it consists of water chestnuts and pieces of chicken liver wrapped in bacon and marinated in soy sauce and either ginger or brown sugar.

(Yes, you can actually get away with serving liver to your guests.)

''The Rumaki recipe is a classic (1940s - 1960s, U.S.) party appetizer recipe, proving that anything wrapped in bacon tastes good — even chicken liver. But you can opt for scallops, shrimp or stuffed olives, instead.'' 

== Ingredients ==
 
===Rumaki===
*12 slices [[cookbook:bacon|bacon]], halved crosswise, or 8 slices, cut in thirds
*12 ounces (~350g) [[cookbook:chicken liver|chicken liver]]s, halved
*12 canned [[cookbook:water chestnuts|water chestnut]] slices, halved

===Marinade===
*¼ cup [[cookbook:soy sauce|soy sauce]]
*1 teaspoon fresh minced [[cookbook:ginger|ginger]]
*2 tablespoons dry [[cookbook:sherry|sherry]]
*1 teaspoon [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
#Rumaki begins with the marinade: Combine soy sauce, ginger, sherry and sugar in a small bowl. Add the chicken livers and water chestnut pieces and marinate them in the refrigerator for at least 1/2 hour. 
#Place 1 chicken liver piece and 1 chestnut piece in the center of each bacon piece, wrap, and secure with a toothpick.  
#Place the Rumaki on a [[cookbook:broiler pan|broiler pan]] or shallow [[cookbook:baking pan|baking pan]] and [[cookbook:broil|broil]], about 5 or 6 inches from the heat, until the bacon is crisp, about 10 to 15 minutes. Or, you may bake the appetizers in a 375 °F oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot. Makes 24 appetizers. 

==Notes, tips, and variations== 
*Add fresh sliced [[cookbook:scallion|scallion]]s to the combination above. 
*Substitute [[cookbook:Scallop|sea scallops]] for the chicken livers and/or water chestnuts. 
*Omit marinade and wrap bacon around [[Cookbook:Smoked Oysters|smoked oysters]], stuffed [[Cookbook:Olive|green olives]], or [[cookbook:pineapple|pineapple]] chunks. 
*[[cookbook:Shrimp Rumaki|Shrimp Rumaki]]: 1 medium shrimp with 1 whole water chestnut and a piece of green onion, with or without the marinade.
* Substitute 1 tsp organic honey for the sugar, or a small amount of pineapple marmalade.

The '''African Grey Parrot''' is a medium-sized parrot of the genus ''Psittacus'', native to Africa. As the name implies, they are predominantly grey, with accents of white.  Some of their feathers are very dark grey and others are a lighter grey colour.  They have red or maroon tails depending on the subspecies.  They feed primarily on nuts and fruits, supplemented by leafy matter. 

==Subspecies==
There are two subspecies:
* Congo African Grey parrot, ''Psittacus erithacus erithacus'' - these are larger birds (about 12 inches/30cm long) with light grey feathers, deep red tails and black beaks. 
* Timneh African Grey parrot, ''Psittacus erithacus timneh'' - these are smaller in size, have a darker charcoal gray coloring, a darker maroon tail, and a light, horn colored upper mandible.
Some avian enthusiasts (incorrectly) recognize a third subspecies, Ghana African Grey (''Psittacus erithacus princeps''). This bird is described to be similar to the Congo African greys, but darker and slightly smaller; however, scientifically this subspecies has not been found. Among breeders, there is said to be a fourth subspecies, the Cameroon African Grey, most often referred to as ''the big silvers''.

==Mimicry and intelligence==
thumb|left|Congo African Grey Parrot
While comparative judgements of animal intelligence are always very difficult to make objectively, Psittaciformes are generally regarded as being the most intelligent of birds.  African grey parrots are particularly noted for their cognitive abilities, which are believed to have evolved as a consequence of their history of cooperative feeding on the ground in central Africa. 

Irene Pepperberg's extensively published research with captive African greys, including Alex,  has shown that these parrots are capable of associating human words with their meanings, at least to some extent. Ambitious claims of language use have also been made for another African grey N'kisi, who has a vocabulary of over a thousand words and speaks in sentences. However, there is little doubt that Greys and other parrots (especially macaws and cockatoos), along with corvines (Crows, Ravens, and Jays), are highly intelligent in comparison with other birds.

==African Grey Parrots as Pets==
The history of African Grey parrots kept as pets dates back over 4,000 years.  Some Egyptian hieroglyphics clearly depict pet parrots. The ancient Greeks also valued parrots as pets, and this custom was later adopted by the  Wealthy Roman families often kept parrots in ornate cages, and parrots were prized for their ability to talk.  King Henry VIII of England also had an African Grey parrot.  The Portuguese sailors kept them as companions on their long sea voyages.

Today, many African Grey parrots are hand reared by breeders for the pet trade and they make wonderful and very affectionate companion parrots; however, because they can  be unpredictable at times, they may not be compatible with small children.  African Grey parrots are very strong and they can bite with their strong pointed beak and scratch with their claws.  African Grey parrots have a high intelligence and they are generally thought to be the best mimics of all parrots.  Pet owners often refer to their relationship with their hand reared pet African Greys as being &quot;like having a five-year-old child&quot;.  On the other hand, wild-caught African Grey parrots captured from the wild need time and effort to adapt to human presence, and have a tendency to growl and bite when they are approached.  The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) has made the sale of all wild caught parrot species illegal.

African Grey parrots, like any pet parrot, can require a large commitment as they require a lot of attention.  While numbers vary with each source, most agree that three hours out of cage daily and 45 minutes of physical interaction is the minimum attention required for good mental health. African Greys – particularly Congo African Greys – are known to be shy amongst strangers. African Greys have the tendency to bond to only one person if they do not interact with different people regularly. While inter-species friendships with other parrots are uncommon with African Greys, they require socialization with other parrots of any species.

African Greys require a lot of stimulating toys due to their high intelligence and to avoid boredom. Three to five toys at a time are typically enough to satisfy African Greys, but too many toys can crowd the cage. Toys should be rotated and switched regularly to keep the stimulation constant and diverse. For an African Grey spending most of its day in the cage, 36&quot;W x 24&quot;D is a good cage size. The height of a cage is typically not important, except in the case of playtop cages that are taller than the owner, in which case the bird can become territorial. An African Grey who spends most of its time on a playstand and uses the cage solely for sleeping only needs a cage large enough so that the bird's wingspan doesn't touch the cage's sides and its head and tail do not touch the cage's top and bottom respectively. The bar-spacing should from be ¾ inch to 1 inch. A companion African Grey should be kept in a bird-safe environment and placed in a busy part of the home, such as the living room, where the bird can occupy himself (or herself) in watching the household activities.

African Greys have special dietary requirements and should be fed with calcium and Vitamin A rich foods such as leafy greens like mustard greens, broccoli etc., almonds or little amount of cheese.  It is usual to give African grey parrots carefully calculated quantities of calcium and vitamin supplements.  An excess of these added vitamins and minerals in an African Grey’s diet can lead to health problems.  Only a few feathers should be clipped from the wings of an African Grey since they are heavy birds.  Clipping too many feathers can severely impair flight and may lead to injuries as they may have a tendency to crash to the ground.  If very young birds are wing clipped they may never gain full coordination and agility in flight.  African Grey parrots' lifespans are upto about 50 years (or more) in captivity.

Can anyone provide an authority for the claim that these parrots can imitate up to 5000 words?  [[User:Seglea|seglea]] 22:47, 30 May 2005 (UTC)i can mine sang eminem moking bird

It's vague. See [[Irene Pepperberg]]'s reasearch on [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]] for more info. But they're certainly very inteligent and they can asociate words to objects (I think that's more important than a big number of words)


I cannot understand why [[Mikkalai]] removed my edit: 
&quot;Greys captured in the wild need time and effort to adapt to human presence, and have a tendency to growl. Hand-fed Greys generally make wonderful and very affectionate companions.''
[[User:Rastapopoulos|Rastapopoulos]] 07:03, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
:Sorry. Restored. I cannot understand this myself. I looked into the history of my edits at this time period. I was tracking anon vandals from my watch list. Since wikipedia is a bit slowish, I usually open several windows for version comparisons. When this article was checked for suspect's contribs I most probably accidentally hit the &quot;revert&quot; button. I have absolutely no opinion about parrots and never edited pages about them. Sorry again. I will try harder to be more careful. [[user:mikkalai|mikka]] [[user talk:mikkalai|(t)]] 07:19, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

Africal parrots need a special diet and need calcium suplements.

== External links ==

I have removed two links ([http://birds.peachyga.com/congo_african_grey.html Information about Timneh African Greys] and [http://birds.peachyga.com/timneh_african_grey.html Information about Congo African Greys]) which are local sales page with some additional information. The info is limited, and the main thing is to contact people for buying or selling birds. I think they are unappropriate as links for an encyclopedia article, see [[WP:EL]]. [[User:KimvdLinde|KimvdLinde]] 20:15, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

== CHECK OUT THE &quot;AFRICAN GREYS AS PETS&quot; SECTION ==

Hey I recently restored the &quot;African Grey Parrots as Pets&quot; section of this article. Can anyone skilled in grammar and vocabulary check if the section's content contains any mistakes and enhance the section. By the way PLZ DON'T REMOVE THE INFORMATION ALREADY THERE. IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO GET THOSE AND THEY ARE FROM VERIFIABLE SOURCES. [[User:Birdeditor|Birdeditor]] 21:31, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
:I'm unable to check your references for that section. Could you provide references from reputable online sources. Oh and PLEASE DON'T SHOUT, it's rude. --[[User:Dv82matt|Dv82matt]] 00:38, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
:Take it easy birdeditor. If they are reliable and verifiable sources, it is not likely that they will be removed, unless it reads like a howto guide to Greys, in that case, it is unencyclopedic. -- [[User:KimvdLinde|Kim van der Linde]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:KimvdLinde|at venus]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;African Grey Parrots as Pets&quot; - &quot;verifiable&quot; sources ==

Most of the information available in that section is taken from www.itsagreysworld.com, that site itself is owned by an experienced owner of multiple African Greys all of whom receive great individual attention according to the site. The site is contains some useful and genuine information and is very informative. The few remaining other sources are miscellaneous, and the information left by the contributor before me is not deleted. [[User:Birdeditor|Birdeditor]] 21:07, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

== External links ==

I am again removing an external link that has ads, which makes it commercial. Forums, blogs, and bulletin boards are not good Wikipedia links either. Any domain that is added to multiple pages is spam. And the animal telepathy site is not encyclopedic. 

Wikipedia is not a link farm. DO NOT RE-ADD YOUR SITE. If your page is so noteworthy that it should be an exception to the spam and linkfarm policies, find a couple admins to review your site. Then one of them can add it back with an invisible note that it was added after review by an administrator. If I see that, I will leave it, although I can't speak for all the Wikipedia Project Spam editors ([[WP:WPSPAM]]). But it would probably be better to add content to the page rather than links. [[User:Pollinator|Pollinator]] 16:37, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

== Aging ==

I'd like to see a couple references to again, but I don't feel I have enough experience to do a major edit to an article such as this. Namely, I'm referring to the differences in appearance as CAG and TAG parrots age. After the first molt (around 12 months), tailfeathers grow back without black tips, but rather fully red. The iris slowly lightens from pure-black at hatch to bight yellow around 18 months. Also, vocalization in the form of human speech minicry typically develops around 12-18 months of age. Anybody feel up to it? [[User:Thadius856|Thadius856]] 18:46, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

== I'd like to know... ==

Would it be acceptable to play around with the idea of splitting this article up into more topics?

It seems '''&quot;African Greys as Pets&quot;''' is kind of a vague spectrum. In this portion of the article it covers history to care. I don't find it very organized at all.

I think perhaps it would be more appropriate if we seperated the article into a few different topics such as &quot;Care and Grooming&quot; (Or something like that) &quot;Habits and Lifestyle&quot; (You see what I'm getting at?)

I'm not saying any of the information should be dumped, but just seperated in a more organized way.

Anyone with me on this?

-Also, I may have pictures of baby CAGs if you think there is a place for them. 

Best Regards [[User:Le Peregrine|Le Peregrine]] 21:27, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

::No problem. I think we should keep the article in one piece, like I noted on your talk page, but the &quot;African Greys as Pets&quot; section ''should'' be seperated into subsections. I have tons of pictures as well, but lets worry about that for when we have a long enough article to fit a couple more pictures.

[[Image:Showing wing.JPG|thumb|right|Fischer's Lovebird spreading its wing]]

The '''Fischer's lovebird''' (''Agapornis fischeri'', synonym ''Agapornis personata fischeri'') is a species of bird in the parrot family. They are native to a small area of east-central Africa, south and southeast of Lake Victoria in northern Tanzania. In drought years, some birds move west into Rwanda and Burundi seeking moister conditions. They were originally discovered in the late 1800's, and were first bred in the United States in 1926. They are named after German explorer Gustav Fischer.

Fischer's lovebirds have green backs, chests, and wings, their necks are a golden yellow and as it progresses upward it becomes darker orange. The top of the head is olive green, and the beak is bright red. The upper surface of the tail has some purple or blue feathers. ''A. fischeri'' has a white circle around its eyes. Young birds are very similar to the adults, except for the fact that they are duller and the base of their mandible has brown markings. They are one of the smaller lovebirds, about 14-15 cm in length and 42-58 g weight.

==Life in the wild==
''A. fischeri'' lives at elevations of 1,100-2,200 m in small flocks. They have a fast, straight flight, and the sound of their wings as they fly can be heard. They live in isolated clumps of trees with grass plains between them. They also have a high-pitched chirp, and are very noisy. These birds eat a wide variety of foods, including seeds and fruit. They sometimes are pests to farmers, as they eat their crops, such as maize and millet. The breeding season is January through April and June through July. The nest is in a hole in a tree, often an old woodpecker hole, 2-15 m above the ground; the 3-8 eggs are incubated for 23 days, and the chicks fledge in 38 days. The population is estimated to be between 290,000-1,000,000, with low densities outside of protected areas due to capture for the pet trade; export licenses were suspended in 1992 to halt any further decline in the species.

==Captivity==
Like with any other pet, it is essential that one make sure the birds that one is about to buy were bred in captivity, and were not wild caught. Besides conservational and ethical reasons, wild caught animals are more likely to get sick, depressed, and to die. 

Both sexes of ''Agapornis fischeri'' look the same. The only way to be sure what sex a certain bird is, without them laying eggs, would be to perform DNA tests (a competent avian veterinarian could do this with a drop of blood, or a kit can be ordered from an online source for a fee).  Pelvic bone testing and surgical testing are '''not''' recommended.

[[Image:Blue mutant in flight.JPG|thumb|right|Blue mutant in flight]]

===Color mutations===
The blue mutation is the main color mutation of this species, and is somewhat smaller than the wild bird. It has bright blue back, tail, and chest, with a white neck and a pale grey head, and a pale pink beak. This mutation was first bred by R. Horsham in South Africa in 1957, and two years later it was bred by Dr. F. Warford in San Francisco, California.

There is a yellow mutation, which first appeared in France. It is pale yellow with an orange face and a red beak. 

Lutino (a mutation that is yellow in colour), pied, black or dark eyed white, cinnamon, white, and albino mutations have also been bred.  

===Housing===
[[Image:Wet Lovebird.JPG|thumb|left|After a bath, they also like to sun themselves]]
Fischer's lovebirds are very active and require a roomy cage. They also require lots of toys and things to chew on and play with. Without a roomy cage (a '''minimum''' of 20x20x30 for one bird, 25x25x30 for a pair.  Do not buy a round cage either, as they do not properly give a lovebird a corner to hide in when they feel insecure), as well as many toys (4-6) and things to play with, they may get bored, depressed and may even go as far as feather-plucking, which can be hard to stop. It is also a good idea to provide a bird bath tub, as they love to take baths almost every day. After taking a shower, many times they like to sun themselves in order to dry off. However, they should not be near any windows, or they may become sick. 
[[Image:Kissing Lovebirds.JPG|thumb|right|Two lovebirds kissing]]
Lovebirds are extremely social birds, and it is generally recommended that they be kept in pairs (unless the owner is willing to spend several hours of time entertaining and being the companion of their single lovebird), for their emotional as well as physical well-being.

===Food===
Providing Fischer's lovebirds them a varied diet, such as pellets, fruits, seeds, grains, sprouts, and vegetables would be a good idea. As a regular food, pellets (One should avoid artificial coloring and pellets that contain the preservatives ethoxyquin and BHT/BAT, as they are toxic) are recommended as the millet food generally sold in pet stores is akin to junkfood, as it has too much fat and is not very nutritionally balanced. While lovebirds like this kind of food, it may decrease their life span. Pellets especially made for small birds such as lovebirds are a good way to give them a well balanced diet. Lovebirds generally particularly like grains and different kinds of wild rice, although it is recommended that other, healthier foods be mixed in with the grains to ensure that they get the vitamins they need.

An all-seed diet (or really a diet that only consists of one thing) is not sufficient and may lead to health problems, including fatty liver disease.

===Personality===
[[Image:Lovebird_Chewing_Stick.JPG|thumb|left|Lovebirds are very active and love to chew things]]
Each lovebird has their own individual personality, but some generalizations can be made. At first, they are very timid and will get spooked by sudden movements, loud noises, or new things, even small ones. One should be very careful not to scare them too much, which can interfere with their taming. They generally do not like to be touched. Lovebirds are very smart, and may even figure out how to open the door of their cage and get out. Adding to their intelligence, once they are tame and comfortable, they are very curious. If they are allowed outside their cage, one should take great care to safeguard the house by not letting them fly around the kitchen with the stove on, around any wires, around places where they could get stuck, such as behind the refrigerator, etc. A house can be a very dangerous place for lovebirds. 

They also like to be clean, often preening their feathers and regularly taking baths. If let outside their cage, they may even fly to other places in order to defecate. Newspaper should be placed below their favorite areas for easy cleanup.

===Taming===
Buying hand fed Fischer's lovebirds can be quite expensive, but if one wants pets to interact with, it is recommended. Because they are very timid at first, great patience is required to tame non hand fed lovebirds. Taming them enough to climb on your finger (which they don't like very much) or to get them to fly to your shoulder (which they prefer) can take years.

Lovebirds (in general) are not known for their talking ability, although there are some lovebirds that do learn words - the females are usually the ones that do this.

===Potential problems===
[[Image:Fischer's lovebird.JPG|thumb|right|Lovebirds are very active.]] 
Lovebirds are very vocal birds, making loud, high-pitched noises that can be a nuisance. They make noise all day, but especially at certain times of day. 

As stated above, lovebirds are also '''very''' active, and love to chew things. When they are let out of their cage, it would be wise to watch them carefully, and protect any furniture or anything they could possibly chew on.

Fischer's lovebirds, like many captive birds, can also suffer from feather-plucking if they get bored, or stressed. To prevent this, the lovebirds should be provided with many things to play with and chew on. They should have a roomy cage, and should be shown affection if they enjoy it. After feather-plucking starts, it is very hard to stop the habit. Providing them with the things mentioned above and giving them time will often reduce or stop the habit. 

Lovebirds are notorious for being nesty birds, especially during mating season - for this reason, loose material such as shredded paper, fabric, etc. are not good things to give to your lovebird because they could see it as nest-making material and attempt to mate, which is not something that should be attempted by someone without lots of experience.  &quot;Huts&quot;, or hiding places and small enclosures that people often give their pet birds, are also not good for the same reason.

Fischer's lovebirds are prone to a mysterious disease characterized by having brownish to creamish patches in their feet and legs, which is probably an infection as a result of their obsessive biting of those areas. It is not known what causes this disease. One hypotheses is that they suffer from hormonal problems caused by changing light levels and the inability to perform things Fischer's lovebirds in the wild would naturally perform, such as building a nest. Another hypothesis is that it is caused by a pathogen. If the signs are detected, fischer's lovebirds should immediately be taken to the vet. Treatments usually involve antibiotics for the wounds, and some way to stop them from continuing the biting of the area. This can sometimes be accomplished with sedatives. Use of the Elizabeth collar should be an option of last resort, as wearing them is extremely stressful both to the bird wearing the collar and to the birds around it. Some lovebirds may start feather-plucking as a result of the stress.

Lovebirds are also known to be nippy and bossy. Although this can be seen as amusing and endearing by many owners, some do not like it; a lovebird, while a nice pet, is not for everyone. They bite very hard and love to test their limits - if the owner does not set them early on, he or she will have a bird that bites to get their way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Nile monitor (''Varanus niloticus'') is a large member of the monitor lizard family (Varanidae). They can grow to about 6 feet in length and have muscular bodies, strong legs and powerful jaws full of sharp teeth.  They also possess sharp claws used for climbing, digging, defense, or tearing at their prey. Like all monitors they have a forked tongue, which facilitates their sense of smell.

Nile monitors live in Africa and are found near their namesake, the Nile. Their nostrils are placed high on the snout, indicating that these animals are highly aquatic, but are also excellent climbers and quick runners on land. Nile monitors feed on fish, frogs, eggs, birds, small mammals, large insects, and carrion. 

==As Pets==

Nile monitors make great pets for the EXPERIENCED OWNER and are not recommended as beginner pets.

Nile monitors will require a very large cage that is twice as long as the lizard. A 6 foot monitor would require a 12x6x6, with three feet of dirt. the same ration should be used for their entire life. A 3 foot monitor would need a 6x3x3,woth 1.5 feet of dirt. Due to their large size, adults will require custom built quarters. Dirt is the best substrate, and the only substrate that should be used. Landscape with rocks, driftwood, or hollow logs. A water dish large enough for the lizard to soak in should be used. Nile monitors have a tendency to defecate in the water dish so clean it whenever soiled or at least daily.

Nile monitors should have a daytime temperature gradient of 80-90° F (27-32° C) and a nighttime temperature of 78-80° F (26-27° C). A basking spot of 140 F should be provided at least 12 hours a day.  A thermometer should be used to verify the temperature. The humidity should be moderate. 

This species is extremely hardy in captivity when properly maintained. Wild caught animals should be checked for internal parasites. The Nile monitor has a very aggressive temperament with a powerful bite and a lashing tail. It is a myth that monitors cannot be tamed. With care and especially if raised from a hatchling nile monitors can be successfully tamed. Do not expect overnight results, taming can take several years. Constant handling aides in the process of taming.

A '''lovebird''' (genus ''Agapornis'', Greek for &quot;lovebird&quot;) is a very social and affectionate parrot.

The name &quot;lovebird&quot; stems from these birds' affectionate nature. Lovebirds form very close bonds with their mates, usually lasting a lifetime. This is reflected by the lovebird's name in other languages: in German, &quot;die Unzertrennlichen,&quot; and in French &quot;les inséparables&quot;- &quot;inseparables.&quot; For this reason, many people feel strongly that lovebirds in captivity should be kept only in pairs. Others believe that lovebirds, like other parrots, are social animals who can bond with human companions when given a great deal of care and attention. 

Lovebirds are about 13-17 cm in size, 40-60 grams in weight and characterized by a small, stocky build and a short, cute, blunt tail. This puts them among the smallest parrots in the world although their beak is rather large for their overall size. Many lovebirds are green, although color mutations can feature many different colors. Some lovebird species, like Fischer's, black cheeked, and the yellow collared lovebird, have a white ring around the eye. Lifespan is 10 to 15 years. 


==Species and habits==
frame|right|Phylogeny of the genus ''Agapornis'' based on existing molecular evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, Jessica R. (1998): Evolution of nest-building behavior in ''Agapornis'' parrots. ''The Auk'' '''115'''(2):455-464.&lt;/ref&gt; The species with the red line is currently unplaced in the phylogeny, but does belong to this genus.
Eight of the different species come from the mainland of Africa. The ninth species, ''Agapornis canus'', originates from Madagascar. In the wild the different species are separated geographically. Lovebirds live in small flocks and eat mainly fruit, vegetables, some grasses and seed. Black-winged lovebirds also enjoy figs.

Only some of the lovebird species are sexually dimorphic. This includes the Abyssinian lovebird, the Madagascar lovebird, and the black-collared lovebird. 

There are a total of 9 different species:
*Peach-faced Lovebird, ''Agapornis roseicollis''
*Masked Lovebird, ''Agapornis personata''
*Fischer's Lovebird, ''Agapornis fischeri''
*Nyasa Lovebird, ''Agapornis lilianae''
*Black-cheeked Lovebird, ''Agapornis nigrigeni''
*Madagascar Lovebird, ''Agapornis canus''
*Abyssinian Lovebird, ''Agapornis taranta''
*Red-faced Lovebird, ''Agapornis pullarius''
*Black-collared Lovebird, ''Agapornis swinderniana''

==Agapornis as pets==
Like with any other pet, it is essential that one make sure the birds that one is about to buy were bred in captivity, and not wild caught. Besides conservational and ethical reasons, wild caught animals are more likely to get sick and to die. Lovebirds, especially when kept individually or brought up hand-fed, make very good pets. Lovebirds can be very interactive with humans, and when comfortable around humans, will willingly perch on human’s fingers and shoulders. Lovebirds rarely talk, but there is a chance they may learn to mimic human speech if taught to at a young age.

thumb|250px|right|A lovebird perched on a finger

===Housing===
Lovebirds are very active and require an appropriately sized cage. They require lots of toys and things to chew on and play with. Lovebirds are extremely social birds, and there is debate on whether they should be kept individually. However, the consensus seems to be that they need social interaction, be it with conspecifics or human companion, for their emotional as well as physical well-being. Without this interaction, daily exercise, a roomy cage, and many toys to play with, they may resort to feather-plucking or other behavioral problems. They love to take baths almost every day and may sun themselves after bathing in order to dry

===Food===
Lovebirds require a variety of food, such as pellets, fruits, seeds, and vegetables. As a regular food, pellets are recommended, as the millet food generally sold in pet stores has too much fat in it and is not very balanced. Pellets specially made for birds provide a well-balanced diet. Fresh greens, such as spinach, are also extremely beneficial if not essential. (See Leaf vegetables).

thumb|250px|right|Family of four lovebirds

===Potential problems===
Lovebirds are very vocal birds, making loud, high-pitched noises that can be a nuisance. They make noise all day, but especially during the first morning hours.

As stated above, lovebirds are also very active, and love to chew things. When they are let out of their cage, it would be wise to watch them carefully, and protect any furniture, electrical wiring or anything else that they could possibly chew on.

--[[User:Fennec|Fennec]] 18:43, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)



Yeah.  But of course, cute bird is a bit of a redundancy.
I love parrots.
I have a pair of peach-faces myself. Well not a pair exactly, one's a widower, the other an adopted spinster, and they don't get along at all, still, I have two of them.
You might want to be careful about the feather-plucked one.  We lost Perch's mate because he plucked her and even when we put a heat blanket and a towel arond their cage she froze to death.

[[Image:Agapornis_roseicollis.jpg|thumb|You almost can see her ponder about that odd camera you're holding, slightly squinting...]]



I visited this page because tonight I was reminded of a peachfaced that unfortunately passed away a year ago - although she reached the respectable age of 13. I've decided not to have pets anymore because I don't think animals are supposed to be kept or caged, but to her I was quite attached.

Curious bird, always eyeing you and the thing you're occupied with at that moment - be it a book, a laptop, your digital camera or the TV's remote for that matter. 

Cheeky, too. Anything that's paper is at risk of being reduced to strips because she's got a beak that's got to be put to use and so she shall, and she won't hesitate to land on the top of the magazine you're reading (and be her noisy self) if that gets you to pay attention to her.

And affectionate. For all the pirate cliches that there are (hehe) she still loved to sit on my shoulder and unintentionally deafen me with her cries.


I quite miss her.

My lovebird does this vomiting ritual every time I scratch him.  I guess he's attracted to my finger...




I went to a relative's house when they were not home and they had a caged lovebird, which I did not know anything about. I started to stick my fingers in the cage and he would (affectionately?) nibble on the fingernails. Unfortunately, I kept doing it, and after a day or so of on-and-off torture the bird would attack my fingers on sight, even drawing blood on one occasion :)

Then when I realized it could be let out, I had a bit of trouble because it was perfectly friendly with roosting on my shoulder, climbing under my shirt and popping its head out as if it were under a blanket, trying to clean my teeth, nibbling on my earlobes for some reason, etc. But if I stuck out my hand, trying to get it to stand on my hand, it would simply attack and bite it.

While I have been typing this (everything up to this point has been recounting previous experiences with the bird), it has been biting my ear a lot. It climbed down my left arm and tried two bite two little moles on my arm. It got to my left hand, started biting the keys on the keyboard, then attacked my right hand, drawing blood again (and if it makes its way down my right arm to my right hand, it will attack my left hand). Also, sometime when it was on my left arm, it stuck its butt off the edge and pooped onto my knee, which I did not realize until I scratched that knee and felt something there.

As it is so mean to my fingers, it was hard to get it back into its cage, but I just now managed to do it, being fed up with its antics. It's a fun bird and I was laughing most of the time, but I'll wait until my relatives (the owners of the bird) get home tonight and I can watch them play with it. This is [[User:Sajt|Sajt]] reporting live.

Hi. I have a black masked lovebird and he is a sweet bird.  He can be a bit of a rascal sometimes but I think that only makes him more hilarious.  When I get home from work he crawls down into my shirt and preens me while I do my chores.

hi i have one of these,he's kinda irritating when im on the computer.[[user:spat10|spat10]]

== egg ==

Our lovebird recently laid an egg although its partner died over 6 months ago.
Im wondering how long does the &quot;pregnancy&quot; or how long does the egg sit in the belly before being laid? are all eggs a bird? could it just be an unfurtle egg?
:It's an infertile egg. An egg is produced in less than a day, think about birds laying a nest of eggs. -- [[User:KimvdLinde|Kim van der Linde]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:KimvdLinde|at venus]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:21, 22 May 2006 (UTC)



== More Solid Info ==

This reads like a care guide on lovebirds rather than an encyclopedic entry. See [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]] under the section ''Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information''. I think that the section on ''Agapornis'' in the wild is too small to be useful, it is missing info on range, conservation status, ect. 

Also, the section on diet is very POV, not everyone feeds pellets.

== Possible omnivore? ==

Just a question. My love bird Tico attacked and ate a brown anole that wandered into my room through the crack under the door when he was on my shoulder. He eyed it for a couple of seconds and then came down upon it like a hawk and literally caught it with his nails I've been putting off to cut, and with it squirming he started pecking at it and eating it. Tico was pulling off strips off meat, ignoring the distraction of the flopping tail that apperantly was the lizard's last hope, and when he was done with it (when I intervened) it was missing three legs, the right side of its chest, and some of its abdomin. And its tail. Picking up the mess was sick enough and I regret not taking pictures, but are love birds supposed to do that? [[User:ACfan|Ace Combat Fanatic]] 00:54, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

I tried to clean up the history section a bit. I thought that some of the language and sentence structure was a little to advanced for children. &quot;Emigrated to the diaspora&quot; seemed a little too advanced for 12 year olds. I didn't object to the content but I couldn't figure out a way to make it more straight forward for children.[[User:Rmawhorter|Rmawhorter]] ([[User talk:Rmawhorter|talk]]) 00:33, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

The '''Rosy-faced Lovebird''' (''Agapornis roseicollis''), also known as the '''Peach-faced Lovebird''', is a species of lovebird native to arid regions in southwestern Africa such as the Namib Desert.  A loud and constant chirper, these birds are very social animals and often congregate in small groups in the wild.  They eat throughout the day and take frequent baths.  Coloration can vary widely among populations but females are generally darker and greener, whilst males are smaller and brighter.  Lovebirds are renowned for their sleep position in which they sit side-by-side and turn their faces in towards each other.  Also, females are well noted to tear raw materials into long strips, &quot;twisty-tie&quot; them onto their backs, and fly distances back to make a nest.

==Native Habitat and Distribution==

==Peach-faced Lovebirds as Pets==

===Housing===
Lovebirds, being an active bunch, need some room to move in their cage. A cage approximately 
24&quot; W x 14&quot; D x 30&quot; H is a good size, but if you can afford it, the bigger the better. Make sure the bars are spaced no wider than 3/8&quot; apart, otherwise your bird will be able to stick its head through the bars. Add a variety of perches, so your lovebird can excerise its feet to prevent arthritis. The perches should be at least 4&quot; long and 1/2&quot; in diameter. Also, a variety of different toys should be placed in the cage to prevent your bird from boredom and loneliness. Do not get your lovebird parakeet toys, because they can tear them apart easily. Try getting cockatiel toys that are more durable. Do not get toys with small bells, because your lovebird can get them stuck in its throat. Also, please, PLEASE don't put the food and water dishes under the perches, because droppings will contaminate them.

===Feeding===
Peachfaced lovebirds thrive when fed the proper diet.  They should be fed a wide variety of active food, including vegetables, whole grains, and fruits. They are not to be fed dairy products, like chocolate and cheese. Carrots, beans, squash, and corn are excellent foods that provide healthy proteins.  Grains should include millet, quinoa, winterwheat, and others.  Except strawberries (which contain trace amounts of carcinogenic pesticides) feed lovebirds a rare treat of fresh fruit.  Many are attuned to the taste of grapes.  These birds also eat various seeds, pellets, and pastas.  While seeds and pellets are easy to give to birds, they are not part of their natural diet and should be used in conjunction with vegetables.  Good seed and pellet mixes include a large array of different seed types.  Be sure to change any perishable food within a few hours of placing it in their housing or at the maximum within one day.

===Breeding===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Spam/External links user warning ==

Not sure if this is the correct place for this - there seem to be few talk pages in use in the templates generally.  Hopefully someone will notice and put me right if it isn't.

I noticed yesterday that someone had marked a page for speedy del because of blog spam and I've just marked another page with the same content and taken a link out of a template too.  I took a look at the user warning message to see if it was worth placing it.  However the current warning is very specifically directed to commercial links and I was wondering if the changing nature of the internet and links meant this should be reviewed?

A short while ago Wikipedia's equivalent was reviewed and changed due to this sort of thinking and currently reads

''&quot;Please do not add inappropriate external links to Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a mere directory of links nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Inappropriate links include (but are not limited to) links to personal web sites, links to web sites that you are affiliated with, and links that exist to attract visitors to a web site or promote a product. See the external links guideline and spam policies for further explanations of links that are considered appropriate. If you feel the link should be added to the article, then please discuss it on the article's talk page rather than re-adding it. See the welcome page to learn more about Wikipedia. Thank you.&quot;''

Given this is Wiki'''books''' and the books are supposed to be &quot;all you need&quot; ''generally'' external links would seem inappropriate to me.  However others may well not agree but I have a feeling that this discussion probably will take place soon if not now.  Equally the other templates in this series may need review?  If it is appropriate/necessary I can open sub pages for the discussion for clarity or moved the dicussion to individual talk pages for the templates?  --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:15, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

'''Cattle judging''' is the process of judging a series of cattle and pronouncing a first, second and third place animal based on each animals qualities. Most cattle judging occurs in show rings at agricultural shows.
When judging cattle, it is ultimately about deciding which cow is worth the most profit. When judging cattle, the judge wants to act like he or she is buying the cow- therefore, which cow would be of most value?
There are a lot of fine points of cattle judging. In a beef cow, for example, it is desirable to have a large animal, and lots of muscle development. In a dairy cow, however, the judge, or buyer, depending on the circumstances, will be looking for characteristics that would help to produce the best possible milk. When judging cattle, there is an overjudge, and that judge will look at all of the cattle and put them in order of ‘best’ cow to ‘worst’ cow.

== Origins ==
Cattle Judging has been around for many thousands of years. Although in modern times the judging of cattle usually occurs in a show ring, in both the past and present it is also a guide to purchasing animals. When purchasing a cow, the buyer will be judging the cow just like a judge would in a show ring. The buyer must decide which cow is worth the most- the cow that can contribute the most to the beef or dairy industry.

== Beef Cattle ==

When judging cattle, the judge is looking for-
A good head carriage- how the head is held on the cow. This also has a lot to do with the neck on the cow- the neck should be broad, sit evenly on the shoulders, and the base must be in line with the spine.
A long body is also desirable to the judge, as this means that the cow will hold much more meat than a cow with a shorter body.
The cow must also have strong, sturdy legs that show no signs of cow-hock, bow-leg, or sickle-hock. If the cow has any of these structural problems, there could be a risk of permanent lameness. They must also be well muscled, and everything must be as large as possible, but all limbs must still remain in proportion to the size of the body.
The cow should also have as much muscle as possible- this maximizes profits to the farmer. However, as a beef cow is much heavier than a diary cow and puts much more weight on the hooves, it is very important that there are no signs of irregular wearing of hooves, as this may be a sign of structural problems in the leg.

== Judging- beef cattle ==
When judging cattle, the judge has a system. Usually, this system starts at the head and goes all the way through to the tail, looking at finer points along the way. Sometimes at agricultural shows there are junior judging competitions. These competitions are created solely for the purpose of giving youth a chance to judge in a competition. The competitors then can go on to talk to the overjudge of the event about why they placed these cows in the order they did. When the competitors are judging, the overjudge is judging them, and the competitors get points on the systems they use in the ring. These systems are usually the system an overjudge uses when they are judging beef cattle.

==== The Head ====
On cows, the judge can't usually check their teeth without using a head brace, as cattle are sensitive around the mouth area. When checking their teeth, the teeth must sit evenly- if the cow has overshot or undershot teeth (much like an overbite or an underbite) then this could cause problems for the cow later. These may include soreness in the mouth, and the cow will not be able to eat as well, and will therefore not be as muscled.

Since the teeth in a cow can't be checked, the judge must look for other symptoms in the jaw. The judge usually goes through the following system:
* They check that the muzzle is as broad as possible, but still in proportion.
* They then stand a bit further back and look at the entire head. The judge is looking for proportion in the head and whether it 'matches' the rest of the body.

When looking at the head of a cow, most judges will agree it is not necessary to look at the ears. Some breeds may have big ears, some may have small ears, but that will have no effect on the meat produced by the cow.

When looking at the head, there are a few key things that the judges are looking for. One of the main things the judge looks for when judging any animal is the structure. In most animals, if one joint is set incorrectly, there is a good chance that others are also set incorrectly. The judges must check that the head is in proportion to the rest of the body. It should also be held naturally high- if the head is set naturally below the shoulders of the cow, there is a likely chance that there is something structurally incorrect there, and also there may be some other structure faults throughout the rest of the body. However, the head shouldn't be held too high- this can suggest some aggressive and bold nature in the cow. However, this will also have no effect on the quality of meat produced, and in most competitions it would not matter if a cow was more active than other cows, provided that it wasn't causing harm to other people and their livestock. If the cow is causing excessive damage, the judge will have to ask for that cow to leave the ring, and the cow would be promptly disqualified from the event.

=== Topline ===
The term 'topline' refers to the back of the cow being judged in the showring. On a cow, it should be straight, however, the cow is not a board, and should therefore have a slight bend in the back, as well as having a relaxed back.
As a bull gets older, he develops a hump on his neck. This is a normal characteristic of bulls from all breeds, and it is only worrying to the judge if the hump, or crest, is ''not'' there. When the bull is young, the crest will not be as noticeable, but as he gets older, it will become a lot more obvious.
With some breeds, such as the Brahman, the hump will be above the shoulder. Once again, breed characteristics are important aspects of judging, and the judge hired for the event will have a lot of knowledge on the breed characteristics of that breed he or she is judging, and usually the judges specialize in only a few breeds because of this reason.
The shoulder blades on a cow should be neat- they should be the same on either side of the back, and they shouldn't stick out too much- on a beef cow, this area should have some muscle. The shoulder blades should also be set in line with the spine- if they are not, the cow could be structurally incorrect. As with the shoulder blades, all joints in the back should be level with the spine, from the shoulder blades to the hip and the pins of the cow. However, some cows' pins do sit slightly lower than the spine. This is acceptable, but it is undesirable for any of the joints to drop off from the spine too much. If joints are set too low from the spine, this will affect the angle of the spine, as well as the angle of the ribs and pelvis, and may cause the animal to walk with a slight waddle. This is not desirable in a beef cow. This can also cause problems with the legs, which means that the hooves do not wear evenly on the ground. This can cause permanent lameness and other conditions at some point in the animal's life.

=== The Legs ===
When looking at the legs in an animal, the judge is looking mainly at the structure, and for some muscle. As mentioned before, when one joint is set incorrectly on an animal, there is a high chance that the other joints will be set incorrectly as well.
When looking at the legs, the cow should be standing squarely on the hooves. This means that the cow will have to also stand squarely on the leg- therefore, the leg must have some bend in it. If the bend is too much, this is referred to as having too much angle in the leg. If the cow's leg is straight, this means that it is post-legged. The cow must have some bend in the hock, however, but not too much. If the cow has too much or too little bend in the legs, the bones in the shoulder blade will be set at either too sharp or too flat of an angle. The bones in the shoulder meet together in an L shape, tilted to the right. We want this angle to be about roughly 90 degrees.

The legs on a cow should be long and well muscled. In is inadvisable to have short, but heavily muscled cattle, as it is preferable for the cow to be larger, have a lot of muscle, but also have some fat. The fat, however, must be minimal- the cow should have some fat, but not a lot.

Looking at the legs of cattle, just like on any other animal, it is one of the most important areas to look at. If the joints in the leg are not set correctly, then it as immediate area of concern.
When looking at the legs of cattle, the first areas the judge will look at are the shoulder blades and the hocks, the joint in the middle of the leg.
When looking at the shoulder blades, they must be in line with the spine, not above or below. However, it is common to see animals with their shoulders set slightly above the spine, however, this is still an area of concern, as this is not where the shoulder is supposed to be set.
When looking at the hocks, they should have a bit of bend in them, however not too much or too little. If the angle is too straight, we call that post-legged. If the angle is too bent, we call that sickle-hocked.Both of these conditions are very serious, as they will affect the angle the hoof strikes the ground. This means that there will be irregular wearing of the hooves, and can lead to permanent lameness.

A lot of the potential in beef cattle lies in structure, and how the muscle is set along the body.

=== Main Body and Ribs ===
When looking at the body, the judge wants to see as much rib extension as possible- this means having a large chest area, adding more muscle to the animal. The amount of muscle must be consistent throughout the animal, all the way from neck to the rump. The body should also be as long as possible, but everything must remain in proportion to the rest of the body.

The spine should be as heavily muscled as possible, as this is where most steaks come from. However, there MUST remain a consistent amount of muscling on the body- it is not desirable to have an animal who is heavily muscled in the front shoulders, but not much muscle on the back. Also, when looking under the body, although there should be a dip in the middle, the dip should definitely not be right at the front- this can also suggest having too much muscle. In general, the most muscle is at the back of the animal, however, we must keep in mind when judging that there is consistency.

=== Rump ===
When standing behind an animal, there are a few things the judge looks for.
* When standing directly behind a cow, they should see only the rump, and none of the body. This means that there is a good amount of muscle on the rump, which is highly desirable in a beef cow.
* If there is a wide rump, the feet should be set apart wider, as well.
* Like above, if the rump is smaller, the feet should be set closer together- if they are not, the cow could have an incorrect structure.

The judge will step backwards again and have another look at the legs from behind. The legs should look straight going all the way down.
* If the legs are bent inwards, this is called cow-hocked. This means that the hocks are pointing inwards, towards each other.
* If the legs are bent outwards, this is called bow-leg. This is a condition that can affect almost any animal.

In general, a lot of muscle should be on the rump.
* The widest part of the rump should be the stifle- about halfway down.
The rump should also be round, and not bony. When standing behind the cow, the rump should obscure any of the body except for the back of the head, as this means there is a lot more meat on the animal.

=== Hooves and Pasterns ===
After looking at leg structure, the judge then wants to look at the hooves and pasterns. The pasterns are the bones that run from the top of the hoof to the fetlock.
As the leg structure affects much of the hoof structure, the hooves are very vulnerable. If the animal does not step on them correctly, lameness, even permanent lameness, may occur in the animal's life.
Although in the judging ring it will be hard to see the cow's feet, there are a few things the judge must know, and look out for along the way.
* There are two parts of a cow's feet- two claws.
* These 'claws' need to be of equal length, and shouldn't curve around too much.
* However, there should be a slope from the pastern joint down the hoof to the ground.
* The heel of the hoof needs to be sitting '''above''' the ground, but not too far above the ground- we do need some bend in the pastern.
* The skin that is attached to the hoof needs to be above the ground as well.
* When the pastern is too straight, it may appear as if the cow is walking on tip-toes, but this is a problem, as it means that the hoof is not striking the ground properly.

=== Walking ===
In a judging ring, the animals will be walking. When the animal is walking freely, the back hooves should step into the front hooves' footprints.
* If an animal is sickle-hocked, there will be some overstepping, which means he is stepping over his footprints.
* When the animal is post-legged, understepping will occur. Understepping means the cow is not reaching his footprints.
* If the judge sees any overstepping or understepping, they would then take another look at the leg structure of that particular cow.
* If he or she sees uneven footprints in the ground, this may also suggest some structure problems in the animal, and they would therefore have another look at the leg structure of the cow.

=== Fat and Muscle ===
When animals are around the same size, in general, the bones will be the same size. However, there could be two cows of the same size, and their weights will be completely different, as one would have more muscle than the other. On a beef animal, we want as much muscle as possible. However, we do want some fat on the animal- just not too much.
* In general, anything below the point of the elbow is fat.
* The brisket (the flap on a cow's neck) is only fat and skin. If the brisket is small, the animal carries more muscle. If the brisket is larger, there will generally be more fat on the animal. Another way of saying how much fat is in the brisket is looking at how many folds of skin there is.
* The flank of an animal is generally only a flap of skin, just under where the joints of the leg and hip are. If this is just a small fold ok skin, the animal is better muscled. If this is large, then the animal is carrying more fat.
* Once looking at the brisket and flank of the cow, the judge looks at the tailhead. The tailhead is the very top of the tail, where the tail meets the body. If this is large, this should confirm that the animal is carrying more fat than it should. If this is not large, then the animal is leaner, and is carrying more muscle.
* The ribs, point of the shoulder and the spine have no muscle- if this area seems 'muscly', it is really fat.
the judge must keep in mind that all breeds are different on where fat is deposited. Before people judge cattle, they should know a lot about the breed you are judging, and where the fat is usually deposited in that breed.
* Also, the judge must keep in mind that that the rump of an animal is where the most muscle will be, and less fat.

There are also a number of places on the animal that a lot of muscle should be.
* On either side of the spine- this is where a lot of steaks come from.
* Between the knee and the elbow of an animal- the forearm.
 
It will also be very obvious looking at some cows where a lot of muscle is, because of the high muscle definition.

=== Bulls ===
When looking at bulls, there are a few things that differ from normal cattle judging that the judge will be looking out for.
* There will be a crest above the neck- the judge mustn’t get this confused with the shoulder. On big bulls, the crest may even be higher than the head, creating the illusion that the head is set too far down on the bull. This may not be true.
* If the head really does look like it is set too low on the bull, the judge will ignore the crest and look at all of the structure on the animal, especially on the front half, just to make sure the head is set correctly.
* The greater size of the testicles, the more cows the bull can service.
* The sheath on a bull should be firmly attached and not pendulous. If the sheath is pendulous, the bull is of more risk to grass seed problems or injury.
* If a cow has a loose navel, there is a chance that her brothers or sons will have the same problem.

=== Cows ===
As there are differences when judging bulls, there are also differences when judging cows that are very important.
* The udders on females should not be pendulous.
* Teat size and placement is critical, but keep in mind that everything should still remain in proportion.
* Coarse hair indicates low fertility.
* The navel should not be pendulous.
* If the navel does appear pendulous, there is a chance that her brothers or sons may have the same problem.

== Judging Etiquette ==
Most people who are not judges, but still are involved in cattle judging, compete in a judging competition. This is where the competitors will be judging the cows in a class, and their judging skills will be evaluated by an overjudge. When in a judging competition, there are a number of things that must be kept in mind for both the competitors and the overjudge.

&quot;Judging instills the confidence in those people who may be timid and humbles those who tend to be conceited.&quot; -- Harlan Ritchie.

Judging in a competition is mainly based on uplifting confidence in the person doing the judging. At agricultural shows, which is where these competitions mainly take place, the whole experience is usually based on education.

When judging, there are points that must be taken into account. First, the competitor must have a basic knowledge of the animal they are going to be judging. That includes the actual animal, and then go into finer points, such as breed characteristics. In most breeds of cattle, however, there will be a standard way of judging that is widely agreed upon, that has been outlined in this article. This is what the overjudge will be looking for when the competitors judge cattle, and they systems they use.
* Breed characteristics is the certain differences between breeds, for example, the skin colour, the size, the milk produced, and where more fat is deposited.
Then they must observe the animals in detail- however, they need to keep in mind all of the breed characteristics, and when judging the animal, they must remember to judge using a system. The system used should include starting at the head and finishing at the end of the tail, going through finer points along the way. While judging, the competitors and overjudge must keep in mind the reasons why they may like or dislike a certain feature of this animal, for it is likely that the competitors in this competition will need to speak to the overjudge about how they ranked the sheep afterwards.
They will then need to compare the different animals. For instance, when someone looks at one cow, while they are looking at the rump, they may think that the cow they looked at beforehand had a larger and more better muscled rump. The competitors must keep in mind the other cows they have judged while you are judging the animal you are judging at the time- at the end they will need to make comparisons between the cows to place them in an order.
Finally, the will need to make your final decision. This decision will be given to a judge, usually on a card or sheet of paper, and the judge will look carefully at the notes you would have written on the piece of paper.

In a judging class, the cows there will usually be numbered A, B, C, and D, and you will place the cows in order of who you thought was the best, to who you thought was worst.

For example, you placed the cows D, A, B, C. D would be the cow you chose to win, A would come second, B would come third, and C would come fourth.

Keep in mind that there may be more or less cattle in the competition you are judging.

There are some things you must do. These things may be practical, or may impress the overjudge. There are also some things that you need to know about competitive judging.

* You will have a time limit- sometimes you will only get a few minutes per cow, but in the higher competitions you will probably get more time. Don't waste your time- start judging the second the class begins.
* Ignore everyone around you. Take charge of a cow and stay there until you have finished judging, then move on to the next cow. Of someone comes and starts working on the same cow, ignore them and keep going with your system. Block out everything except for the class you are judging.
* First impressions are usually the most accurate, as you have no time to think back and doubt your decisions. Once you have finished judging and have written down your placings, try not to dwell on the class too much unless you are reviewing how you judged personally. Don't keep on changing your placings.
* Don't be biased- go into the class with an open mind.
* Have confidence in yourself- don't doubt yourself. If you start to re-think your placings, remember that if you have judged the cattle to the best of your ability, the first order you write down will usually be the correct one.
* Make a point of not hearing the other orders people placed the cattle in until after the event- avoid anything that will affect your own judgment.
* Make sure that you right down notes and your placings on the official card that should be handed to you.
* Make sure you use the correct terms.
* Both before, during, and after the class, think about the systems you have been taught, and remember to use these systems when you are judging.

When you judge cattle, you will be asked to give your reasons to the judge orally. Some people also may have to say their reasons for placing the cattle the way they did over a microphone. Don't be daunted by this- it's normal, everyone has to do it, and it can be fun- as well as educational.
Basically, what you have to do is tell the judge why you placed the cattle the way you did. This does not need to be daunting. You DO NOT have to have the exact placings the judge wrote down, however, if you can say why you placed the cattle the way you did, you will get extra points, and maybe even the judge will learn some more.
Remember, the judge does not expect you to get the same placing as him, and won't be impressed if you do get the same placings, but can't justify why.
You also won't know the judge's placings until after the event, sometimes maybe never at all, but you should be told after the event.

You can also learn a lot from this experience.
* You learn more about taking notes- you need to write your notes in a detailed and organised way for the judge, but you have to write them very quickly.
* You learn more about comparing the animals.
* You can remember more.
* You can 'sell' your ideas.
* You can defend your decisions and provide reasoning on the spot.

The overjudge will judge you both on the systems you use and how systematic you are with your judging, and on how well you can provide reasoning for your placings orally.
* You need to know what you are talking about- use the correct terms, etc.
* You need to compare animals- eg, 'C' was not as long as 'A' because...
* You need to build on your ideas- instead of stating something, you need to say why that was important.
You need to show a good public speaking etiquette- 
* Maintain eye contact
* Don't stutter
* Make use of pronouns
* Correct pronunciation and grammar
* An audible voice- no yelling, no whispering
* Logical order of reasons.

However, there are a few things you should always avoid doing.
* Using too much jargon- use correct cattle terms, but don't go overboard.
* Nervous mannerisms- jingling coins in pockets, clicking tongue, rocking back and forth.
* Have hands in pocket.

=== Note Taking ===

In some classes, you will be expected to remember your reasons and write your notes afterwards. In some classes they mightn't give you time to write notes during your actually judging, and only say to write your notes afterwards. In some classes, however, you will be able to write notes, and in almost every class you will be expected to write notes.
When the overjudge is assessing your ability to judge cattle, they will also be assessing your notes, judging skills, systems, and oral presentation.
When taking notes there are a few things you must keep in mind.
* Write quickly but neatly.
* Don't write in too much shorthand- the judge needs to be able to read what you are saying.
* You may describe the cow.
* Write down the obvious things as well as the complex things.
* Write down reasons why you placed the animals the way you did. When you write your final notes, you should
1. Have the order of the cows written clearly
2. Have the reasons you placed the cows in that order
3. Include both good and bad things about that cow.
These notes will be the basis of your speech and you will need them for later.

However, you must be careful that you do not spend too much time on the notes. The overjudge will be looking for this- you need to show that you are talking about the cow, not about the notes.
Don't spend all of your time looking at the notes. Spend most of your time looking at the cattle. You should only spend a small part of your time looking at your notes.

=== Oral Presentation ===
After you have assessed the cattle in the class, you will usually be asked to speak to the overjudge and talk about the cattle. You will mainly need to say why you placed the cattle in the order that you did.
When you are in a judging competition like this, there are a few things you should remember.

1. Good first impressions last.

2. Confidence in yourself helps others to really know that you know what you are talking about.

3. Neatness and a good presentation is usually a good impression.

When you are talking to the overjudge, you may be in a room alone, outside, or talking privately near the animals and the other competitors. Wherever you are, you must still give your oral presentation well.
* Use a general public speaking etiquette.
* Don't jingle things in pockets.
* Don't have your hands in your pockets.
* Be on time- as soon as you or your number is called, be prepared to talk and arrive at the overjudge promptly.
* Don't fully rely on your notes- you may be asked to leave them behind. The judge wants to see that you evaluated the animals efficiently enough to remember most of your notes anyway.
* Be confident, but don't be cocky- just be calm.
* Don't rely on anything- different competitions will have different guidelines. Do not always rely on your notes as in some competitions you may be asked to leave your notes behind.
* Stand normally, and do not invade personal space.
* Maintain constant eye contact.
* Speak with sincerity.
* Talk in a normal speaking tone, volume, and speed. Don't talk down to the overjudge, don't whisper or shout, speak normally, and don't speak too quickly.
* Don't talk for too long- you may have a time limit. Speak briefly but thoroughly.

=== Speech Structure ===
When talking about the cattle, you should say things in a certain order. This is widely agreed upon in most competitions, however, it is not a strict guideline. This, however is probably the most organised guideline, and the most commonly used speech structure.
* NOTE When listing reasons, do not go into too much detail about the worse points about the cow. This is to avoid hard feelings after the contest, and it is good show etiquette. When talking about the cattle, state the reasons the cow was good. If you need to state any negative points, say them briefly, and quickly move on. Don't go into detail. You may say 'I felt cow 'B' had a shorter neck extension than cow 'A'', then just leave it at that. Also, try to say your bad points right at the end when you're talking about that cow.

You should thank the associations who helped organise the competition. You may say &quot;Firstly, I would like to thank the Angus Association and the 'show name' for organising this event.

1. '''Introduce the class'''
Simply say the order you placed the animals. Don't go into detail about why you placed the animals in that order. Just state the breed and the order. For example: &quot;I placed these cattle in the order D, B, A, C.&quot;

Start with the cow that came first, using our example, this will be cow D. Move through the cows one by one and say why you placed them in that order.
'''
Start with cow D.'''
1. State that you placed cow D first.

2. Say the good points of cow D. Since cow D came first, try not to say any bad points, instead, glorify all of the good points to justify you putting the cow in that position.

3. Summarise why you placed cow D first.

'''Then start with cow B.'''

1.State that you placed cow B second.

2. List your reasons you placed cow B second.

3. Summarise why you placed cow B in the second position.

'''Then you start on cow A .''' Talk about why you placed cow 'B' before cow 'A'.

1. State that you placed cow A third.

2. Go into detail. Say the good points of cow B.

3. You may like to summarise why you placed cow A in that position.

'''Then talk about cow C.'''

1. State that you placed cow C fourth.

2. Go into detail. Say why cow C finished behind cow A, but don't dwell on the negative points of cow C. Say the good points of cow C.

3. Summarise why you placed the cow C in that position.

'''Conclude your speech.'''
Conclude your speech by summarising all of the cows, but very briefly. Then end you speech with an appropriate closing statement.

When saying your speech, there are a few other things to avoid saying.
* Don't say 'better', say your reasons WHY the sheep was better.
* Instead of saying 'animal', say the name- for example, heifer, cow, or bull.
* Instead of saying a few words, just say the one word needed. Instead of saying 'her teeth were neither overshot nor undershot' say 'her teeth her set correctly'.
* Use past tense- eg. I plac&quot;ed''.
* Don't say 'number'- just say 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'.
* Don't say 'he' or 'she'- use more adjectives, for example, 'the red bull'.
* Be specific- don't say 'sort of', 'kind of'- say she ''is''. Get straight to the point, and if you need to, be blunt, just not insulting.
* Do not use the word 'it'- this can be insulting, and the cow can also be referred to as 'he' or 'she'.
* Don't say 'that'- for example, 'that' rump is better muscled than 'that' one, instead say 'her rump is more muscled than cow 'D'.

Once more, don't be intimidated. You should know the breed characteristics, the systems you need to work through, how to write your notes and how to say your speech. The judge is looking that you do these correctly, and the judge should also talk to you about the class afterwards, to all of the contestants, of not individually.
The above guideline is generally used in shows around the world. It is just a guideline, however it is widely agreed to be the most effective way of completing a judging competition. It can also be applied to many other typed of livestock.

===Direct Taxes===

These are levied directly upon the taxpayer and are generally taken from the taxpayer's income.

* Income tax 
* Capital gains tax 
* Corporation tax 
* National insurance 
* Stamp taxes 
* Council tax 
* Inheritance tax 
* Business rates

===Indirect Taxes===

These are collected through an intermediary such as a reseller and are generally a tax upon consumption.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One inconsistency here: Fred and George receive their OWL results at the end of term, and Percy receives his NEWT results at the same time. While Harry, Ron, and Hermione sit their OWLs at the end of book 5, they don't get their results until the summer. As the description of Harry receiving his OWL results is quite detailed, where the description in this chapter of Percy and the twins getting their results is one throw-away sentence, I will make the assumption that this is a slight mistake by the author, and in fact the twins wouldn't have actually gotten their results until summer; as employment, which starts right after graduation, ordinarily depends upon NEWT results, I will allow that they may have come back sooner for Percy.

{{sectstub}}

In the United Kingdom, '''stamp duty''' is a form of tax charged on instruments (that is, written documents), and requires a physical stamp to be attached to or impressed upon the instrument in question.  

The scope of stamp duty has been reduced dramatically in recent years.  Apart from transfers of shares and securities, the issue of bearer instruments and certain transactions involving partnerships, stamp duty was largely abolished in the UK from 1 December, 2003.  Stamp duty land tax (SDLT), a new transfer tax derived from stamp duty, was introduced for land transactions from 1 December 2003.  Stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) was introduced on agreements to transfer certain shares and other securities in 1986.

=Stamp duty reserve tax=
{{main|Taxation in the United Kingdom/Stamp taxes/Stamp duty reserve tax}}

Stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) was introduced under Finance Act 1986 to ensure that a form of tax equivalent to stamp duty would continue to be payable on the transfer of uncertificated shares.  At that time, it was expected that the TAURUS share trading system would come into operation.  In the event, SDRT was adapted for the charge to trading in uncertificated shares in CREST, and is charged on agreements to transfer shares and other securities.  SDRT is not a stamp tax, but a self-assessed transfer tax which is usually collected automatically by stock market participants (such as brokers) when a transaction takes place.

Stamp duty remains in force for shares and securities that are held in certificated form which can only be transferred by using a physical stock transfer form, and runs in parallel to SDRT on agreements to transfer shares.  Since 1986, both stamp duty and SDRT have been charged at a rate of 0.5% of the consideration for the transfer of shares (in the case of stamp duty, rounded up to the nearest £5).  The same transaction may include an agreement to transfer shares which may trigger a liability to SDRT, and the agreement may later be completed by a transfer of the shares which is liable to stamp duty.  Provided that the transfer is stamped within 6 years, the charge to SDRT is cancelled to avoid a double charge.

A higher rate of SDRT at 1.5% is charged for the issue or transfer of shares to a person who operates a depositary receipt scheme or a clearance service (other than CREST, which is exempted).  The higher charge compensates for the fact that later transfers of depositary interests or through the clearance services will not attract SDRT.

It is widely expected, although the UK Treasury may wish otherwise, that as a practical matter SDRT will not ultimately survive the introduction of the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID.) which is designed to create a single market in financial services across the EU. As currently operated, SDRT will create a number of tax, legal and operational barriers that could effectively present an uneven playing field. It is totally unclear how UK Tax Authorities could hope to police transctions wholly effected in other member states.

There is little sign that this is clearly understood by the UK Government nor even faintly comprehended by the UK Stamp Office who are still stuck on the concept of imposing SDRT on transactions effected on national exchanges

=Stamp duty land tax=
{{main|Taxation in the United Kingdom/Stamp taxes/Stamp duty land tax}}

Stamp duty land tax (SDLT) is a new tax in land transactions that was introduced by [[Finance Act 2003]] and largely replaces stamp duty with effect from 1 December, 2003.  SDLT is not a stamp duty, but a form of self-assessed [[transfer tax]].  SDLT is charged on &quot;land transactions&quot; and for typical transactions in land, such as the buying and selling of a residential house, there is little change from stamp duty, except that a tax return is required to be made to the Inland Revenue and documents no longer need to be given a physical stamp.  Like any other self-assessed tax, but unlike stamp duty, the Inland Revenue is able to enquire into an SDLT return and raise assessments to recover unpaid SDLT.

For residential house purchases, the current rates in the UK are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Consideration !! Rate
|-
|up to £125,000 || 0%
|-
|over £125,000 to £250,000 || 1%
|-
|over £250,000 to £500,000 || 3%
|-
|over £500,000 || 4%
|}

SDLT is not a [[Graduated_tax|progressive tax]], but rather works on a &quot;slab&quot; basis, so the above percentages apply to the whole of the purchase price. For example, a house priced at £250,000 would attract a SDLT of £2,500, but one of £250,001 would be liable to SDLT of £7,500. Some areas have been designated as disadvantaged areas and have relief from SDLT on residential transactions below a certain level.

In previous years, there had been a high level of house price [[inflation]] in the UK but no change in these thresholds, leading to a substantial increase in the revenue from SDLT through [[fiscal drag]]. In 2000-01, the [[Inland Revenue]] received £2.145bn from residential stamp duty. In 2002-03, it received £3.59bn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/stamp_duty/03IR153.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the threshold for paying SDLT was raised from £60,000 to £120,000.  In 2006, the threshold was further raised to £125,000.

In addition to SDLT on the purchase price for land, SDLT is also charged when a lease is granted.  Any premium for the grant is charged to SDLT at the same rates as for the purchase price for a sale of land; SDLT is also charged on the rent payable under the lease, at the rate of 1% of the (discounted) net present value of rent passing under the whole term of the lease.  Previously, stamp duty was charged at rate of up to 24% of the annual rent.  The amount of SDLT due on the grant of a typical commercial lease generally amounts to a substantial increase from the amount of stamp duty that would have been due previously.

SDLT is also charged on certain transactions involving the transfer of land involving partnerships (transfers of land from or to the partners, or changes in the partners' partnership interests where the partnership owns land).

Whether or not tax is payable Her Majesty's Customs and Revenue require a Return to be received by them within four weeks of the transaction completing failing which they have power to levy a fine on the tax payer - the fine is not for failure to pay the tax but for failure to make the return.  When a return is accepted by HMRC they provide a Certificate without which it is impossible to register a change in the land ownership.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Capital gains in the United Kingdom are subject to tax at the marginal rate of income tax (for individuals) or of corporation tax (for companies).

Capital gains for individuals are taxed slightly differently from those for companies:

==Individuals==

The basic calculation for individuals (in very broad terms) is proceeds less cost;  Individuals also have a capital gains tax free amount or &quot;annual exemption&quot; (in 2006-07 this is £8,800&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/cgt.htm HMRC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Companies==

For companies, the chargeable gain is calculated (again, in very broad terms) as proceeds less cost; however, instead of taper relief, companies are entitled to indexation allowance, which is calculated with reference to movements in the retail prices index (individuals are also entitled to indexation allowance prior to April 1998). Companies are not entitled to any annual exemption.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Value Added Tax (VAT) is the third largest source of government revenues in the United Kingdom.  It is charged at the standard rate of 20% on supplies of goods and services. It is therefore a tax on consumer expenditure. Certain goods and services are exempt from VAT, and others are subject to VAT at a lower rate of 5% (the reduced rate) or 0% (&quot;zero-rated&quot;).

      <comment>/* The National Insurance number */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''National Insurance''' is a system of taxes, and related social security benefits, that has operated in the United Kingdom since its introduction in 1911, and wider extension by the government of Clement Attlee in 1946.

==Introduction==

The name ''national insurance'' was adopted as an expression of the government's aspiration that the system should be qualitatively different from conventional general taxation such as income tax.

The proposed differences that were enacted, or aspired to, included:
* the revenue was expected to roughly equate to current spending on contributory benefits
* no means testing of benefits - the amount of benefit paid in respect of any claim by a claimant was the same whether the claimant was rich or poor, depending only on the completeness of the claimant's contribution record 
* a cap on the system's scope for redistribution - above a certain level of earnings or profits no extra contributions were payable
* the payment of a contribution by an employer for each employee comparable to that paid by the employee

Initially, the most important contributory benefits were the State Retirement Pension and Unemployment Benefit.

With the introduction of employer payroll tax deduction (Pay-As-You-Earn or PAYE), employees' national insurance contributions were collected along with income tax.  This replaced the old system of purchasing a contribution certificate or ''stamp'', but for many years some older Britons continued to describe making NI contributions as ''paying their stamp''.

In the contemporary United Kingdom budget national insurance contributions are a significant source of government revenue: £90 billion in 2006-2007, approximately 17% of total government receipts. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/26E/0F/bud06_completereport_2320.pdf |title=Budget 2006 |accessdate=2006-08-10 |author=HM Treasury | date=2006-03-22 |format=pdf |pages=19 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution classes==

National insurance contributions (NICs) fall into a number of classes.  Class 1, 2 and 3 NICs paid are credited to an individual's NI account, which determines entitlements to certain benefits - including the state pension. Class 1A, 1B and 4 NIC do not count towards benefit entitlements but must still be paid if due. 

'''Class 1''' contributions are paid by employees and their employers.  They are deducted from their gross wages by the employer, with no action required by the employee.  The employers also match these contributions (with the one exception below).  There are three milestone figures which determine the rate of NICs to be paid: Lower Earnings Limit (LEL), Earnings threshold (ET) and Upper Earnings Limit (UEL).

* Below the LEL, no NICs are paid.
* Between the LEL and the ET, NICs are not paid, but are credited as if they were.
* Between the ET and the UEL, NICs are paid at a rate of 11% on earnings by employees and 12.8% of earnings by employers.
* Above the UEL, NICs are paid at a rate of 1% on earnings by employees and 12.8% of earnings by employers.

Unlike income tax the limits for class 1 NICs for ordinary employees are calcuated on a monthly basis. However those for company directors are calculated on an annual basis.

'''Class 1A''' contributions are paid by employers on the value of company cars and other benefits in kind of their employees and directors at rate of 12.8% of the value of the benefits in kind (from their P11Ds).

'''Class 1B''' were introduced on 6 April 1999 and are payable whenever an employer enters into a PAYE Settlement Agreement (a PSA) for tax. Class 1B NICs are payable only by employers and payment does not provide any benefit entitlement for individuals. 

&lt;!--Explanation of contracting-out could go here, if someone provides one--&gt;
'''Class 2''' contributions are fixed weekly amounts paid by the self-employed. They are due regardless of trading profits or losses, but people on small (low) earnings can apply for exception from paying and those on high earnings with liability to either Class 1 or 4 can apply for deferment from paying. While the amount is calculated to a weekly figure, they are typically paid monthly or quarterly. For the most part, unlike Class 1, they do not form part of a qualifying contribution record for contributions-based Jobseekers Allowance.

'''Class 3''' contributions are voluntary NICs paid by people that wish to fill a gap in their contributions record which has arisen either by not working or by their earnings being too low.  The main reason for paying Class 3 NICs is to ensure that a persons contribution record is preserved for entitlement to the state pension,generally a person needs either 10 or 11years for a minimum state pension (depending on sex and date of birth),although in certain cases fewer years may be required.

'''Class 4''' contributions are paid by self-employed people as a portion of their profits, calculated with income tax at the end of the year, based on figures supplied on the SA100 tax return. Below the earnings threshold no class 4 NICs are due. Above the earnings threshold and below the upper earnings limit class 4 NICs are paid at a rate of 8% of trading profits. Above the upper earnings limit class 4 NICs are paid at a rate of 1% of trading profits. They do not form part of a qualifying contribution record for any benefits, including the state retirement pension.

People who are unable to work for some reason may be able to claim NIC credits.  These are equivalent to Class 1 NICs, though are not paid for.  They are granted either to maintain a contributions record while not working, or to those applying for benefits whose contribution record is only slightly short of the requirements for those benefits.  In the latter case, they are unavailable to fill &quot;gaps&quot; in contribution records for some benefits.

==The National Insurance number==
The National Insurance numbercard is issued by the former Department of Health and Social Security. Children born and resident in the UK are assigned an NI number (referred to internally as a NINO), and receive a plastic card of similar proportions to a credit card with the number raised on the front shortly before their 16th birthday, and are advised to keep the card safe (only one replacement card may ever be issued over the lifetime of an individual).  However, allocation of this number might occur a long time before this occasion (the date can usually be established from the prefix letters used), and siblings may have consecutive numbers - this is dependent on the payment of Child Benefit.  

Persons from abroad looking to work in the UK, or those to whom a number was not initially allocated as children, may apply for a number through the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).  The prefixes used are typically different from those used in the normal run.

The format of the number is two letters, six digits, and one optional letter.  The example used is typically AB123456C.  It is usual to pair off the digits - such separators are seen on forms used by government departments (both internal and external, notably the P45).

In the case of '''AB 12 34 56 C''', the first and second letter cannot be ''D'', ''F'', ''I'', ''Q'', ''U'' and ''V''.  The second letter also cannot be ''O''.  The six digits are sequentially issued (siblings who are few years apart may notice their numbers are consecutive when the numbers are issued together), and the suffix letter is ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' or absent.  The number is unique without the last letter - if there is AB 12 34 56 C, then there will be no AB 12 34 56 D (though it is possible that there will be AB 12 34 57 D).  A common error found on documents containing an individual's NI number is the final letter being incorrect, though this error is non-fatal in that an individual can be identified without the last letter.


It is worth noting that, while an individual may be issued with a second NI number when all traces of their original number has been lost, these numbers never change.  Some accountants often mistakenly advise their customers of a change, particularly in the suffix letter, where ''A'' referred to employment, ''B'' to self-employment, etc.  The actual meaning of the suffix letter dates back to before NIRS (see below), and referred to the quarter in which that individual's annual record card was due for return, and is roughly (but not directly) linked to their date of birth.

As Britain does not (yet) have a system of personal ID cards, and not everyone has a passport, the NI number is, along with the NHS number, the only system which provides every adult in the country with a code number.  Consequently, NI numbers are sometimes used for identification purposes in other contexts which have nothing to do with their original National Insurance purpose. This is despite a clear claim on the back of the NI card that it is not proof of identity.

==NIRS==

National Insurance contributions for all UK residents and some non-residents are recorded using the NIRS computer software package (''National Insurance Recording System'', pronounced &quot;nurse&quot;).  NIRS is currently in its second generation and is known within the Civil Service as NIRS/2 (&quot;nurse two&quot;).

The original NIRS was a more archaic system first used in 1975 without direct user access to its records.  A civil servant working within the Contributions Office (NICO) would have to request paper printouts of an individual's account which could take up to two weeks to arrive.  New information to be added to the account would be sent to specialised data entry operatives on paper to be input into NIRS.

NIRS/2 is a Microsoft Windows based system with several applications under its umbrella.  These include individual applications to access or update an individual National Insurance account, to view employer's National Insurance schemes and a general work management application.

There has been some controversy regarding the NIRS/2 system from its inception in 1996 when problems with the new system attracted widespread media coverage.  Due to computer problems, deficiency notices which used to be sent out on an annual basis stopped being issued in 1996.  The Inland Revenue is currently  (as of August 2004) running an exercise to catch up on a backlog of deficiency notices for the 1996-97 to 2001-02 tax years on the instructions of the Paymaster General.  The exercise is due for completion in March 2005.  Deficiency notices are due to be issued on an annual basis again from October 2004.

==Chapter 1==
===Introduction and Methodologies===
When the United States withdrew from [[w:Vietnam|Vietnam]] in [[w:1973|1973]] and [[w:South Vietnam|South Vietnam]] fell to the [[w:North Vietnamese Army|North Vietnamese Army]] in [[1975]], US leadership in [[w:Asia|Asia]] suffered a severe blow.  The power equation in Asia again shifted in 1978, when [[w:Jimmy Carter|President Carter]] announced diplomatic normalization with [[China]] and Tokyo signed the Peace and Friendship Treaty (PFT) with Beijing.  When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, under claims of protecting ethnic Vietnamese, Tokyo's reaction diverged from the responses of Washington and Beijing.  Because of the changing power relationships in East Asia, Japan's foreign policy toward Vietnam differed from the US policy when Tokyo acted in its own self interest to steer a course between the United States, China, The Association of Southeast Asian Nations ([[w:ASEAN|ASEAN]]), and Vietnam.  An investigation of Japan's foreign policy toward Vietnam during this period could provide an understanding of the larger bilateral relationships of Tokyo and Washington and Tokyo and Beijing, while highlighting regional and domestic factors that caused Tokyo to choose this independent middle course.

==Statement of thesis==
This thesis covers Japan's foreign relations with Vietnam from [[w:1978|1978]] to [[w:1992|1992]] in order to gain insights about Japan's general foreign policy goals and its diplomatic style, and to provide possible explanations for Tokyo's actions resulting from international and domestic pressures during this period.  In December 1978, the Vietnamese army invaded [[w:Cambodia|Cambodia]], which prompted Tokyo to cut off official development aid and economic assistance for all but humanitarian relief.  Full diplomatic relations continued, but Tokyo refused to restore economic aid to Hanoi until 1992, after Vietnamese forces had withdrawn from Cambodia and the international climate (decreasing pressure from the United States) reached a point that allowed Japan to restore nearly JPY45.5 billion ($370 million) in loans and grants to Vietnam.  What prompted Tokyo to cut off aid in 1978?  Why did Japan continue diplomatic relations despite the hard line stances of both Washington and Beijing?  Why didn't Japan go further (like the US full embargo against Vietnam) in its &quot;punishment&quot; of Hanoi?  What domestic factors pressured Japan's policy?  How did the Japan-Vietnam relationship color other bilateral relationships in the region for Tokyo?

Examining Japan's dealings with Vietnam during that country's invasion of Cambodia provides insight into facets of Japan's foreign policy such as the tendency to seek a middle ground between two extremes.  While the United States, China, and ASEAN called for strong economic punishment of Hanoi, Japan soft-pedalled its sanctions against Vietnam, explaining the suspension of economic assistance in terms of international and regional pressure.  This thesis investigates international factors such as pressure from the United States, burgeoning relations with China, stagnant relations with the USSR, and economic integration with ASEAN to determine the outside influences that most affected Japan's policy toward Vietnam.

In order to shed light in terms of domestic goals and pressures on Japan's Vietnam policy, I will present the bureaucratic policies of the [[Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) that pertained to Vietnam.  The thesis also examines the trade activities of the private sector in order to show increasing commercial activity between the two countries despite governmental policies.  From this trade data, we can surmise to what degree domestic economic pressures helped determine policy.  Trade in some sectors dropped off dramatically after aid was suspended in 1979, while other sectors grew in relation to Vietnam's production capability.

The pattern of Japan &quot;in the middle&quot; reoccurs throughout all these regional relationships. That is, we can view Japan's foreign policy at two levels: (1) bilateral direct actions with other countries (A to B, and B to A), and (2) reactionary responses to developments between two other countries (A's position between B and C).  This second level, the reactionary model, manifests itself quite significantly in Japan's relations with Vietnam.  Tokyo officials often attempted to place Japan in a conciliatory role between regional hegemons.  When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and relations between Vietnam and ASEAN came to a standstill, Japan Foreign Ministry officials pleaded the case for maintaining economic assistance to Vietnam on the grounds that someone needed to keep ties with Vietnam in order to prevent further sliding.  When the Sino-Vietnamese border war erupted in 1979, Japan offered to act as a go-between toward settlement.  As relations between Hanoi and Washington continued to drag over th
e POW/MIA issue as well as the Cambodian question, Japanese officials expressed the hope of bringing the two countries together.  This thesis describes actions by the major regional powers and includes Japan's position on those actions in an attempt to bolster the description of Japan's foreign policy as one seeking the middle ground.

===Structure of the thesis===
This work is descriptive and is divided chronologically into three main areas: 
# 1978-1984-- limited relations, 
# 1985-1989-- increased trade in a changing international setting, and 
# 1989-1992-- restoration of economic assistance to Vietnam without upsetting the US-Japan relationship.

Within this structure, I examine the bilateral relations between Japan and Vietnam, the international factors that affected the relationship, and the actions taken by the various Japanese bureaucracies.  In addition, I have charted the imports and exports between Vietnam and Japan to illustrate the influence (or lack of influence) private sector trade had on Tokyo's policies.

At the international level, this thesis begins by outlining the international setting at the time of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and then follows regional developments through 1992.  Dramatic change occurred at the macro level between 1978 and 1992, as the Cold War ended and East Asian countries, communist and noncommunist alike, shifted priorities to economic development.  Such changes magnified Tokyo's regional position and as a direct result, affected Japan's policy toward Vietnam.  Further, international factors and pressures continued to control Japan's &quot;no aid&quot; policy toward Vietnam until 1992.

At the domestic level, bureaucratic politics shaped policy in the form of different goals for different bureaucracies.  The Ministry of Finance and Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) were concerned with expanding trade and recycling Japan's aid and trade surpluses throughout the region, while the Foreign Ministry needed to maintain close ties with the United States as well as handle closer relations with China and ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations).  While more weight should be given to the international factors, the bureaucratic wrangling among these actors affected policy and the timetable for restoring assistance to Hanoi.  A study of Japan's policies toward Vietnam gives insight into the relative positions among the bureaucracies-- which bureaucracy determined policy and to what degree.

Party politics played a small role in the debate whether or not to continue with aid in 1979, but had diminished greatly as time progressed and Opposition parties such as the Japan Communist Party and Japan Socialist Party faced the dilemma of agreeing with the majority LDP or supporting their ideological brothers in Indochina.  Separately, private industry continued to trade with Vietnam, and therefore never had cause to voice serious opposition to Japan's suspension of economic assistance.  The balance between these domestic factors, while not dominant, shaded policy toward Vietnam throughout the fourteen years under study.

===Literature review===

I am undertaking this work primarily to describe an international relationship (Japan and Vietnam) that has not been extensively researched in English language sou rces.  Most of the current information about the expanding trade relationship between these two countries has come from periodicals and business-oriented newspapers.  Economic modelling about Japan's relationship with Asian countries has centered mostly on Korea, China, and ASEAN countries.  Others have tried to determine Japan's policy to
ward third world developing countries.  Scholars have also looked at the tie between Japan's economic aid policies and subsequent increase of trade with developing nations.  However, I have yet to find more than one or two works describing specifically Japan's relationship to Vietnam during Hanoi's &quot;pariah period&quot;.  Therefore, this work is primarily descriptive, collecting scattered journalistic reports into cohesive chapters divided into subheadings of international and domestic factors.  As stated earlier, this thesis carries three basic goals: (1) describe Japan's bilateral relationship with Vietnam, (2) analyze the international and domestic factors that contributed to that relationship, and (3) draw conclusions about and propose explanations for Japan's diplomatic style and economic policies toward Vietnam.

===Japan's bilateral relations with Vietnam===
A comprehensive history of economic and security relations in the post [[w:WWII|WWII]] era between Japan and Vietnam can be found in [[w:Masaya Shiraishi|Masaya Shiraishi]]'s ''Japanese Relations with Vietnam: 1951-1987''.  Shiraishi states that his is the first work to explore this relationship as an overall study.  The work is strong in developing the economic ties and aid relations stemming from [[w:ware reparations|war reparations]] (WWII) and Japan's assistance programs during American involvement in the 1960s and early 1970s, with careful consideration to Tokyo's desire to stay as &quot;balanced&quot; as possible once it became evident by 1973 of the eventual fall of South Vietnam and rise of North Vietnam.  However, given the span of his work, Shiraishi has little room left to develop political factors that went into Japan's policy following Vietnam's 1978 invasion of Cambodia.  My thesis may hopefully be considered the follow-up to Shiraishi's work. This work will be an analysis of Japan's foreign economic policy and will address factors contributing to that policy.

[[w:juichi Inada|Juichi Inada]] speaks specifically on Japan's role in Vietnam in Koppel and Orr's volume on foreign aid, in a chapter entitled &quot;Stick or Carrot: Japanese Aid Policy and Vietnam.&quot;  Inada covers the period from the end of the Vietnam War to 1990 and traces the internal Vietnam security issues and the international (regional) concerns that influenced Japan's approach to Vietnam.  Although short on Japan's internal political factors accounting for Japan's aid to Vietnam, this work does discuss the history of international events surrounding the Japan-Vietnam relationship between 1978 and 1990.  However, its primary focus is to describe the Japan-Vietnam relationship within a larger context of Tokyo's aid policies, and the chapter was written before the Cambodian situation was fully resolved.  Therefore, Inada's main focus is to use the Vietnam relationship as simply a case study or example of Tokyo's aid policy; his policy recommendations are based on conjecture about how Japan could restore assistance to Hanoi.  The recommendations seem sound, but fall short in anticipating the degree to which US pressure and regional economic competition provided the controlling factors for Japan's decision on when and to what degree to restore economic assistance.

===International political factors===
&lt;p&gt;  This thesis adds to a growing body of research on Japan's emerging regional leadership position.  Current scholarship on Japan's foreign policy focuses on Japan's role in a post-Cold War world.  Gerald Curtis' 1993 volume ties together several articles that address Japan's relationships with Asian powers, the third world, and former communist states.  Articles on Japan's diplomatic style are concerned with what effect the end of the cold war will have on the &quot;coping&quot; paradigm: Japan has always followed older brother &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; in security issues and now faces a crossroads as a regional and economic dominating power.  This thesis, which investigates Tokyo's role in resolving the Cambodian issue in the face of sometimes conflicting pressure from the United States on the one hand and Asian powers (China, ASEAN) on the other, adds to scholarship on Japan's regional responsibilities and addresses the questions of Japan's independence or dependence upon Washington to determine foreign policy.  As this thesis will show, Washington influenced Japan's policy toward Vietnam well through 1992, as evidenced by Tokyo's close association with US envoys to Vietnam over the POW/MIA issue-- an association that continued through the US Presidential election in November 1992.

===Politics of Japan's aid and foreign economic policy===
By cataloging the trade between Japan and Vietnam, this thesis may contribute as a case study of one of the largest debates among Japanese policy scholars: the connection between business and government (the &quot;Japan, Inc.&quot; debate).  In a 1977 volume, Fukui outlines the division among scholars over the existence and influence of a &quot;power elite&quot; in Japanese policy making, similar to the model made famous by [[C. Wright Mills]] in 1956.  Fukui references many Japanese scholars who provide variants on the theme of a &quot;power elite.&quot;  These models became popular as Japan's economic power increased in the 1980s.  Probably two of the more widely read works conveying this stance is Karl van Wolferen's 1989 book ''The Enigma of Japanese Power'', and [[w:Chalmers Johnson|Chalmers Johnson]]'s ''MITI and the Japanese Miracle''.  Earlier, moderates such as [[T.J. Pempel]] had outlined a strong connection between [[LDP]] politicians and civil service bureaucrats, but stopped short of a [[Marxist]] interpretation of the power of the bureaucracy.  This thesis examines a situation where Japan's government stopped aid and trade support mechanisms.   Links between government-led programs and private industry should therefore be found in the statistical evidence of the subsequent drop in trade following the suspension of aid.  Extremists like [[Karel van Wolferen]] and Johnson may see such a drop as evidence to support their &quot;[[state-capitalism]]&quot; theories, but I believe this thesis will conclude differently: trade increased despite the aid embargo and was probably more dependent on Vietnam's production capability rather than LDP-business policy harmony. 

Fukui, Tempel and Stockwin all produced case studies of policy produced in a pluralistic model as a compromise between competing bureaucracies or factions within the LDP.  However, Japan's relations with Vietnam were dominated by one bureaucracy-- the Ministry of Foreign Affairs-- throughout the fourteen years covered in this work.  Some compromise did occur, though not to the level of other cases listed by these authors. 

A 1993 scholarly work on Japan's bureaucratic workings vis-a-vis foreign aid in the Finance Ministry is &lt;i&gt;Japan's Foreign Aid: Power and Policy in a New Era.&lt;/i&gt;  Editors Koppel and Orr have compiled case studies of Japan's aid to various countries.  Taken as a whole, this book claims that Japan's foreign aid is a major tool for foreign economic policy toward Japan's Asian  neighbors.  Others have investigated the relationship between trade and aid.  [[Margee M. Ensign]], in a prior study of Japan's overseas development aid ([[ODA]]) practices, found a significant relationship between trade in infrastructure-related equipment to a country and the amount of infrastructure aid provided to that country the previous year.  The focus of her study was an investigation into the contract bidding practice for aid-funded projects.  She found that a majority of these contracts come back to Japanese firms because of the bureaucratic hoops inherent in the structure that give firms with close government contacts an advantage.

Thus, models of Tokyo's intricate connections between private sector trade and foreign aid have been proposed by numerous scholars.  Basic questions about the degree of power concentration within Tokyo have remained since the end of the occupation and the rise of the LDP in 1955.  This thesis may provide fodder for those who believe in a strong link between the government and trade, a link that is reflected by the drop in trade in 1979.  Further research showing increased trade amounts following the resumption of aid and assistance programs could bolster such arguments.  In addition, comparisons to similar economies that enjoyed economic assistance could highlight the effects of Tokyo's suspension of aid from 1978 to 1992.

===Factual information and trade data===
A primary concern of this research is to catalog trade data for the embargo period.  On a macro level, trade statistics for the region have been taken directly from the &lt;i&gt;[[United Nations Direction of Trade Yearbooks]]&lt;/i&gt;.  However, statistics specific to Vietnam are sketchy.   While some production statistics are provided in the Vietnam 1991 publication ''[[Economy and Trade of Vietnam: 1986-1990]]'', only spotty figures are given for certain years.  Journalistic sources such as the [[w:Foreign Broadcast Information Service|Foreign Broadcast Information Service]], ''[[w:Far Eastern Economic Review|Far Eastern Economic Review]]'', ''[[w:The Economist|The Economist]]'', ''[[w:The Nikkei Weekly|The Nikkei Weekly]]'', and the ''[[w:Japan Economic Journal|Japan Economic Journal]]'' all provide similar, if not identical, numbers for volumes of trade in and estimates of the Vietnam market.  These sources are currently the best available and will have to do for this study.  Unfortunately, the scarcity of consistent statistics gauging Vietnam's production capability prevent regression analysis similar to Ensign's work on aid/trade relationships.  The present work will have to rely on primarily qualitative analysis of international and domestic factors, with support from trade data as indications of these factors.

On a bureaucratic level, the Ministry of Finance publishes a yearly report of Japan's official development assistance, which gives statements of policy goals and structure as well as charts breaking down the amounts of aid by country and sector.  This supplementary information is useful because this thesis will attempt to show some of the political ties between aid and investment in developing countries.  Furthermore, every few years the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prepares its ''[[w:Diplomatic Blue Book|Diplomatic Blue Book]]'' that summarizes the state of diplomatic relations and aid to foreign countries.  Drawing information from both the Ministry of Finance (MoF) reports and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) summaries gives subtle clues about differing goals between the ministries.

==Methodologies==
This thesis is a descriptive work that first looks at the bilateral relations between Japan and Vietnam and then addresses the international and domestic factors that may have affected Tokyo's policy toward Hanoi.  Chapters are arranged chronologically, and factors are organized by country or bureaucracy within each chapter.

===Chronology===
The thesis is divided into five chapters: the introductory chapter, three chapters discussing the factors surrounding this relationship, and a chapter containing the conclusions derived from the description of international and domestic factors.  The three middle chapters will divide the period chronologically.  Chapter 2 presents the international and domestic powers that carried influence in Tokyo on the eve of the invasion of Cambodia in 1978 and the steps Japan took against Vietnam in the early years of the embargo period.  Chapter 3 covers the years from 1985 through 1989 and discusses discussing the economic reforms within Vietnam and Japan's gradually increasing role in Southeast Asia. Chapter 4 outlines the sequence of diplomatic events and pressures that led to a resumption of aid in 1992.  Chapter 5 contains the conclusions we can draw from the thesis on bilateral, international, and domestic levels.

===International factors===
Within each of these chronologically divided chapters, I address both the international and domestic factors that I think influenced Japan's policies.  Internationally, I focus on the major players in the region: the United States, the USSR, China, ASEAN, and factions in Cambodia (known also as Kampuchea).  The United States cannot be ignored because Washington led the charge for sanctions against Vietnam and maintained a full trade embargo until 1994.  The USS.R, as Vietnam's parent state and longtime antagonist to US positions in Asia, must be included in any discussion about Indochina.  Strained Japan-Soviet relations must also be addressed when discussing Tokyo's policy toward a communist country.  Japan concluded a friendship treaty with Beijing within weeks of the United States' doing so in 1978, just prior to the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.  Beijing's support of the Khmer Rouge pitted China against Vietnam, which led to a &quot;punishment&quot; war in 1979.  China was and is a major focus of Tokyo's foreign policy in Asia; therefore, the Tokyo-Beijing relationship during this period must be examined to understand politics in Indochina.  

Along with the superpowers-- the United States, the Soviet Union, and China-- ASEAN and factions in Cambodia certainly affected Japan's Vietnam policy.  ASEAN was perhaps the most vociferous in its condemnation of Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia.  Throughout the period under study, Japan floated trial balloons of reconciliation toward Indochina, only to be lambasted in the press by ministers from ASEAN countries.  Under the Fukuda Doctrine, ASEAN took a primary position in Japan's foreign policy goals and economic assistance programs.  In order to understand the hurdles between Tokyo and Hanoi, this thesis includes Tokyo's dealings with ASEAN and how they affected the Japan-Vietnam relationship.

Cambodia comes into play in the Japan-Vietnam relationship on a significant level only after 1985.  Up until that point, Cambodia (or Kampuchea) hardly existed as a nation- state in the international context.  However, as Tokyo began to increase her role in searching for a solution to the Cambodian problem, resolution of that problem became a central point between Japan and Vietnam.

==Hunches and assumptions==
&lt;p&gt;  Going into this work, I assumed Japan would align itself closely with the United States in security matters but leave the door open for development of economic ties.  Previous study of Japan's relations with Vietnam during the Vietnam War (Second Indochina War 1964-75) showed that Tokyo attempted to follow an &quot;omnidirectional&quot; (zenp“) policy in the East-West confrontation in word but cooperated with the United States in a secondary or supportive (and very low profile) role.  When President Carter announced the normalization of relations with China in 1978, Japan acted quickly to avoid another Nixon shock.  Thus it is reasonable to assume that (1) Japan would act in concert with the United States and China against Hanoi's actions, and (2) Japan's &quot;omnidirectional&quot; or nonmilitary policies would require it to search for some middle ground and maintain some relations with Vietnam.

&lt;p&gt;  As bilateral trade grew from 1985 onward, I assumed Japan would grow more lenient toward Hanoi at the behest of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and Japan's private sector.  However, as I will show, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dominated the relationship with Vietnam and withheld economic assistance (the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance) until 1992 both out of deference to the United States and in an effort to minimize the international perception of Japan's &quot;checkbook&quot; or &quot;merchant diplomacy.&quot;

==Background history==
Southeast Asia has proven crucial to production in postwar Japan.  Beginning with the American occupation of Japan following WWII, US policymakers attempted to keep Japan harmless by breaking up large industries and limiting farms to seven acres.  However, the rising Soviet threat in Europe and China's fall to Mao Tse Tung and the communists in 1949 prompted Supreme Command Allied Powers (SCAP) to change course.  Japan's recovery would occur only with domestic prosperity via vigorous trade with other Asian countries.  With China out of the trade picture,  American policymakers looked to steer Japan toward Southeast Asia.  Edward  M. Doherty of the Far Eastern Bureau's Office of Northeast Asian Affairs summed up the issue: 
:''How can we utilize idle labor and capital in Japan to furnish the needed economic assistance to the countries of South Asia now threatened by communism and at the same time help Japan balance its international accounts and become independent of  US assistance?''

SCAP and the bureaucratic equivalents in Washington agreed to end the occupation and turn Japan's economy toward exporting to Asia to ensure security, political stability and economic welfare of the region.  In order to secure Asia from the threat of communism, the West funneled aid money through the International Cooperation Administration (ICA), where purchases or procurement often wound up as profits in Japan's economy. Indochina figured greatly as an economic front, both to shore up Japan's economy and to stop communist expansion in a classic colonialism economic plan.

===War Reparations 1960-1965===
In 1951, in San Francisco, Japan signed a formal peace treaty that included the Bao Dai government of South Vietnam.  Japan did not recognize the Ho Chih Minh government. War reparations treaties followed, with Japan and South Vietnam signing an agreement in May 1959.   The French initially demanded $2 billion in reparations from the Japanese at the peace conference in San Francisco.  However, both sides eventually agreed on $39 million, the Vietnamese themselves understanding that the payments were a sort of investment for Japanese exporters preparing markets in Indochina.  War reparations were an essential precursor to any economic diplomacy in Southeast Asia.  The reparations came to be seen as economic opportunity for both parties.  Beginning in 1960, Japan was to pay $10 million for the first three years and $4.5 million for the next two years, totalling the $39 million.

The content of these payments, however, provides insight into Japan's motives in providing reparations.  $27.8 million was earmarked for a dam at Da Nhim, $7.5 million for consumer goods, $2 million for use at Saigon's discretion, and $1.7 million for the South Vietnamese delegation to use in Tokyo.  Almost all of the money would end up back in Japan through contracts for construction equipment and services connected with the Da Nhim project.  War reparations to Indochina and other parts of Asia entitled to payments under the San Francisco Treaty became an echo of America's Marshall Plan economics, with money funneled to poor countries to enable trade and export production in the mother country.  The only difference is that this money was &quot;required,&quot; not donated.  

===American Escalation: 1965-1970===
War reparations ended in 1965.  Follow-up loans, however, were postponed indefinitely because of the escalating war in South Vietnam.  US forces increased dramatically in 1965.  Accompanying this increase in manpower and firepower in Vietnam was the subsequent increase in support apparatus and secondary equipment (noncombat.)  The Japanese could not participate in military activities because of  to Article IX, which restricted offensive forces, in Japan's constitution.  However, the legalities of economic cooperation in supporting military action were at best a grey area.  The Sato cabinet in Japan followed US diplomatic stances toward China and Vietnam with deference, but allowed tacit economic collaboration with the US military effort.  Article VI of the 1960 US-Japan Security Treaty allowed US forces the use of base facilities in Japan  to assure not only Japan's security but also &quot;international peace and security in the Far East.&quot;  The Sato government interpreted the security treaty as allowing the US military machine to use bases in connection with Vietnam short of flying directly into combat from them.  Although Vietnam was not in the original definition of &quot;Far East,&quot; the Vietnam War did pose a threat to security in the Far East according to the Sato government.  Thus the conduits for military-industrial spending in Japan were set:  money from US procurement flowed directly to stations in Japan, along with money for the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) support equipment to be exported from Japan and the money earmarked for the US forces' supplies to its swelling ranks on the ground in Vietnam. All these funds passed through the Japanese economy in some form or another.

US forces in Vietnam relied heavily on Japanese products.  Havens catalogs some of these items in his 1987 book &lt;i&gt;Fire Across the Sea&lt;/i&gt;:
:''Data from MITI [Ministry of International Trade and Industry] show that Japanese firms supplied most of the materials needed for camps and bases: prefabricated buildings, lumber, cement, cranes, generators, tents, jeeps, and toilet paper.  American soldiers drank Kirin beer, chewed Lotte gum, and ate Chiba lettuce.  American pilots dropped more than a billion propaganda leaflets, written in Vietnamese and printed in Kanagawa [Japan].''

Japanese factories were closer to Vietnam, advantageous for both time and transportation costs, and Japanese labor was skilled, fastidious, and cheap.  Many of the quality control methods and high technology-based factory processes benefited from manufacturing the heavy-industry specialized products developed for the war.

The Vietnam War's effect on special procurement can be estimated by taking a base figure of $314 million (personal consumption for US forces and dependents, payroll for Japanese employees on bases, and payments for supplies and services) for pre-1965 levels, and noting the increase to $516 million in 1967, an increase of $202 million because of escalated activity linked to Vietnam.  Havens further notes:

:''The Bank [of Japan] concluded that '''direct Vietnam procurement earned Japan''' $292 million in 1967, rising to a peak of $467 million three years later.  It was widely believed during the war that another $150 million (perhaps twice that sum) in less visible purchases of politically sensitive goods like weapons and chemicals went publicly unrecorded each year.[italics added]''

However, direct procurement to Vietnam and increased US military support expenditures in Japan accounts for only part of the equation.  Goods exported to other countries, like South Korea, Taiwan, and other Southeast Asian states, went to fill procurement contracts eventually destined for Vietnam.  

President Johnson issued a &quot;buy American&quot; policy in 1967.  Textiles and light industry began to move toward Southeast Asia, but Japanese production still prospered because only they could produce certain items like cameras, truck diesel engines, locomotives, and two-way radios.  Aircraft repair and overhauling rose 146 percent in 1966, and naval repair jumped 378 percent.  Some economists estimate R&amp;R in Japan added $13 to 20 million annually from 1965 to 1970.

In all, leading financial institutions estimate that the total economic impact of the Vietnam war-- from escalated military activity at US bases in Japan, to direct procurement, to increased exports to fill military contracts in third countries-- to be about $1 trillion annually from 1965-1967.  Sanwa Bank, Nomura Sogo Institute, and Nihon Kangyo Bank all give much higher figures than MITI estimates.  Exports to South Vietnam increased dramatically beginning in 1966-- peaking in 1969 at a level of $223,156,000-- while imports from Vietnam never rose above $7,000,000 until 1972, when levels rose to $30 million: the increase came mostly from timber and fishery products.

===An Opportunity, Not a Problem===
Japan, despite her constitutional restrictions on waging war except to in self-defense, participated heavily in the military-industrial complex connected to the Vietnam War.  War reparations provided the seeding ground for economic export to South Vietnam in the early 1960s, a pattern learned from the American Marshall plan and ICA in Asia during the 1950s.  On top of this export market, increased US military activity in Japan-based operations (shipping, airlifting, secondary equipment) coupled with direct procurement to South Vietnam for purchases from Japan and increased exports to fill military-industrial contracts in several countries, including the United States, combined to expand the Japanese economy almost $1 trillion annually during the height of the US involvement in Vietnam from 1965-1970.  The ruling conservatives in Japan saw Vietnam for what it was, both good diplomacy with the United States and good politics among their big business constituents.  Murakami Yoshio, a member of the cabinet at the time, was noted as saying, &quot;the Vietnam War to Japanese conservatives was an opportunity, not a problem.&quot;  This investment opportunity suffered a severe blow the winter of 1978 when Vietnamese tanks rolled into Phnom Penh.  Tokyo cut off aid to Hanoi, and trade dropped off across the board.  The rest of this thesis describes the long, slow process toward the resumption of aid and the development of a working relationship between Japan and Vietnam.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the United Kingdom, '''stamp duty''' is a form of tax charged on instruments (that is, written documents), and requires a physical stamp to be attached to or impressed upon the instrument in question.  

The scope of stamp duty has been reduced dramatically in recent years.  Apart from transfers of shares and securities, the issue of bearer instruments and certain transactions involving partnerships, stamp duty was largely abolished in the UK from 1 December, 2003.  Stamp duty land tax (SDLT), a new transfer tax derived from stamp duty, was introduced for land transactions from 1 December 2003.  Stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) was introduced on agreements to transfer certain shares and other securities in 1986.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) was introduced under Finance Act 1986 to ensure that a form of tax equivalent to stamp duty would continue to be payable on the transfer of uncertificated shares.  At that time, it was expected that the TAURUS share trading system would come into operation.  In the event, SDRT was adapted for the charge to trading in uncertificated shares in CREST, and is charged on agreements to transfer shares and other securities.  SDRT is not a stamp tax, but a self-assessed transfer tax which is usually collected automatically by stock market participants (such as brokers) when a transaction takes place.

Stamp duty remains in force for shares and securities that are held in certificated form which can only be transferred by using a physical stock transfer form, and runs in parallel to SDRT on agreements to transfer shares.  Since 1986, both stamp duty and SDRT have been charged at a rate of 0.5% of the consideration for the transfer of shares (in the case of stamp duty, rounded up to the nearest £5).  The same transaction may include an agreement to transfer shares which may trigger a liability to SDRT, and the agreement may later be completed by a transfer of the shares which is liable to stamp duty.  Provided that the transfer is stamped within 6 years, the charge to SDRT is cancelled to avoid a double charge.

A higher rate of SDRT at 1.5% is charged for the issue or transfer of shares to a person who operates a depositary receipt scheme or a clearance service (other than CREST, which is exempted).  The higher charge compensates for the fact that later transfers of depositary interests or through the clearance services will not attract SDRT.

It is widely expected, although the UK Treasury may wish otherwise, that as a practical matter SDRT will not ultimately survive the introduction of the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID.) which is designed to create a single market in financial services across the EU. As currently operated, SDRT will create a number of tax, legal and operational barriers that could effectively present an uneven playing field. It is totally unclear how UK Tax Authorities could hope to police transctions wholly effected in other member states.

There is little sign that this is clearly understood by the UK Government nor even faintly comprehended by the UK Stamp Office who are still stuck on the concept of imposing SDRT on transactions effected on national exchanges

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stamp duty land tax (SDLT) is a new tax in land transactions that was introduced by Finance Act 2003 and largely replaces stamp duty with effect from 1 December, 2003.  SDLT is not a stamp duty, but a form of self-assessed transfer tax.  SDLT is charged on &quot;land transactions&quot; and for typical transactions in land, such as the buying and selling of a residential house, there is little change from stamp duty, except that a tax return is required to be made to the Inland Revenue and documents no longer need to be given a physical stamp.  Like any other self-assessed tax, but unlike stamp duty, the Inland Revenue is able to enquire into an SDLT return and raise assessments to recover unpaid SDLT.

For residential house purchases, the current rates in the UK are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Consideration !! Rate
|-
|up to £125,000 || 0%
|-
|over £125,000 to £250,000 || 1%
|-
|over £250,000 to £500,000 || 3%
|-
|over £500,000 || 4%
|}

SDLT is not a progressive tax, but rather works on a &quot;slab&quot; basis, so the above percentages apply to the whole of the purchase price. For example, a house priced at £250,000 would attract a SDLT of £2,500, but one of £250,001 would be liable to SDLT of £7,500. Some areas have been designated as disadvantaged areas and have relief from SDLT on residential transactions below a certain level.

In previous years, there had been a high level of house price inflation in the UK but no change in these thresholds, leading to a substantial increase in the revenue from SDLT through fiscal drag. In 2000-01, the Inland Revenue received £2.145bn from residential stamp duty. In 2002-03, it received £3.59bn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/stamp_duty/03IR153.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the threshold for paying SDLT was raised from £60,000 to £120,000.  In 2006, the threshold was further raised to £125,000.

In addition to SDLT on the purchase price for land, SDLT is also charged when a lease is granted.  Any premium for the grant is charged to SDLT at the same rates as for the purchase price for a sale of land; SDLT is also charged on the rent payable under the lease, at the rate of 1% of the (discounted) net present value of rent passing under the whole term of the lease.  Previously, stamp duty was charged at rate of up to 24% of the annual rent.  The amount of SDLT due on the grant of a typical commercial lease generally amounts to a substantial increase from the amount of stamp duty that would have been due previously.

SDLT is also charged on certain transactions involving the transfer of land involving partnerships (transfers of land from or to the partners, or changes in the partners' partnership interests where the partnership owns land).

Whether or not tax is payable Her Majesty's Customs and Revenue require a Return to be received by them within four weeks of the transaction completing failing which they have power to levy a fine on the tax payer - the fine is not for failure to pay the tax but for failure to make the return.  When a return is accepted by HMRC they provide a Certificate without which it is impossible to register a change in the land ownership.

=Chapter 3:Increased Trade in a Changing International Setting, 1985-1989=
During the latter half of the 1980s, Communist bloc countries moved toward economic renovation, no longer able to function under the weight of command economies. On a macro level, Soviet Premier Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika softened the Soviet threat in the eyes of the West. Economic reforms were sweeping through the Asian Communist powers as well. When Deng Xiaoping shifted the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) priorities toward modernization before revolutionary ideology, China began an earnest move toward a close relationship with the West. Similarly, Vietnam's leaders began the Doi Moi (economic renovation) reforms in December of 1986, which emphasized modernizing the economy and improving Vietnam's markets. These sweeping attitudinal changes among Asian powers, coupled with increased bilateral Japan-Vietnam trade, paved the way for the eventual restoration of economic assistance from Tokyo and unrestricted economic relations between Japan and Vietnam.

This chapter first looks at the international factors surrounding Japan's position in the region and Japan's attitude toward Vietnam, including Tokyo's position concerning policies between regional powers. It then investigates the domestic political and economic pressures that set up Japan and Vietnam for closer relations. The shift from security concerns to economic priorities occurred throughout the region and within Vietnam and Japan as well. This changing international setting placed Tokyo in a position of power in the region as the Japanese maximized the effect of their foreign aid and extended the advantages of Japan's centrist diplomatic style.

This chapter will address the issue of how the changing international climate affected Japan's &quot;middle&quot; position. As ASEAN and Indochinese countries looked to develop their economies, Japan's influence in Southeast Asia via development aid increased. Conversely, Vietnam felt the increasing burden of its incursion into Cambodia as valuable developmental aid from Japan, France, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank continued to elude Hanoi. When Vietnam announced the withdrawal of troops from Cambodia in 1989, regional powers were in a quandary on how soon and in what manner to handle resumption of normal economic assistance to Indochina. Japan, which had acted somewhat as Vietnam's advocate to the United States and ASEAN, shifted its emphasis to economic enticements for the entire region if a comprehensive political solution could be found to the Cambodian question.

Domestically, factors such as oil and raw material imports from Vietnam came to play the dominant role in the Japan-Vietnam association. Political posturing on whether or not to extend aid to Hanoi had ended, and bureaucrats from the Foreign Ministry quietly kept ties with Vietnam on a reduced level. The Foreign Ministry looked toward filling a leadership role in solving the Cambodian crisis among ASEAN and Western powers concerned with the region, and it pushed the Japanese government into an active role in providing aid for the region. Because Hanoi's international debt problems showed promise of resolution, the Ministry of Finance looked to service Vietnam's debt to further economic stability and trade with Japan.

This chapter covers the period from 1985 to 1989, a period of political stalemate in Indochina but dynamic economic evolution throughout Southeast Asia, including Vietnam. The changes in the region dramatically increased Tokyo's leadership in terms of foreign aid and highlighted Hanoi's need for economic rejuvenation. The shift in priorities for ASEAN, China, and Vietnam allowed Japan to slowly increase contact with Vietnam, eventually setting the stage for resuming aid in 1992.

==International Developments==

===The International Monetary Fund===
International monetary organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) dealt a harsh blow to Hanoi in 1985. The purpose of such lending institutions is to facilitate economic reform, infrastructural development, and the stabilization of currency via loans and grants-- exactly what Hanoi needed to solidify its postwar economy. However, the leadership of the IMF looked at Vietnam's stagnant growth rates and spiraling inflation rates and saw no hope for Vietnam to repay the debts already incurred to the IMF. Subsequently, the IMF suspended aid in 1985, when Vietnam defaulted on overdue loans. Economists agreed that Vietnam would have to settle its IMF debts before it could attract Western investment. According to the State Bank of Vietnam, these debts stood at about $130 million. The IMF also told Vietnam that it must introduce a &quot;comprehensive economic adjustment programme&quot; to stabilize the country's economy. In 1987, the IMF agreed to help Vietnam arrange foreign loans to cover two-thirds of the country's arrears, if Hanoi first paid the remaining third from its own resources, but this payment never materialized. By 1989, Vietnam began to make token payments on the interest due to the IMF under the &quot;intense collaborative approach&quot; while the IMF and the World Bank gave Hanoi nineteen recommendations for stabilizing its economy in order to maintain interest payments.

The ADB had yet to extend loans to Vietnam, and would not do so until 1992. Even though ADB regulations forbid discriminating against countries because of their political and social issues, Vietnam's international debt problems prevented the ADB from extending credit to Hanoi. In 1989, ADB programs director Ronald Skeats expressed optimism:

 We would like to resume lending [to Vietnam], and the
 portents are rather positive as soon as this perception is shared
 among all ADB member countries.[italics added]
        

The conditional statement &quot;among all&quot; is in reference to Japan and the United States, two leading shareholders in the ADB that had taken a hard-line position against Hanoi and refused Vietnam access to funds. Washington needed to pressure Hanoi on the POW/MIA issue, and Tokyo needed to maintain its close relationship with Washington. Optimism aside, Vietnam needed help from donor countries such as Japan and France to underwrite the outstanding debts. It would be well into 1992 when Vietnam and the ADB came to terms.

These international bodies hoped for change as Vietnam embarked on economic reorganization efforts in 1986. Vietnam's economy improved greatly under the Doi Moi reforms. Officials in Japan's Foreign Ministry received Hanoi's change of direction with some reserve. At the time, Tokyo predicted Vietnam's reforms would follow a strict Soviet model, with tighter social controls to maintain the primacy of the party within an economic restructuring. Despite a change of leadership in Hanoi and Vietnam's pledges for better relations, Japan's Foreign Ministry did not expect any progress in relations with China, Japan, or the United States.

Vietnam's export-led growth centered around its wealth of raw materials, most notably the crude oil exports that began in 1985. By 1989, officials at the IMF and World Bank considered &quot;an exemplary Vietnamese effort at economic stabilization and structural adjustment&quot; and contemplated Vietnam's reentry into the multilateral financial institutions. However, Washington and Tokyo insisted that Vietnam must not only withdraw its troops from Cambodia but also contribute to a long-term political settlement of the Cambodian crisis. The U.S. and Japan were calling for a comprehensive solution, that included an internationally controlled supervision team to verify the withdrawal. IMF officials, wary of attaching political conditions to its aid policies, stressed Vietnam's economic progress in their report, but US and Japanese objections could not be overcome. One IMF official declared:

 [The IMF] should not be held hostage . . . The US and
 Japan can do what they want with their bilateral aid, but they
 should not bring in their poorly disguised political agenda into
 multilateral institutions dedicated to solving economic problems.
 The fund and the bank must lead the way into Vietnam because
 all the bilateral aid relationships are waiting for the signal from
 us.

Though most officials at the IMF approved of Vietnam's progress, the United States and Japan held enough strength within the multilateral lending body to halt funds for Vietnam. Washington and Tokyo demanded a more comprehensive solution to the Cambodian issue, because both countries were anxious to prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge but could not state this openly because of diplomatic ties to Beijing.

By 1989, Do Muoi (not to be confused with Doi Moi), the Vietnamese Premier, courted Japan directly by stating that IMF funds were forthcoming as soon as Hanoi paid the first third of its debts. Muoi accused Western countries of taking the Cambodian occupation as a pretext to continue their &quot;politically hostile policies and impose economic sanctions against Vietnam.&quot; Reassuring Tokyo that the scheduled pullout of troops would continue despite the lack of an international control mechanism to inspect the withdrawal, Muoi pressed Japan to resume aid because the pretext would no longer exist, but to no avail. Support from the IMF and ADB, along with Japanese economic assistance, wouldn't resume until 1992.

Given Tokyo's desire to claim the middle ground and Japan's willingness to provide aid to international bodies, a quick analysis would predict that Japan should support IMF and ADB liberalization toward Vietnam. But Tokyo's solidarity with Washington in demanding a comprehensive peace reveals two developments: (1) Japan's unity with the United States in foreign policy toward Asia continued through this period, and (2) Tokyo's increased influence via foreign aid (or withholding aid) was accompanied by a new assertiveness toward bringing peace to Indochina [see the section Foreign Ministry below].

===The United States v. Honda Motor Company===

The United States continued to pressure Japan to increase its regional leadership during the second half of the 1980s. Washington welcomed increasing levels of Japanese Overseas Development Aid (ODA) to crucial &quot;front-line&quot; countries such as the Philippines and Malaysia. At the same time, the United States continued to aid Democratic Kampuchean forces as well as pressure Hanoi with economic sanctions. However, some allies weren't &quot;playing with the team&quot; in the eyes of some senators. Japan, in particular, with increasing levels of trade in crude oil, lumber, fish, and machinery, looked as though it were compromising Washington's tough stance against Hanoi. In September 1987, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution stating:

 The Congress hereby strongly urges Japan to (A) prevent
 its private business sector from engaging in developmental trade
 with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and (B) discontinue
 specific Japanese trading practices with Vietnam which provide
 long-term credits and developmental equipment, including
 equipment for oil and gas development, forestry and fishery
 production, development of commodities for light industries, and
 the upgrading of production capacities for export purposes.

Senator Katsen (WI), who proposed the resolution to the Senate floor, lambasted the Japanese government for its apparent indifference to Western efforts to isolate Vietnam. The Senator singled out Honda Motor Company, which had plans to build a motorcycle factory in Vietnam but cancelled its plans after learning of the threat of losing the U.S. market under the Trading with the Enemy Act. Senator McCain (AZ), a Vietnam War POW, commended the resolution and added vivid stories of Vietnam's atrocities in Cambodia. Finally, Senator Jesse Helms (NC) harped on Japanese business practices in general, calling Japanese businessmen &quot;the scavengers of the world,&quot; and cited several examples where Japan had crossed the embargo lines against Nicaragua as further proof of his accusation.

The next day, Honda Motor Company abandoned its plans for a motorcycle plant in Vietnam as well as plans for economic relations in Cambodia and Laos. The Senate criticism came on the heels of a Toshiba delivery of computer equipment to the Soviet Union, after which Toshiba lost its American market because of a Senate resolution. The pressure was felt in official channels as well. A &quot;Japanese diplomatic source&quot; announced that Japanese companies would slow down investment in Vietnam:

 The question of private trade between Tokyo and Hanoi
 was brought up [in a visit to Hanoi by Kineo Fujita of the
 Foreign Ministry] and we do not think it is a good time to
 increase Japanese investment in this country.

Hanoi, as could be expected, rebutted the resolution in a fiery commentary against the &quot;perfidious schemes&quot; and &quot;obstinate furtherance of their hostile policy against Vietnam.&quot; Vietnam had the right, it claimed, to conduct business with countries outside the Socialist realm just as EEC members traded with Eastern European countries or the U.S. traded with the Soviet Union. Beijing, however, ran an editorial in Renmin Ribao, citing Japan's trade with South Africa despite an international embargo, and calling on the Japanese to &quot;think twice when faced with a choice between 'profits' and 'morality.'&quot;

The Senate resolution and ensuing retreat of official Japanese channels shows that Washington still held sway in Japan's foreign policy. The delicate balance of Japan-U.S. relations depended on U.S. security issues in Asia as well as Japanese corporations' access to the American market. Toshiba's violation of the COMECON trade restrictions against Communist bloc countries and the Senate's response to that violation proved to be a lesson for businesses dealing with Vietnam.

Several points can be divined from Japan's reaction to what probably amounted to domestic posturing by U.S. Senators (1987 saw a slight recession in the U.S. and recessions always breed Japan-bashers). Tokyo could have reined in Honda for several reasons: (1) open defiance of U.S. Congressional resolutions only invites more resolutions, which would bring all Japanese operations in third-world countries under criticism; (2) placing manufacturing plants within Vietnam could upset ASEAN and China because they would have lost an offshore production contract, and (3) as with the Toshiba case, Honda's production could aid Vietnam's efforts in Kampuchea, and would therefore run counter to Tokyo's foreign policy goals, though this last point sounds like a good cover for what probably amounted to simple kowtowing for the sake of Japanese-U.S. relations.

While it was diplomatically advantageous for Tokyo to take the center between Washington and Hanoi, the diplomatic costs for moving ahead of the United States outweighed any economic advantages gained by increasing investment in Vietnam. For the United States, censuring Japan via the Honda case seemed sufficient because the U.S. State Department had more pressing issues in the POW/MIA problem-- the United States could not exactly serve out indictments with clean hands.

===China's diplomatic efforts===

Sino-Japanese relations progressed rapidly after the signing of the Peace and Friendship Treaty in 1978. Beijing sought Japanese investment to shore up its modernization efforts; Japan sought access to China's vast resources and huge consumer market. A main priority of the Chinese dignitaries visiting Tokyo, it seems, was to stress the need for official and commodity loans by the Japanese government, much the same pitch Trinh had made to Tokyo in 1978. The difference was that China presented no immediate security risks to ASEAN and the West, while Vietnam's behavior in Indochina was unpredictable.

In Indochina, Beijing remained stalemated with the Soviets over what to do about Cambodia. From the Chinese stance, Vietnam was acting as Moscow's puppet in order for Russia to surround China, a perception further bolstered by the continuing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Tokyo, while valuing its good relations with Beijing, was leery of aligning too closely in an &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; pact, and did its best to steer clear of Sino-Vietnamese problems, stressing economic development instead.

In January 1989, Beijing and Hanoi agreed that Vietnamese troops would withdraw from Cambodia by September 1989, and China would stop its military aid to anti-Vietnamese resistance forces, thereby effectively ending external involvement in the protracted conflict. A war-weary and capital-starved Vietnam appeared ready to deal with China, which was looking to improve its international and regional power in light of a collapsing Soviet presence in East Asia. Beijing's solution for improving Sino-Vietnamese relations complemented Japan's agenda for the region. China demanded that Vietnam must withdraw from Cambodia and Laos under some sort of international supervision, end the Soviet presence in Cam Ranh Bay, and accept Chinese sovereignty over the Spratly Islands.

Except for the Spratly Islands issue, these demands were compatible with Tokyo's stated positions. With Vietnamese troops out of Cambodia, Tokyo's Ministry of Finance and MITI could reactivate their plans to send aid and loans to Vietnam. Tokyo had demanded Soviet withdrawal from Cam Ranh Bay in 1979 when Japan was still toying with the idea of sending economic assistance. Furthermore, Beijing's concession of ending support for the anti-government factions in Cambodia (specifically the troublesome Khmer Rouge) certainly sat well with ASEAN (and therefore Japan), which was wary of increased Chinese hegemony in the region. Hanoi was also ready to solicit ASEAN investment and the huge pool of loans that would come from the IMF and World Bank if a solution to the Cambodian issue could be found.

Perhaps the most crucial influence on Japan-Vietnam relations coming from Beijing was the Sino-Soviet summit in the spring of 1989. By the time of the summit, the Cambodian question had become how to fill the vacuum left by withdrawing Vietnamese troops. Chinese officials reported to their Japanese counterparts that China had proposed a coalition government with the Heng Samrin (the Vietnamese puppet regime) and the three opposition factions-- an idea rejected by the Heng Samrin and Vietnam. Vietnam had preempted China by announcing that a troop withdrawal would be completed by September. At the summit, China and the Soviet Union issued a nine-point communique that outlined the superpowers' positions on Cambodia. In what appeared to be a competition over who would take credit for resolving the issue, China pushed the Soviets to help reach a political solution before the scheduled September withdrawal in order to give Beijing the prize of &quot;solving Cambodia.&quot; Li Peng met Prince Sihanouk just hours before the conference with the USSR and expressed China's support for the former Cambodian head of state. Points in the communique included (1) the need for an &quot;effective control mechanism&quot; to supervise a Vietnamese troop withdrawal, (2) an end to military aid to the various factions, (3) the holding of free elections, (4) the convening of an international conference on Cambodia &quot;when conditions are ripe,&quot; (5) no foreign troops or military bases in Cambodia after Vietnam's withdrawal, and (6) that the UN will play its &quot;appropriate role as conditions gradually present themselves.&quot;

Though Japan's Foreign Ministry issued no immediate statement about the communique, points outlining international participation, the banning of foreign troops, and the promise of an international conference on Cambodia forwarded Tokyo's goals for the region. Japanese foreign policy held the United Nations in high regard, and subsequent offers by Foreign Minister Kurinari that pledged Japan's participation through the UN on a solution in Cambodia give evidence of Japan's support of the communique. Tokyo's nonresponse may be seen as an attempt to avoid the appearance of Sino-Japanese collusion in Southeast Asia. Japan's aid and trade with China was developing rapidly, as were Japan's financial ties to ASEAN. Tokyo did not need to show a comment or act on China's efforts in resolving Cambodia: Japan's goals were being met regardless of Tokyo's approval of Beijing's moves, and Japan only risked confusing the issue (compromising its middle ground) by commenting on Sino-Vietnamese relations.

===ASEAN's shift from security to economic development===
In 1979, When Tokyo suspended economic aid to Vietnam, the realpolitik of Soviet containment and China-courting played the dominant roles in determining Western governments' policies in Southeast Asia. At the time, ASEAN was little more than a regional grouping of underdeveloped, free-market economies. Communiques issued collectively by the foreign ministers of ASEAN concerning security issues and calls for action from the superpowers came only after Vietnam posed a real threat in Indochina by invading Cambodia.

Apart from the common security stance against Vietnam, ASEAN's power grew rapidly in economic terms during the 1980s-- in no small part because of the massive amounts of trade and aid from Japan. As Tokyo placed top priority status on Southeast Asia, alongside its relations with the United States and China, ASEAN's clout in Tokyo grew. Indeed, as Japanese corporations sought fertile investment opportunities for offshore production, trade with ASEAN countries blossomed.

At the 1987 ASEAN Ministers' Conference, Foreign Minister Kurinari outlined a plan for a &quot;new fund&quot; to provide low-interest financing for joint ventures and debt relief. Japan needed to recycle its trade surplus with ASEAN countries, as well as move beyond the vertical integration inherent in the Fukuda Doctrine. According to Kurinari, Japan would place emphasis on horizontal integration within the region and on bringing relations between Japan and ASEAN to account for factors in the entire Asia-Pacific region, not just within ASEAN.

Certainly Tokyo was well aware of the economic drag that Vietnam and the festering Cambodian issue were placing on development in Southeast Asia. Reports in the Japan Economic Journal looked forward to the economic possibilities coming from emerging communist countries:

 Moreover, China and the Soviet Union have set out on a
 new Asia-Pacific policy which emphasizes the economy.  This
 new economic rationalism appears to be spreading to Vietnam as
 well, and may soon provide new opportunities in reaching a
 political resolution to the Kampuchean conflict.

As ASEAN increased in economic power, its voice on the difficulties in Cambodia grew stronger. Replacements for the cold war containment models used in the 1970s, Japan's policies that centered on foreign aid seemed to be giving adding more credence to ASEAN's developmental outlook in the region.

The ASEAN countries had always been the most vociferous of regional the players in their opposition to giving any kind of economic advantage to Hanoi. However, the danger of such zealotry is that it allows others to &quot;cheat&quot;: knowing that ASEAN would take the polar position against Vietnam gave Tokyo room to move toward the middle ground between ASEAN and Hanoi. Because of ASEAN's tough stance, Japan could allow trade to increase without taking the political heat for &quot;compromising&quot; the economic limits placed against Vietnam, since Japan merely had to vocalize its support for ASEAN's position without taking hard action.

For example, by the mid-1980s, Hanoi began to court Japanese trading houses with its wealth of natural resources. Vietsovpetro began pumping oil in 1985. Shrimp, rice, and lumber production all did well under the Doi Moi reforms in Vietnam. As Nissho- Iwai and other large Japanese trading houses began to do business with Vietnam in crude oil, agricultural projects, marine products, and lumber, ASEAN was caught in a trap: continuing a hard-line stance against trade with Vietnam could upset probusiness MITI and the Ministry of Finance in Japan. An upset which could endanger aid and trade relations with ASEAN's primary trade partner, but compromising on the Japan-Vietnam trade issue might undermine the pressure on Hanoi to withdraw from Cambodia.

This dilemma broke in Tokyo's favor in May 1987, when Singapore Foreign Minister Suppiah Dhanabalan declared that ASEAN no longer objected to Japanese trading firms' plans to do business in Vietnam. However, Dhanabalan placed limitations on ASEAN's allowances: Nissho-Iwai could do business in Vietnam, &quot;providing it is purely commercial,'' and provided that the company did not extend export credit to Vietnam. This allowance did not apply to government-controlled economic policies. ASEAN would object if the Japanese government or governmental bodies extended export credit or aid of any other kind to Hanoi. The Singapore foreign minister reiterated that ASEAN's economic policies toward Vietnam did not include trade embargoes or economic boycotts but did oppose any noncommercial quasi-government assistance to increase trade or economic aid. The Foreign Ministry responded:

 Last Friday, the Foreign Ministry requested that some
 Japanese companies be more careful in doing business with
 Vietnam so that foreign nations do not misunderstand Japan's
 stance against Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia.

The Foreign Ministry acknowledged Dhanabalan's concerns, but gave no definitive policy regarding trade with Vietnam. In fact, the Japanese government had come to the defense of Nissho-Iwai against accusations by ASEAN officials:

 The government told ASEAN last week that its
 investigations showed Nissho Iwai's activities in Vietnam to be
 of a strictly business nature, and that businesses have been
 warned not to engage in activities that may arouse the suspicions
 of the noncommunist nations of Southeast Asia.

Dhanabalan retreated by saying that ASEAN would object if the Japanese government gave export credit or aid to Hanoi, but ASEAN did not believe that it would stop Japanese firms selling their products to Vietnam for money it [Vietnam] already had or had received from the Soviet Union. &quot;ASEAN's concern is to deny Vietnam aid, not to have a trade embargo.&quot;

The similarities to the U.S. Congressional protest against Honda in September of that same year cannot be ignored. In both cases, foreign officials complained to Tokyo about a Japanese firm's dealings in Vietnam. In both cases, the Foreign Ministry publicly censured the &quot;offending&quot; company, stating that the risk of &quot;upsetting the international situation&quot; (or in other words, jeopardizing Japan's position in the middle) dictated caution. However, in response to ASEAN's complaint, Japan's Foreign Ministry released subsequent statements that defended Japan's commercial interest, while in response to the United States, Japan did not justify its business when Congress complained against Honda. This difference demonstrates the hierarchy in Japan's foreign relations: U.S. complaints are heard and adjusted to, whereas ASEAN's complaints are merely heard.

By 1989, ASEAN member Thailand began to move toward closer relations with its Indochina Peninsula neighbors Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The Thai government hoped for new joint ventures in fishing and agriculture and instructed Thailand's National Security Council to study ideas to increase trade with Vietnam. The private sector in Thailand had traded with Vietnam throughout the Cambodian crisis, but now the Thai government was hinting at official trade programs with Vietnam and Cambodia. Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan even remarked that Thailand should concentrate on changing Indochina from a battlefield to a marketplace.

As economic development became more important to ASEAN and Indochina, Japan stepped up its economic enticement for a solution to the Indochina quagmire. At the ASEAN plenary session of foreign ministers in June 1987, Japanese Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari called for the pursuit of a peaceful resolution to the Kampuchean problem and pledged financial and other forms of assistance by Tokyo for the economic reconstruction of Indochina. Kuranari called the Cambodian issue &quot;a source of instability in Southeast Asia&quot; with &quot;global implications.&quot; In evolution from the carrot Japan had held in front of Vietnam since 1979, Tokyo now offered aid to the entire region, the offer conditional upon resolution of the Cambodian issue. The offer was aimed directly at ASEAN (delivered at the ASEAN conference), whose member countries were starting to see the potential for foreign direct investment through opening markets in Indochina if only the Cambodia-Vietnam conflict could be resolved.

Japan, which had originally used ASEAN's security worries as a diplomatic cover for the suspension of economic aid in 1979, now held an increasing economic interest in a resolution of the Indochina problem. Japan sought to participate in conferences and negotiations sponsored by ASEAN. By 1989, the Cambodian factions began to realize the need for serious negotiations. Informal talks were held in Bangor, Indonesia, in late January 1989. ASEAN ministers showed great diplomatic finesse in getting the Cambodian factions to agree to the negotiations. Parties within Indochina and the region as a whole started to recognize ASEAN's prime position in resolving the Cambodian issue-- Vietnam, China, the USSR, Japan, and the United States saw that economic dynamism was replacing military hegemony in the international relations of Southeast Asia.

The countries of ASEAN began to warm up to Vietnam, and in 1989 Hanoi began to consider becoming a member of ASEAN. Indonesia hinted that it could take the diplomatic lead in rapprochement with Vietnam, because relations between Jakarta and Hanoi had remained warm despite the Cambodian crisis, based on a shared distrust of China and a shared history of anticolonial struggles. Hanoi made several diplomatic overtures to Indonesian and Thai officials, hinting that Vietnam desired to join ASEAN. Thai officials commented that Vietnam's political ideology should pose no serious threat to membership so long as Vietnam accepted ASEAN's basic principles: the Bali Treaty, the creation of a Southeast Asian zone of peace, freedom, and neutrality, and the avoidance of the use of force to resolve conflict. Philippines Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus visited Hanoi in 1988 and suggested that Hanoi sign the Bali treaty as a &quot;significant step&quot; toward ASEAN membership. However, Malaysia and Singapore diplomats remained reserved on Vietnam's potential membership. All member states agreed that a solution to the Cambodian question would predate any serious action toward admitting Vietnam. For Singapore, this hesitation could have been economically based, because Singapore enjoyed significant trade (ten times the level of Thailand) with Vietnam. Closer relations with others might mean Vietnam would shift its trade routes through Thailand or Indonesia, away from the trade-centered city-state. Indeed, when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, the crisis provided a need for cohesion and coordination among ASEAN countries. As political hegemony shifted toward economic development in Indochina, rifts developed within ASEAN as competition for the virgin markets of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos increased.

The pattern is easy to recognize: as Japan began to spread its economic influence through offshore production and raw material &quot;neocolonialism&quot; throughout Southeast Asia, Thailand and Indonesia began to look to Burma and Indochina as targets for development by their own firms, following the Japanese model. Renewed pledges of increased aid and capital from Japan toward rebuilding Indochina whetted the appetites of Indonesia and Thailand, obvious conduits for aid toward reconstruction efforts. Marine products, timber, mineral resources and hydropower could be harvested from Indochina and sold in the needy, heavily populated Thai market in return for Thai manufactured goods. Korn Tapparangsee, a minister in the Thai cabinet, urged aid-providing Scandinavian countries to become Thailand's investment partners in Indochina and Burma, describing Indochinese countries Thailand's &quot;inner ring&quot; and the larger ASEAN market as Thailand's &quot;outer ring.&quot;

Japan continued to act through ASEAN on the issue of renewing economic aid. Economic assistance remained dependent on a solution to the Cambodian question. Bangkok and Jakarta repeated the promise of economic aid following a settlement of the crisis, and Tokyo stood with them, a stance reflected by the comment of a Japanese diplomat in Bangkok:

 We'd like to see some sort of an international conference
 in which Japan can take part in the provision of financial and
 economic assistance.

Japan's regional leadership role was increasing. Compared to 1978 and 1979, when Tokyo cut off aid to Vietnam and used ASEAN's concerns almost as an excuse, Japanese officials were becoming proactive in their approach, attempting to involve the ASEAN and Indochinese countries in finding a solution to the Cambodian problem.

But resolution of the Kampuchean issue continued to elude ASEAN ministers. In 1989, as Vietnamese troops began to trickle out of Cambodia and a solution to the region's troubles seemed imminent, factions continued to fight within Cambodia's borders instead of negotiating in Jakarta or other proposed sites for a political settlement. Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas came under criticism for his continued insistence on a comprehensive solution of the Cambodian conflict. Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan's government had proposed a step-by-step process of resolution, which came to be known as the gradualist approach. Indonesia, eager to find a solution and increase trade with Vietnam, searched for a policy that would not mimic the gradualist arguments but would conform to the reality in Indochina. Vietnam, armed with the claim that its troops were indeed withdrawing from Cambodia, was growing weary of the protracted negotiations led by Alatas. Furthermore, factions within Cambodia stepped up their fighting in the vacuum left by departing Vietnamese troops.

On the whole, ASEAN saw its power increase within the region. Japan supported this increase, with initiatives for a &quot;new fund&quot; of developmental aid and statements from Japan's Foreign Ministry that promised to provide aid for the entire region if a solution to the Cambodian issue could be found. The overall shift from security-driven policies to developmental economic enticements served to enhance the Japan-ASEAN relationship as well as strengthen Japan's influence in the region in both ASEAN and Indochinese countries with the promise of aid if a comprehensive solution the Cambodian issue could be found.

===Indochina's factions===

As early as 1986, Vietnam foresaw an eventual withdrawal from Cambodia, possibly by 1990. Vietnam seemed certain it could withdraw troops by 1990, and could wait for economic aid until then, if necessary:
 If we have to wait until 1990, we are prepared to wait. It's
 bearable . . . [until] the so-called Kampuchean question no
 longer exists.

However, talks between the Vietnamese-backed Heng Samrin regime and the Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge had yet to progress. Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann, the other two parties fighting against Heng Samrin, could get little backing other than verbal support and aid from the West. Stalemate in Cambodia was a direct result of the lack of progress between China and Vietnam, and China and the Soviet Union. Against this backdrop, Japan once again played the role of Vietnam's &quot;friend&quot; and stressed the need to maintain open channels with Hanoi.

Of all the resistance leaders, Norodom Sihanouk enjoyed the most open support in Tokyo. The former prince had access to the highest officials whenever he visited Japan (usually in transit to the U.S.) and met with Prime Minister Takeshita in August 1988. Toru Yano, a professor of Political Science at Kyoto University, responded to Sihanouk's visit by outlining several points Japan should follow in order to solve the Kampuchean problem in the Japan Times: (1) treat all four factions with equality; (2) find a solution to reduce Pol Pot's (Heng Samrin's) forces; (3) acknowledge China's role in Southeast Asian peace, and (4) prepare for Sihanouk's comeback as a leader of Kampuchea. Though Tokyo seemed leery of officially recognizing Sihanouk as the leader of choice, out of deference to the Sino-Japanese relationship, Japan was migrating toward a position backing the former Cambodian head of state as leader of a new coalition authority.

Japan gave an unofficial nod to Sihanouk by granting him a meeting with Prime Minister Takeshita and Foreign Minister Uno, a privilege not granted to a Vietnamese leader since Trinh's visit in December 1978. Among Sihanouk's goals was the prevention of a resurgence of the Khmer Rouge after the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces. Takeshita endorsed this when he told Sihanouk that the Vietnamese withdrawal was an important precondition and that the resurgence of the inhumane regime must be checked. The prime minister further advised Sihanouk of his intent to exchange views with China concerning the Khmer Rouge when the prime minister visited Beijing later that month.

Sihanouk also hinted at Japan's position as a possible advocate when he remarked that he &quot;[did] not have the leverage to make China change its support for the Khmer Rouge.&quot; He went on to urge Japan's participation in an international conference on Kampuchea under the UN umbrella, as well as participation in an international commission to supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and the holding of elections. Japan, wary of its wartime history in Southeast Asia, could act best under a UN mandate as part of a larger international effort. This action would provide Tokyo with diplomatic cover against cries of resurgent colonialism from Vietnam, China, and anyone else upset with Japan at the time.

Talks in Kampuchea between the Heng Samrin regime and the tripartite coalition (Sihanouk, the Khmer Rouge and Son Sann) had been ongoing since 1987, with little promise of resolution. However, conferences between China and the USSR in 1988, along with negotiations between China and Vietnam, opened the door for a solution in Cambodia. Sihanouk's increasing profile among international actors gave hope for his leadership after the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces. In November 1988, meetings were held in Paris with most of the parties concerned: Heng Samrin, Son Sann, Norodom Sihanouk, Vietnam, China, the USSR, the United States, Japan and France. At the conference, China agreed to approve a UN resolution that sought &quot;the early withdrawal of Vietnamese troops&quot; because the resolution also indirectly prohibited the Pol Pot regime from returning to power. Though the Pol Pot representatives were not in Paris, China's compromise short-changed the Khmer's long-term survivability. Vietnam also compromised by agreeing to move the withdrawal date forward to mid-1989. Vietnam began withdrawing forces from Cambodia in the spring of 1989. Only pressure from China and the USSR, combined with enticements from ASEAN and Japan, seemed able to move Hanoi and the factions toward a political solution.

As proof of what Japan was capable of doing in Indochina, Foreign Ministry officials pointed to Laos--a Soviet state now abandoned in terms of aid from the Soviet Union and Vietnam. Laos embarked on economic reform in 1986 (simultaneously with Vietnam's Doi Moi reforms), and aid from Japan had increased significantly. Japanese officials had expressed no qualms about the desired effect of Japan-Laos relations: closer ties with Laos could demonstrate to the rest of Indochina what effect economic aid could have on such poor countries-- a sort of carrot-by-proxy approach. Japanese officials also mentioned plans to develop a triangular relationship with Indochina and ASEAN. The message was clear: Japan had enough ODA money for everyone if a workable, long-term solution to Indochina's troubles could be found.

===The Soviet Union and glasnost===
The most obvious element of change in the Soviet Union's policies toward Asia in the second half of the 1980s was a shift from military priorities to economic development. Relations between Japan and the USSR remained cold throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Disagreements on the Kurile Islands continued with little hope of resolution. However, with the rise of Mikail Gorbachev and economic reforms, perestroika, and glasnost in the Soviet Union, Tokyo renewed pressure to improve relations. Japan repeated its invitation for the Soviet premier to visit, an invitation that had been standing unfulfilled for over a decade. The shift in Soviet policy was welcome in Tokyo. Japan sought to take advantage of the improving relations between China and the Soviet Union, as stated by one government official:

 In addition, we hope that this move of bettering ties
 between Socialist nations and the Western camp will also have
 the effect of lessening the Soviet influence in the region.

ASEAN officials' reception of the Soviets' new initiatives concurred with Japan's. The ASEAN nations reacted cautiously to Soviet overtures, but resolving the Kampuchean issue remained the key to unlocking the wealth of foreign investment from the West. Anything that the Soviet Union could do to pressure Vietnam would be welcome.

For Moscow, its strategic alliance with Vietnam was no longer reaping the benefits of containing China or spreading Soviet influence among the third-world countries of Southeast Asia. Aid and the trade imbalances that favored Vietnam were no longer possible in the constraints of a floundering Soviet economy. Conversely (or complementarily, depending on the point of view), Japan was standing by, ready to increase its aid and trade with the communist states in Indochina.

Unfortunately, as much as the Soviet Union wanted to increase its ties with Japan's booming economy, the territorial issue stood in the way of any significant progress between Moscow and Tokyo. Thus, Japan-Soviet relations improved slightly with Gorbachev's policies, but no direct help or agreements could be reached in replacing Soviet aid with Japanese aid in Vietnam. For Tokyo, it was merely a matter of waiting: decreased Soviet aid and trade would leave the Vietnamese more desperate for help from Japan and the West. The carrot for withdrawing from Cambodia looked closer and bigger than ever, and it was becoming Vietnam's only recourse.

===Shifts at the international level===
The latter half of the 1980s saw no dramatic shift in the political alignments in Southeast Asia, but change did occur. The economies of ASEAN began to turn toward economic priorities, and those countries looked to Indochina both as a political hindrance to further growth as well as a potential market for exports. The Soviet Union began a strategic retreat from the region as worsening economic problems at home forced Gorbachev to reverse the Brezhnev expansionist policies. China saw its poor relations with Vietnam and Indochina as an economic drag as well. All these elements served to further isolate Hanoi and compound the pressure to withdraw from Cambodia. Japan stood fast in its demands of a troop withdrawal and a comprehensive peace in Cambodia before reinstatement of economic assistance. Tokyo managed to gain the middle ground between Hanoi and other regional hegemons during this period as well. Though the Japan-Vietnam relationship remained somewhat static, Hanoi was slowly moving toward a resolution that would reinstate full government aid relations with Tokyo.

The most apparent shift in external factors for Japan's policy toward Vietnam was the move from security worries to economic development. Though China's punishment war in 1979 raised fears of a wider regional conflict for both Japanese and ASEAN officials, the fighting soon subsided. However, Vietnamese troops remained entrenched in Cambodia. For the first seven years of Vietnam's occupation, Tokyo seemed content to isolate Vietnam economically. But by 1985, Southeast Asian economies began to see double-digit growth while China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and other smaller communist states began to dismantle expansionist rhetoric and replace it with economic prioritization. Vietnam's economy showed signs of real growth when exports in crude oil began in 1985 (see Graph 3.4). The economic opportunities throughout Southeast Asia accelerated to the point where all parties involved saw the urgency of resolving the Cambodian conflict.

Within this context, Tokyo's policies shifted relevant to its regional leadership role. While the dynamics of East Asian economies moved the priorities for those countries' governments toward economic development, Japan's economic- and aid-based influence grew. Subsequently, Tokyo officials began to offer aid to the entire region if a solution to the Cambodian issue could be found as part of a larger, more active foreign policy. Thus, the evolution of Japan's policy toward Vietnam came from four major factors: (1) Vietnam's economic development, which heightened the necessity for foreign assistance from Japan; (2) economic development within ASEAN, which depended on a greatly increased trade relationship with Japan; (3) China's shift to economic development and need for Japanese and Western investment; and (4) the retreat of Soviet power, which isolated Vietnam and allowed greater regional leadership in light of a reduced East-West confrontation.

The balance of power began to shift in Japan's favor. With greater regional influence came greater regional responsibility for finding peace in Southeast Asia. Tokyo's offer to supply developmental aid to the entire region seemed to fulfill this responsibility. However, Japan's bilateral relations with Vietnam continued to be hindered by the troop situation and by pressure from Tokyo's closest ally: the United States. Washington's continued pressure for economic isolation, demonstrated by the 1987 Honda case, counterbalanced any progress with China or the Soviet Union in easing tensions in Indochina. The net effect of these influences on Japan's policy toward Vietnam was optimistic caution. Tokyo renewed its promises for restoration of economic assistance after a comprehensive solution could be found in Cambodia.

==Domestic Factors==

As in chapter 2, it is important to investigate factors at the bureaucratic level to determine any domestic influences on Japan's foreign policy toward Vietnam. The ever increasing trade relationship with Vietnam and its virgin market began to enter the debate over when and how to reinstate economic assistance, but regional considerations and the U.S.- Japan relationship still dictated prudence from the perspective of the controlling bureaucracy (the Foreign Ministry). As stated above, international relations in Southeast Asia increasingly became subject to economic factors and were less affected by political or security concerns. Japan's import of raw materials from Vietnam increased greatly through Vietsovpetro's crude oil shipments that began in 1985 and the Doi Moi reforms that began in 1986. Although we would expect to see MITI and the Ministry of Finance taking a stronger voice in calling for leniency in policy decisions toward Vietnam, the Japanese government maintained its course: no economic assistance until Vietnam made significant progress on withdrawing from Cambodia. For the time being, given ASEAN's strong objections to governmental or semigovernmental economic cooperation with Hanoi, and the U.S. pressure to curtail overt economic activity within Vietnam, MITI and the Ministry of Finance could only wait for resolution of the Cambodian issue.

However, the lack of government-sponsored aid programs did not deter the private sector from forging ties with the Vietnamese. Starting in 1987, Nissho-Iwai, Mitsubishi, Marubeni, and other conglomerates opened trade offices and prepared for branch offices for banks and other financial institutions. Though the official aid vacuum limited the volume of trade, Japanese corporations began to lay the foundations for a long-term trade relationship.

===Ministry of Finance===
The Ministry of Finance solidified Tokyo's wariness concerning Vietnam when it issued a report of twenty-seven risky countries in 1984. The report, a reflection of MITI's assessment of sovereign risk, included suspension of export-insurance and was considered a bell-weather indicator for Japanese industries. Along with debt ridden countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Peru, the Philippines, Zambia, and Madagascar, the Ministry of Finance suspended export insurance to North Korea, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The latter five countries were listed in a separate category, and while not titled as such, it may be assumed the &quot;risk&quot; in these countries came from political concerns.

By 1987, however, the Ministry of Finance was willing to give Vietnam a break. In a new program aimed at easing debt relief to Vietnam (which had one of the worst payment records), the ministry approved a plan that would permit Japanese banks' nontaxable redemption of loans to countries with cumulative debts and formulated standards to approve loans based on the economic situation, interest payment condition, and debt repayment period of the country accepting the loan. This was certainly welcome news to Hanoi, which had committed to the Doi Moi reforms a year earlier and had begun to make headway toward economic stability.

Japan's Institute of Developing Economies, associated with the Ministry of Finance, sent a semigovernmental mission to Vietnam to assess suitable aid projects in the spring of 1989; at the same time, negotiations in Cambodia were progressing after years of impasse. Japan recognized the need for $500 million in aid to stabilize inflation (estimated at 600 percent) on imports of salt, soap, and paper. In addition, the Institute's officials looked to begin restructuring Vietnam's infrastructure of roads, ports, and irrigation. Though no promises of aid had been made, the mission signalled to Hanoi and contractors in Japan that ODA monies might soon be forthcoming.

Unfortunately for Vietnam, Japan balked under U.S. pressure to hold out on restoring economic assistance until Vietnamese troops were withdrawn from Cambodia in the end of the summer of 1989. Japan and the United States, through the IMF, withheld restoring loan programs to Hanoi because (1) the withdrawal of troops had not been verified internationally and (2) a comprehensive plan for political stability in Cambodia had not been reached. According to Susumu Awanohara of the Far Eastern Economic Review,

 Some officials said it was &quot;surprising and sad&quot; that Japan
 had followed the US lead, particularly given that Ministry of
 Finance officials were earlier known to be positive about
 Vietnam's reforms and privately disagreed with their pro-US
 Foreign Ministry counterparts on whether economic aid to
 Vietnam had to wait for a political settlement of the Cambodian
 problem.

Though the Ministry of Finance seemed prepared to go ahead with better official economic relations with Hanoi, pressure from the United States, as well as the primacy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, could not be ignored.

===Ministry of Foreign Affairs===
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs clearly led in determining policy toward Vietnam throughout the decade. Concrete breakthroughs on Cambodia eluded the region until 1989, and Japan's stated policy remained the same: no economic assistance to Vietnam until troops were withdrawn from Cambodia and a viable political solution could be found. However, as affirmed earlier, when the situation is viewed in context of ASEAN, China, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the Ministry of Foreign affairs steered a careful course in order to keep Japan close (relatively) to Vietnam. Japan's foreign ministers and other diplomats accepted Vietnamese &quot;guests&quot; on an unofficial basis, while retired diplomats and LDP party officials visited Vietnam on unofficial tours in an effort to &quot;create an environment conducive to a political solution of the Kampuchean problem.''

The primacy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in determining policy is evident in the dispute over Nissho-Iwai's commercial trades in Vietnam-- suspected trades that upset ASEAN officials. When Minister Dhanabalan from Malaysia came to Tokyo to file a complaint in the name of ASEAN, the ministry defended Nissho-Iwai. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry stated that the department did not intend to interfere with Nissho-Iwai's activities-- a statement which showed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs clearly had veto power on what commercial activities transpired between Japan and Vietnam (a veto not exercised against Nissho-Iwai).

By 1987, with Vietnam well into its economic reforms, Japan's policy shifted emphasis to the carrot approach in order to resolve the Cambodian question. Foreign Minister Kuranari proposed Japan's solution: first, he proposed a dialogue among the parties concerned and urged Vietnam to &quot;come to the negotiating table without attaching preconditions&quot; to such basic principles as withdrawal of Vietnamese forces. Second, he proposed a peace plan that &quot;must provide in clear terms for ways of maintaining peace during the Vietnamese withdrawal and for ensuring just and free elections for self-determination&quot; by the Kampuchean people. This plan highlighted two major components of Japanese policy toward Indochina: (1) Japan was willing to treat all parties equally at the negotiating table (by no longer vilifying the Heng Samrin nor the Khmer Rouge), and (2) Japan was now demanding the establishment of a viable government in Kampuchea before full economic relations could be restored. The codicil to this second point was that Japan was now offering money not only to Vietnam, but to Kampuchea and Laos as well. Kuranari added that economic reconstruction in Indochina would be good for other areas also, an allusion to ASEAN neighbors Thailand and Indonesia, which would become conduits for Japanese ODA money and reconstruction efforts in Indochina. Kuranari reaffirmed Japan's intention &quot;to play a role in connection with each of these steps by extending assistance and cooperation commensurate with its resources.&quot; Here again, is evidenced by Kuranari's statements about which country would receive aid and when highlight the primary position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Foreign Ministry refined its policy in 1989, when withdrawal of Vietnamese troops seemed imminent following talks between Vietnam and China. Once again, Tokyo searched for the middle ground between two polarized positions. Japan moved closer to Vietnam by retracting its demand that the troop withdrawal be supervised by an international peacekeeping force, a demand of Western powers that had been rejected by Vietnam. Japan defined its desired scenario in Kampuchea by pushing for internationally supervised elections, to be held after the provisional government of the four factions took power. Tokyo also decided to link aid to Kampuchea with the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces. However, the announcement made no mention of aid to Hanoi, a signal that Vietnam still had a way to go before it could incur Japan's favor.

===Political parties===

Debate between political parties on whether or not to send economic assistance to Vietnam had long since ended after the concrete condition of a troop withdrawal had been clearly stated by the Foreign Ministry. Throughout the 1980s, the opposition parties, JCP and JSP, hosted dignitaries from Vietnam or sent representatives to communist-related anniversary celebrations of &quot;the Revolution&quot; in Hanoi. Though the JCP continued to claim ideological unity with Hanoi, it could do little toward changing the bilateral relationship because it held so few seats in the Diet.

Leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party, in the strong majority and the de facto power brokers since 1955, enjoyed meetings with foreign dignitaries as though they were cabinet- level ministers. However, the LDP was careful not to give the appearance of close relations with Vietnam. Any parliamentarian visits to Hanoi were &quot;unofficial,&quot; and Vietnamese delegates rarely gained audience with party leaders when in Tokyo. Other Indochinese leaders, such as Norodom Sihanouk or Lao Vice Premier Phoune Sipaseuth, met with LDP leaders when in Tokyo, an obvious snub to Hanoi. This diplomatic isolation incurred little costs to the ruling party. The probusiness LDP had no serious qualms about Vietnam, because trade with Vietnam continued to grow despite the isolation in terms of government- sponsored programs.

===The private sector===
Although international lending institutions like the World Bank and IMF discontinued loans to Hanoi in 1985, trade between Japan and Vietnam flourished. Japan imported coal, frozen shrimp, and, beginning in 1985, crude oil. Simultaneously, Japan exported machinery, building materials, refined oil, chemicals, and manufacturing goods to Vietnam. (See Charts 3.1 and 3.2) Despite the Ministry of Finance's decision to end export insurance coverage for deals with Vietnam, Japan's private banks signed a debt-rescheduling agreement in 1984 and continued to lend, without batting an eyelid, at low rates to companies exporting to Vietnam. A report to the AFP in Hong Kong summarizes the situation in 1985:

 Japan is Vietnam's second largest trading partner, trailing
 the Soviet Union but in front of other Eastern Bloc countries. 
 Japanese exports amounted to $227 million-- 10 times more than
 France, Vietnam's biggest trading partner in the West.  In 1985,
 sales of Japanese motorcycles were six times higher than the
 previous year.  Sales of televisions rose by four while building
 material sales were three times higher.

The most significant development for Japan-Vietnam trade was the beginning of oil shipments from Vietsovpetro, a joint Vietnamese-Soviet Union corporation that drilled for oil in the South China Sea, east of Vietnam. Anxious to gain hard currency to correct their trade imbalances with Japan [see Graph 3-3], Vietsovpetro initially made an offer to a business delegation, organized by Nissho-Iwai, that visited Vietnam in April 1985. Kaiyo Oil, 46 percent of which is owned by the governmental Japan National Corporation, found oil in the area in cooperation with Mobil Corporation of the United States in 1974. The company went ahead with the deal after an unsuccessful attempt to gain financial assistance from the Japanese government, which usually supplies 80 percent of funds for oil field development.

The private Japanese trade delegation that accepted the offer from Vietsovpetro in 1985 was the first business mission from Japan since 1978. The business leaders met with several Vietnamese leaders on how to correct the trade imbalance. Japan was looking to increase imports of raw materials (coal, lumber, crude oil) and foodstuffs (coffee, sesame, fruit, cuttlefish) in order to cycle its trade surplus with Vietnam. Because Hanoi held limited amounts of hard currency, the surplus could eventually &quot;dry up&quot; Hanoi's reserves and curtail trade. The trade imbalance switched to Vietnam's favor, beginning in 1986, with increased raw materials and other exports: crude oil, timber, seafood, and tin (see charts 3.2 and 3.3).

The private sector began to take hold in Vietnam. Nissho-Iwai Corporation, a front- runner in trade with Vietnam at ・ to 6 billion, announced it would open a trade office in Hanoi by September 1986, the first since reunification ten years earlier. Meiwa Industry Company, the leader at ・0 billion, lost the privilege of opening the first office in Vietnam to Nissho-Iwai because the latter provided valuable shrimp-culture technology to the state-owned Vietnam National Sea Product Export Company.

The Vietnamese government liberalized travel restrictions for Japanese investors looking for new business. Starting in 1985, Japanese businessmen were no longer required to apply for new entry visas when the maximum three-month stay had expired. The length of stay was extended and visitors could now use the same entry visa repeatedly. An official with the Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Trade noted the influx of visitors: &quot;Two out of three businessmen are Japanese.&quot;

Vietnam was desperate to export raw materials to Japan. Because of the sharp rise of the yen following the Plaza Accords in 1985, yen-dominated payments skyrocketed for Vietnam while Japanese bankers gained an added bonus. Cash-strapped Hanoi usually paid in dollars and therefore pushed crude oil and other raw material exports in order to increase hard currency supplies in Vietnam. Japan's increased trade with Vietnam creates two questions: (1) How could the U.S. and ASEAN allow such trade levels, and (2) to what degree did this increased trade affect policy?

The answer to the first question is that neither the United States nor ASEAN took Japan's trade actions lying down. The resolution by the U.S. Congress against Honda and the complaint lodged by ASEAN officials against Japanese trade houses proves this point. However, Tokyo's stated position since 1979 was that official governmental assistance programs and aid would be halted, but that Japan would not enforce a full trade embargo. Thus, perhaps neither the U.S. nor ASEAN had the political will to risk damaging its relationship with Japan in order to push Tokyo to further tighten its stance against Vietnam. Besides, by the late 1980s, solutions to resolve the Cambodian issue began to materialize, and a tightened policy would probably only hurt that process.

Japan's policy seemed little affected by the increasing levels of trade. Japanese firms made no significant lobbying efforts or public statements criticizing Tokyo's position. In fact, the increasing levels of trade probably served to subtract the private sector as a factor affecting policy: if trade is increasing as fast as Vietnam's market will allow, then why complain to the government for action and risk international scorn?

===Shifts at the domestic level===
Though the trade relationship between Japan and Vietnam continued to grow, MITI and the Ministry of Finance continued to follow the lead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when dealing with Hanoi. Continued international economic isolation by the IMF and World Bank virtually constrained the Ministry of Finance from making any new initiatives and thus eliminated that ministry from seriously affecting policy toward Vietnam. For MITI and the private sector, trade levels were increasing despite the suspension of official programs. Official visits by MITI bureaucrats were restricted, which explains the increase of &quot;private&quot; delegations of businessmen to Vietnam as trade increased. Private sector trade with Vietnam seemed to be moving ahead despite the economic assistance isolation, thus subtracting pressure from domestic industry as a factor for changing Tokyo's policy.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy toward Vietnam shifted from the isolation of the early 1980s to an engagement plan for peace that involved the entire region. As progress on the international level gave new hope for peace in Cambodia, Japanese officials tried to use Tokyo's centrist position and huge amounts of aid monies as tools to coax the region toward a comprehensive solution. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to control policy toward Vietnam in light of the international factors surrounding the bilateral relationship.

==Conclusions==
International factors continued to outweigh domestic concerns in continuing Tokyo's suspension of aid to Vietnam. The ASEAN countries looked to the untapped markets of Indochina to accelerate their newfound economic development. Japanese policymakers looked for an evolution of the Fukuda Doctrine into a triangular relationship involving Japan, ASEAN, and Indochina. Subsequently, the need for a solution to the Cambodian issue became much more urgent. China and Vietnam realized the economic costs incurred by the continued squabbling over Cambodia, and the Soviet Union began to withdraw worldwide, heightening Vietnam's isolation and its need for reconciliation with Japan and the West. Taken together, these events set the stage for an increased regional leadership role from Tokyo, because Japan could supply necessary developmental funds. Japan acted on these cues with new initiatives to supply aid for the entire region, initiatives conditional upon a solution in Cambodia. However, pressure from the United States held Japan back from making any further overtures to lure Hanoi toward peace. Cautious of prematurely rewarding Hanoi, Tokyo began to insist on a comprehensive peace plan for Indochina.

Japan maintained its middle position by taking a more proactive approach to solving the Cambodian issue while acknowledging U.S. concerns about prematurely rewarding Hanoi. Tokyo ensured itself a controlling position between ASEAN and Vietnam by offering aid to the entire region, thus greatly increasing Tokyo's influence with both sides. Similar increases in aid to China placed Japan in a strong position (as strong as possible for anyone outside China) as Beijing and Hanoi came to terms over resolving the problems in Cambodia. Japan's advantages from its middle-ground diplomacy were only amplified as the region's dynamics shifted from security to economic issues.

Domestically, little pressure came from the private sector or MITI to insist on restoring economic assistance programs with Vietnam. Oil imports grew as fast as Vietnam's production capability, and Japanese business leaders began preliminary work on setting up branch offices in Vietnam despite the government restrictions on official delegations. The Ministry of Finance could do little to accelerate loan programs with Vietnam, because international bodies could neither endorse or recommend such plans and because the funds already allocated since 1978 were still held in limbo by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thus, officially Japan's policy toward Vietnam had not changed. But the sea change throughout the region from security concerns to economic development was setting the stage for Tokyo's regional leadership role as well as the eventual restoration of aid to Vietnam. Unofficially, trade with Vietnam progressed in such a way that domestic economic concerns did not affect Tokyo's official stance toward Hanoi.

=Chapter 2: Limited Relations 1978-1984=
When [[w:Saigon|Saigon]] fell in the spring of 1975, the West carried little influence in the region, let alone had close relations with the North Vietnamese government. [[w:Japan|Japan]], following the US lead, had backed the South Vietnamese regime all through the war. By the time North Vietnamese Army (NVA) tanks rolled into the presidential palace, Tokyo had stopped aid to South Vietnam, not knowing what or who would be in charge in Saigon after repeated coups. However, the new regime of a united Vietnam was quick to assemble an agenda courting relations with regional powers through diplomacy and quick to lay out economic plans. These plans relied heavily on foreign aid and investment, so Hanoi was very open and solicitous toward the countries of ASEAN and toward Japan to replace its wartime allies of the Soviet Union and China.

Relations proceeded smoothly with the new united Vietnamese government. Japan established full diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1976. Tokyo forwarded economic assistance to Hanoi, and trade grew yearly between the two countries. However, Japan's relationship with Vietnam came under stress when Hanoi began to flex its military muscle against its Indochinese neighbors. By 1978, Vietnamese troops were skirmishing openly along Vietnam's western border against Cambodian forces. Tokyo's apprehension over how to handle relations with Vietnam dictated caution. This chapter shows a Japan slightly different from the Japan during the US-Vietnam War: because the US had reduced its presence in Southeast Asia, and because of American diplomatic overtures toward China, along with a new assertiveness from ASEAN, Japan could no longer act under the umbrella of US military might in its policy toward Vietnam, but rather had to seek a course between all of these regional hegemons.

As regional alignments solidified, with the Soviet Union appearing to back Vietnam's aggressive moves and China supporting Cambodia, border skirmishes increased throughout Indochina. Japan needed to find a policy that would both salvage any mileage out of the &quot;omnidirectional&quot; policy of the 1960s and early 1970s and at the same time maximize trade potential with developing markets. This chapter will argue that Japan's foreign policymakers sought the middle ground between opposing forces. By describing the bilateral diplomatic efforts between Japan and Vietnam, along with Tokyo's policies toward regional players such as China, ASEAN, the US and the Soviet Union, this chapter describes a Japan that left the door slightly ajar for Vietnam even in the darkest days of the economic assistance embargo. The decision to cut aid for Hanoi came not out of pressure from Washington, but as a move to claim the middle ground between ASEAN and Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union, and the United States and Indochina. Several questions will be addressed in this chapter: how did Japan handle its relationship with Vietnam in terms of the Cambodian invasion? Why didn't the United States pressure Japan into a tougher stance against Hanoi? What relationships did Japan keep with Vietnam and why?

==Bilateral relations==
In December of 1978, Foreign Minister [[w:Nguyen Duy Trinh|Nguyen Duy Trinh]] visited Japan to hold a series of talks with Japan's Prime Minister Ohira and officials in Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This was the first visit of a high-ranking Vietnamese leader since the unification of Vietnam in 1976. Trinh's intention, in retrospect, seems to have been to secure Japan's promise to continue economic assistance despite the unstable situation that had developed on the Vietnamese-Cambodian border. Though it is unclear whether Trinh had knowledge of the military plan to launch a full-scale invasion into Cambodia, certainly the leaders who dispatched Trinh to Tokyo only two weeks before the offensive into Cambodia were calculating regional alignments. Japanese Foreign Minister Sunao Sonoda expressed caution to Trinh, saying that Japan would find difficulty in extending economic cooperation to Vietnam unless suspicions of Vietnamese expansionism then emerging among noncommunist Southeast Asian countries, could be relieved.

Sonoda conditioned Japan's economic assistance on ASEAN's security, showing Trinh that Japan's policy would have a degree of solidarity with ASEAN. Sonoda further revealed a wariness about the treaty on friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and the Soviet Union, signed in October 1978. His wariness signaled Japan's dismay at Vietnam's apparent shifting away from its prior policy of &quot;equidistance&quot; from both Beijing and Moscow. He linked this concern with ASEAN as well, stating that the treaty was causing &quot;uneasiness, particularly in Malaysia, Thailand and other noncommunist neighbors of Vietnam.&quot; However, Sonoda was quick to reiterate Japan's support and contributions toward Vietnam's postwar recovery, and stressed Tokyo's willingness to keep good relations with Vietnam. The message to Hanoi was clear: Japan sided with ASEAN and opposed increased Soviet influence in Southeast Asia, but was willing to listen to Vietnam even if the situation worsened.

Despite Sonoda's hesitance, Trinh's visit to Japan was a success for Hanoi. On December 19, 1978, Japan and Vietnam issued a joint statement pledging efforts to promote bilateral cooperation through mutual understanding. This statement included an agreement on economic cooperation under which Japan would extend loans of up to ¥4 billion (at the time approximately $64 million) and donate 150,000 tons of rice. These loans were to begin in fiscal 1979, which began in March 1979.

Diplomatically, each side gained leverage through this joint statement. The statement affirmed that the countries should cooperate with each other for peace and stability in Asia on the principles of mutual respect for independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. Basically, relations were at a comfortable distance with a level of detente. (Vietnam, as we shall see, used these same terms of &quot;noninterference&quot; and &quot;sovereignty&quot; to ignore outside pleas and pressure when its occupation of Kampuchea continued year after year.) For its part, Japan increased its leverage with Vietnam when Foreign Ministry officials &quot;leaked&quot; that Vietnam had wanted much more money in economic assistance. However, Japan reserved commitment to aid, saying that it would further discuss the matter with Vietnam and would take into consideration what foreign policy Hanoi would make in the future as well as other factors in the Southeast Asian situation. Thus, Tokyo promised a basic amount of aid while placing conditions on any expansion in economic assistance. The form of Japan's limited relations had begun to gel. Internationally, Japan claimed the cat-bird's seat, positioning itself between ASEAN and Vietnam in terms of providing economic assistance and, while not directly showing dissatisfaction with Hanoi, conveying ASEAN's security concerns.

Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia The honeymoon between Vietnam and the noncommunist countries of the region disintegrated at the end of 1978. Despite ASEAN's repeated calls for peace in Indochina, a dry-season offensive by Vietnamese troops pushed into Cambodia on Christmas Day, and by January 7 had captured the capital of Phnom Penh. While ASEAN countries swiftly condemned the action, Japan withheld judgement on how to deal with the Cambodian question, initially expressing no intention of recognizing the rebel Cambodian People's Revolutionary Council. Foreign Minister Sonoda strengthened the Japanese line against Vietnam one degree by threatening the flow of aid:

:::''Developments in the Cambodian situation and Vietnamese policies will be taken into consideration &lt;br /&gt;in implementing Japanese aid to Vietnam. ''


Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Minister Michio Watanabe stepped up the pressure by stating that the government would reexamine the 150,000 tons of rice aid to Vietnam in view of the Cambodian conflict. For Japan-Vietnam relations, the worst-case scenario had come true, and Tokyo began to enforce the conditions it had placed on economic assistance.

Two days after the announcement of the fall of Phnom Penh, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former head of state in Cambodia throughout the Vietnam War, took the initiative in announcing Japan's decision to freeze economic assistance to Vietnam. It is unclear whether Japan intended taht Sihanouk reveal such a major shift in Japan's policy or whether he was breaching protocol intentionally or accidentally. Either way, the Foreign Ministry backed the announcement when Prince Sihanouk arrived in Narita by arranging an airport press conference with the Prince, the deputy director general of the Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs bureau Wasuke Miyake, and Chinese Ambassador to Japan Fu Hao.

Vietnam was quick to respond. Two days after Sihanouk's pronouncement, Hanoi petitioned the Japanese Ambassador Takaaki Hasegawa to carry out the economic aid promised to Nguyen Van Trinh the month before. However, Hasegawa echoed Sonoda's reasoning earlier and pointed out that the members of ASEAN were concerned over Vietnam's role in the Cambodian conflict and that &quot;restraint on planned Japanese aid to Vietnam would be inevitable under the circumstances.&quot; The logic of the response is clear: by placing the reason for stopping aid on ASEAN's shoulders, Tokyo both avoided damaging the Japan- Vietnam relationship directly as well as highlighted the Japan-ASEAN unity in foreign policy. Such dual-purpose responses are the one of the benefits of the &quot;middle ground&quot; approach to regional diplomacy.

The following weeks saw some confusion over Japan's decision. Foreign Ministry officials had to declare firmly that Japan had not changed its policy of suspending aid to Vietnam in protest against Vietnamese support for the rebel forces that took over Cambodia. This declaration came in response to a Singapore-based news report that Japan was &quot;double- talking.&quot; It is not clear whether there was an actual doubt or if Singapore officials had leaked the rumor in order to pressure Japan into stating its position clearly. It is possible that Japan originally had not conveyed its policy clearly or that Singapore disliked Tokyo's attempt to placate both sides. But Japan's middle ground approach continued: its clarification of its pro- ASEAN stance as it also contained a morsel for Vietnam. The Japanese officials added that they &quot;could not believe that the suspension of aid to Vietnam would cause a break in relations between the two countries.&quot; Here, Japan was reassuring Vietnam that diplomatic relations would continue, and that Japan wished to continue recognizing Hanoi and would keep the avenue open for Vietnam to plead its case.

The official level of bilateral relations remained as outlined in the joint declaration between Japan and Vietnam that had resulted from Trinh's visit prior to the invasion. As Tokyo's policy of suspending aid began to solidify, Sonoda sought a reasoning for it based on the international principles stated in the agreement. In a House of Representatives Budget Committee hearing, Sonoda explained rather abstractly that if the armed forces of one country crossed the border of another country the crossing was an act of aggression. This statement leads directly back to the joint declaration and left-handedly accuses Vietnam of violating the agreement.

However, regional concerns began to confuse the issue for Tokyo policymakers. (Indochinese politics are never simple. What is good for the Hanoi goose is good for the Peking duck.) Reports of Chinese troop movements into Northern Vietnam were beginning to surface, and Sonoda soon realized the danger of upsetting Sino-Japanese relations by equating border crossings with &quot;acts of aggression.&quot; When an opposition Dietman raised this issue, Sonoda downplayed the Chinese-Vietnam border clash, saying that there was only a slight possibility that a large-scale clash would erupt on the Chinese-Vietnamese border. He said he considered the Chinese actions on the border small-scale and defensive in nature, and not large-scale fighting. Later that same day, Sonoda moderated his use of the phrase &quot;an act of aggression&quot; in reference to Vietnamese actions-- the word &quot;aggression&quot; was too strong. Once again, Japan soft-pedaled its language toward Indochina, both for the sake of Japan- Vietnam relations and to avoid a conundrum of inconsistency toward China in light of Chinese troop movements into northern Vietnam.

In April 1979, Vietnam played its hardship card and declined Japan's offer of a 150,000-ton rice loan. Speculation within the Foreign Ministry placed the reasons on the price of the loan (Vietnam was hinting that it was too expensive). Diplomatically, the tactic paid off for Hanoi-- Japan had to give assistance to show it truly intended to maintain relations with Vietnam. Japan needed to send some amount of aid in order to both back its promises made to Trinh and to maintain Japanese integrity on promises to the third world. The next day, Foreign Ministry officials announced that Japan would continue economic assistance to Vietnam as scheduled, despite an increased Soviet military presence in Vietnam. Tokyo shifted the reasons for their disapproval of Hanoi away from the Cambodian question to concerns of a possible Soviet military buildup. Tokyo seemed to be baiting the Vietnamese with the continuance of economic aid dependent on how Vietnam limited the Soviet presence. With this bait came the threat that discontinued assistance would adversely affect relations (beyond the denial of economic assistance), but the threat was softened with the conditional promise that &quot;Tokyo would continue to offer aid grants and loans to Hanoi in 1980 and thereafter, unless the Soviet military presence there becomes more evident.&quot;

Japan baited Vietnam again in 1979 with a possible resumption of aid if the refugee problem could be solved. Tokyo soon extended the conditions for resuming economic assistance to cover Vietnamese cooperation in solving the refugee problem, warning &quot;that it would become difficult for Japan to continue economic assistance if the mass exodus of refugees failed to subside.&quot; At the time, Japan had been suffering mild international scorn for its reluctance on the refugee issue. Refugees had been leaching out of Indochina for some time and had their exodus accelerated in the late 1970s. In December 1978, just before Vietnam's army rolled into [[Phnom Penh]], the United Nations sponsored a two-day conference in Geneva on the refugee problem. European powers and the United States agreed to absorb more refugees, but Japan was noticeably low-key. Tokyo had been implementing a policy of discouraging immigration at the source. The extension of this policy led naturally to Tokyo's use of suspension of economic assistance as a stick against Vietnam: solve the refugee flow at the source.

==Tokyo's conditional policy toward Vietnam==
By October 1979, Tokyo had settled on the conditions it wanted before the resumption of the ・4 billion in grants and loans to Vietnam could resume: as long as Vietnamese military involvement in Cambodia continued, Japan would suspend economic assistance. The aid had not been cancelled, nor had it been revoked-- it had already been allocated in the budget but had not been sent. Therefore, policymakers in Tokyo were forced to handle the aid question in terms not of &quot;should&quot; but of &quot;when&quot; and &quot;how&quot; the aid was to be transmitted to Vietnam. In other words, the carrot for Vietnam was so close that Hanoi could smell it. Foreign Ministry officials at every opportunity reminded Hanoi that a timed bureaucratic &quot;review&quot; of foreign aid did not alter the policy of giving aid to Vietnam promised to Trinh back in December. Rather, it was a question of how and under what conditions the policy would be executed.

Policy toward Vietnam solidified as another fiscal year expired. Though the aid had been earmarked for Vietnam, the yearly review of conditions to execute the transfer forced Tokyo to reiterate its stance: the government would not give financial assistance appropriated to Vietnam in the fiscal 1979 budget until Vietnam pulled out its troops from Cambodia. Japan would not give the ・4 billion aid to Vietnam within the 1979 fiscal year, ending on 31 March 1980, because of Vietnam's sweeping operations against the China-backed Pol Pot regime troops in Cambodia. Though it took over a year, the Foreign Ministry finally concretely stated the terms for resuming assistance to Vietnam. However, because of the bureaucratic &quot;limbo,&quot; the assistance was merely carried over into the next year's budget. Vietnam could enjoy resumed assistance as soon as progress on the Cambodian question occurred. In fact, the Foreign Ministry continued to remind Vietnam that assistance could be forthcoming via this yearly budget review. The next year, Japan called on Vietnam for progress on the refugee issue in a statement about assistance being carried over into the fiscal 1980 budget. Japan, having maneuvered between ASEAN and Vietnam, needed to stand by its conditions on restoring assistance in order to defray criticism from ASEAN and simultaneously remind Hanoi that Tokyo remained the best chance (relative to China, ASEAN, and the US) for a window to the West and economic aid.

By 1982, most regional powers, including Vietnam, realized that Vietnam would eventually withdraw troops from Cambodia. Japan took the lead in a soft line toward Hanoi (compared to ASEAN) and actually offered to lower the hurdles if some progress could be demonstrated. Akitane Kiuchi, head of the ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau, told an Upper House committee, &quot;We are not necessarily going to insist on complete withdrawal [of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea].&quot; Here again, Japan attempted to maximize its position between Vietnam and the West.

Hanoi continued to play hardball. ASEAN's, European countries', the United Nations', the US's and Japan's calls for withdrawal went unheeded. Vietnam continued their offensives against Khmer insurgents in the Western jungles of Cambodia and even made strikes a few miles deep into neighboring Malaysia, much to the alarm of ASEAN. Financially, Vietnam hiked the stakes with Japan. During the goodwill years from 1976 to 1978, Tokyo and Hanoi had worked out a tacit agreement that the North Vietnamese government, now the united Vietnam government, would assume and endorse the debts of the former South Vietnamese regime. These debts amounted to $50 million. This agreement was directly linked to Japan's pledge of nonreimbursable government aid of ・6 million. By 1983, however, Vietnam had refused to reimburse these debts. This refusal was probably due more to an economic crisis within Vietnam than a diplomatic snub. Vietnam's economic situation was rapidly deteriorating, in no small part because of the Cambodian crisis.

Indeed, Vietnam attempted to downplay the diplomatic impact of the loan default by sending Premier Pham Van Dong to Japan three months after the announcement of the refusal to pay. Premier Dong deftly baited the Japanese by playing the &quot;economic potential&quot; card for Vietnam:

 Japan, as a developed industrialized country, may have a
 constructive role with regard to peace, security, and development
 in Asia, first of all Southeast Asia. 
 
This was an almost exact quote from the Fukuda speech in 1977, in which Japan pledged economic and developmental leadership in Southeast Asia. Dong was hinting that Vietnam could play a major role in the development of Indochina, with the Vietnamese population of over 70 million and the country's resources in coal, lumber, seafood, and potential crude oil. Vietnam understood one of Japan's primary foreign policy goals: secure resource imports and open markets for exports. Dong played straight to these goals with his statements about the possible relationship between Japan and Vietnam.

Economically, Japan-Vietnam trade inched higher, but until the treasure-houses of Japan's economic assistance program openned, the relationship starved. Unfortunately for Hanoi's need of foreign aid and for Japan's trade houses, Vietnam continued to occupy and back the Heng Samrin puppets in Phnom Penh, and Tokyo refused to budge on its conditions.

It is evident that Japan-Vietnam relations took a serious blow when Vietnam invaded Cambodia and Tokyo suspended its economic assistance programs. It is also evident that Japan kept the door slightly ajar for continued relations and possible resumption of aid if certain conditions were met. Unfortunately for both, Tokyo could not spell out this policy clearly and Vietnam would not withdraw from Cambodia. Conditions for resumption varied from the withdrawal of troops to reduced Soviet presence to progress on the refugee issue. In order to understand Tokyo's vacillation and its attempts to keep relations with Vietnam functioning, we must examine the international factors in the region during this period.

==International Factors==

===United States and the hard line===
In sharp contrast to the dominant role it had played in Indochina since 1954, the United States experimented with an isolationist mentality toward Southeast Asia during the late 1970s and early 1980s. President Carter took office soon after the fall of Saigon, and a weary America was reticent to involve itself any further in Indochina. The Carter administration left the initiative in handling Indochinese difficulties to Beijing. China had also been handed the responsibility of resisting the spread of Soviet influence in East Asia.

Relations between Hanoi and Washington hinged on the resolution of two issues: information on POW/MIA cases and financial reimbursement for the property owned by US citizens and corporations in South Vietnam that was seized by North Vietnam forces in 1975. Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia put the Carter administration between a rock and a hard place: the Khmer Rouge's abominable record of human rights abuses versus the invasion of one sovereign state by another. In the end, the State Department issued a statement saying it opposed unilateral Vietnamese intervention. US policy on resolution of the Cambodian question was never spelled out in concrete terms. After all, Hanoi was already on very cold terms with Washington, and therefore Washington had little leverage in coaxing a solution to the Cambodian question.

Meanwhile, the United States was pushing Japan toward taking greater international responsibility. The United States encouraged and fully supported Japan's decision to boost foreign assistance to developing countries, as exemplified by the Fukuda Doctrine issued in 1977. A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman speculated on US reasons for this push: (1) Japan's aid to developing countries was the smallest among the advanced industrial nations as of 1979; (2) the US was becoming unable to make more positive efforts because of the reluctance in Congress in light of economic downturns, and (3) the US believed Japan should raise its amount of foreign aid to cycle trade surpluses back into the world market. Simultaneously, the United States called on Japan to carry an increased security role under the &quot;burden-sharing&quot; agreements, in which Japan would finance the cost of basing US forces in Japan.

Given the cold state of US-Vietnam relations combined with Washington's desire for Tokyo to exert stronger regional leadership, we might have expected the United States to push Japan harder on punishing Vietnam diplomatically. However, several considerations may help explain why Tokyo was &quot;allowed&quot; (by Washington) to keep diplomatic relations with Vietnam: (1) suspending economic assistance represented Japan's greatest foreign policy tool, and could be sufficient punishment; (2) American attempts at strongarming Japan into a full embargo and having Tokyo stop diplomatic relations with Vietnam might actually cause more problems in the US-Japan relationship that would outweigh any benefit to the US; (3) Tokyo could make a case that keeping relations with Vietnam actually enhanced Japan's regional leadership (a lead issue with Washington) in regard to China, the USSR, and the trading partners in Southeast Asia (ASEAN).

With the Reagan administration, pressure on Japan to carry more regional leadership increased, as evidenced by security issues such as the Reagan-Suzuki joint declarations which called for greater security participation by Japan and for increased aid to strategic countries in the region. Washington's policies placed greater leadership responsibility with Tokyo. Therefore, Japan's aid policies as well as trade levels gained the country a political voice in the region. Although Japan was party to no mutual security treaties, except for the US-Japan Mutual Security Agreement, increased aid signaled increased leadership for Tokyo in the eyes of Southeast Asia. Thus, the United States seemed willing to accept Japan's position of stopping economic assistance while allowing trade and diplomatic relations. From an American perspective, issues concerning China and the Soviet Union ranked as higher priorities in East Asia; therefore, the US-Japan security agreement was tantamount. Besides, difficulties in the US-Vietnam relationship hinged on issues unrelated to Tokyo's foreign policy-- namely, the POW/MIA problem and war reparations.

===China===
Evolution of the Sino-Japanese relationship is probably the most influential among the international influences on Japan-Vietnam relations during this period. Indeed, some scholars argue that the Peace and Friendship Treaty (PFT) between China and Japan, signed in October 1978, was the direct cause for the Russo-Vietnamese Friendship and Cooperation Agreement [see section below, The Soviet Union], and therefore a cause to Vietnam's belligerent behavior in Indochina. The shift in regional alignments put Japan's Asian policy at a crossroads-- the omnidirectional policy between Beijing and Moscow now seemed to be replaced by Tokyo-Beijing vs. Moscow-Hanoi. When this change in the Sino-Japanese relationship was challenged by opposition Diet member, Japan Socialist Party (JSP) chairman Asukata, Foreign Minister Sonoda tried to minimize any speculation by referring to the &quot;sharp difference&quot; between the Japanese and Chinese stands on Vietnam as proof that Japan would never blindly act in concert with China. However, Sonoda did not give the specifics of this &quot;difference&quot; at the time. The discussion centered around policy toward the Soviet Union, and Sonoda hinted at two goals: (1) conveying to the Soviets that Japan did not intend to participate in an anti-Soviet bloc (with China) and (2) positioning Japan apart from China in Hanoi's eyes. Taken together, these goals demonstrate that Sonoda was downplaying the alignment effect of the Sino-Japanese treaty in an effort to salvage the omnidirectional policy while reminding Vietnam that Tokyo intended to continue relations with Hanoi. Sonoda placed Japan between China and Vietnam, just as Tokyo had attempted to gain the middle ground between ASEAN and Vietnam.

In December 1978, Vietnam soft-pedaled its reaction to the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty, no doubt in an attempt to calm fears about its own treaty with the Soviet Union:

 [Mr. Dong, Vietnam Prime Minister] said the treaty between 
 Vietnam and the Soviet Union was not a military pact. . . . The
 friendship and cooperation treaty between China and Japan would
 not affect Vietnam's relations with other countries. 

However, diplomatic soothings soon gave way to Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia and China's &quot;punishment&quot; invasion into northern Vietnam. Japan's omnidirectional policy could no longer stand in light of the PFT, nor could Tokyo overtly side with China as an ally. On the eve of China's punitive action, the Japanese government officially expressed a plea for restraint, requesting that China not take military action against Vietnam in connection with the China-Vietnam border dispute. When the &quot;Third Indochina War&quot; erupted along the China-Vietnam border in February 1979, Japan was quick to call for an end to the fighting, but was reluctant to condemn either side:

 Sonoda issued a statement Sunday morning calling for a swift
 and peaceful settlement of the fighting that broke out Saturday
 between China and Vietnam. . . . He said that the government has
 also demanded the withdrawals of Chinese and Vietnamese forces
 &quot;from other countries,&quot; indicating that Japan asked Vietnam to
 pull out its troops from Cambodia. 

The mention of Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia in the same sentence as the call for an end to the China-Vietnam border war could be seen as a diplomatic victory for Beijing. Tokyo was practically endorsing China's reasons for the punitive war against Vietnam as well as equating the blame between the two countries, despite China's offensive across Vietnam's border.

Simultaneously, Tokyo sought to contain damage to the Sino-Japanese relationship. Foreign Minister Sonoda backpedaled from a statement in which he originally said, &quot;Japan has 'strongly protested' to China,&quot; later phrasing his comment as, &quot;[Japan] has expressed deep regrets over the last Chinese action.&quot; Throughout the three-week conflict, Sonoda repeated his confidence that the action would be brief and that China did not intend a deep, long-term offensive into Vietnam. For Japan, the economic, diplomatic, and security benefits of the Sino-Japanese friendship treaty were too great to justify condemning China or taking some sort of sanctioning action.

Tokyo's quest for the middle (while inplying a pro-China stance) put Japan in a position as possible mediator, especially when viewed from the Vietnamese side. From Vietnam's standpoint, having Japan mediate would weaken the Japan-China ties because Tokyo would have to show some sort of neutrality. In addition, Vietnam could gain diplomatic favor in Tokyo as a willing party for peace, which favor could eventually reopen the floodgates of economic assistance. Initially, Sonoda told the Diet that Japan had no intention of mediating between China and Vietnam. Yet Vietnam persisted, stating its readiness to negotiate under terms of Chinese troop withdrawals from Vietnamese territory. Furthermore, Vietnam's ambassador to Japan, Nguyen Giap &quot;. . . urged the Tokyo government to clearly distinguish between 'the aggressor' and 'the victim.'&quot; In response, Sonoda echoed Japan's friendly relations with Vietnam and reminded Giap of Japan's opposition to the use of force to settle a problem. He then went on to offer Japan's readiness to play a positive role for a peaceful settlement of the Indochinese conflict. Once again, Sonoda was linking the China-Vietnam border conflict with the Cambodian question by use of the term &quot;Indochinese conflict.&quot; Vietnam even went so far as to offer to withdraw its troops from Cambodia if China ceased its military assistance to the ousted Cambodian Government of Premier Pol Pot, and if the Pol Pot, forces stopped their resistance in Cambodia. This offer was no breakthrough, however, because such conditions were the whole purpose of Vietnam's decision to send troops into Cambodia in the first place.

With Japan's new role as mediator came hopes and suggestions from some in the Foreign Ministry that Japan could play a mediating role between Vietnam and the United States. Some suggested that Japan could provide assistance to Vietnam in order to act as the window for the West to Hanoi. Once again Japan's foreign policy goals were framed in terms of another country's interests: first, Japan cut off assistance because of ASEAN's security concerns, and now Japan could resume assistance in the name of helping build a bridge for the United States. Once again, Tokyo sought the middle ground between two poles.

===Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)===

The regional grouping ASEAN (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and later Brunei) had been little more than an economic council among third world developing countries prior to Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. The ASEAN grouping rarely made headlines before the Vietnamese incursion in 1978. However, Vietnam's belligerence awakened ASEAN, cementing the countries together in a common cause: peace and security in Indochina and the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. Japan had signed on with ASEAN two years earlier when Prime Minister Fukuda gave his famous Fukuda Doctrine speech in Manila in 1977. Though not stated directly, the Fukuda Doctrine outlined a partnership and cooperation with ASEAN in order to create solidarity and resilience as well as fulfill Japan's responsibility to foster relationships with Indochina.

In July 1979, ASEAN ministers and representatives from Japan, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand met in Bali for their annual conference. The Indochina problem headed the agenda. Japanese Foreign Minister Sonoda attended the conference with the two goals of reaffirming Japan's financial aid to the five countries and finding a solution to the Indochina question. The financial aid outlined in the Fukuda Doctrine was projected at one billion dollars, with a major project to be funded in each country. Clearly, Japan carried a lot of pull with ASEAN, which helps explain why ASEAN could not complain about Tokyo's diplomatic relations with Hanoi. At the conference, Sonoda gave reassurance that Japan would stand by ASEAN and proposed a primary link between Japan and the member countries in solving the regional problems:

 We had better not ask what other countries can do, but ask
 ourselves what we can do to solve the problems and consolidate
 our partnership. 

This was not intended as a sort of Monroe Doctrine for Southeast Asia with Japan providing the regional security. Rather, Sonoda was stressing the economic unity between Japan and ASEAN, and emphasizing that regional solutions, including those for Indochina, should be worked out regionally before asking for U.S. or European involvement.

The Bali conference resulted in a hard-line statement against Vietnam's incursion, along with language calling on Vietnam for a solution to the refugee problem, which was beginning to tax the resources of refugee destination countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Indonesian Foreign Minister Mochtar, a strong advocate of Japanese leadership in the region, paid homage to Japan's participation in ASEAN efforts to solve the Vietnamese refugee problem. Sonoda used the opportunity to hint at the grand alliance network forming in East Asia:

 ASEAN-Japanese, Sino-Japanese, and Sino-American relations
 were designed to preserve world peace. . . . I would like to call
 on the ASEAN and Japan to firmly secure the security of the
 region. 

The triumvirate of ASEAN, Japan, and the United States, along with China as a quasi-ally against Soviet expansionism, presented a formidable front against Vietnam's loose- cannon behavior in Indochina. While Japan could not use military force (a responsibility left to the Americans) in the region, the Fukuda Doctrine (as explained by Sonoda) aimed to secure the financial well-being of ASEAN, also securing Japan's leadership role in the region.

Vietnam rejected the statements from the Bali conference. Hanoi deemed that the Kampuchean (the new name of Cambodia) issue should be solved by the Kampuchean people, and that matters between Vietnam and Kampuchea, &quot;two sovereign countries,&quot; must be decided by those two countries without outside interference. The phrase &quot;sovereign countries&quot; is in direct reference to the founding documents and principles of ASEAN: ASEAN countries first and foremost must respect the sovereignty of other member nations.

From day one of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, ASEAN had made repeated calls for withdrawal. ASEAN took the lead position in calling for sanctions and cutting off economic assistance from regional powers. Such a vocal position provided political cover for the various powers, evidenced by the case of Japan's policy toward Vietnam. Such a strong position for ASEAN was hardly difficult or controversial because the U.S. was already embargoing Vietnam over the POW/MIA issue and China had cut off aid prior to the invasion because of ongoing attacks against the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia by Vietnamese-backed guerrillas. ASEAN could only gain politically in Washington and Beijing by appearing as a staunch ally against Soviet expansionism.

However, as the occupation of Cambodia settled into a long-term issue, this hard-line policy against Hanoi enabled other powers to suggest rapprochement without having to worry about being the standard-bearer against Vietnam. ASEAN played a very strong &quot;bad cop&quot; which allowed Japan and France to toy with being the &quot;good cop.&quot; In 1982, when France suggested it might resume aid to Vietnam, ASEAN ministers held emergency meetings with French External Relations Minister Claude Cheysson in Paris, seeking suspension of the planned $40 million in French aid. After long pressuring, France withheld the aid, but certainly scored points with Hanoi. Similar situations forced ASEAN to adopt resolutions calling on the European Community to step up its economic pressure and withhold assistance to Vietnam until Hanoi withdrew its troops from Kampuchea. As the strongest advocate against Vietnam, ASEAN's vociferousness actually allowed other countries, including Japan, to keep good relations with Hanoi. Tokyo maintained diplomatic relations and allowed the private sector to trade with Vietnam while keeping an official stance, consistent with ASEAN, of disapproval toward Hanoi's incursion.

As humanitarian aid began to flow into the beleaguered countries of Laos and Cambodia, ASEAN again took the role of policing against any benefit to Vietnam. As Japan began to suggest aid to Laos and Cambodia in an attempt to solve the Cambodian question, ASEAN voiced a concern that the aid not end up benefiting Vietnam. Tokyo retreated somewhat and reaffirmed its solidarity with ASEAN on resolution of the situation in Indochina. However, as with the French case, ASEAN's hard line against Vietnam allowed room for Japan to maneuver. Later that same week, Foreign Minister Mokhtar Kusumaatmaja, speaking on behalf of ASEAN, deferred to Japan slightly:

 ASEAN can accept continuation of Japanese aid [to Laos], but
 we feel that it should not exceed the amount given in previous
 years. 

The ministers of ASEAN faced a dilemma: by taking the hard-line position against Hanoi, they allowed Tokyo diplomats room to seize the middle ground, yet the ASEAN ministers could not criticize Japan without endangering the Japan-ASEAN aid relationship.

===The Soviet Union===
Relations were never on good terms between Japan and the Soviet Union. Tokyo consistently demanded the return of four Kurile islands seized at the end of WWII, and the Soviet Union consistently denied the request. The Soviets had always been wary of Japan's position under the US nuclear umbrella-- bases at Okinawa, Yokosuka and elsewhere in Japan enabled the US to project power effectively throughout East Asia. Diplomatically, Tokyo has tried to maintain an open invitation to better relations with the USSR, including repeated invitations for Soviet dignitaries to visit Japan. The Ohira and Nakasone cabinets were no different.

Economically, Japan carried a liberal policy on trade with communist countries. On the eve of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, Foreign Minister Sonoda was publicly forwarding a policy of liberalizing the trade restrictions under the COCOM accords:

 Trade with communist countries should be eased according to
 the changing situation, including the recent announcement of the
 normalization of Sino-US relations. . . . COCOM controls should
 be applied equally to Communist countries, including China and
 the Soviet Union.&quot;   

Clearly, Japan was looking toward the market potentials in China and perhaps in Vietnam as well. Trade between Japan and the USSR had always been relatively low.

As the border war between China and Vietnam erupted, Japan urged the Soviet Union &quot;to exercise restraint to prevent the Sino-Vietnam border conflict from spreading,&quot; though it is unclear how much attention the Soviets paid to Japan's opinion in the matter. In the early months of Vietnam's actions in Cambodia, when Tokyo was searching for reasons to continue economic assistance to Hanoi, the Foreign Ministry offered a carrot to Vietnam: Japan would continue to extend economic aid assistance to Vietnam as scheduled, despite increased Soviet military presence in that country. For reasons apart from the Cambodian question, Hanoi could earn points with Tokyo if it reduced the Soviet military presence-- after all, more than half of Japan's energy imports came through the sea lanes of Southeast Asia, and a significant Soviet presence at Cam Ranh Bay was a direct nuisance to those shipments.

Comparing Japan's reaction to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to Japan's reaction to Vietnam's actions into Cambodia highlights the difference in Tokyo's outlook on the two communist countries. One week after it froze aid to Vietnam, the Japanese government froze ・.2 billion in aid to Afghanistan. However, the Japanese House of Representatives went so far as to adopt a resolution demanding the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan, while such public declarations were never made against Vietnam. In the same session of the Diet, the House also adopted a resolution calling for a solution of the Northern Territories problem.

In contrast to its policy allowing industry from trading with Vietnam, the cabinet of Yasuhiro Nakasone stated in 1983 that economic relations with the Soviet Union would not be promoted separately from politics. In other words, trade hinged on resolving the territorial issue:

 It is necessary to continue dialogue and conduct exchanges
 with the Soviet Union.  However, I think it is difficult to
 separate business from politics as long as the territorial issue
 remains unsettled. 

Clearly Japan's relations with the Soviet Union centered around the territorial issue, and worries about Soviet influence in Southeast Asia played a secondary role. By the 1983 ASEAN conference, as Japan sought to play a positive role in solving the Cambodian question, Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe acknowledged the Soviet influence:

 Japan wants to approach Vietnam and the Soviet Union
 directly for a political settlement of the Kampuchean question.

Japan realized any solution in Indochina would require the Soviet Union in some role. Unfortunately, bilateral Soviet-Japan relations were frozen over the territorial issue disallowing any progress from that angle. The Soviet Union played a minor role in Japan- Vietnam relations. If Tokyo-Moscow communication had been more liberal, Tokyo's influence with Hanoi might have increased.

===Cambodia===
The Vietnam-backed Heng Samrin regime found little favor in Tokyo, except among the Japan Communist Party [see Domestic factors section below]. Among the Cambodian factions, Norodom Sihanouk carried the strongest voice because he forwarded a position favored by ASEAN. Japan was careful to stay low-key about which faction it supported: the China-favored Khmer Rouge had such an atrocious human rights record that Japan could not support them. Son Sann, head of the 15,000-strong anticommunist Khmer People's National Liberation Front, the third member of the coalition against Heng Samrin, was granted a chance to address his concerns to Nakasone in 1985. He framed the need to restrain Vietnam in terms Tokyo could understand: Soviet influence was spreading throughout Southeast Asia via Cam Ranh Bay and now Kampuchea. Prime Minister Nakasone assured the seventy-two- year-old Kampuchean leader that Japan had no plans to resume economic assistance to Vietnam. Foreign Minster Abe told Son Sann that the dispatch of a senior foreign ministry official to Vietnam later that month did not mean a change in Japan's economic aid policy toward Vietnam. On the whole, Japan's policy toward Cambodia fell somewhere near the U.S. position: opposition to Vietnam's unilateral invasion and support of Sihanouk's faction rather than the Chinesebacked Khmer Rouge. However, SinoJapanese ties prevented Tokyo from openly stating which faction it favored.

===International Monetary Fund===
During the early 1980s, Vietnam's economy went from bad to worse. The original postwar recovery plan relied heavily on large amounts of foreign direct investment (FDI) and aid to support infrastructure rebuilding. The invasion into Cambodia cost Hanoi in two ways: (1) the cessation of aid from Japan, the EC, and China strangled capital supply, and (2) huge drain on manpower and resources needed to maintain forces in Cambodia created a huge economic loss. It had become &quot;Vietnam's Vietnam.&quot; In 1985, the International Monetary Fund decided to halt loans to Vietnam after Hanoi defaulted on its debts. This was the first time the multilateral body had taken such action against any country. Vietnam's foreign debt stood at $6 billion at the end of 1983, of which $1.5 billion was owed to countries with convertible currencies. Hanoi had originally joined the IMF in 1976 as part of its recovery plan. Outside currencies from the Soviet Union, along with modest aid from Sweden, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland, was not enough to pay back the huge debts incurred over nine years.

===The influence of international factors===
It is difficult to isolate seminal events within the interplay of nations and to determine which move by one regional power affected the subsequent moves by other countries. However, some events outside the bilateral Japan-Vietnam relationship clearly influenced Japan's policy toward Vietnam during this difficult phase. Tokyo's position of neutrality under the omnidirectional philosophy was eroded when Japan concluded the Treaty of Peace and Friendship with China, and Vietnam announced the Mutual Cooperation Agreement with the Soviet Union weeks later. Verbal condemnations of Hanoi had to be altered to fit within the delicate Sino-Japanese relationship. As Chinese troops poured into Vietnam's northern provinces in 1979, Tokyo made blanket statements against all aggression in Indochina, virtually ratifying China's &quot;punishment war.&quot; Therefore, China stood as the replacement for U.S. military might in Indochina in lieu of Japanese forces. Tokyo's strength lay in its suspension of economic assistance. However, when suggestions arose that Japan approved of China's actions, Japanese officials were quick to put distance between Tokyo and Beijing in regard to Vietnam, which action benefited Tokyo's standing in Hanoi and with the ASEAN members leery of Chinese domination.

As the U.S. withdrew from involvement in Southeast Asia, both China and the Soviet Union moved to fill the vacuum. Japan could no longer operate under the wing of U.S. military might, and it needed to chart a course toward the center among hegemons in order to avoid polarization against another regional power. The Reagan administration pushed for greater regional leadership by Tokyo, and it was clear that Washington could no longer determine Japan's policy for dealing with Southeast Asia. Tokyo began to fill this leadership role with greater levels of aid for ASEAN and with punishment for Vietnam by stopping assistance programs. Sonoda's statement at the Bali conference, to &quot;solve the problems and consolidate our partnership&quot; shows Tokyo's desire to lead ASEAN in facing the greater world community. However, because of the veracity of ASEAN's condemnations of Vietnam's invasion, Tokyo gained the ability to keep relations with Hanoi-- an ability that would grow proportionally with ASEAN's harshness against Vietnam.

The Soviet Union had little clout in Japan because of the territorial issue. Despite the Soviet's position of &quot;parent state&quot; to Vietnam, Moscow influenced Japanese policy toward Hanoi very little. Attempts to link the Soviet presence at Cam Ranh Bay with resuming economic assistance fell upon deaf ears in Hanoi. The Cambodian issue weighed much more heavily among ASEAN, Beijing, Washington, and Tokyo as the determining factor for restoring assistance and full relations. Cambodian factional leaders visited Tokyo, raised humanitarian issues, and called for further sanctions against Vietnam, but their lobbying played only a minor role in determining Japan's policies toward Vietnam in comparison to the calculus of Sino-Japan relations, Japan-ASEAN solidarity, and U.S. pushes for greater leadership by Tokyo.

==Domestic factors==
As we have seen, Japan put forward various conditions for the resumption of economic assistance to Vietnam, conditions sometimes directly influenced by domestic concerns in Japan. Granted, Tokyo originally called on Vietnam to withdraw troops from Cambodia because of ASEAN's security concerns, but subsequent attempts by Japan to link aid with the refugee issue or Soviet expansion in Southeast Asia hint at possible domestic political influences on policy toward Vietnam. Later in 1979, as the refugee problem began to tax resources, Tokyo demanded Vietnam take responsibility. Also, in the summer of 1979, the Defense Ministry pointed to the Soviet presence at Cam Ranh Bay as a threat to domestic security, and the Foreign Ministry hinted that economic assistance might resume if the Soviet military presence were minimized.

Bureaucracies vary in their goals and priorities which are determined by the various functions within a government. Prior to the invasion, Japan's dealings with Vietnam centered around the economic assistance provided by the Ministry of Finance. However, when the Cambodian incursion sent ripples throughout the region, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs began to take the lead in determining policy toward Hanoi. We can therefore examine the stance of each bureaucracy in order to refine our understanding of the Japan-Vietnam relationship.

===Office of the Prime Minister===
Japan's relationship with Vietnam proceeded smoothly until news about the troubles in Cambodia began to reach the outside world in the winter of 1978. The joint statement issued in December 1978 shows that Japan was well aware of Vietnam's intentions, and had tried to commit Vietnam on paper to respect the sovereignty of her neighbors. When Vietnamese representative Trinh met with Ohira personally, Ohira stated Japan's wariness more bluntly:

 Ohira stressed the importance of Japan's relations with the
 countries of ASEAN. He added that Japan also wanted to further
 develop cooperative relations with the countries of Indochina. 
 Trinh asked for Ohira's opinion on the possibility of future
 exchange of visits between Ohira and Vietnamese Premier Pham Van
 Dong. Ohira replied that he would study the suggestion because
 such an exchange would be beneficial for both countries[italics
 added]. 

Ohira flatly declared that Japan's priorities lay with ASEAN. He refrained from promising Trinh that an exchange system would be established, rather he said that he would &quot;study the suggestion&quot;-- an ambivalent answer at best. When news of Vietnam's incursion became public, Ohira addressed the Diet:

 Meanwhile, recent developments surrounding Cambodia are
 extremely regrettable.  It is our strong hope that peace and
 stability can be restored under the principle of noninterference
 in domestic affairs and national self-determination.  From this
 viewpoint, the government is resolved to continue its all-out
 efforts for the restoration of peace and stability in this area
 through cooperation with the ASEAN and other countries. 

Once again, Ohira declared Japan's cooperation with ASEAN in solving the Indochinese crisis. Ohira was adamant about continuation of the Fukuda Doctrine. While Sonoda and the Foreign Ministry attempted to maintain some flexibility with Vietnam and to keep the door open for a resumption of assistance under certain conditions, the Prime Minister's office consistently emphasized Japan's ties with ASEAN whenever the Indochina question arose.

By the time Yasuhiro Nakasone took office as Prime Minister in November 1982, Vietnam was entrenched in Cambodia and the region faced little hope of progress on the issue of withdrawal. Nakasone's pro-U.S. policies, along with desires to see Japan take on a greater international leadership role, did not sit well with Vietnam. Hanoi invariably condemned the Nakasone cabinet for its pro-U.S. and defense buildup policies. An excerpt from an interview given to Kyodo News Agency journalists is typical of Nakasone's world view:

 Japan has been too modest, I want to see Japan have greater
 influence on international politics and discharge its due
 obligations as a member of the free world. 

In the same interview, Nakasone said that ASEAN would certainly welcome a stronger U.S.-Japan alliance, with the United States assuming a security role and Japan contributing economically. Thus, both Ohira and Nakasone offered little respite for Hanoi. When Nakasone asserted his new leadership in the office of the Prime Minister, he took a staunch anticommunist line (in step with U.S. President Reagan) in foreign policy matters. This further weakened Japan's omnidirectional stance. Maintaining ties with Vietnam was left solely to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

===Ministry of Foreign Affairs===
The mission of a foreign ministry is to foster relations with other countries and execute foreign policy decisions. Though the ・4 billion in economic assistance had been slotted for Vietnam prior to the invasion of Cambodia, the decision to suspend the aid was left to the Foreign Ministry. As such, Foreign Minister Sonoda was primarily responsible for Japan's relationship with Vietnam. Over the course of events during his tenure from 1977- 1979, Sonoda seemed somewhat more friendly to Vietnam than Prime Minster Ohira but was still critical of Vietnam's actions. In an initial reaction to the invasion, Sonoda, without naming the country, expressed his strong criticism of Vietnam's action, labeling it &quot;military intervention in the internal affairs of another country.&quot; However, Sonoda stated Japan's intent to fulfill its assistance obligation for 1978 but warned that future aid &quot;will have to be frozen in the case of intervention in the internal affairs of another nation.&quot; We can therefore extrapolate that Sonoda was willing to continue relations with Vietnam, but only under favorable conditions in Indochina.

After leaving office in 1979, Sonoda showed pride in his handling of the situation with Vietnam:
 Our country is one of very few [non-Communist] countries
 which can communicate with Vietnam.  This fact has been one of
 our major political resources, allowing us actively to play an
 important role for stabilizing Asia.  It is true that some of the
 ASEAN and Western countries, as well as China, have worried about
 our country's economic cooperation with Vietnam.  I understood
 this opinion and tried to postpone [economic assistance]
 implementation.  However, I believed that it was not wise to
 discontinue the aid.  The reason was that we had to maintain a
 communication route rather than to suspend our economic
 assistance of 14 billion yen per year.  Furthermore, when we
 provided economic aid, we used to advise Vietnam to purchase Thai
 and other ASEAN countries' products by using our aid.  We
 expected it to serve for the promotion of mutual understanding
 between Vietnam and the ASEAN countries. . . . Utilizing our
 communication channel [with Hanoi] we could also contribute to
 the development of US-Vietnamese dialogue, and actually we tried
 to do so several times. 

Sonoda's regret over discontinuing aid to Vietnam is understandable, given his position as foreign minister. His responsibility was to foster ties with other countries. From Sonoda's standpoint, stopping economic assistance to Vietnam virtually halted any progress made with Hanoi because such an action eliminated Japan's greatest foreign policy tool-- foreign aid. Furthermore, Sonoda understood the leverage to be gained in the region if Tokyo could successfully become the bridge or conduit between Vietnam and the West. Such a position would allow the Foreign Minister to spin any proposal from the U.S. or ASEAN to fit the Japanese Foreign Ministry's agenda. Sonoda felt Japan played a balancing role in Asia, and that Tokyo should take some credit for the US-China agreement on normalization of ties (only Japan was notified in advance of the US decision to normalize relations with China).

As Japan attempted to steer the middle between the West and Vietnam, it encountered criticism for feet-dragging-- for allowing very limited numbers of refugees in despite its strong economy. The Foreign Ministry was aware of this problem and recommended increasing the quota, but to little avail. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry maintained the nuts and bolts of relations with Vietnam: exchanges of visits, persons, and cultural events. As one Foreign Ministry source put it:

 Different assessments and policies of Tokyo and Hanoi do not
 deter the Japanese from emphasizing the need to maintain a
 healthy relationship with the Vietnamese. 

Visits by parliamentarians and former Foreign Minister Yoshio Sakurauchi in 1985 were &quot;strictly&quot; goodwill missions and were in response to a similar parliamentarians' mission from Vietnam in 1983.

Yet even the diplomatic exchanges suffered from Hanoi's reduced standing. Throughout the early 1980s, Japan's relations with Vietnam were stagnant, except for the yearly visits by cultural attaches and other low-level exchanges. However, the diplomatic relationship between Japan and Vietnam was not balanced. Several high-ranking Vietnamese officials visited Japan, while the complementary visits by Japanese bureaucrats were made by relatively low-level personnel or opposition party members [see section on JCP below]. If a calculus could be created where the rank of an official were multiplied by the number of visits per year to show the &quot;superior/inferior&quot; relationships vis-a-vis Confucian politics, Vietnam would certainly score lower than Japan.

===Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)===
Though I could find no direct evidence or statements on Vietnam from MITI, it is likely that the ministry resisted suspension of the economic assistance. The precipitous drop in trade certainly hurt Japanese industries, as did the loss to banks that could no longer finance the government outlays in aid to Hanoi. During Trinh's visit to Japan in December 1978, Tatsuzo Mizukami, chairman of the trade policy committee for the powerful private business lobby Keidanren, said that promotion of mutual understanding would eventually lead to expansion of bilateral trade between Japan and Vietnam. Certainly MITI felt much the same. However, because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' economic assistance had frozen, there was little MITI could do. Part of Japan's isolation of Hanoi was to cut off access to funds in the import-export bank for Japanese corporations. If companies wished to trade with Vietnam, they were on their own. However, in comparison to the U.S., which outlawed firms from trading or signing contracts with Vietnamese counterparts (complete embargo), the Japanese policy looks quite mild. As we will later see, Japan grew to be Vietnam's second largest trading partner despite structural restrictions placed on the bilateral relationship.

===Political parties===

Throughout this period, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) held a dominant position in both houses of parliament, and therefore all the major cabinet positions were filled by LDP members. The LDP position on Vietnam was virtually the same as the official government policy: limit economic assistance but allow trade and diplomatic relations. However, as Japan placed limitations on its relations with Vietnam, some of the opposition parties took the opportunity to attack the government positions. The most vocal were the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) and Japan Communist Party (JCP), (for obvious reasons). It is doubtful any of the opposition comments actually affected policy.

In 1978, the Japan Socialist Party Chairman Asukata reacted to the Japan-China agreement with some trepidation. The JSP worried that Japan might become part of China's anti-Soviet strategy. However, Sonoda replied that was not the case, and referenced the differences on policy toward Vietnam as an example. On the whole, the JSP welcomed the normalization of the US-China relations on the grounds that this move would &quot;help ease tension and contribute to peace.&quot;

The Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), a smaller opposition party with only thirty-two out of 511 seats in 1979, agreed with the government's handling of the Cambodian situation and declared its solidarity with ASEAN. However, the DSP also held off on support of the coalition government in Cambodia (the anti-Heng Samrin coalition). The DSP argued that support should come only after the coalition was &quot;firmly established and [had won] wide international recognition.&quot; The DSP chairman Watanabe also declared his party's unity with the government on the issue of denying economic assistance to Vietnam. Many of the opposition parties appeal to urban housewives and use humanitarian issues to define themselves apart from the Liberal Democratic Party. This issue was no different. In the same statement in which the DSP declared its support of the government position, Watanabe also called on the government to increase aid to Indochinese refugees on humanitarian grounds.

Opposition parties generally supported the LDP government's position on Vietnam, with one glaring exception: the Japan Communist Party (JCP). Estranged from both Beijing and Moscow, the JCP found itself singled out within Tokyo as well. For the JCP, the issue was not necessarily a show of support for Hanoi but a fight against Tokyo's succumbing to the power politics between the US, China, and the USSR When Trinh visited Japan in December 1978, just prior to the invasion of Cambodia, House of Councilors JCP member Hiroshi Tachiki urged the Ohira government to &quot;actively develop friendly relations between Japan and Vietnam, independently of the policies of the major powers.&quot; Tachiki criticized Japan's decision to delay economic assistance to Vietnam. In response, Sonoda defended Tokyo's position in developing relations with Vietnam &quot;no matter what China's policy is.&quot; Sonoda himself was aware of the possible perception Japan might be giving to Vietnam and the rest of Southeast Asia: Japanese-Chinese collusion. The JCP continued to exploit this weakness of the LDP government, ridiculing the U.S.-Chinese diplomatic normalization, along with giving the classic Marxist interpretation of the Japan-China PFT as &quot;only natural&quot; in the course of international relations.

On Cambodia, the JCP sided with Vietnam's explanation of events. Chairman Miyamoto of the JCP stressed that the Kampuchean people had overthrown the Pol Pot regime. The JCP also publicly called for resistance to what they termed as &quot;Beijing authorities who are urging Japan to issue a joint statement and take coordinated action on the Indochinese situation in accordance with the Peace and Friendship Treaty.&quot; The LDP government had said repeatedly that the peace and friendship treaty did not require such coordinated action, but the JCP still used the issue to divorce themselves from Beijing. By May of 1979, the JCP had publicly denounced China and said its long-standing feud with USSR was ending.

===The private sector===

As stated above, Japan's private sector corporations stood to lose only from the suspension of economic assistance. The Keidanren courted Trinh when he visited Japan prior to the invasion, but there was little it could do in the face of international and domestic political pressures on Japan's policy. All was not lost, however. Although international considerations motivated Tokyo to suspend economic assistance, Japan's policy stopped short of a trade embargo. Only official channels were closed. Japanese firms willing to risk operating without loan guarantees, export insurance, or capital from government funds could trade with Vietnam.

Lobbying for liberalizing relations did occur. One group, the Japan-Vietnam Friendship Association, sent a statement to Japanese Prime Minister Ohira and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Industry, and Agriculture and Fishery, demanding that the Japanese government not suspend economic aid to Vietnam. Such groups usually consist of company executives with interests in the foreign country. The statement pointed out the hypocrisy that Japan would be committing in light of agreements reached with Trinh in December 1978, and it claimed that Tokyo's policy reflected a chauvinistic attitude of a big nation that can rely on its financial muscle to influence the foreign policy of another country. However, such lobbying had little effect.

Trade dropped off in several sectors in 1979, on the heels of assistance suspension [see charts 2.1 and 2.2]. On the export side, the chemicals trade had been growing steadily from 1975 reaching $118 million in 1978, but then fell to less than half that level in 1979. Natural oils and basic manufactures had also seen growth from 1975 to 1978 but suffered losses after economic assistance was suspended.

Imports from Vietnam give interesting evidence on the effect of economic aid suspension. Mineral fuels (mostly coal, because crude oil fields had yet to be developed) and seafood (shrimp, cuttlefish) were growing up until 1978, then fell precipitously. It is important to note that these sectors fell prior to the economic aid suspension, indicating market problems within Vietnam as the lead factor, not the political decision to stop aid. Also, the raw materials sector, consisting mostly of lumber and tin, actually grew steadily despite Tokyo's policy. Like the raw materials sector, seafood imports began to grow from 1980 onwards, indicating that this sector wasn't beholden to government policies either.

By 1983, Japan had become Vietnam's chief noncommunist trading partner, with an annual trade of over $150 million. Trade could have climbed higher, but Hanoi placed a ceiling on trade because of a shortage of foreign exchange. Japanese firms resorted to private financing, with payment made upon receipt of goods or through short-term credit. Companies involved in Vietnam included Komatsu, National, Honda, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Toyo, Yamaha, and Sumitomo. However, the Japanese firms had yet to set up branch offices or serious manufacturing bases within Vietnam. A majority of the activity consisted of barter-trades in lumber and seafood in exchange for basic manufactures and chemicals.

A careful look at the trade data [see graphs at end of chapter] yields an important clue into understanding Japan's policy toward Vietnam. Imports from Vietnam dropped in some sectors before aid was suspended while they climbed steadily in other sectors. In either case, Tokyo's aid policy does not seem to be the controlling factor on trade. Therefore it can be inferred that importers did not try to pressure Tokyo into changing its policy. Conversely, while exports to Vietnam fell dramatically because of the aid suspension, these exporters' main markets were the United States and ASEAN, and they therefore could not risk international criticism if they were to try to press Tokyo for liberalizing economic aid to Vietnam.

===Influences from the domestic level===

Tokyo had promised ・4 billion in economic assistance just weeks before Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. When the Indochina situation exploded, Japan's concerns switched to its relations with ASEAN and China from its promise of aid promised to Hanoi. Policy became driven by Foreign Ministry goals to maintain good relations with the high-volume trade partners in Southeast Asia. There was little standing in the way to prevent or deter such a policy focus. Neither the Prime Minister, Finance Ministry, MITI, or the private sector had valid arguments for continuing aid to Vietnam. Prime Minister Ohira, and later Prime Minister Nakasone, gave little weight to Vietnamese pleas to resume the aid, instead boldly stating to Vietnamese delegates that Japan's priorities stood with ASEAN. The Finance Ministry had already earmarked the funds, and therefore fulfilled its bureaucratic duties. The sending of those funds was left to the Foreign Ministry. MITI and the private sector could not ignore the Sino-Japanese and ASEAN-Japanese relationships when calculating market potentials and delicate trade relations. Besides, major imports from Vietnam had fallen before the invasion, indicating trouble at the source, and not political decisions, as the reason for the drop in trade.

==Conclusion==

After some hesitation and various attempts at negotiation with Hanoi, Tokyo decided to suspend economic assistance to Vietnam in early 1979, just months after Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. Tokyo tried to work out solutions with Vietnam, offering to restore some aid if certain problems could be resolved, like the Soviet presence in Cam Ranh Bay or the refugee issue, but to no avail-- Hanoi would not withdraw its troops from Cambodia.

The Japan-Vietnam relationship, which had been quite warm prior to the Cambodian invasion, suffered from environmental changes within the region. International factors involving China, the US, and ASEAN certainly affected Japan's foreign policy toward Vietnam. When Japan signed the China-Japan friendship and peace treaty in October 1978, and Vietnam signed the mutual cooperation treaty with the Soviet Union weeks later, both Tokyo and Hanoi had moved from &quot;omnidirectional&quot; (Japan) and &quot;equidistant&quot; (Hanoi) positions relative to Beijing and Moscow. This involvement served to polarize the relationship somewhat, because Japan now firmly belonged in the Western camp and Vietnam came to be seen as a satellite of Soviet (Brezhnev Doctrine) expansionism. Japan's relationship with ASEAN, established in 1977 with Prime Minister Fukuda's announcement of aid and cooperation, deepened with policy cooperation opposing Vietnam's actions in Indochina. However, Tokyo was able to use this relationship to provide diplomatic cover in its dealings with Hanoi, by explaining the aid suspension in terms of ASEAN security concerns and not as punishment from Japan. Furthermore, as the vacuum of US involvement in Southeast Asia continued, and American administrations pushed for greater leadership from Tokyo, Japan found its regional role increasing. In some ways, Tokyo's hand was forced into stopping assistance to Hanoi, given the friendship treaty with China and an obvious choice of either siding with ASEAN or Vietnam. However, Japanese policymakers steered Japan toward the middle, deftly playing the softer role in comparison to other regional powers' treatment of Vietnam.

Domestically, policy toward Vietnam was left to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Economic assistance programs had been budgeted by the Ministry of Finance, but subsequently halted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in light of the Japan-U.S. and Sino- Japanese relationships. Trade diminished somewhat because of the suspension, but this reduction may have been due to production problems within Vietnam. Although the JCP sided with Hanoi, all other parties agreed with the majority LDP in taking a hard-line stance against Vietnam. Given the international stakes, Japan's suspension of aid had few opponents in Tokyo.

|__TOC__
|}
When Vietnam withdrew its forces from Cambodia in September 1989, Hanoi fulfilled a long-standing requirement for restoration of economic assistance from Japan. However, nuances of the Japan-U.S. relationship, Japan's position among regional powers, and Tokyo's domestic agenda prevented an immediate restoration of aid. The Cold War was over, and Vietnam no longer posed a viable threat as a Soviet satellite or as a loose cannon in Indochina. Hanoi, now abandoned by Moscow and Eastern Europe, grew more and more anxious for help from the West, especially from Japan. Tokyo, while eager to resolve the Indochina problem through aid and economic assistance, faced strained U.S-Japan trade relations and still-dormant U.S.-Vietnam relations, two factors preventing liberalization of its policy. Economic assistance would not come until November 1992. This three-year end game, in which the basic requirements for restoring aid had been met but international politics outside the Japan-Vietnam relationship determined Tokyo's policy, gave Tokyo in a difficult problem: how to move ahead of the U.S. in restoring aid to a communist government without creating an overly dominant profile in East Asia or compromising the alliance with the United States.

To explain why Japan hesitated until 1992 to restore economic assistance, I first give an overview of the bilateral direct dealings between Japan and Vietnam and then address international factors and Japan's reactions to movements by regional powers, reactions that in turn affected the relationship with Vietnam. After investigating the international factors, I then examine domestic factors such as the policies of the bureaucracies, the political parties, and the private sector to show how emerging economic pressures to restore assistance programs began to add urgency to Tokyo's dealings with Vietnam.

==Bilateral Relations==

Both Japan and Vietnam foresaw the resumption of economic assistance as the next logical step toward closer ties. Vietnam needed aid badly to shore up its economy after Soviet assistance virtually dried up. Japan had begun to place more emphasis on its own role as a regional leader, diplomatically and economically. To further this goal of leadership, Tokyo hoped to bring peace and economic development to Indochina.

===Vietnam's need for aid===

In 1989, with the troop withdrawal confirmed by the United Nations and real progress made toward a viable political solution in Cambodia, both Vietnam and Japan were eager for Tokyo to resume official economic assistance. Vietnam desperately needed aid because economically collapsing Eastern bloc countries could no longer support subsidies to Hanoi. As Soviet governments laid out their five-year plans for 1991-1995, the outlook from a senior Soviet official was grim:

In the next five-year plan, Vietnam won't get much economic aid.  We'll exchange goods and provide technical assistance, but subsidies will depend on the Supreme Soviet.  I don't think they will be very high.
          

After 1990, aid from the Soviet Union dropped to a fraction of previous levels. Vietnam's imports from the Soviet Union began to drop from a high of 1.79 billion rubles in 1988 to 1.53 billion rubles in 1989. By 1991, imports had dropped to one-third of 1989's level. Clearly, Vietnam could no longer depend on its parent state for economic assistance.

Vietnamese leaders were very public about their need for help. Vo Dong Giang, a senior member of Vietnam's Investment Committee, called on Japan to help rebuild and strengthen Vietnam's roads and railways as well as its manufacturing sector. Vietnam recognized its war-torn infrastructure as the biggest obstacle to an improved economy. Unfortunately, the size of such infrastructure projects required amounts of money that only official government loans or grants could cover. Dr. Pham Khac Chi, general director of the state-controlled Foreign Investment Service Company (under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations), invited Japan to &quot;take the initiative&quot; in improving Vietnam's economic situation, commenting that the international finance troubles facing Hanoi would improve quickly following Tokyo's lead.

Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach visited Tokyo in October 1990. Japan's foreign Ministry heralded the visit as the beginning of a &quot;new era in Japanese-Vietnamese relations,&quot; but the ministry was quick to say the situation was still premature for a resumption of aid. Here again, relative inferior/superior positions of Vietnam and Japan are clear: the Vietnamese Foreign Minister was granted audience in Tokyo, but hat in hand, for the first time in over a decade. Japan's Foreign Ministry extended the invitation as a reward for Vietnam's improved relations with the West and for the improvement of the Cambodian situation. Following Thach's trip to Japan, the state-run media in Vietnam regularly featured news about Japan and its economic investment power. The propaganda attempted to link the two countries, drawing parallels between Japan's Meiji Restoration and Vietnam's concurrent intellectual awakening.

Tokyo was warming up to Hanoi as well. Japanese officials listed Vietnam's importance in both commercial and geopolitical terms. The raw material supply in Indochina and Vietnam's potential market of 70+ million consumers would dovetail nicely with Japan's economy. Japanese diplomats weighed Vietnam as a central player in resolving the Cambodian issue and bringing peace to Indochina:

We regard Vietnam as one of the most important countries for stabilizing Asia and the Pacific.
Yet control of the relationship still lay in Tokyo's half of the court. Vietnam could only hope for a resumption of economic assistance; it had already fulfilled the major obligations by withdrawing troops from Cambodia and setting its economy on the road to recovery. But, interestingly enough, Hanoi's destiny lay in the hands of its former enemy, the United States, which still exerted a veto power over international aid agencies and pushed allies like Japan into delaying action.

Clearly, Vietnam couldn't progress much further economically without ODA money from the West, as Bui Xuan Nhat, director of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's Economic Cooperation Department explained:

We consider ODA as pre-investment [assistance], paving the way for private investors to come.  The best way to pave the way is by developing the infrastructure, which is now still so weak.
          

Vietnam's Premier Vo Van Kiet echoed a similar position in a meeting with the president of Nihon Keizai Shimbun:

Hopefully, the cooperative relationship Vietnam now enjoys with Japan, including assistance in developing Vietnam's infrastructure, will improve in the near future.

          

Vietnam would wait until November 1992, when Tokyo would announce that it was resuming economic grants and commodity loans. Japan showed signs of its willingness to resume aid, but the U.S.-Japan relationship, Hanoi's debts to the IMF, and the continued political disarray in Cambodia prevented closer official ties.

Japan's willingness to resume economic assistance

By 1989, Japan had begun to directly pressure Vietnam for a solution in Cambodia. Foreign Minister Nakayama kept the carrot right in front of Vietnamese Foreign Minister Thach in order to gain Vietnam's cooperation:

If Vietnam is willing to cooperate with the guerrilla

          alliance, Japan will come up with a variety of measures to help

          reconstruct the Vietnamese economy, including the resumption of

          assistance, which has been suspended since fiscal 1979.

          

          

This baiting of Vietnam came as a companion to the policy of providing aid to the entire region that had been discussed with ASEAN officials earlier. Japan had stopped alluding to ethereal concepts of regional harmony or hinting at assistance levels for the entire region. Tokyo had stepped up its pressure on Hanoi, with direct references to aid in exchange for cooperation.

Although official visits by high-ranking Japanese officials were suspended in 1978, parliamentarians and bureaucrats increasingly paid unofficial calls to Hanoi, starting in 1987. These visits reached a new level in September 1989, when former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita (still a power-wielding member of the LDP) met with Vietnamese Vice Premier Vo Nguyen Giap in Beijing, just as troops were withdrawing from Cambodia. The two agreed to &quot;expand bilateral relations&quot; and do their utmost to &quot;develop friendly and cooperative ties.&quot; This marked a new acceptance of Vietnamese leaders, though no concrete plans were presented because the meeting was not official. In fact, Takeshita stressed that cultural ties should precede economic ties, and the meeting had been hurriedly arranged by Giap's aides, once again evidence of Vietnam's insecurity relative to Japan.

Official visits to Vietnam by high ranking Japanese began in September 1990, when Rep. Michio Watanabe, vice-chairman of the Japan-Vietnam Parliamentarians Committee, toured Indochina and ASEAN countries. His review of Japan-Vietnam relations sounded promising:

All the conditions for Japan to begin economic cooperation

          with Vietnam are in place.  In order to secure stability and

          economic growth in the Asian-Pacific region, weight must be

          given to cooperation in the rebuilding of Vietnam's

          infrastructure.

          

Vietnam emphasized the visit as a precursor to a visit in November 1990 by Vietnamese Foreign Affairs Minister Nguyen Co Thach and by Nguyen Mai, vice chairman of the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment, which marked a new era in bilateral relations. Officials were beginning to transit between Hanoi and Tokyo at an almost complementary, reciprocal level-- an important step for Vietnam.

When Minister Thach met with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, in November 1990, the Japanese minister followed through with Tokyo's intent to include Vietnam as a key player in solving the Cambodian issue. Nakayama congratulated Vietnam on its withdrawal of troops and &quot;asked Vietnam to cooperate&quot;; the congratulations and request show a change of tone from the days of economic threats and sanctions. Furthermore, Nakayama discussed plans for development in Indochina, an obvious reference to the huge amounts of aid that would be forthcoming if a comprehensive solution could be found. For the time being, Nakayama offered continued humanitarian aid and cultural cooperation. Tokyo's policy remained as it was, but the stage was being set for the resumption of economic assistance. Nakayama's statements reveal Tokyo's positive outlook, but outside pressures (the U.S.) exerted enough influence to keep Japan's policies conservative.

By June 1991, Tokyo was willing to offer a &quot;limited aid package&quot; to assist and encourage Vietnam's economic reforms. However, Foreign Ministry officials made clear that this package not involve any financial assistance. Masaharu Kohng, Director in charge of Indochinese Affairs, announced this aid just prior to Nakayama's visit to Vietnam and just prior to the Seventh Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party. Timing seems to be the crucial element of this announcement, and Japan was anxious to see the Vietnamese Congress move further with its reforms and not slip back into a command economy:

It is a rather encouraging sign that this doi moi policy has

          taken root since the last party conference in 1986.  We would

          like to encourage this direction which the Vietnamese

          government has been taking.

          

Kohno explained that the aid constituted technical and intellectual aid that would be &quot;conducive'' to the advancement of the reform policies. Diplomatically, Nakayama's visit was intended to strengthen the foundation of bilateral ties and be a gesture of Japan's support for Vietnam's taking a &quot;more active&quot; role in rebuilding peace in Indochina. Here again, Tokyo treated Hanoi as part of the solution, not part of the problem. Kohno echoed Japan's position of strength between Vietnam and ASEAN:

 The purpose [of the visit] is to have a political dialogue
 with Vietnam.  I am quite confident there will be no negative
 response from the ASEAN countries because we stand firm on
 the Cambodian issue and we have no intention to jeopardize the
 peace process.

Nakayama discussed Vietnam's future role in the region with Thach and other Vietnamese leaders and promised Japanese aid in the expansion of cultural ties by accepting more Vietnamese students, building a Japan study center in Vietnam, and donating aid monies to preserve Vietnamese cultural assets. Cultural ties and nonfinancial aid incurred little political cost for Japan because such measures did not upset ASEAN, the U.S., or China by crossing the line drawn against Hanoi. For Tokyo, however, the overtures showed Japan's sincerity toward Hanoi, and intimated the amounts of ODA that would come, once a conducive international setting could be created.

By January 1991, Japan had stepped to the doorway of resuming economic assistance to Vietnam by openly setting amounts of ODAas well as dates by and conditions on which ODA would resume. Japanese government sources cited expectations of a viable solution coming from the Cambodian peace talks to be held in Paris from October 21 to 23 that same year. They saw the peace talks as a benchmark from which to gauge timetables for the resumption of aid. Initial estimates of aid amounted to roughly ・0 billion ($76 million) for each country. However, the officials added that aid would only be forwarded after consultations with the IMF, the World Bank, and Western governments.

The announcement of a semidefined timetable and estimated amounts of aid was a big change in Japan's policy-- Tokyo had announced levels of aid before conditions governing that aid had been met. Prior to this announcement, Tokyo had only hinted and alluded to forthcoming aid, never giving amount estimates or defining timetables. After an agreement had been signed in Paris in October, Foreign Minister Nakayama further refined Tokyo's position by spelling out specific goals for Hanoi such as settling Vietnam's overdue debts with Japan. In retrospect, this conditional statement might have been a stalling tactic by Tokyo, intended to preserve Japan-U.S. relations. Nakayama, while taking an affirmative stance on Indochina, stated Japan's &quot;no-rush&quot; position for resuming aid after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker:

 We want to proceed with economic reconstruction of
 Indochina in concert with the Association of Southeast Asian
 Nations and the United States.

After the mostly successful summit in Paris, Japan was poised to resume assistance to Vietnam. The only remaining obstacles were cooperation issues among the Cambodian factions and the logistics of how to clear Vietnam's debts with Japan.

In January 1992, Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe acknowledged Japan's intent to provide aid and announced that an official aid mission would be dispatched to Vietnam from January 11 to 19 to discuss how to resolve Hanoi's ・0 billion ($160 million) debt to Japan. The Vietnamese press leaked that Japan was contemplating providing ・ billion ($32 million) beginning in April (the start of the fiscal year) but Japan denied this statement. According to one Japanese official who went on the investigative mission, the situation looked promising:

 Personally, I think Japan should commit ・0-40 billion
 ($240-320 million) in commodity loans as a shot in the arm for
 the Vietnamese economy.  Ideally, most of the Japanese loans
 should be used to buy commodities from ASEAN countries.  We
 want to avoid a situation under which Japanese companies would
 flock there looking for aid-related business.

However, commodity loans would have to wait for Vietnam to clear its debts with Japan. Koji Kakizawa, Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, told a lunch meeting that aid could resume by the end of 1992 if the outstanding debt could be resolved. The Foreign Ministry spokesman, commenting on Kakizawa's statement, offered a solution: Tokyo might negotiate a deal with Hanoi whereby Japan could offer fresh loans or assistance to Vietnam in return for a pledge that outstanding debts would be repaid.

As late as 15 October 1992, no decision to resume full economic assistance (commodity loans, economic grants) had been reached. However, Japan was willing to donate ・ million toward two community projects via a small-grant program, initiated in 1989, that provided funds of around ・ million to grassroots projects in developing countries. This program was not a resumption of full assistance, but it marked the first economic assistance to Vietnam outside of humanitarian (food and medicine) grants in thirteen years.

By 30 October 1992, Tokyo and Hanoi had moved to resolve the debt issue in the manner suggested earlier by the Foreign Ministry. A series of fresh loans would be used to bridge the outstanding debt and unlock economic assistance. One official remarked:

 [It's] a matter of time.  There's no question that we are
 heading in the direction of a resumption of aid. 

A week later, the long period of economic isolation officially ended. With a Cambodian peace settlement, signed a year earlier in October 1991, and bridge loans to cover Vietnam's debt, Tokyo was poised to announce the huge grants and loans to which officials had been alluding since 1989.

On 6 November 1992, the Japanese government announced the extension of a ・5.5 billion ($370 million) credit to Vietnam. Hanoi repaid the outstanding debt, and an agreement was signed in Hanoi by Vietnam's Deputy Foreign Minister Vu Khoan and Japanese Ambassador Hiroyuki Yushita. The amount was derived directly from Vietnam's debt repayment via a separate bridge loan provided by a syndicate of six Japanese banks. The banks provided Hanoi with ・3.5 billion and resolved the last standing condition of the Foreign Ministry:

 The long-standing debt problem with Vietnam has been

          resolved, thus removing an obstacle to Japan's economic

          cooperation.  Japan's assistance to Vietnam's ongoing effort

          toward economic openness and reform will contribute to the

          stability of Vietnam and of the Southeast Asian region.

          

The announcement also included plans for a thirty-year commodity loan (1 percent with a ten-year grace period) through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, which would be used to pay for Vietnamese imports, although the loan would not be tied to the purchase of Japanese goods or services.

Bilateral economic assistance to Hanoi had resumed after almost fourteen years of official isolation. Vietnam had fulfilled Japan's expectations by withdrawing troops from Cambodia, pressing its Heng Samrin puppet-faction to cooperate with the opposition triumvirate, and pledging renewed diligence on clearing its outstanding debts. Hanoi's status in Tokyo took another step forward when Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited Japan in March 1993. This visit was the first visit of a Vietnamese head of state since diplomatic relations were established in 1973 and Kiet's first visit to a major industrial nation. Japan Prime Minister Miyazawa welcomed Kiet's visit, which &quot;opened up a new era in Japan-Vietnam relations.''

However, the fact that Japan waited until November 1992 to restore economic assistance raises several questions. What prompted Tokyo's three-year delay after troops began to withdraw in September 1989? More specifically, why did Tokyo hesitate a full year after the Cambodian Peace Agreement was signed in October 1991? What international concerns or pressures influenced policymakers at Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and what factors influenced the programs created in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance's Vietnam policies? These issues will be addressed in the rest of this chapter.

==International Factors==

Having discussed the direct dealings between Japan and Vietnam, an investigation of the various actions of regional players would clarify our understanding of the possible motives for Tokyo's policies within this bilateral relationship. Although Japan's foreign policy had matured in regional leadership and developmental assistance, Washington's agenda for Southeast Asia, the agenda of international organizations, and the perception of Japan's role by its Asian neighbors affected that policy. Having successfully steered a middle course between Vietnam and the United States, ASEAN, and China, Tokyo needed to upgrade relations with Hanoi without detracting from its relationships with these other regional players. Thus, the policies of Washington, the ASEAN countries, and Beijing held some sway on the speed of Japan's liberalization toward Vietnam.

===Return to the IMF===

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had suspended its assistance to Vietnam in 1985 because Hanoi could not pay off its outstanding debts to the organization. Though political issues are technically not supposed to affect IMF policy, the United States, as the largest shareholder in the IMF, succeeded in preventing access by Vietnam until a viable political solution could be found in Indochina. But, in 1990, U.S. officials were willing to let the IMF sell $1.2 billion in gold in order to help eleven of the world's poorest nations, including Vietnam and Cambodia, pay off debts to the fund. However, United States officials with the IMF still refused Vietnam's reentry into the IMF loan schemes. The gold sale was more for the benefit of the bank rather than the countries involved.

Vietnam was not without its supporters in the IMF. A group led by France and including Sweden, Italy, Canada, and Australia looked toward resolving Vietnam's debt problems, estimated at $110 million. France and the other supporters were proposing a scheme in which Vietnam could earn &quot;rights&quot; toward future financing after adopting IMF- approved economic restructuring measures. But both Washington and Tokyo opposed any action on behalf of Vietnam until a political settlement in Cambodia could be reached.

By September 1990, France had declared its willingness to raise up to $10 million toward Hanoi's debt relief and normalization with the IMF. Sweden and Australia mentioned similar amounts with the latter committing to at least $4.1 million. French banks, looking to syndicate the bridge loan for the full debt owed to the IMF, continued to be frustrated by the adamant conditions from the U.S. and Japan, because any bridge loan would depend on Hanoi's access to IMF monies for repayment. The Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterier (BCFE) hoped to include Japanese banks in the syndication plan, but the Japanese banks had received instructions not to participate from Japan's Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, the BCFE was frustrated because officials in Paris decided to wait for Washington to stop pressuring Japan and others to stand against Hanoi. At the IMF board meeting, on 26 October 1990, the United States and Japan remained opposed to a structural-adjustment program for Vietnam. By November, France and the other supporters for Vietnam's readmission thought to perhaps extend the loans independently of the IMF.

Washington's pressure on Tokyo to maintain the hard-line stance against Hanoi's readmittance into the IMF continued through 1991. Senior Japanese officials reaffirmed their position of both &quot;respecting U.S. leadership&quot; and &quot;remaining in the fold&quot; with other donors in regards to Vietnam:

:''I think the understanding about Vietnam's situation is there. But the IMF cooperation is not finally agreed on among the countries and that is very important. That is something we have to discuss from now on.'' [italics added]

          

Japan's leaders neither openly supported France's efforts to restore IMF assistance to Vietnam nor took the lead position in continuing to reject Vietnam's reinstatement. The above statement stresses the lack of cooperation and consensus among the IMF countries (namely, the United States and France) as its reason for agreeing (or not agreeing) to any proposals.

Two weeks following Tokyo's announcement of the ・5.5 billion commodity loan to Vietnam in November 1992, Japan and France announced their intention to assume responsibility for Vietnam's $140 million in overdue debt to the International Monetary Fund. Tacit agreement from the U.S. took the form of American officials commenting they would not block the efforts once progress came on the MIA issue. In other words, Washington would allow the loans if Hanoi granted further access to U.S. investigators. The speed of the announcement, coming just after the renewed bilateral commodity loans, showed that Japan sided with France and Vietnam on Hanoi's bid to return to the IMF, but had deferred action until other issues could be resolved. Pressure from the United States negated any possibility for action until November 1992. Just like the bilateral aid issue, Tokyo took a stance between Hanoi and Washington, carefully keeping both channels open. Open U.S. support of IMF loans to Vietnam came eight months later, when President Clinton announced that his government was dropping its objection to IMF lending to Vietnam.

===Japan acting through the United Nations===

Japan also used the United Nations to nurture ties in Indochina. Such action provided Tokyo with anonymity that protected its delicate relationship with the United States and China. In 1990, Japan resumed cultural aid to Vietnam via the trust fund of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), starting with an estimated $100,000 donation for the restoration of the royal palace in Hue in central Vietnam. Japan fully supported a so-called United Nations plan to resolve the Cambodian conflict, sponsored by United States Congressman Stephen J. Solarz and Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. The plan essentially called for the United Nations to step in and run key government ministries in Cambodia during a &quot;transition&quot; period leading to democratic elections that involved all the Cambodian factions. Supporters of the plan looked to Tokyo for financial support of the estimated $20 billion it would cost to run the ministries under UNESCO command. While Tokyo did not initially confirm its financial commitment to the full amount, Japan assumed much of the costs in Cambodia.

===Pressure from the United States===

The influence of the United States in this final stage before resumption of economic assistance is quite strong. As stated above, Tokyo waited until 1992 to begin commodity loans and to underwrite Vietnam's debts to the IMF. Though Japan had been hinting at proceeding with aid for Indochina since 1989, its stated conditions of a comprehensive solution in Cambodia were always made in conjunction with U.S. demands. The signals sent to Hanoi were clear: Japan wanted to restore aid, but older brother America was applying too much pressure to allow it. Washington, after a long period of disengagement begun in the Carter administration, now searched for a positive role in Indochina. Unfortunately, the POW/MIA issue, and perhaps a collective bitterness left from the war, prevented U.S. leadership and hindered Japan's efforts in the region.

When Vietnam began to unilaterally withdraw its troops in 1989, Washington was faced with a quandary: how to encourage the withdrawal without leaving Cambodia in anarchy. Both the United States and Japan began to actively nudge Hanoi into accepting an internationally supervised withdrawal. When Vietnam withdrew without supervision, Washington had no choice but to withhold support on French and Japanese intentions to resume aid. Japan, mindful of the long-term goals of development and stability in Indochina, agreed with the U.S. and insisted on Vietnam's participation in a comprehensive political solution in Cambodia before Tokyo would resume aid.

After fifteen years of diplomatic disengagement from Indochina, the United States moved to reinvolve itself in finding positive steps toward resolving the POW/MIA issue and the Cambodian quagmire. Secretary of State James A. Baker signaled this new approach in Paris on 18 July after a meeting there with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Schevardnadze. Baker announced that the United States would no longer support the occupation of Cambodia's U.N. seat by a coalition that included the Khmer Rouge. This signaled Phnom Penh and Hanoi that America was moving more toward the center. In September 1990, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach met with Baker in Washington, the first of such a level in seventeen years. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon announced in December 1990 that the United States would soon be prepared to &quot;formally begin the process of U.S.- Vietnam normalizations.&quot; Pressure was mounting from Congress in the form of bipartisan efforts to push the administration toward direct dealings with Hanoi.

For Japan, the warming climate between Washington and Hanoi could only help. Tokyo strengthened its position with Hanoi by openly declaring the reasons it could not extend aid: Washington's hard-line position. Because of the trade embargo on U.S. corporations, and the implied threat of extending sanctions to any Japanese corporation found trading with Vietnam [see chapter 3, The United States v. Honda Motor Co.] under the Trading with the Enemy Act, Japanese officials laid the blame for slow rates of Japanese investment in Vietnam squarely at the foot of the U.S. Capitol. But members of Congress were beginning to see the diplomatic leverage to be gained via Hanoi's economic straits. In a hearing before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, a regional expert spelled out the possibilities for resolving U.S.-Vietnam difficulties:

::''If the United States wishes to assert claims, it has lots of authority to do so.  The Vietnamese want access to our markets, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank. . . . The Vietnamese need billions of dollars worth of help and expertise.  Our negotiators will have plenty of room to negotiate at the table if they want this.''

Japan had realized the power of the economic leverage, or &quot;aid card,&quot; in Hanoi long before. Washington's shift from security to economic priorities in its dealings with Vietnam only strengthened Tokyo's point position in Indochina.

However, a seemingly unrelated event affected Japan's progress in Indochina. The Gulf War and its subsequent diplomatic fallout painted Japan's foreign policy as &quot;checkbook diplomacy&quot; when Tokyo shelled out massive amounts toward the allied effort but refused to commit troops. Officials in Tokyo noted the need to refrain from allowing Japanese corporations to snap up the huge reconstruction contracts in Kuwait, but rather to let them go to American firms. However, the same tacit exclusion from the Middle East made Vietnam a more attractive target for reconstruction and infrastructure contracts. Son Sann, the Cambodian resistance leader, urged Japan and the West to refocus on Cambodia after having been distracted by the Gulf War:

::''Japan has agreed to help us. . . .  Now that the [Gulf] war is over, Japan must seize the opportunity to work towards a solution.

Progress came at Washington's pace, and the scale of infrastructure projects in Cambodia and Vietnam required government backing from Tokyo, which was following Washington.

Japan began to fulfill the role of mediator between the United States and Vietnam, a role it had offered to play since the end of the war in 1975. Vice President Quayle met with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama in May 1991 to address the situation in Indochina. Quayle reiterated the American position that Washington would move toward normalizing ties with Hanoi only after the settlement of the Cambodian problem. Nakayama reassured the vice president that Japan would continue to withhold financial aid until a settlement was reached, and offered his services in urging Hanoi to cooperate with the peace process. Japan's position between Washington and Hanoi is evident from Quale's discussing bilateral relations between the United States and Vietnam with Japan and from Nakayama's offer to speak with Hanoi on behalf of the Western powers. In November of the same year, Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe told visiting Secretary of State James Baker that Japan would ask Vietnam to respond to U.S. inquiries on the POW/MIA issue. Baker, in turn, asked for Japan to contribute financially to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). Watanabe promised not only financial and material aid for UNTAC but said that Japan would dispatch personnel to serve in UNTAC, the offer of personnel a lesson undoubtedly learned from the Gulf War.

The American diplomatic efforts toward Vietnam by Vice President Quayle and Secretary Baker used Japan's strong position as aid donor and regional leader in Southeast Asia. While Washington could only pressure Tokyo to withhold economic assistance until Cambodia reached a comprehensive peace, Washington also tried to upgrade its own standing in Hanoi by speaking through Japan. Baker's calls for Japan to continue withholding aid were wearing thin, and the United States was clearly playing catch-up to Japan's position in Vietnam. In his response to Baker's requests, Watanabe would only stress Japan's intention of asking Vietnam to cooperate, a noncommittal answer that may have signalled that Japan was going to resume aid ahead of the United States. Japan, along with France and the EC, were starting to move ahead of the United States in restoring aid to a number of regimes (South Africa, Poland), a clear indication of the erosion of American primacy in determining allied foreign policy. By January 1992, Tokyo announced it would move to lift economic sanctions against Vietnam, though in consultation with the United States. While the U.S. did not oppose such moves, American officials said they preferred Japan to extend its aid gradually.

Although Tokyo was preparing to restore economic assistance to Vietnam, the U.S. Congress still held some sway with Japanese corporations. Indeed, private firms were never prohibited from doing business with Vietnam by the Japanese government. Only the implied threat from the U.S. Congress served to limit trade between Japan and Vietnam throughout the Cambodian occupation. Song Joon, chairman of the Tokyo-based Overseas Economic Research Institute (OERI), explained:

::''Japan's leading companies, which depend heavily on the U.S. market, are likely to refrain from launching full-fledged business transactions with Vietnam until Washington lifts its sanctions.  At the same time, many companies are quietly engaged in feasibility studies for future sales and production in Vietnam.''          

Mr. Song made this statement as late as February 1992, indicating Washington's continued influence despite Tokyo's initiatives.

In March 1992, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon stopped in Tokyo on his way back from talks in Hanoi. He met with Japanese Parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa to update Japan on U.S. efforts in Vietnam. Hanoi had come far on the MIA issue, allowing unprecedented access to documents and government archives. Earlier, Watanabe had sent a letter to his Vietnamese counterparts, stressing the need for cooperation between Hanoi and Washington and adding that &quot;Japan would not extend massive aid to Vietnam if it jeopardized Tokyo's relationship with Washington.&quot; This letter verifies Japan's prioritizing its ties with the United States above any dealings with Vietnam. Kakizawa furthered Japan's role of mediator because of its friendly relations with both the U.S. and Vietnam when he declared his hopes of playing the role of &quot;an honest broker&quot; between the two. Kakizawa carried another letter from Watanabe, addressed to Vietnam's Premier Vo Van Kiet and his cabinet, which urged them to implement their previous pledges if they wished to receive Japanese aid. However, Japanese officials also hinted that Japan could go ahead with aid if Vietnam seemed to be cooperating to the best of its ability and if Washington hesitated for purely domestic American reasons.

In the end, Japan waited until November 1992 to restore economic assistance to Vietnam. Although Tokyo openly declared its intentions to do so as early as January 1992, and although at the time, the U.S. gave its tacit approval, officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs considered the U.S-Japan relationship too important to jeopardize for the sake gaining of a few months. Some reports, such as those in the Far Eastern Economic Review and the Japan Economic Journal, saw the changing of the guard in the U.S. presidential election as the final clearance to announce the aid, as the announcement came only one week after the election of President Clinton. A September 1992 report in the Japan Times quoted an anonymous Ministry source:

::''Japan wanted to resume official yen loans to Vietnam much earlier, but has delayed doing so out of foreign-policy consideration to the United States.  Japanese yen loans to Vietnam will not be provided until after the U.S. presidential election in early November.''

Just before the 1992 election, President Bush received the positive results of a presidential mission to Hanoi, led by retired General John Vessey, who returned to Washington with Hanoi's pledge to grant greater access to U.S. investigators. On 23 October 1992, President Bush declared, &quot;[T]oday, finally, I am convinced we can begin writing the last chapter of the Vietnam War.&quot;

With that statement, the president changed U.S. policy toward Vietnam from a punitive to a supportive role and cleared the way for Japan to resume its economic assistance.

===France===
France, the former colonial power in Indochina, had ceased any claims to governmental rights in Vietnam when it lost to Ho Chih Minh's forces at Dien Ben Phu in 1954. By the late 1980s, France searched for reconciliation through aid and support for Hanoi in international forums such as the United Nations and the IMF. France was the first major Western country to restore aid to Vietnam following the troop withdrawal in September 1989. However, French officials admitted their weak standing in the region:

 France doesn't have a big influence in Southeast Asia. 
 Through relations with Vietnam and Indochina, France intends
 gradually to expand its relations with other countries in the
 Southeast Asia.

In 1990, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama received French Prime Minister Michel Rocard in Tokyo and agreed to start discussing economic aid to the Indochese countries of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Nakayama looked to France for guidance before his trip to Laos, and Rocard's reply reflected France's sense of duty:

 [France] has a historical responsibility with regard to the
 future of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

Indeed, by 1991 French investment in Vietnam topped the list at $125.6 million dollars, while Japan still lagged behind Canada, Britain, and Belgium.

As stated earlier, France led the team of supporters within the IMF to reinstate Vietnam's ability to draw loans. French aid to Vietnam nearly doubled every year after 1989 and reached Ffr 250 million ($47 million) by 1992, placing it third behind Japan and Sweden. Whenever French officials paid visits to Tokyo, Japanese officials expressed their desire to aid Vietnam in conjunction with French plans for Indochina. Just as with the United States and Vietnam, Tokyo sought the middle territory between the United States and France-- Japan looked forward to development schemes for the region but attended to Washington's anxiety over rewarding Hanoi prematurely. Japan continued to side with the United States in refusing Hanoi access to IMF funding, though it listened intently to French designs. In the end, Japan moved in concert with France to clear Vietnam's arrears to the IMF in November 1992, soon after the announcement of bilateral aid.

===China===
China upset world opinion when Beijing cracked down on protesters in Tienanmen Square on 4 June 1989. Japan acted with most Western governments to stop aid following the incident. However, a year later, Michio Watanabe, now a senior official of the Liberal Democratic Party, visited China and promised that aid would return soon. For China, the short term as a pariah state might have drawn Beijing closer to Hanoi (one of the few remaining socialist states), as evidenced by a remark of Chinese Vice Premier Wu Xueqian:

 China wants to improve its contacts with Vietnam to the
 point where we are both comrades and brothers.

By the summer of 1990, China had agreed to greatly reduce its support of the Khmer Rouge. As the ongoing Cambodian peace talks gained a higher profile in the international community, Beijing became aware of the potential economic damage that would be incurred if China appeared to be slowing the process of peace in Indochina-- a lesson reinforced by the Tienanmen incident. Thus, China became much more cooperative on the Cambodian issue. This cooperation made room for Vietnamese demands about diminishing the role of the Khmer Rouge, and therefore led both sides toward the middle in a comprehensive solution and toward the eventual institution of a ruling commission led by Norodom Sihanouk in Cambodia.

===The Association of Southeast Asian Nations===
Beginning in 1987, the ASEAN countries, which had been so vocal in their opposition to Hanoi's actions earlier, began to split over how to resolve the Cambodian question. Cambodia's neighbor Thailand favored reconciliation with Vietnam once the troop pullout was complete, while Singapore still favored holding out until Vietnam cooperated fully in a comprehensive peace-- anything short of full cooperation would be rewarding a loose-cannon regime. Either way, ASEAN began to shift from security oriented pressuring tactics to economic enticements, a shift boosted by Tokyo's pledges to aid the entire region if a settlement could be reached.

Thailand's Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan signalled to Tokyo in 1990 that Japan should restore aid to Vietnam now that the September 1989 troop pullout had occurred. Previously, Thailand had followed the United States in not accepting the veracity of the claimed pullout, but now Chatichai turned toward acceptance. That same year, Singapore noted Vietnam's slow political reforms despite its economic progress as evidence that Hanoi should not be rewarded too early. Furthermore, Singapore Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng lambasted the Vietnamese-backed Hun Seng regime in Cambodia for being &quot;unwilling to compromise.&quot;

Japan responded to these divided calls from ASEAN with further promises of increased cooperation and aid. Tokyo realized that the simple bilateral aid relationship would no longer curry enough favor for the region. Rather than a scheme of Japan (giver) and ASEAN (receiver) for aid and assistance, Tokyo began to shift toward a triangular model: Japan (initiator) to ASEAN (conduit) to Indochina (receiver). Such a scheme would double the mileage of Japan's aid, benefiting not only the receiving countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos), but also the industries supplying infrastructure materials in the conduit countries (Malaysia, Indonesia). Foreign Ministry officials explained these plans prior to Prime Minister Kaifu's tour of the Southeast Asia region, in which Kaifu would discuss this &quot;more mature&quot; relationship with the ASEAN countries.

Japan hoped to increase its diplomatic pull in the region with Kaifu's tour. As Beijing began to warm up to Southeast Asia and settle differences with Hanoi, Tokyo sought to counterbalance the Chinese influence in Indonesia and Singapore, two countries that were normalizing relations with China at the time. In addition, Tokyo sought to keep its central position among the regional powers. After Tokyo hosted a conference to solve the Cambodian solution that made little progress, officials proposed that the next conference be held under an &quot;international conference&quot; banner in an ASEAN context in order to work out &quot;what should be our respective policies for economic cooperation with Vietnam.&quot;

The ASEAN's hard line against Hanoi had faded significantly by 1992. Thailand, eager to restore relations with its Indochinese neighbors, moved ahead of the other countries and sent Prime Minister Anand to Vietnam in February 1992, the first Thai head of government to visit that country since 1976. Anand also pledged to give Vietnam long-term credits worth about $5.8 million to buy Thai goods and services. Anand's announcement came weeks following Japan's initial signals that it would resume aid within the year. Clearly, for Thailand, the economic possibilities had gained priority over the security issues that gripped ASEAN back in 1978, when Vietnam was seen as a threat to the rest of Indochina.

===Indochina===
By 1989, the factions fighting for control of Cambodia has settled into three basic camps: (1) the Hun Seng regime backed by Vietnamese troops, installed shortly after the invasion in 1978, (2) the Cambodian &quot;Nationalists,&quot; a combination of the faction headed by Prince Sihanouk and the army of guerilla leader Son Sann, and (3) the Khmer Rouge, or Pol Pot regime that was ousted from power by the Vietnamese in 1978. Vietnam backed the Hun Seng regime, China backed the Khmer Rouge, and the United Nations, Japan, and the United States favored Sihanouk's party, which seemed the to play centrist role.

Tokyo supported what came to be known as the &quot;UN plan&quot;: power would be given to UNTAC (UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia) to run the ministries while political power would rest in the Supreme National Council (SNC). The debate now shifted to who would control the SNC. The Vietnamese-backed Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen had vied for Tokyo's favor following the Paris talks in 1989:

 The position of the Japanese government seems very
 positive and very much in line with my government.

In retrospect, the statement appears to be a propaganda ploy to paint Hun Sen's regime as centrist and cooperative. Japan continued to back Sihanouk's faction. Japanese Foreign Minister Nakayama voiced this opinion to the Vietnamese government when Foreign Minister Thach visited Tokyo in 1990. Thach's visit coincided with a decision by the UN Security Council to welcome Sihanouk as the head of the SNC if he were chosen by the Cambodian people. Tokyo obviously sided with the decision because it had backed Sihanouk's faction from the start. However, Tokyo remained hospitable to Thach and Vietnam while continuing to back the alliance against the Heng Samrin (Vietnamese-backed) faction.

Son Sann, who also enjoyed Tokyo's favor, took special note to warn Japan and the West about rewarding Vietnam and Hun Sen too soon. As late as March 1991, Son Sann called on Japan to withhold aid and economic assistance for at least another eighteen months in order to force acceptance of the UN peace plan:

 I ask all friendly people to maintain the embargo for 18

          months more.  Vietnam has economic, political and social

          difficulties and will be compelled to accept the UN plan.

          

Son Sann made references to private companies who had increased trade with Vietnam and thus diminished the incentive to negotiate, an obvious reference to Thailand's renewed efforts as well as to the Japanese trading houses.

When Thach visited Tokyo again in 1991, Nakayama pushed once again for cooperation. In addition, Nakayama tacked on the condition that any comprehensive plan include participation of the Khmer Rouge, a point the Vietnamese were adamantly against. This condition echoed the opinions of Sihanouk, ASEAN, and obviously China. Although the United States opposed participation by the Khmer Rouge because of their atrocious human rights record, Washington recognized the need for a solution:

 Secretary Baker has stated clearly that, from an American

          perspective, we want no role for the Khmer Rouge in a future

          Cambodian Government.  However, the judgement of Prince

          Sihanouk, China and the ASEAN countries-- as expressed in the

          communique of their annual ministerial meeting this past July--

          has been that the chances for peace are better if the Khmer

          Rouge is included in a four-party interim coalition.

          

Thach insisted that any inclusion of the Khmer Rouge must also include a reference to their abominable history of slaughter. This would run counter to the UN plan, which included no references to the Khmer Rouge's history. In contrast to Thach's favored SNC control, in which the Hun Seng regime held significant power, Nakayama favored UNTAC control until elections could be held:

 I believe that this peace proposal is the most realistic
          approach for ending the Cambodian conflict.  As the Pol Pot
          faction refuses to sit down with the other factions to negotiate a
          peace plan, it is highly doubtful that the SNC can immediately
          function as a forum for promoting constructive talks among the
          four feuding parties.

Nakayama did, however, offer Thach some relief. The Japanese Foreign Minister told Thach he would &quot;urge&quot; Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to cooperate in ending the conflict when Qichen visited Tokyo at the end of the month. Here again, Nakayama attempted to place Japan in the middle between two extremes. While Tokyo backed the Sihanouk faction and not the Vietnamese or Chinese factions, Nakayama offered to relay Thach's concerns to China, a move more on behalf of Japan-Vietnam relations and Sino- Japanese relations more than for the sake of the Khmer Rouge or Hun Seng.

===The Soviet Union===

In accounting in international factors that affected Japan's policy toward Vietnam, we have seen the shift move from cold war puppeteering to economic competition. The USSR was noticeably absent because the Soviet Union had fallen into such economic straits that it could no longer provide aid and therefore could have little influence in Southeast Asia. Soviet influence, if any, took the form of broader strokes at the end of the Cold War and Gorbachev's dismantling of Brezhnev's expansionist policies. After 1989, the Soviets had begun a dialogue with China and were in full retreat from Afghanistan and Cam Ranh Bay. From the viewpoint of the United States and the West, China's backing of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia was the focus of attention, far outweighing any remaining strings from Moscow to Hanoi to Phnom Penh.

Overall, the United States carried the greatest third-party effect on the Japan-Vietnam relationship. Washington adamantly refused to grant any leeway to Hanoi on readmittance to the IMF or to endorse aid from France and Japan. The United States clearly insisted that Japan's Foreign Ministry withhold economic assistance well into 1992. The ASEAN countries became divided over the conditions to extend aid to Indochina, and the loss of solidarity cost the group the lead position in determining policy toward Vietnam. China, eager to accelerate its economic programs and relations with the West, came to terms with the Soviet Union and Vietnam, a move crucial in the path to a solution in Cambodia.

===Analysis of international factors===
Clearly, the most influential external factor in Japan's policy toward Vietnam was the pressure from the United States to hold off a resumption of economic assistance until 1992. International bodies such as the IMF and World Bank had begun to hint about restoring Hanoi's eligibility for loan guarantees, but the vetoes from Washington and Tokyo and the comments by IMF officials about Washington's pressure on Tokyo give clear evidence of Japan's alignment with the United States. While France pushed for liberalization, the U.S. preached caution and demanded a comprehensive solution in Cambodia as well as progress on the POW/MIA issue. Japan may have felt some competitive pressure from France for control of Indochina's markets, but relations with the United States took precedence. Furthermore, any fears of losing regional leadership in Southeast Asia to France were allayed when ASEAN representatives maintained a hard-line stance against Hanoi-- similar to the stance taken by the United States and Japan.

The shift in priorities toward economic development continued to isolate the Soviet Union and China in terms of projectable power. Both countries had overwhelming domestic concerns, problems powerful enough to dismantle the regime in the Soviet Union and almost cause a civil war in China. Subsequently, the Soviet Union became a non entity in Southeast Asia, and China's position at the bargaining table was seriously compromised. Thus, Tokyo's foreign policy took its cues from the United States and ASEAN instead of France, and Japan practically ignored the Soviet Union and held the upper hand in Sino-Japanese relations.

==Domestic factors==

As mentioned earlier in this work, the emphasis in policy toward Vietnam had long since shifted from security issues to economic development. Subsequently, action between Japan and Vietnam came to center around private sector trading houses and oil development corporations rather than the political debates over ideology that had dominated the relationship when the suspension first began. The Japan Communist Party stood greatly diminished by the end of the Cold War, and the Liberal Democratic Party's hard-line stance against communist nations had softened. Bureaucratically, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) maintained its lead position in determining Tokyo's dealings with Hanoi. The Finance Ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) sent missions to Vietnam when the lifting of aid sanctions approached, but these missions came under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

===Ministry of Foreign Affairs===
Despite the optimism shared by France and Thailand following Vietnam's withdrawal in 1989, officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were quick to spell out their conditions for Hanoi:

 Until and unless what we term as a comprehensive solution
 to the Kampuchean problem is achieved, we are not in a position
 to start extending economic aid either to Kampuchea or to
 Vietnam.  It is true that Vietnamese forces are pulling out of
 Kampuchea.  That is something we should really watch.

Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe went on to chide Hanoi for withdrawing unilaterally rather than under UN supervision. The Foreign Ministry continued to hold a hard-line stance demanding a comprehensive solution in Indochina. This stance was consistent with the Foreign Ministry's goals: maintain the U.S.-Japan relationship, expand relations with ASEAN (thus the need for a long-lasting peace) and keep smooth the touchy Sino-Japanese relationship in the wake of Tienanmen Square.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs took a significant step toward improving relations with Vietnam in 1990 when it resumed grants for cultural cooperation and exchanges. Simultaneously, the Ministry planned its next step: an increase in humanitarian grants and assistance to hospitals as a method of expanding aid to Vietnam without violating the sanctions against official economic assistance. Japanese ambassadors to East Asian countries urged flexibility in restoring aid to Vietnam, bringing the carrot closer for Hanoi and increasing Japan's diplomatic influence in Indochina.

By February 1991, top officials within the MoFA openly recommended moving ahead with increased humanitarian grants. In a panel discussion in the Gaiko Forum, a monthly diplomacy magazine published under the auspices of the Foreign Ministry, Sakuro Tanino, director general of the ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau, commented that Japan should increase aid for &quot;humanitarian&quot; reasons, because of Vietnam's economic straits.

Japan's Foreign Ministry proposed a plan to disarm the four warring Cambodian factions that drew criticism from both Washington and Hanoi. Washington thought the plan constituted too much interference from the outside (a formula for disaster in the U.S. collective memory) while Hanoi rejected the plan because it could give military power to the Khmer Rouge.

The primacy of the Foreign Ministry in determining overall policy toward Vietnam continued through 1992. Tokyo announced in January 1992 that it would resume aid within the year and sent an official aid mission to Vietnam. Although bureaucrats from the Finance Ministry, MITI, and secondary bureaus connected with various branches all attended, the mission was organized and directed by the Foreign Ministry. The Foreign Ministry, and not the Finance Ministry, announced in March 1992 that Japan would perhaps syndicate a bridge loan to clear Vietnam's arrears before economic assistance would resume.

===Ministry of Finance===
The Ministry of Finance had followed the rules spelled out by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ever since official aid was suspended in 1979. While Official Development Aid (ODA) was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, the permission to transfer the funds that had been marked for Hanoi had to come from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In January 1992, as the MoFA began to signal that it would soon allow the resumption of economic assistance, the Ministry of Finance participated in official missions to Vietnam for preliminary research to find worthy aid projects. However, even these missions were headed by bureaucrats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Apart from suspending official economic assistance to Vietnam, Tokyo limited trade by suspending import-export insurance for Japanese firms trading with Vietnam. This insurance, like ODA, also came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. As mentioned earlier, the Finance Ministry followed the lead of the Foreign Affairs Ministry in dealing with Hanoi over the issue of restoring ODA. However, restoration of insurance came long after political differences with Hanoi were solved. Interestingly, the Ministry of Finance's conservatism prevented restoration of the short-term trade and investment insurance system for Japanese private companies doing business with Vietnam until well into 1993. The Finance Ministry moved to restore the insurance only after Vietnam had proved its sincerity by repaying the nearly ・0 billion owed to private Japanese corporations by using the ・5.5 billion in commodity loans extended to Hanoi in November of 1992.

===The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)===

Like the Ministry of Finance, MITI waited until 1992 to commit to any serious steps toward restoring ties with Hanoi. However, MITI acted with foresight and long-term planning in its dealings with Vietnam. Beginning in 1991, the agency started subsidizing feasibility studies on infrastructure projects, studies conducted by consulting firms within Japan. This action did not violate the official suspension of aid because the funds were channeled domestically. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), an arm of MITI, received fifty trainees from Vietnam throughout 1991. This number was up from sixteen trainees in the previous year.

The Ministry searched for creative ways to forge ties with Vietnam despite the official ban. MITI officials discussed ways to upgrade existing infrastructure (roads, bridges) without having to incur huge foreign aid levels for new construction. The Institute of Energy Economics (IEE), another arm of MITI, sent a study group to Vietnam in April 1992 that included representatives of private firms who paid their own expenses. The group thus avoided appearing official. The reason for these preliminary trips, as stated by Toru Kimura of the IEE, was typical of MITI's philosophy and zest for planning ahead:

 Hanoi is frustrated that Japan keeps researching and
 studying Vietnam's problems, but does nothing.  But before it
 spends any money, Tokyo must make a priority list of potential
 projects.

The Ministry seemed eager to open trade channels with Vietnam as much as possible the closer the resumption of aid loomed. In September 1992, just two months prior to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announcement, MITI petitioned for a relaxation of regulations under the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control (COCOM) regulations imposed on Vietnam as a socialist state. COCOM limits on trade were harming industrialization within Vietnam, according to Japanese sources, because the regulations applied to construction machinery and communications equipment. These two commodities had been leading exports for Japanese firms throughout Southeast Asia. Earlier, Japan had called for easing COCOM restrictions against all Asian nations except North Korea. To reassure the Paris-based organization of Western countries, officials from MITI and the Foreign Affairs Ministry promised to monitor export controls to Vietnam.

At the bureaucratic level, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintained its lead position in determining policy toward Vietnam up through November 1992, when resumption of aid was finally announced. Although the Finance Ministry and MITI began to strengthen ties in the spring of 1992, they took no official action without the participation and oversight of the Foreign Affairs Ministry. Attitudinally, MITI seemed eager to resume ties with Vietnam, especially in light of the huge trade deficits that had been accumulating since 1986 (see Chart 4.1). Conversely, the Ministry of Finance seemed reluctant to resume insurance and other trade assistance programs with Hanoi, given the country's abominable financial state.

===The private sector===
The sea change from security issues to economic development throughout Southeast Asia meant an increasing role for the private sector in Japan-Vietnam relations. Corporations were moving ahead of the government by establishing branch offices and trade representatives in Hanoi and Ho Chih Minh City. By 1990, following the troop pullout, Japan's financial sector could sense the eventual return of official aid relations, and it began to openly call for the resumption of full official economic ties. An editorial in the Japan Economic Journal summarizes the call:

 The U.S. understandably may require more time to
 liquidate legacies of the war to enter full relations.  But Japan,
 free from such restrictions, is now definitely in a position to
 facilitate the new wave in situations in the Indochina Peninsula. 
 This means that Japan should drop its rigid stance that it will
 withhold economic assistance for Vietnam until a comprehensive
 peace settlement in Cambodia is achieved.  It's time for Japan to
 consider an early resumption of aid.

          

The editoral articulated two important positions: (1) Japan should move ahead of the United States, and (2) Japan should not hold out for the comprehensive peace settlement-- the last remaining condition from Tokyo. Clearly, the private sector wanted to move into Vietnam as soon as possible, regardless of the overarching concerns of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Mitsubishi Corporation confirmed these intentions when it opened an office in Vietnam in January 1991, becoming the largest Japanese trading company to establish a base in Vietnam. Sumitomo Corporation and Kanematsu Corporation, two other trade house giants, had already received Hanoi's permission, while Marubeni Corporation and Nichimen Corporation had begun the approval process. By March 1991 (and with very little announcement in light of Washington's position), the nine largest trading houses had established offices in Hanoi. These trading firms handled the lack of export-import insurance and other official monetary devices by dealing in trade credits-- a sort of elaborate bartering system similar to the Pepsi/Vodka trades that occurred with the Soviet Union. That same summer, the national carrier Japan Airlines announced it would soon open a route to Vietnam.

However, Japan's banks did not share this optimism. Similar to the Ministry of Finance, Japanese banks could not overlook Vietnam's debt problem as well as its atrocious repayment record. In 1990, Hanoi tried negotiating with the Bank of Tokyo to reschedule its debt of roughly $150 million, but with little progress. Until official economic assistance and ADB and World Bank funds could enter the pipeline to Vietnam, Japanese banks remained wary of Hanoi. Eventually, a bridge loan to clear Hanoi's arrears came from a syndicate of these same banks, but only after the green light had been given in November 1992 for commodity loans and economic assistance.

By August 1991, the quasi-official organization Keidanren (Japan Federation of Economic Organizations), which had deep ties within the bureaucracy and represented over five hundred of the top Japanese firms, launched an Indochina Relations Committee and announced that a mission of senior Japanese executives would go to Vietnam. Along with the above-mentioned trading firms, representatives from Toyota Motor Corporation, Showa Shell Sekiyu KK, Toshiba Corporation, Honda Motor Company and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation would go on the mission. Other organizations within the private sector attempted to forward relations between Japan and Vietnam. The Japan-Vietnam Trade Association, consisting of members from the major trading houses gathered to negotiate collectively with Hanoi, signed an economic cooperation agreement with the Vietnam State Committee for Cooperation and Investment in an effort to promote investment by small- and medium-sized Japanese companies. Summarily, the group sponsored trips to Vietnam in order to research infrastructure projects as well as sponsor technical tours of Japanese factories by Vietnamese officials.

While the private sector had moved ahead of the government in increasing relations with Vietnam, the eventual resumption of official aid still remained the key to achieving higher levels of investment and trade, according to one trading company representative in Hanoi:

 The aid delegation is very significant.  The major part of
 our business [in Vietnam] will be ODA-related. We're preparing
 for many projects utilizing soft loans as well as grants.

          

The Keidanren dispatched its mission to Vietnam in October 1991. Upon good recommendations from the returning delegates, the organization formed its first Japan-Vietnam Economic Relations Committee in November, nominating Nissho Iwai President Akira Nishio as committee chairman. Nissho Iwai had been the lead trading house since the mid-1980s, with a majority of the oil projects under its control.

Immediately following the announcement of the ・5.5 billion in November 1992, the second wave of firms announced they would open branch offices in Vietnam. These included construction firms such as Kajima, Obayashi, and Hazama, along with concrete and heavy machinery companies like Komatsu and Tomen. The logic here is obvious: these firms depended on contracts for infrastructure projects to rebuild roads, bridges, and ports, projects that were dependent on the huge amounts of ODA and economic assistance for funding.

Japan's trade with Vietnam had been growing steadily since 1985, and it accelerated in 1989, when the troop pullout signalled that peace would soon come to the peninsula (see Charts 4.1 and 4.2). Exports to Vietnam were dominated by the basic manufactures trade sector, which included parts for assembly by Vietnamese labor as well as finished consumer goods. By 1992, crude oil came to be the major import from Vietnam in terms of total dollars, with trade of mineral fuels topping $545 million. The classical colonial model was forming between Japan and Vietnam: raw materials traded for finished goods. However, the relationship was beneficial for cash-strapped Vietnam because Hanoi had enjoyed a net trade surplus with Japan since 1987 (see Chart 3.3).

The private sector moved well ahead of the bureaucrats in establishing ties with Vietnam. Although the U.S. Congressional backlash against Honda in 1987 had served as a warning to these firms, trading houses were able to quietly establish branch offices in the months prior to an official resumption of aid. The timing of these moves indicates the remaining influence of the threat of Washington's wrath, but legally, the companies could operate unfettered by Tokyo's regulations. Japan's official policy toward Vietnam covered only official economic assistance and ODA. The freedom to operate had been spelled out in 1987 when ASEAN complained of Nissho Iwai's oil development plans and Tokyo responded that it could only ask for the company's cooperation. When the Foreign Ministry began to signal the resumption of aid by early 1991, the private sector moved swiftly to establish a beachhead in Vietnam's virgin market of raw materials and consumers.

===Increasing domestic influences===

The shift toward economic development throughout the region and Tokyo's subsequent emphasis on economic developmental plans for peace certainly placed greater power in the Ministry of Finance, MITI, and the private sector's dealings with Vietnam. Trade with Vietnam had escalated steadily since 1985. By 1990, Vietnam had become a major supplier of seafood, oil, and lumber. Ironically, this very same success virtually subtracted MITI and the private sector as a serious pressure for reinstating economic assistance. In other words, trade had not been seriously hampered by the suspension of aid; therefore, MITI and the private sector went about business anyway, despite Tokyo's official policy. Major infrastructure projects for Vietnam's roads and harbors lay waiting, but funding for these projects couldn't come without the blessings of the Ministry of Finance. However, Vietnam's economy, regardless of the international political situation in Indochina, was deemed unfit for loans and insurance until after the IMF debt and other arrears were cleared. Therefore, the domestic pressures from the business-oriented bureaucracies were completely subject to the international situation and to strong-arming from Washington.

Overall, the differing goals of the bureaucracies provide the best explanation of their behavior: the Foreign Affairs Ministry's prime responsibilities are to keep good relations with the United States, ASEAN, China, and the rest of the world, in that order. Any premature movement toward normalizing aid relations with Hanoi would jeopardize those priorities. The Finance Ministry's prime concern is Japan's budget. Premature extension of export insurance or ODA would only result in bad loans and a loss of funds. The MoF acted only after Hanoi possessed the currency (・5.5 billion) to prop up any huge losses. Conversely, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry was eager to ratchet up Japanese exports to Vietnam in order to offset the trade deficits resulting from oil, timber, and seafood imports from Vietnam. While no official action could be taken, organizations such as JICA and IEE moved to ensure that Japan's influence in Hanoi would foster trade once aid sanctions were lifted.

==Conclusion==
This chapter assumed Tokyo wanted to move ahead with aid for Vietnam but could not because of Japan's relations with the United States. When Vietnam withdrew its troops in September 1989, it fulfilled Tokyo's biggest condition for resuming economic assistance, but aid was three more years in coming. Japan, in light of the chaotic situation in Cambodia and because of the &quot;checkbook diplomacy&quot; label derived from its behavior in the Gulf War, hesitated to make any bold gestures toward Vietnam. Japan wanted to move ahead with aid, as evidenced by the timetables and the amounts hinted at as early as January 1991.

Countries in the region had all moved to positions conductive for resuming aid to Vietnam. The ASEAN countries of Indonesia and Thailand had expressed leniency toward Vietnam in hopes of becoming conduits for the huge amounts of multilateral and Japanese bilateral aid that had been promised to Indochina. Beijing had started to bury the hatchet with its southern neighbors (except on the Spratly Islands issue), a move in keeping with the new diplomatic measures it took in order to fulfill the goal of filling the vacuum in East Asia left by the retreating Soviet Union.

When a peace plan was signed by the Cambodian factions in the fall of 1991, nothing stood in the way of resuming aid except Tokyo's deference to Washington. Japan's policy toward Vietnam gives strong indications of the factors guiding foreign policy in Tokyo. Despite the end of the Cold War, the United States still held a leadership role in the Southeast Asian region and in Japan. However, as the role of economic factors began to heavily outweigh security issues, Tokyo's position in the region and in Southeast Asia increased to the point where it could openly hint about moving ahead of the United States. In the end, concerns between Tokyo and Washington held the suspension of aid until November 1992, when Japan finally announced it would forward ・5.5 billion to Vietnam.

This thesis has charted Japan's relationship with Vietnam from the time of the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978 to the reinstatement of economic assistance in 1992. I have framed bilateral relations between Tokyo and Hanoi in the context of discussions about Japan's dealings with regional powers which affected that relationship. In addition, this thesis examined domestic political factors within Japan in the hopes of demonstrating the differences in the policies and goals of the various bureaucracies and political parties, and the private sector. Private sector ties between Japanese corporations and Vietnam were included to illustrate how business progressed despite the strained economic developmental relations between the two countries. Thus, private trade did not exert significant influence or pressure to reinstate economic aid. I hope that Japan's policies toward Vietnam have been sufficiently described to allow extrapolation of conclusions concerning the relative positions of Japan and Vietnam, the style of Japan's foreign policy, and Japan's position relative to Southeast Asia and the superpowers. I also hope that this description allows insight into bureaucratic politics and the business and government relationship within Tokyo.

This thesis reveals that: (1) Japan maintained a relatively close relationship to Vietnam when compared to ASEAN's, China's, and the United States' policies toward Vietnam; (2) Japan's position relative to Hanoi grew in strength, parallel with Vietnam's need for assistance; (3) the end of the Cold War magnified Tokyo's regional leadership position in filling the vacuum left by the end of the East-West confrontation as priorities among regional powers shifted from military security or political ideology to economic development; (4) Tokyo's diplomatic style dictated a search for the middle ground between two polar positions- - and was therefore somewhat reactionary; (5) Japan's Foreign Ministry continued to see the U.S.-Japan relationship as the top priority until 1992; and (6) the Foreign Ministry carried veto power over private-sector dealings with Vietnam but was not all-pervasive.

==Relatively close bilateral relations==
Despite the injury to Hanoi's position in the international community, an injury that stemmed from the Cambodia incursion, Tokyo maintained a relatively healthy relationship with Vietnam when compared to other East Asian powers' stances on Hanoi. Cultural exchanges and diplomatic functions between the two countries continued, as did commercial trading. Official censure for Vietnam's rogue behavior came in the form of suspending economic assistance, which Tokyo had considered as the lead element of its policy toward the developing fourth-world country prior to December 1978. While such action temporarily removed the strongest interaction between Tokyo and Hanoi, Japanese diplomats repeatedly reminded their Vietnamese counterparts that the suspension of aid did not connote an irreversible or fatal threat to bilateral relations nor a reduction of ties.

When Japan announced suspension of economic assistance because of Vietnam's behavior in Indochina, the reasons were carefully worded to present Tokyo's actions as a response to pressure from ASEAN, the security arrangements with the United States, and the fragile relations with China. In other words, Japan attempted to explain its suspension not in terms of punishment but in terms of having its hand forced by duties and obligations to other regional powers. While the Indochina problem continued through the 1980s, Japan's open- hand carrot approach earned Tokyo the superior position in bilateral relations: lower bureaucratic Japanese officials met in Hanoi on &quot;unofficial&quot; visits while Vietnamese officials visiting Tokyo never received audience with upper-level bureaucrats.

When a solution in Cambodia drew nearer with the troop withdrawal in September 1989, Tokyo began to use the advantages gained from keeping open relations with Vietnam. Concurrent with the troop withdrawal came the end of the Cold War and an increase in Japan's regional leadership role. As a stronger leader, Tokyo used the carrot of resuming economic assistance in order to demand Vietnam's active participation in a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia, whereas prior to 1989 the withdrawal of troops was the primary condition for resumption of aid-- merely abandoning Kampuchea would no longer suffice. Along with this pressure came renewed promises of huge amounts of developmental assistance. Japan began to treat Vietnam as part of the solution toward peace in Indochina and not as part of the problem. Tokyo could appear sincere in this policy because it had not taken the rhetorically polar stance against Hanoi (like ASEAN's condemnations or the U.S.'s full embargo).

From the time of the decision to stop assistance in 1979 through the stalemate years in the 1980s up to the restoration of aid in 1992, Japan maintained full diplomatic relations with Vietnam and took every opportunity to highlight out the working relationship that existed between the two countries. In fact, Japanese officials almost always framed their statements concerning Vietnam in terms of Tokyo's closeness with Hanoi relative to the closeness other regional powers (namely ASEAN and China).

Bilateral trade relations suffered some reduction when economic assistance was suspended in early 1979, but by 1985, trade levels in both directions began to grow significantly. Japanese exports of basic manufactures to Vietnam saw double-digit growth from 1985 onward, while imports of Vietnamese oil grew at a rate comparable to Vietnam's oil production capability. The troop withdrawal in 1989 foreshadowed a resumption of full economic assistance programs and general acceptance by the West, and so Japanese firms moved early and strongly to secure trade offices and off shore production facilities within Vietnam.

==Japan's increased regional role==
Tokyo's policies must be viewed in both the context of Japan's position in the region as well as the Japanese government's overall policies for Southeast Asia before we can draw any conclusions about the true nature and development of this relationship during the period 1978-1992. As stated in chapter 2, Cold-War alignments changed dramatically in the closing months of 1978, just prior to Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. The United States announced normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China, Japan concluded a Peace and Friendship Treaty with China, and the Vietnamese followed suit with a Treaty of Cooperation with the Soviet Union. Clearly, Tokyo had shifted away from the omni directional policies it had been refining since the mid-1960s. Japan now played more of a regional role, acting more in conjunction with China and ASEAN (following the Fukuda announcement in August 1977) than with Vietnam or the Soviets when facing the dilemmas in Indochina.

With time came greater economic strength for Japan, and thus greater power behind Tokyo's aid policies to East Asia and Southeast Asia. Subsequently, Japan's regional leadership grew, and Tokyo took the position of both advocate for Southeast Asia to the industrialized West and lead representative of the West's interests in Southeast Asia. This increased regional role served to magnify the promise of Japan's aid to Vietnam if a comprehensive peace could be reached, because Tokyo began to promise unprecedented levels of economic assistance to the entire Indochina Peninsula.

The Japan-Vietnam relationship provides evidence of Tokyo's diplomatic style: Japan's foreign policy seems to search for the middle ground between two polar countries that have polar-opposite positions. This style may have developed from the omni directional policies of the 1960s and 1970s, where Japan sought a mostly neutral position in the East- West conflict. I have described Japanese efforts to place Tokyo in between several adversarial relationships in the region: ASEAN and Vietnam, China and Vietnam, China and ASEAN, and the US and Vietnam. Though this middle ground style does not hold true for all cases (North Korea or the Soviet Union), it certainly helps explain Japan's approach to its relationship with Vietnam within the international context.

==Tokyo's search for the middle ground==
Tokyo's diplomatic style sought for a middle ground between two polar positions in several incidences, mostly those involving Vietnam and some other regional player. In January 1979, Japan explained its actions against Vietnam in terms of having to accommodate ASEAN's anxiety. Conversely, Foreign Minister Sonoda made it clear that Japan saw itself between ASEAN and Vietnam. Later, when Japanese industries began to move into Vietnam and ASEAN officials complained about economically rewarding Hanoi, Japanese officials repeated Japan's and ASEAN's mutual condemnation of Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia, but at the same time explained that Japanese corporations were free to trade with Vietnam-- an explanation again positioning Japan between ASEAN and Vietnam.

When China launched its punishment war against Vietnam in 1979, Japanese officials attempted to stay detached, calling for an end to hostilities on all sides. But when Vietnam came begging for Tokyo to act as a mediator, the same Japanese officials saw a chance to position Japan in the middle, between Beijing and Hanoi, a move that both facilitated Japan's relationship with Vietnam as well as showed ASEAN that Tokyo was not subject to Beijing's bully tactics. China seemed satisfied with Japan's call for an end to hostilities &quot;throughout Indochina&quot;-- a statement that essentially linked the Sino-Vietnam border war and Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia.

Later, as Vietnam withdrew its troops in 1989 and a solution to the Cambodian issue seemed imminent, Tokyo because the go-between for Hanoi and Washington over the POW/MIA issue. The leverage gained from this position allowed Japan to openly signal Vietnam about the reinstatement of economic assistance. Tokyo deferred to the U.S. position in Indochina through the American presidential election in 1992. However, the speed of Tokyo's announcement following the election gives evidence of a prearranged agreement between Japan and the United States, with the former agreeing to delay action until after the election because of U.S. domestic political concerns.

Taken together, Tokyo's reaction to regional positions illustrates a consistent pattern in which Japan sought to place itself between Vietnam and others. Japan could vie for such a position in security-oriented conflicts (the Sino-Vietnam war of 1979) because of its nonmilitary status. Complementarily, Tokyo could choose its ground between hegemons as priorities shifted to economic development (ASEAN versus Vietnam), given Japan's huge aid outlays and its promises for greater levels of assistance if both sides cooperated. In the case of the United States-Vietnam relationship, Japan gained leverage with both sides as a result of both its nonmilitary status and the power of promised aid. Since Japan did not participate directly in the U.S.-Vietnam War, it could act in good faith in the POW/MIA issue for both Hanoi and Washington. Also, because of Tokyo's promise for restoring economic assistance, Vietnam began to cooperate with Washington in 1991-1992 by granting new access to wartime records.

==Primacy of the U.S.-Japan relationship==
As the United States withdrew as a major factor in Southeast Asia in the late 1970s, Japan, China, Vietnam, and the USSR moved to fill the vacuum. Subsequently, Tokyo concluded the Peace and Friendship Treaty with Beijing within weeks of President Carter's announcement of U.S.-China ties. (The United States placed China in charge of containing Soviet expansionism.) Almost simultaneously, Hanoi announced a mutual cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union. Thus, the region was in danger of becoming polarized between Tokyo-Beijing and Hanoi-Moscow. To quell such fears, Japan sought a middle ground between China and Vietnam (see above) and continued to include the United States as a cooperating power, if not as a balancing force.

Consequently, Washington continued to dominate Japan's foreign policy toward Southeast Asia. When Honda Motor Corporation attempted to set up a manufacturing plant within Vietnam in 1978, the United States Senate passed resolutions condemning Japan's leniency toward Hanoi. Japan's Foreign Ministry immediately publicly censured Honda, and Honda withdrew its plans within days. The IMF felt American influence strongly when the organization considered reinstating Vietnam's eligibility for loans in 1990 and 1991. The United States vetoed plans to relieve Hanoi's debts and persuaded Tokyo to veto the proposed action as well. International Monetary Fund officials laid the blame squarely on the POW/MIA issue, and some within Japan felt regret at Tokyo's deference to Washington, but Japan could not ignore the importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship.

By early 1992, Vietnam had begun to work toward a compromise in the Cambodian situation. Having withdrawn its troops nearly two and a half years earlier, Hanoi aligned itself to the conditions set out by Tokyo for reinstating economic assistance. However, Washington continued to pressure Hanoi for greater access to POW records, and Tokyo's position in the middle now meant a responsibility to help solve the issue on both sides. Consequently, Tokyo officials were asked to speak on behalf of the Americans by the vice president and the State Department officials assigned to the POW/MIA issue; Tokyo also sent letters threatening to further suspend aid if no progress came from Hanoi.

The strongest evidence of Japan placing the relationship with the United States in prime position is the delay until the 1992 United State presidential election to restore assistance to Vietnam. Japan had hinted at loan amounts and timetables had been foreshadowed since January 1992, and officials had been making open remarks about restoring aid to Vietnam since that summer. However, out of deference to the United States and the U.S.-Japan relationship, Tokyo delayed its announcement until the week following the election. President Bush avoided the Vietnam issue during the last hectic weeks of th election because Tokyo remained low-key on its moves toward restoring economic assistance.

==Foreign Ministry influence over the bureaucracies and the private sector==
Throughout the period under study, the Foreign Ministry had primarily handled policy toward Vietnam. When Foreign Minister Trinh visited Tokyo in December 1978 and secured nearly $64 million in aid for Vietnam, the Ministry of Finance earmarked the funds for the next fiscal year. However, when Vietnamese troops crossed the border, the Foreign Ministry suspended the aid money-- a suspension that would last nearly fourteen years. Thus, the Foreign Ministry supplanted the Ministry of Finance's jurisdiction over ODA and economic assistance.

The Foreign Ministry's veto power extended to the private sector as well. When ASEAN officials complained about Japanese trading houses doing business with Hanoi, the Foreign Ministry explained Japan's suspension of official aid but did not enforce an economic embargo against Vietnam. However, the ministry simultaneously asked companies to be sympathetic to the international situation, a pattern repeated with the 1987 Honda Motor Corporation case raised by the United States Congress.

As Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia and Vietnam's exports of raw materials boosted trade relations, one would expect MITI and the private sector to begin driving the relationship between Tokyo and Hanoi. However, bureaucratic junkets to Hanoi continued to fall under Foreign Ministry control. Even as late as 1992, groups including MITI, the Ministry of Finance, and parliamentarians were led by the Foreign Ministry. Affairs with Vietnam were driven at the international level, which made the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the lead domestic player at the bureaucratic level. Domestically, trade with Vietnam grew at a level concurrent with Vietnam's production capacity but was not affected by the suspension of official aid. Therefore, the private sector and MITI were subtracted as major factors in changing Tokyo's policy toward Vietnam.

==Further research==
The goal of this thesis was to provide a description of Japan's policy toward Vietnam from 1978 to 1992. One purpose of this work is to follow up on Masaya Shiraishi's Japanese Relations with Vietnam 1951-1987, focusing more on the period of Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia. Shiraishi only devoted twenty or so pages to this period. Shiraishi's work left many questions unanswered about how Tokyo would eventually resolve the Cambodian issue with Vietnam, since the issue had yet to be settled as of 1987. Inada's chapter &quot;Japanese aid to Vietnam: Stick or Carrot,&quot; written in 1989, could only postulate about solutions to restoring Japan's economic assistance to Hanoi, as aid wasn't restored until 1992. Evaluations of the political changes brought about with the end of the Cold War, along with estimations of the evolving economies of Southeast Asia, must depend on new models that give greater weight to economic power. Japan's middle ground position, as evidenced by Tokyo's policies toward Vietnam from 1978 to 1992, carries new connotations for international relations when viewed in a post-Cold-War context.

Another purpose of this research has been to provide information about the Vietnam relationship as a case for extrapolation into a study of Japan's foreign policy style. The conclusions about Tokyo's search for a middle ground and its dependency on the United States led to the need for further research into Japan's dealings with other conflicting powers and into Tokyo's search for a stronger regional role while maintaining its close relationship with Washington. It is hoped that this work will provide material for other research into Japan's relationships with third-world countries in the region from the angle of the Tokyo- Washington cooperation and conflict in developing trade and security relationships.

One more possible avenue for further research is Japan's approach to the emerging communist bloc or former communist countries such as Mongolia, Eastern Europe, and Cambodia. What commonalities exist? Is Japan's policy driven mainly by economic potential or security concerns? This information about Japan's policy toward Vietnam could spawn such research as well.

Today, Japan enjoys robust trade and significant economic development cooperation with Vietnam. This relationship is both the result of Hanoi's reforms toward a market economy and Tokyo's careful courting of Vietnam throughout the pariah period from 1978 to 1992. Because of Japan's navigation between regional hegemons ranged against Vietnam, Japan stood in prime position to offer massive amounts of developmental assistance and therefore win huge infrastructure contracts for Japanese firms when Hanoi embarked on a vigorous modernization plan in the last several years. When the United States finally lifted its economic embargo in 1994, the release came largely because of domestic U.S. industry pressure, driven by concerns about losing ground in Vietnam to the fast-moving Japanese.

Japan's policy toward Vietnam continues to evolve. It is hoped that this thesis has expanded the knowledge base for further research on international relations within the East Asian region. Clearly, the Japan-Vietnam relationship carries ramifications for US-Japan relations, Sino-Japanese relations, and development within ASEAN and Indochina.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The '''Council Tax''' is the main form of local taxation in England, Scotland and Wales. It is paid by residents to the local authority. It was introduced in 1993 (by way of the Local Government Finance Act 1992) as a successor to the Community Charge or Poll Tax, introduced in 1989 in Scotland and in 1990 in England and Wales.

The base for the tax is residential property.  Each dwelling is allocated to one of eight bands coded by letters A through H (I in Wales) on the basis of its assumed capital value (as of 1 April 1991).  Newly constructed properties are also assigned a nominal 1991 value. Each local authority sets a tax rate expressed as the annual levy on a Band D property inhabited by two liable adults. This decision automatically sets the amounts levied on all types of households and dwellings. Single adults living alone are entitled to a 25% discount.

As of 2006, the average annual levy on a property is £1,056 (the average Band D tax is £1,268)&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4849152.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is the only tax which is set by local government, the Council Tax contributes only a small proportion (25%, on average) of local government revenue.  The majority comes from central government grants and from business rates which are collected centrally and redistributed to local authorities.

Northern Ireland still levies rates, the system of local taxation used in the rest of the United Kingdom before the implementation of the Poll Tax. The Government is considering using Northern Ireland for a pilot project to replace council tax with a property &quot;wealth tax&quot; based on an annual charge of 0.78% of the value of the property. Such property valuations would be updated every five years.

== Calculation of amount ==

Council Tax is divided into a number of components.  Depending upon where the dweller lives, there can be a separate charge made by the Greater London Authority, County Councils, Police Authorities, Fire Authorities, Transport Authorities, National Park Authority, Olympic Delivery Authority, District Councils, Scottish Water and Civil Parishes.  These all set their precepts independently.

Each of the levying authorities sets a precept (total amount) to be collected for their area.

This is then divided by the number of ''nominal Band D'' properties in the authority's area (county, district, national park, etc.) to reach the Band D amount.

(The ''nominal Band D'' property total  is calculated by adding together the number of properties in each band and multiplying by the band ratio. So 100 Band D properties will count as 100 ''nominal Band D'' properties, whereas 100 Band C properties will only count as 89 ''nominal Band D'' properties.)

Each collecting authority (district/borough council or unitary authority) then adds together the Band D amounts for their area (or subdivisions of their area in the case, for example, of civil parish council precepts) to reach a total Band D council tax bill.

To calculate the council tax for a particular property a ratio is then applied. A Band D property will pay the full amount, whereas a Band H property will pay twice that.

There may be further modifiers in certain circumstances, for example a discount for unoccupied property, a 25% discount for single occupants, or a total dispensation for diplomatic residences.

==Revaluation==

The government had planned to revalue all properties in England in 2005 (the first revaluations since 1991) but, in September 2005, it was announced that the revaluation in England would be postponed until 2009 or 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4262590.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Terms of Reference of the Lyons Inquiry were extended and the report date pushed out to December 2006. In Wales, tax bills based on the property revaluations done using 2003 prices were issued in 2005. Because of the surge in house prices over the late 1990s and early 2000s, more than a third of properties in Wales found themselves in a band higher than under the 1991 valuation. Some properties were moved up three or even four bands with consequent large increases in the amount of council tax demanded. Some properties were moved into new Band I at the top of the price range. Only 8% of properties were moved down in bands. However, a large shift of properties between bands will cause a shift in the allocation of the charge between bands, and the tax levied for each particular band will then drop, as the total amount collected will remain the same for each authority (see 'calculation of amount' above).

Between the wholesale revaluations, a major change to a property (such as an extension, or some major blight causing loss of value) can trigger a revaluation to a new estimate of the value the property would have reached if sold in 1991.

== Bands ==

In England, the council tax bands are as follows :

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Band !! Value&lt;ref name=&quot;value&quot;&gt;Nominal value as at 1991&lt;/ref&gt; !! Ratio&lt;ref name=&quot;ratio&quot;&gt;The ratio governs the relationship between the bands. For example, a Band B property will pay 78% of the charge set for a Band D property in the same area.&lt;/ref&gt; !! Ratio as %
|-
| A || up to £40,000            || 6/9 || 67%
|-
| B || £40,001 to £52,000       || 7/9 || 78%
|-
| C || £52,001 to £68,000       || 8/9 || 89%
|-

|-
| H || £320,001 and above       || 18/9 || 200%
|}

In Wales, the bands were re-set on April 1, 2005 by the National Assembly for Wales, based on 2003 valuations.  In addition to revising the band boundaries upwards, an extra band was added.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Band !! Value&lt;ref&gt;Nominal value as at 2003&lt;/ref&gt; !! Pre-2005 value&lt;ref name=&quot;value&quot; /&gt; !! Ratio&lt;ref name=&quot;ratio&quot; /&gt; !! Ratio as %
|-
| A || up to £44,000           || up to £30,000 || 6/9 || 67%
|-
| B || £44,001 to £65,000      || up to £39,000 || 7/9 || 78%
|-

|-
| I || £424,001 and above      || || 21/9 || 233%
|}

In Scotland, the current bands are

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Band !! Value&lt;ref name=&quot;value&quot; /&gt; !! Ratio&lt;ref name=&quot;ratio&quot; /&gt; !! Ratio as %

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

In the United Kingdom, '''Death Duty''' was first introduced as a tax on estates in England and Wales over a certain value from 1796, then called legacy, succession and estate duties. 
The value changed over time and the scope of estate duty was extended. By 1857 estates worth over £20 were taxable but duty was rarely collected on estates valued under £1500. Death duties were introduced in 1894, and for the next century were effective in breaking up large estates. 

== Inheritance Tax ==
Estate duty was replaced in 1975 by '''Capital Transfer Tax''', which was replaced by '''Inheritance Tax''' (IHT) in 1986. Partly due to the simple and widely-used methods which are available to avoid it, Inheritance Tax is a small, but by no means insignificant, revenue generator for the UK government, raising around £2,000,000,000 in 2001. 

For the 6 April 2008 to 5 April 2009 tax year, the IHT rate is 40% on the value, at death, of an individual's tax estate over £312,000. This figure is known as the nil rate band, and rises annually.

=== Tax estate ===
The tax estate includes:

# all of the deceased's assets, whether real estate or personal estate, and includes even small-value items such as the contents of his or her home;
# any gifts made in the seven years before death;
# some assets which were not owned by the deceased but which are affected by the death (the most common example is a life interest in a trust, technically known as an interest-in-possession);
# gifts with reservation of benefit. These are gifts where the legal ownership passes to the recipient. However, the donor continues to enjoy the benefit of the asset either rent free or at reduced cost. The seven year period outlined above does not begin counting down whilst a gift is considered to be under a reservation of benefit.

There is also a charge on &quot;lifetime chargeable transfers&quot; into certain trusts (and a recalculation of those charges if the giver dies within seven years), and trusts themselves have an inheritance tax regime. See Taxation of trusts (United Kingdom).

=== Deductions ===
There are deductions for:

# all assets left to a spouse or civil partner. However the exemption is limited to £55,000 where the deceased is domiciled in some part of UK and the surviving spouse/civil partner is domiciled outside of the UK &lt;ref&gt;s18 Inheritance Tax Act 1984&lt;/ref&gt;;
# all assets left to a charity registered in the UK;
# some political donations;
# gifts of up to £3000 in a given year;
# gifts of up to £250 made to separate people;
# some business assets (under Business Property Relief or &quot;BPR&quot;);
# some farmland (under Agricultural Property Relief or &quot;APR&quot;).
# gifts made out of income that do not impact upon the standard of living of an individual.
# gifts made in contemplation of a marriage or civil partnership. The level of this deduction varies according to the relationship of the donor to person marrying or entering into a civil partnership.

=== Minimising IHT ===
In order to avoid IHT, many people in the IHT bracket practise some or all of the following avoidance measures:

* Outright gifts to another individual made during a person's lifetime are known as &quot;potentially exempt transfers&quot; or PETs. They are taxable if the person dies within seven years, but have the ''potential'' to become ''exempt'' from tax once seven years have gone by with the giver still alive. If the giver survives three years, the value of the PETs that is taxable reduces by 20%, and then by a further 20% of the original value on each of the subsequent anniversaries, reaching 0% after seven years.  This is a form of taper relief.  Since the original PET value takes precedence over any other asset in making up the ''nil rate band'', the relief is only effective with gifts in excess  of this amount.  For example, a PET of £575,000 when the nil rate band is £275,000 would see a reduction in taxable value of £60,000 (20% of £300,000) every anniversary between the third and sixth. The whole gift becomes entirely exempt from tax seven years after it was made
* Gifting assets to a trust fund before death. (Some gifts of this kind, however, are disadvantageous as they amount to lifetime chargeable transfers on which IHT is paid straight away. This applies to many more trusts than previously under legislation announced in the 2006 budget. See Taxation of trusts (United Kingdom).)
* Charitable giving, which is IHT exempt.
* Lifetime gifts within certain limits are completely exempt. These include any number of &quot;small gifts&quot; (up to £250), an annual amount of £3,000, all regular gifts from surplus income, and some wedding gifts.
* Upon death, passing non-taxable assets to the next generation (or to a discretionary trust for the benefit of the whole family) and therefore NOT to the spouse. To many people this seems counter-intuitive because they are aware that gifts to a spouse are '''IHT exempt''' and should therefore be maximised. However, if something is '''non-taxable''' on the first death it should not go to the spouse as it will merely increase his or her tax estate upon his or her later death. (The '''nil-band discretionary trust''', discussed below, is an example of this principle in action.)

==== Nil rate bands ====
A person who has a tax estate less than the nil rate band may consider himself or herself outside the IHT bracket. Since October 2007, unused nil rate bands have been transferable between spouses and civil partners. That is, if on the first death, the nil rate band is not fully used, then the remainder can be used on the second death.

For unmarried couples and those not in a civil partnership, the most common means of ensuring that both nil rate bands are used is called a nil band discretionary trust. This is an arrangement in both wills which says that whoever is the first to die leaves their nil band to a discretionary trust for the family, and not to the survivor. The survivor can still benefit from those assets if needed, but they are not part of that survivor's tax estate. 

A gift is not valid for IHT purposes if the giver retains any benefit from it. There are quite complex and rigid rules which establish whether the giver has retained a benefit, and where there is a retention of benefit all IHT advantages from the gift are effectively lost.

More detail on discretionary trusts can be found in this module: [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Inheritance tax/Discretionary Trusts|Discretionary Trusts]].

==== Pre-owned assets ====
The Finance Act 2004 introduced an income tax regime known as pre-owned asset tax which aims to reduce the use of common methods of IHT avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2004/revbn40.htm REV BN 40: Tax Treatment Of Pre-Owned Assets]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Business rates''' are a tax charged to businesses and other occupiers of non-domestic property.  The proceeds of the tax are collected centrally and distributed to local authorities to contribute towards the costs of their services.

The 1990 Conservative government introduced a standard multiplier called the ''Uniform Business Rate'' (UBR) set by central government; this is used in conjunction with a property's rateable value to calculate the rate.  This was part of the reforms of local government funding which also introduced the community charge.

name=Gillyweed|
type=Plant|
features=Allows the person who eats it to breathe underwater|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]|}}

== Overview ==

'''''Gillyweed''''' is a magical plant. Gills appear on the neck of the person who eats it, enabling him or her to breathe underwater for a limited amount of time. It is described as looking like &quot;slimy grayish green rat tails.&quot;

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] is having difficulty figuring out a way to complete the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 26|second task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] (which requires him to rescue Ron from the bottom of a lake), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] steals some Gillyweed from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape's]] store cupboard and gives it to Harry to use.

We later learn that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] had given a book on ''Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean'' to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], with the expectation that Harry would ask Neville for help in the Challenge. Harry never consulted Neville, however; so Moody deliberately mentioned Gillyweed in Dobby's hearing.

== Analysis ==

More than breathing underwater, this plant forces partial adaptation to an underwater existence, providing Harry with gills and extending his feet and hands into flippers.

Note: In the film version of this series, it is in fact Neville who provides Gillyweed to Harry; this is managed by having Neville summon [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s office, instead of having [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] do it. This is likely a cost-cutting decision by the filmmakers; by eliminating Dobby from this one scene, they remove any need to have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house-elves]] in the film.

* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

This article needs some pictures badly. And just maybe some sections... [[User:Wikisquared|Wikisquared]] 20:44, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

===Article is Too Long=== 
This article (and all the other introductory material for this book) is far too long. This is not intended to be a chemistry book. It is intended to be a book about the elements. Perhaps some of this material should be forked to Wikijunior Basic Chemistry and we should decide what material here really adds to the overall mission of this book. Also, as Wikisquared has pointed out the article is far from complete, so it shouldn't be marked so on the front page. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 12:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

== Modification of outdated material-waste of time? ==

User:Az1568  modified the older version of Introduction, I think you may have wasted your time. Perhaps check the newer one and edit/improve that instead. If everyone agrees, then my plan was to move &quot;new!' into the Introduction slot and delete this older version.
cheers!--[[User:Read-write-services|Read-write-services]] 22:18, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

What are the new and old versions you speak of? I only see one version here!
[[User:John H, Morgan|John H, Morgan]] 20:40, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

This is the new one!
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior_The_Elements/Introduction_to_The_Elements-NEW%21

and this is the version that was modified by Az1568, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior_The_Elements/Introduction

cheers.
--[[User:Read-write-services|Read-write-services]] 21:42, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

The basic issue is that some authors have been working on a basic chemistry book here. I think this is an admirable goal and should be encouraged and continued. But I don't think that it fits with what this book is designed to be about. That is why I proposed forking the content. Keeping a version of the Introductory content here in &quot;The Elements&quot; but drastically editing it down, and creating a new book &quot;Wikijunior Basic Chemistry. Having two different active versions of the same article in the same book space is confusing for everyone, I think. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 02:20, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Geology is the foundation of soil mechanics.  Without a proper understanding of the underlying geologic processes that have formed the particular soil you have to deal with, a soils or geotechnical engineer will be playing with fire.  This is where a well trained engineering geologist is so vitally important.  They can help other people involved in the design and construction of a facility or project understand the geologic antecedents of the materials they have to use.&lt;p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thank you for putting your book online and making it freely available.

To answer one of your comments [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Economics]] :
''submitting to WIKI looks like a lotta work.''

Yes, submitting 1800 files will take a bit of work.
But *you* don't have to do the work.

I suggest that you post a note on your web site.
Make the note say that you release the book into the public domain.
(Or make it license the book according to the GFDL.)
(Creative Commons is another popular license, but other wiki are better set up to handle CC content than Wikibooks).
Then if only 10% of the people who hit your web site take a few minutes to copy a page or two from your web site to the wiki, it could all be copied in a month, without &quot;a lot of work&quot; from any one person.
(Or perhaps one person who sees that note will write a little bot to copy your entire book into Wikibooks in one swoop).

Perhaps you could create the first page of your book on Wikibooks.
Then once that page exists, you could add the exact URL of that page to the note on your web site.

Thank you for considering this wiki as a long-term home for your EPE book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rock''' is a musical style that arose in the U.S. in the mid-1950s and became the dominant form of popular music in the world. Though rock has used a wide variety of instruments, its basic elements are one or several vocalists, heavily amplified electric guitars (including bass, rhythm, and lead), and drums. It began as a simple style, relying on heavy, dance-oriented rhythms, uncomplicated melodies and harmonies, and lyrics sympathetic to its teenage audience's concerns — young love, the stresses of adolescence, and automobiles. 

Its roots lay principally in rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) and country music. Both R&amp;B and country existed outside the mainstream of popular music in the early 1950s, when the Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed (1921 – 65) and others began programming R&amp;B, which until then had been played only to black audiences. Freed's success gave currency to the term rock and roll. The highly rhythmic, sensual music of Chuck Berry, Bill Haley and the Comets, and particularly Elvis Presley in 1955 – 56 struck a responsive chord in the newly affluent postwar teenagers. 

In the 1960s several influences combined to lift rock out of what had already declined into a bland and mechanical format. In England, where rock's development had been slow, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were found to have retained the freshness of its very early years and achieved enormous success in the U.S., where a new generation had grown up unaware of the musical influences of the new stars, thus commencing the British Invasion.  Similarly, in the United States in the early 1960s, rock bands such as The Beach Boys and The Four Seasons were hugely popular, preceding the British Invasion.  Others, such as Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, the Byrds, and others were blending the traditional ballads and verse forms of folk music with rock, and musicians began to explore social and political themes. Performers such as the Grateful Dead, Jim Morrison of the Doors, and Frank Zappa of the Mothers of Invention combined imaginative lyrics with instrumental virtuosity, typically featuring lengthy solo improvisation. Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix won large followings with their exotic elaborations on R&amp;B. 

The 1970s saw the rise of singer-songwriters such as Paul Simon, Neil Young, Elton John, David Bowie, and Bruce Springsteen, and rock assimilated other forms to produce jazz-rock, heavy metal, and punk rock. In the 1980s the disco-influenced rock of Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Prince was balanced by the post-punk &quot;new wave&quot; music of performers such as Laurie Anderson, Talking Heads (led by David Byrne), and the Eurythmics — all of whom illustrated their songs with music videos. By the 1990s rock music had incorporated grunge, rap, techno, and other forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consider the real-valued exponential function &lt;math&gt;exp : \Bbb{R} \rightarrow \Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt; exp(x) = e^x &lt;/math&gt; . It has the following properties:

1) &lt;math&gt;e^x\neq 0\quad \forall x\in \Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

2) &lt;math&gt;e^{x+y} = e^xe^y\quad \forall x,y\in\Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

3) &lt;math&gt;(e^x)' = e^x\quad \forall x\in\Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

We want to extend the exponential function &lt;math&gt;exp&lt;/math&gt; to the complex numbers in
such a way that

1) &lt;math&gt;e^z\neq 0\quad \forall z\in \Bbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;

2) &lt;math&gt;e^{z+w} = e^ze^w\quad \forall z,w\in\Bbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;

3) &lt;math&gt;(e^z)' = e^z\quad \forall z\in\Bbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;e^z&lt;/math&gt; has been already defined for &lt;math&gt;z=i\theta&lt;/math&gt; and we have
&lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta}=\cos \theta+i\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

== Experiment ==

Submerse Cu&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; (copper) in AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; (silver nitrate) 

Wait for the chemical reaction and you will see Ag (silver) forming on the outside of the copper (it may look fuzzy) and replacing it, you now have 2Ag and Cu (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the exposed area of the copper.

== What happens? ==

The copper is replacing the silver in the silver nitrate. This reaction is a single-replacement reaction. The solution turns blue. Copper nitrate is the end product.

== Equation and Explanation ==

This chemical equation is an example of a single-replacement reaction. The Cu and the Ag switched places so to say. Resulting in Ag (silver, the fuzzy stuff) and Cu(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;

Balanced, the equation looks like this:

Cu&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2Ag&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + Cu(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

The molar mass of this compound is 296.524

For more aspie resources see [[/Resources|Resources]].

== What is this book about? ==

Let's start with the obvious - nothing is obvious. There is no scientific consensus about what Asperger's Syndrome is. There is even no consensus what 'mind' is or how it works, nor what 'healthy' or 'normal' is supposed to be. Yet for some reason, medical professionals manage to say that for aspies, all these categories - mind, health, normality - are different. Why is that so? What does it do?

== Chapters in this book ==

*'''[[/What_makes_me_an_Aspie_and_others_not|Chapter 1 - What makes me an Aspie and others not? (personal observations by aspies)]]'''
*'''[[/About_chatting|Chapter X - Chatting on the Internet]]'''
*'''[[/How_can_I_make_my_life_more_predictive|Chapter Y - How can I make my life more predictive?]]'''
*[[Aspies Book/Resources]]

There may not be a consensus among medics, but is there one among aspies? Aspies are the true professionals. No one knows them as well as they do themselves. So what is this all about? This book tries to answer some of these questions.

== Preface to the First Edition ==

The information revolution is commonly talked about as a phenomenon that affects everybody, bringing fundamental changes to the way we work, entertain ourselves and interact with each other. Yet the reality is that for the most part, such changes have bypassed the majority of humankind, the billions of poor people for whom computers and the Internet mean nothing. However, in a growing number of instances, and as part of a quieter revolution, a variety of local organizations, aid agencies and government bodies are discovering that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can be used to extend the reach of the information revolution to the poorest of people living in the remotest corners of the world.

Under the right circumstances, ICTs have been shown to be capable of inducing social and economic development in terms of health care, improved education, employment, agriculture, and trade, and also of enriching local culture. Yet making this possible is by no means straightforward, as it involves more than the mere deployment of technology and requires as much learning on the part of the promoters of the technology as on the part of its users. It is all too easy to introduce technology with great expectations; it is far more challenging to create the necessary conditions under which the technology can attain its full potential, requiring as it does the combined and coordinated efforts of a range of stakeholders with disparate interests.

Much of the evidence in support of the use of ICTs for alleviating poverty remains anecdotal, and initiatives are proceeding with little reference to each other. There is a need for field practitioners to take stock of the experience that has so far been accumulated. Each experiment in the field generates learning opportunities and there are no failures, except perhaps our own when we do not learn from past experience. Moreover, as experience accumulates, we can begin to make general sense of it by detecting recurring themes and patterns of relationships that can be usefully carried forward.

This e-primer is brought to you by United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme, in collaboration with the Government of India. APDIP seeks to create an ICT enabling environment through advocacy and policy reform in the Asia-Pacific region. The APDIP series of e-primers aims to provide readers with a clear understanding of the various terminologies, definitions, trends and issues associated with the information age. This e-primer on ICTs for Poverty Alleviation reviews contemporary initiatives at field level and synthesizes the learning opportunities that they provide. It serves as a practical guide for field implementers, offering not only a glimpse of best practices, but also a deeper understanding of how these have been applied in a range of instances.

We wish to acknowledge the contribution of the peer reviewers and the production team of the e-primer series.

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

='''Plasma'''=

==Plasma==

Plasma is known as the fourth state of matter and is in fact the most common state of matter. Over 99% of the matter in the universe is plasma. It is in the form of an excited gas. Plasma is created when the gas gets so hot that the electrons are stripped away from the atoms, giving it a positive charge.

[[Image:2006-02-25_candle-flame_with_colour-shift_B.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A candle flame is plasma.]]

==Examples of Plasma==
One common example of a plasma is the flame of a candle. The candle wax burns and gives off a hot gas that emits energy, in the form of light. It is this excited and hot flame that is known as plasma. All fire is plasma.
The light we see during a lightning strike is plasma. Another example of plasma is the sun and other stars. The light and heat of the sun is a result of hydrogen and other elements in a plasma state.

==Uses of Plasma==
Argon gas in a plasma state interacting with the phosphor coating within a glass tube gives us fluorescent lighting. Neon signs use argon in a plasma state interacting with mercury and phosphorus to produce their bright colors. Another example is the plasma television which works by applying electricity to cells of xenon, neon, and helium gas between two plates of glass. When the electricity is applied to the cells the gasses become plasma and interact with different phosphors to form the colors we see on the screen.

Gas laser systems, for example Helium/Neon types, use the two inert gases in a hot and excited state to emit large bursts of light energy. 

Some specialised welding apparatus use a plasma of inert gas to prevent the metals from oxidising (by excluding oxygen from the surrounding air) while being welded.

* 1 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]
* 1 Tbs [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]
* 1 quart [[Cookbook:Cream|whipping cream]]
* [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashew nuts]] &amp;ndash; for garnishing and paste (can be omitted for calorie-conscious people)
* 4 large [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 3-4 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|green chillies]] (depending on spice requirement)
* dried [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] and [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
* [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|red chilli powder]]
* [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Cottage Cheese|paneer]] (cottage cheese) cubes
* 1 Tbs [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] for garnishing

==Procedure==

# Cut the bell peppers into half-inch pieces.
# Chop the green chillies into fine pieces.
# Sauté paneer until golden brown; set aside.
# Soak a handful of cashew nuts in warm water for the creamy paste.
# Grind the tomatoes and the soaked cashew into a fine paste. Keep this paste aside.
# Sauté the chopped vegetables, green chillies, and dried parsley in the butter/oil until they are cooked. You could also microwave the vegetables for ~10 minutes without water, and then sauté them in butter for a minute.
# Add the tomato paste to the vegetables and let cook for 5 minutes.
# Add the garam masala, red chilli powder, salt and turmeric according to taste; simmer for 2 minutes.
# Add the whipping cream and the sour cream and let it cook until the cream thickens.
# Add the paneer and mix well.
# Garnish with cilantro and cashew nuts.
# Serve hot with [[Cookbook:Naan|naan]] or [[Cookbook:Roti|roti]] (Indian breads)

==Notes, tips and variations==
* You could choose other vegetables like zucchini or broccoli if you like.

      <text xml:space="preserve">='''Bose-Einstein condensates'''=

Bose-Einstein condensates are pieces of atoms called bosons that when supercooled, condense (fall out of) a gas to form a phase of matter that exhibits some very strange properties. The first actual experiment to prove that they existed was performed in 1995. The two scientists who completed the task were Cornell and Weiman. Two other scientists, Satyendra Bose and Albert Einstein, had predicted it in the 1920. They didn't have the technology to create it back then. Now we do. BEC happens at super low temperatures near absolute zero. When it gets low enough the matter starts to clump together. A group of atoms take up the same space creating a &quot;super atom.&quot; There are no longer separate atoms. They all take on the same qualities.


To summarize in a grossly abbreviated manner, a Bose-Einstein condensate is a collection of supercooled particles that assume the same quantum state (they are &quot;in phase&quot;) and thus exhibit quantum mechanical behaviour on a relatively macroscopic scale as a singular collection of between 10^4 and 10^5 particles.  Thus, effectively becoming &quot;the largest quantum particle&quot;.

== Preface to the First Edition ==

One of the many challenges facing the countries in the Asia-Pacific today is preparing their societies and governments for globalization and the information and communication revolution. Policy-makers, business executives, NGO activists, academics, and ordinary citizens are increasingly concerned with the need to make their societies competitive in the emergent information economy. 

The e-ASEAN Task Force and the UNDP Asia Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP) share the belief that with enabling information and communication technologies (ICTs), countries can face the challenge of the information age. With ICTs they can leap forth to higher levels of social, economic and political development. We hope that in making this leap, policy and decision-makers, planners, researchers, development practitioners, opinion-makers, and others will find this series of e-primers on the information economy, society, and polity useful. 

The e-primers aim to provide readers with a clear understanding of the various terminologies, definitions, trends, and issues associated with the information age. The primers are written in simple, easy-to-understand language.

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
Neon is a colorless, odorless gas at room temperature.

==How was it discovered?==
It was discovered by Scottish chemist William Ramsay and English chemist Morris Travers in 1898.

==Where did its name come from?==
Neon gets its name from Greek ''neos'', meaning &quot;new&quot;.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Neon is used in lighting.
* Neon, when in a plasma state, emits a reddish-orange glow.
* 
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Neon is a gas that is common in the universe but rare on Earth itself. Neon can be found in the earth's atmosphere, in small amounts.  It is the fourth most common element in the atmosphere behind nitrogen, oxygen and argon.  Because it is a noble, inert gas, it forms no compounds.

==What are its uses?==
Neon is used in lighting and some lasers.  Below is an example of the characteristic reddish-orange glow emitted by Neon plasma.
[[Image:NeTube.jpg|thumb|left|A lighted sign containing neon]].

==Is it dangerous?==
No.  Neon is an inert gas.
It is odorless, and  has no effects.
Neon lights do get hot, though, so you can burn yourself by touching them.  Also, breathing in pure neon gas can cause suffocation because it contains no oxygen, which is what your cells need to produce energy.

==Introduction==
Dendrochronology is the method of scientific dating based on the analysis of tree-ring growth patterns.  The technique can date wood to exact calendar years, and tell much about the climate of specific years.

== History==
'''Beginnings of Dendrochronology'''
:This technique was invented and developed during the 20th century originally by A. E. Douglass, the founder of the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona.

'''Dendrochronology in Anthropology'''

'''Notable cases in Dendrochronology's history'''
:'''Dendrochronology used to verify carbon dating techniques'''
:'''Methuselah'''
::Methuselah (estimated birth 2832 BCE) is a bristlecone pine in the White Mountains of California, which, at 4,838 years old, is the oldest living organism currently known and documented. It is named after Methuselah, a biblical figure reputed to have lived 969 years. Its exact location is currently undisclosed to the public as a protection against vandalism.

:'''Prometheus'''
::Prometheus (aka WPN-114) is the nickname given to the list of oldest non-clonal organism ever known, a Great Basin Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva) tree about 5000 years old growing at treeline on a mountain in eastern Nevada, USA. The tree was cut down on August 6, 1964 by a graduate student and United States Forest Service personnel for research purposes. The cutting of the tree remains controversial. Different versions of the event and the decision-making process behind it exist, although a number of basic facts are agreed upon. The name refers to the mythological figure Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. 

::The tree was a member of a population of bristlecone pine trees growing at treeline on the lateral moraine of a former glacier on Wheeler Peak, in what, since 1986, has been Great Basin National Park, in eastern Nevada. Wheeler Peak is the tallest mountain in the Snake Range, and the tallest mountain entirely within the state of Nevada. The bristlecone pine population on it is divided into (at least) two distinct sub-populations, one of which is accessible by a popular interpretive trail. Prometheus however, grew in an area reachable only by off-trail hiking. In either 1958 or 1961, a group of naturalists who admired the grove in which the tree grew gave names to a number of the largest or most distinctive trees, including Prometheus. The designation of WPN-114 was given by the original researcher, Donald R. Currey, and refers to the 114th tree sampled by him for his research in Nevada's White Pine county.

::The ring count of a section of the tree by Currey was 4844. A few years later, this was increased to 4862 by Donald Graybill of the University of Arizona's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research. However, the ring counts were done on a trunk cross section taken about 2.5 m (8 feet) above the original germination point of the tree, and so the innermost, lower rings were missed in the count. Adding in the years required to reach this height, plus a correction for the estimated number of missing rings (which are not uncommon in trees growing at treeline), it is probable that the tree was at least 5000 years old when cut. This makes it the oldest unitary (i.e non-clonal) organism ever known, exceeding the Methuselah tree of the White Mountains' Schulman Grove in California by about 200 years.

::Whether Prometheus should be considered the oldest organism ever known depends on the definition of &quot;oldest&quot; and &quot;organism&quot; one uses. For example, certain sprouting or clonal organisms, such as creosote bush or aspen, could have older individuals if the entire clonal organism is considered. Under this criteria, the oldest living organism is a quaking aspen grove in Utah known as Pando, at 80,000 years old. In a clonal organism, however, the individual clonal stems are nowhere near as old, and no part of the organism at any given point in time is particularly old. Prometheus was thus the oldest non-clonal organism yet discovered, with its innermost wood over 5000 years of age.  It is possible, however, that an older specimen occurs that has not yet been aged.  Bristlecones are notoriously hard to age because of their extremely contorted growth, and cutting of old trees is no longer allowed.

::In the 1950s dendrochronologists were making active efforts at finding the oldest living tree species, in order to use the analysis of the rings for various research purposes, such as the evaluation of former climates, the dating of archaeological ruins, and the basic question of finding the oldest living things. Bristlecone pines in the White Mountains of California and elsewhere were discovered by Edward Schulman to be older than any species yet dated. This spurred interest in finding very old bristlecones, possibly older than the Methuselah tree, aged by Schulman in 1957 at over 4700 years.

::Donald R. Currey was a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying the climate dynamics of the Little Ice Age using dendrochronology techniques. In 1963 he became aware of the bristlecone populations in the Snake Range and on Wheeler Peak in particular. Based on the size, growth rate and growth forms of some of the trees he became convinced that some very old specimens existed on the mountain, and cored some of them, finding trees exceeding 3000 years. Currey was not, however, able to obtain a continuous series of overlapping cores from WPN-114. Here, stories diverge. It is not clear whether Currey requested, or Forest Service personnel suggested, that he cut and section the tree in lieu of being able to core it. There is also some uncertainty as to why a core sample could not be obtained. One version has it that he broke or lodged his only long increment borer and could not obtain another before the end of the field season, another claims he broke two of them, while another implies that a core sample was too difficult to obtain and also would not provide as much definitive information as a full cross section of the tree would.

::In addition, there are conflicting views over the uniqueness of Prometheus in the Wheeler Peak grove. It is reported that Currey and/or the Forest Service personnel who authorized the cutting believed the tree was just one of many large, very old trees in the grove, while others, at least one of whom was involved in the decision-making and tree cutting, believe that the tree was clearly unique — obviously older than other trees in the area. At least one person involved says that Currey knew this to be true at the time, although there is no known admission from Currey himself that he knew this, and others have disputed that the tree was obviously older than others.

::Another uncertainty is that it is not clear how the cutting of such an old tree was necessary given the topic Currey was studying. Since the Little Ice Age started no more than 600 years ago, many trees could presumably have provided the information he was after for that time period.  However, in Currey's original report (Currey, 1965) he refers to the Little Ice Age as encompassing the period from 2000 BC to the present, thus defining the Age over a much longer time period than is currently accepted.  Whether this was the common sentiment at the time is not known.  In the article, Currey indicates that he sectioned the tree as much from the question of whether the oldest bristlecones were necessarily confined to California's White Mountains (as some dendrochronologists had been claiming) as from its usefulness in regards to studies of the Little Ice Age.

::Whatever the rationale, the tree was cut and sectioned in August 1964, and several pieces of the sections hauled out to be processed and analyzed, first by Currey, then by others in later years. Sections, or pieces of sections have ended up in various places, some of which are publicly accessible, including: the Great Basin National Park visitor center (Baker, NV), the Ely Convention Center (Ely, NV), the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research (Tucson, AZ), and the US Forest Service's Institute of Forest Genetics (Placerville, CA), among others.

::It has been argued that the cutting of the tree was an important factor in the move to protect bristlecones in general, and the Wheeler Peak groves in particular. There had been a movement to protect the mountain and contiguous areas in a national park before the tree was cut, and 22 years after the incident the area did gain national park status. 

::The exact location of the now-oldest tree, Methuselah, is kept secret by the administering agency, the U.S. Forest Service.  Because of the importance of the species in dendrochronogical research, all bristlecone pines, standing or down, are now protected.

== Trees ==

Many trees in temperate zones grow one growth ring each year, the newest ring being under the bark. For the entire period of a tree's life, a year-by-year record or ring pattern is formed that reflects the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring. A drought year may result in a very narrow one. Trees from the same region will tend to develop the same patterns of ring widths for a given period. These patterns can be compared and matched ring for ring with trees growing in the same geographical zone and under similar climatic conditions. Following these tree-ring patterns from living trees back through time, chronologies can be built up. Thus wood from ancient structures can be matched to known chronologies (a technique called ''cross-dating'') and the age of the wood determined precisely. Cross-dating was originally done by visual inspection. Nowadays, computers are used to do the statistical matching. 

To eliminate individual variations in tree ring growth, dendrochronologists take the smoothed average of the tree ring widths of multiple tree samples to build up a ring history. This process is termed replication. A tree ring history whose beginning and end dates are not known is called a ''floating chronology''. It can be anchored by cross-matching either the beginning or the end section against the end sections of another chronology (tree ring history) whose dates are known. Fully anchored chronologies which extend back more than 10,000 years exist for river oak trees from South Germany (from the Main and Rhine rivers). A fully anchored chronology which extends back 8500 years exists for the bristlecone pine in the southwest US (White Mountains of California).

In areas where the climate is reasonably predictable, trees develop annual rings of different properties depending on weather, rain, temperature, etc. in different years. These variations may be used to infer past climate variations &amp;mdash; see dendroclimatology.

Timber core samples are used to measure the width of annual growth rings. By taking samples from different sites and different rock strata within a particular region, researchers can build a comprehensive historical sequence that becomes a part of the scientific record; for example, ancient timbers found in buildings can be dated to give an indication of when the source tree was alive and growing, setting an upper limit on the age of the wood. Some trees are more suitable than others for this type of analysis. Likewise, in areas where trees grew in marginal conditions such as aridity or semi-aridity, the techniques of dendrochronology are more consistent than in humid areas. These tools have been important in archaeological dating of timbers of the cliff dwellings of Native Americans in the arid Southwest.

Scientific value 
A benefit of dendrochronology is that it makes available specimens of once-living material accurately dated to a specific year to be used as a calibration and check of radiocarbon dating. The bristlecone pine, being exceptionally long-lived and slow growing, has been used for this purpose, with still-living and dead specimens providing tree ring patterns going back thousands of years. For dating purposes, in some regions sequences of more than 10,000 years are available.

The dendrochronologist faces many obstacles, however, including some species of ant which inhabit trees and extend their galleries into the wood, thus destroying ring structure.

Similar seasonal patterns also occur in ice cores and in varves (layers of sediment deposition in a lake or river). The deposition pattern in the core will vary for a frozen-over lake versus an ice-free lake,and with the fineness of the sediment. These are used for dating in a manner similar to dendrochronology, and such techniques are used in combination with dendrochronology, to plug gaps and to extend the  range of the seasonal data available to archeologists.

While archaeologists can use the technique to date the piece of wood and when it was felled, it may be difficult to definitively determine the age of a building or structure that the wood is in. The wood could have been reused from an older structure, may have been felled and left for many years before use, or could have been used to replace a damaged piece of wood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Magic, as a whole, employs many devices, both real and other to accomplish its effects on spectators. ''Sleights'' (alternatively referred to as ''sleight of hand'') is a term which implies hiding, placing, obscuring or moving or switching an object or objects into or out of ones hands unbeknownst to onlookers.  Customarily, professional magicians use sleight of hand readily to accomplish their effects.

==A list of sleights used in close-up magic==
One simple move in card magic is called the '''double lift'''. 
A double lift involves the performer seemingly lifting the top card from a deck of cards, when he actually picks up two cards and shows the lowest card as one. When used with proper patter, this sleight has many powerful advantages for the performer. 

To perform a double lift, simply make a 'break' between the second card from the top of the deck and the remainder of the cards -- generally using your little finger...this should be done very casually, while talking. Turn over both cards, handling their edges to portray the illusion that you've merely turned over the top card of the deck. Put them back on the deck, and put the top card in the middle of the deck, then 'snap' over the cards, and show the new top card, which is the original card. David Blaine has used this on his television show.

A good way to make this move is to use a '''Wizard pack''' (one with tapered cards--also knowns as a '''Stripper deck''') and have the reversed tapered card 2nd from the top. This is useful if you have small hands or find it hard to insert a finger without anyone seeing.

== Who am I ==

I don't give my name away on the internet. But I like pseudonyms. You can call me by the following and I'll know that you're speaking to me. Monk, Roland, or Clonky if you're feeling silly.

''I am a wikipedia user. My wikipedia page is here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Monk_of_the_highest_order Monk of the highest order].''

== Why am I here ==

I joined wikibooks because I was working a lot on the East Coast Swing page. I had already done some substantial fixing up of that page on the left underarm turn, and added a terminology section, and when I started making the section on triple-step, I thought &quot;Hey, if I'm gonna keep on adding like this, might as well have a user account.&quot; So that's all.

I like writing, organizing, editing, and copyediting books more than I like to work on articles. I feel this way because books, although they can and should have just as high a standard of quality as an encyclopedia article, allow the author to go more indepth, and allow both the reader and the writer to explore all the fascinating nuances of the subject. An article only gives you a sip of that deep pool of knowledge, a book can tell you everything you need to know.

== What am I doing ==

Originally, this section said ''&quot;Really, aside from an occasional edit here or there, I probably won't do anything at all.&quot;'' but I've grown accustomed to doing a little more than that. I've developed a bit of a passion for this place.</text>

== Hello! ==

Hello Monk! Welcome to wikibooks. We have a welcome template around here, but I can't remember what it is, so you will have to make due with my hand-written welcome. I see from your user page that you have developed a &quot;passion&quot; for this place. I'm glad about that! Wikibooks is a small project, admittedly, but the people that we do have really care about the project, and really want to generate some high-quality textbooks for the world to use. If you have any questions, or if you have any problems while working here, please don't hesitate to ask me on [[User talk:Whiteknight|my user talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:51, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== East Coast Swing ==

WOW, is just about all I can say.  WOW.  I've been using Wikibooks as a transwiki destination for a lot of the swing dancing how-tos on Wikipedia, but just recently meandered over here after a few months to see if anything had happened to the transwikied articles.  WOW!  The East Coast book is actually ... I mean it's ... organized!  I applaud you on the great work so far!--[[User:Will.i.am|Will.i.am]] 13:24, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

== Demystifying depression ==

The people who used to maintain the lists of &quot;good books&quot;, and the books that appear on the main page are no longer active, and the exact methodologies that lead to books being listed in those places is unknown. I've been working on new methods for updating these pages by community concensus, but at the moment those projects haven't gotten off the ground. For more information on my efforts in this area, as well as a good place to list your complaint, see [[wikibooks:Good books]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:11, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

For bringing that VfD up - there were a series of pages that had been missed - think I've cleared them now - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:10, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks/Unstable|What is Wikibooks draft]] ==

It wasn't that hard for me to rewrite, since I was the one who made that confusing text to begin with. I think I still need to fix it up some more though. Needs a more positive tone to it like the rest of the policy. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:42, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;[[Movie_Making_Manual/Introduction|Previous | Introduction]]&lt;/div&gt;

The concept is simply an idea of what the Movie will be about. Generally a writer or director will develop a concept. From there, if funding is required, a &quot;Spec Script&quot; may be written and presented to a board. If the funding is given, a writer may be hired to develop the concept further and complete the script for further criticism from producers. Where funding is not required, a Director may choose to just write the script and shoot the final product.

Developing a concept can be one of the hardest steps in the film making process as a good concept can either make or break a movie, however there are few simple methods to developing an idea. One of these is dreaming. Lucid Dreaming is a popular method for coming up with story concepts as it allows the mind to freely develop and remember a scene. It is advised to write down dreams soon after you wake up to avoid forgetting. 

Another method to coming up with scarier concepts is to change a small aspect of something common and similar to everyone. Steven Moffat commonly uses this method in his writing for Doctor Who. Some of his examples include;
* The Weeping Angels - Statue of angels that only move when not being viewed.
* The Empty Child - Removing a face with a gas mask is a simple way to remove someone's identity.

A concept is the only thing some directors need. For example, in [[w:Paranormal Activity]], the Director (Oren Peli) opted for retro scripting, where the actors are given an outline of the plot and improvise dialogue. This is ideal for found footage as the actor is reacting to a scene and not memorize dialogue.

== Pronunciation ==
=== b, d, g, j ===
''b'', ''d'', ''g'', and ''j'' (IPA: &lt;nowiki&gt;[p],[t],[k], and [tɕ]&lt;/nowiki&gt;), sounds in Cantonese are voicless, in contrast to the voiced English sounds spelled with the same letters.  The tongue position for Cantonese ''b'' and ''g'' sounds is the same as for English.  For the ''d'' sound the tongue tip is more forward in Cantonese than in English--against the base of the upper teeth for Cantonese, on the dental ridge for English.  The tongue position for the ''j'' sound has been discussed in Lesson 1.  All of the above sounds are unaspirated, as are the English counterparts.  But the Cantonese and English sounds contrast with respect to tenseness--the Cantonese initial consonants are tense while the English lax in isolated words and in stressed positions of a sentence.

===un===
''un'' as in ''Yahtbún'' and ''Yahtbúnyàhn'' is a two part final composed of a high back rounded vowel (IPA: &lt;nowiki&gt;[u]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) by the alveolar nasal consonant (IPA: &lt;nowiki&gt;[n]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). When the two are together there is a slight offglide to the high central position (IPA: &lt;nowiki&gt;[uːin]&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  The vowel is '''not''' nasalized before nasal final.  The Cantonese 'un' is roughly comparable to the `oon` in English (e.g. `boon`).

Listen and compare
#bún (本), boon
#boon, bún (本)


===eui===
The lips should be rounded throughout the final.  Remember that the ''i'' of ''eui'' represents the high front rounded vowel (IPA: &lt;nowiki&gt;[y]&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

Listen and repeat
#kéuih 佢
#deuim̀hjyuh 對唔住
#deui 對 


===iu===
''iu'' is a two-part final composed of the high front unrounded vowel (IPA: &lt;nowiki&gt;[i]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) plus the high back rounded vowel (IPA: &lt;nowiki&gt;[u]&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  In this sequence the ''i'' is pronounced as an onglide, with the longest portion being the ''u''.

== Preface to the First Edition ==

One the many challenges facing the countries in the Asia-Pacific today is preparing their societies and governments for globalization and the information and communication revolution. Policy-makers, business executives, NGO activists, academics, and ordinary citizens are increasingly concerned with the need to make their societies competitive in the emergent information economy.

The e-ASEAN Task Force and the UNDP Asia Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP) share the belief that with enabling information and communication technologies (ICTs), countries can face the challenge of the information age. With ICTs they can leap forth to higher levels of social, economic and political development. We hope that in making this leap, policy and decision-makers, planners, researchers, development practitioners, opinion-makers, and others will find this series of e-primers on the information economy, society, and polity useful.

The e-primers aim to provide readers with a clear understanding of the various terminologies, definitions, trends, and issues associated with the information age. The primers are written in simple, easy-to-understand language. They provide examples, case studies, lessons learned, and best practices that will help planners and decision makers in addressing pertinent issues and crafting policies and strategies appropriate for the information economy.

The present series of e-primers includes the following titles:

#The Information Age
#Nets, Webs and the Information Infrastructure
#e-Commerce and e-Business
#Legal and Regulatory Issues for the Information Economy
#e-Government
#ICT and Education
#Genes, Technology and Policy: An Introduction to Biotechnology

These e-primers are also available online at http://www.apdip.net/publications/iespprimers

The primers are brought to you by UNDP-APDIP, which seeks to create an ICT enabling environment through advocacy and policy reform in the Asia-Pacific region, and the e-ASEAN Task Force, an ICT for development initiative of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We welcome your views on new topics and issues on which the e-primers may be useful.

Finally, we thank all who have been involved with this series of e-primers-writers, researchers, peer reviewers and the production team.

== E-Commerce Applications: Issues and Prospects ==

Various applications of e-commerce are continually affecting trends and prospects for business over the Internet, including e-banking, e-tailing and online publishing/online retailing.

A more developed and mature e-banking environment plays an important role in e-commerce by encouraging a shift from traditional modes of payment (i.e., cash, checks or any form of paper-based legal tender) to electronic alternatives (such as e-payment systems), thereby closing the e-commerce loop.

a)  Benefits of e-Commerce 
* Expanded Geographical Reach 
* Expanded Customer Base 
* Increase Visibility through Search Engine Marketing 
* Provide Customers valuable information about your business 
* Available 24/7/365 - Never Close 
* Build Customer Loyalty 
* Reduction of Marketing and Advertising Costs 
* Collection of Customer Data 

b)   Basic Benefits of e-Business e-Commerce
* Increase sales - this is the first thing that people consider when dealing with e-commerce 
** Decreasing costs 
** Increase profits 
*** Understanding that profits is not the same as sales 
** Expands the size of the market from regional to national or national to international 
** Contract the market 
** Reach a narrow market 
*** Target market segmentation allows you to focus on a more
**** Select group of customers 
*** And therefore have a competitive advantages in satisfying them

== What are the existing practices in developing countries with respect to buying and paying online? ==

In most developing countries, the payment schemes available for online transactions are the following:

'''A. Traditional Payment Methods''' &lt;br&gt;

* ''Cash on delivery.'' Many online transactions only involve submitting purchase orders online. Payment is by cash upon the delivery of the physical goods.

* ''Bank payments.'' After ordering goods online, payment is made by depositing cash into the bank account of the company from which the goods were ordered. Delivery is likewise done the conventional way.

'''B. Electronic Payment Methods''' &lt;br&gt;

* ''Innovations affecting consumers,'' include credit and debit cards, automated teller machines (ATMs), stored value cards, and e-banking.

* ''Innovations enabling online commerce'' are e-cash, e-checks, smart cards, and encrypted credit cards. These payment methods are not too popular in developing countries. They are employed by a few large companies in specific secured channels on a transaction basis.

* ''Innovations affecting companies'' pertain to payment mechanisms that banks provide their clients, including inter-bank transfers through automated clearing houses allowing payment by direct deposit.

== What is an electronic payment system? Why is it important? ==

An electronic payment system (EPS) is a system of financial exchange between buyers and sellers in the online environment that is facilitated by a digital financial instrument (such as encrypted credit card numbers, electronic checks, or digital cash) backed by a bank, an intermediary, or by legal tender.

EPS plays an important role in e-commerce because it closes the e-commerce loop. In developing countries, the underdeveloped electronic payments system is a serious impediment to the growth of e-commerce. In these countries, entrepreneurs are not able to accept credit card payments over the Internet due to legal and business concerns. The primary issue is transaction security.

The absence or inadequacy of legal infrastructures governing the operation of e-payments is also a concern. Hence, banks with e-banking operations employ service agreements between themselves and their clients.

The relatively undeveloped credit card industry in many developing countries is also a barrier to e-commerce. Only a small segment of the population can buy goods and services over the Internet due to the small credit card market base. There is also the problem of the requirement of “explicit consent” (i.e., a signature) by a card owner before a transaction is considered valid-a requirement that does not exist in the U.S. and in other developed countries.

''What is the confidence level of consumers in the use of an EPS?'' &lt;br&gt;

Many developing countries are still cash-based economies. Cash is the preferred mode of payment not only on account of security but also because of anonymity, which is useful for tax evasion purposes or keeping secret what one’s money is being spent on. For other countries, security concerns have a lot to do with a lack of a legal framework for adjudicating fraud and the uncertainty of the legal limit on the liability associated with a lost or stolen credit card.

In sum, among the relevant issues that need to be resolved with respect to EPS are: consumer protection from fraud through efficiency in record-keeping; transaction privacy and safety, competitive payment services to ensure equal access to all consumers, and the right to choice of institutions and payment methods. Legal frameworks in developing countries should also begin to recognize electronic transactions and payment schemes.

What is e-banking?

E-banking includes familiar and relatively mature electronically-based products in developing markets, such as telephone banking, credit cards, ATMs, and direct deposit. It also includes electronic bill payments and products mostly in the developing stage, including stored-value cards (e.g., smart cards/smart money) and Internet-based stored value products.

:'''Box 7. Payment Methods and Security Concerns: The Case of China'''
{{TextBox|In China, while banks issue credit cards and while many use debit cards to draw directly from their respective bank accounts, very few people use their credit cards for online payment. Cash-on-delivery is still the most popular mode of e-commerce payment. Nonetheless, online payment is gaining popularity because of the emergence of Chinapay and Cyber Beijing, which offer a city-wide online payment system.
|}}

''What is the status of e-banking in developing countries?'' &lt;br&gt;

E-banking in developing countries is in the early stages of development. Most banking in developing countries is still done the conventional way. However, there is an increasing growth of online banking, indicating a promising future for online banking in these countries. Below is a broad picture of e-banking in three ASEAN countries.

'''The Philippine Experience''' &lt;br&gt;

In the Philippines, Citibank, Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), Philippine National Bank, and other large banks pioneered e-banking in the early 1980s. Interbank networks in the country like Megalink, Bancnet, and BPI Expressnet were among the earliest and biggest starters of ATM (Automated Teller Machines) technology.

BPI launched its BPI Express Online in January 2000. The most common online financial services include deposits, fund transfers, applications for new accounts, Stop Payment on issued checks, housing and auto loans, credit cards, and remittances.

'''The Singapore Experience''' &lt;br&gt;

In Singapore, more than 28% of Internet users visited e-banking sites in May 2001. Research by NetValue (an Internet measurement company) shows that while the number of people engaging in online banking in Singapore has increased, the average time spent at sites decreased by approximately four minutes from March 2001 to May 2001. This decline can be attributed to the fact that more visitors spend time completing transactions, which take less time than browsing different sites. According to the survey, two out of three visitors make a transaction. All major banks in Singapore have an Internet presence. They offer a wide range of products directly to consumers through proprietary Internet sites. These banks have shifted from an initial focus on retail-banking to SME and corporate banking products and services.

Among the products offered are:

* Fund transfer and payment systems;
* Integrated B2B e-commerce product, involving product selection, purchase order, invoice generation and payment;
* Securities placement and underwriting and capital market activities;
* Securities trading; and
* Retail banking.

'''The Malaysian Experience''' &lt;br&gt;

E-banking in Malaysia emerged in 1981 with the introduction of ATMs. This was followed by tele-banking in the early 1990s where telecommunications devices were connected to an automated system through the use of Automated Voice Response (AVR) technology. Then came PC banking or desktop banking using proprietary software, which was more popular among corporate customers than retail customers.

On June 1, 2000, the Malaysian Bank formally allowed local commercial banks to offer Internet banking services. On June 15, 2000, Maybank (www.maybank2U.com), one of the largest banks in Malaysia, launched the country’s first Internet banking services. The bank employs 128-bit encryption technology to secure its transactions. Other local banks in Malaysia offering e-banking services are Southern Bank, Hong Leong Bank, HSBC Bank, Multi-Purpose Bank, Phileo Allied Bank and RHB Bank. Banks that offer WAP or Mobile banking are OCBC Bank, Phileo Allied Bank and United Overseas Bank.

The most common e-banking services include banking inquiry functions, bill payments, credit card payments, fund transfers, share investing, insurance, travel, electronic shopping, and other basic banking services.37

''What market factors, obstacles, problems and issues are affecting the growth of e-banking in developing countries?'' &lt;br&gt;

Human tellers and automated teller machines continue to be the banking channels of choice in developing countries. Only a small number of banks employ Internet banking. Among the middle- and high-income people in Asia questioned in a McKinsey survey, only 2.6% reported banking over the Internet in 2000. In India, Indonesia, and Thailand, the figure was as low as 1%; in Singapore and South Korea, it ranged from 5% to 6%. In general, Internet banking accounted for less than 0.1% of these customers’ banking transactions, as it did in 1999. The Internet is more commonly used for opening new accounts but the numbers are negligible as less than 0.3% of respondents used it for that purpose, except in China and the Philippines where the figures climbed to 0.7 and 1.0%, respectively.

This slow uptake cannot be attributed to limited access to the Internet since 42% of respondents said they had access to computers and 7% said they had access to the Internet. The chief obstacle in Asia and throughout emerging markets is security. This is the main reason for not opening online banking or investment accounts. Apparently, there is also a preference for personal contact with banks.

Access to high-quality products is also a concern. Most Asian banks are in the early stages of Internet banking services, and many of the services are very basic.

''What are the trends and prospects for e-banking in these countries?'' &lt;br&gt;

There is a potential for increased uptake of e-banking in Asia. Respondents of the McKinsey survey gave the following indications:

1. '''Lead users''': 38% of respondents indicated their intention to open an online account in the near future. These lead users undertake one-third more transactions a month than do other users, and they tend to employ all banking channels more often.

2. '''Followers''': An additional 20% showed an inclination to eventually open an online account, if their primary institution were to offer it and if there would be no additional bank charges.

3. '''Rejecters''': 42% (compared to the aggregate figure of 58% for lead users and followers) indicated no interest in or an aversion to Internet banking. It is important to note that these respondents also preferred consolidation and simplicity, i.e., owning fewer banking products and dealing with fewer financial institutions.

Less than 13% of the lead users and followers indicated some interest in conducting complex activities over the Internet, such as trading securities or applying for insurance, credit cards, and loans. About a third of lead users and followers showed an inclination to undertake only the basic banking functions, like ascertaining account balances and transferring money between accounts, over the Internet. 38

== What is e-tailing? ==

E-tailing (or electronic retailing) is the selling of retail goods on the Internet. It is the most common form of business-to-consumer (B2C) transaction.

:'''Box 8. E-Tailing: Pioneering Trends in E-Commerce'''
{{TextBox|The year 1997 is considered the first big year for e-tailing. This was when Dell Computer recorded multimillion dollar orders taken at its Web site. Also, the success of Amazon.com (which opened its virtual doors in 1996) encouraged Barnes &amp; Noble to open an e-tail site. Security concerns over taking purchase orders over the Internet gradually receded. In the same year, Auto-by-Tel sold its millionth car over the Web, and CommerceNet/Nielsen Media recorded that 10 million people had made purchases on the Web.
|}}

''What are the trends and prospects for e-tailing?'' &lt;br&gt;

Jupiter projects that e-tailing will grow to $37 billion by 2002. Another estimate is that the online market will grow 45% in 2001, reaching $65 billion. Profitability will vary sharply between Web-based, catalog-based and store-based retailers. There was also a marked reduction in customer acquisition costs for all online retailers from an average of $38 in 1999 to $29 in 2000.

An e-retail study conducted by Retail Forward showed that eight of its top 10 e-retailers 40 were multi-channel-that is, they do not rely on online selling alone. Figure 7 shows the top 10 e-tailers by revenues generated online for the year 2001.

In addition, a study by the Boston Consulting Group and Shop.org revealed that the multi-channel retail market in the U.S. expanded by 72% from 1999 to 2002, vis-àvis a compounded annual growth rate of 67.8% for the total online market for the years 1999-2002.

== What is online publishing? What are its most common applications? ==

Online publishing is the process of using computer and specific types of software to combine text and graphics to produce Web-based documents such as newsletters, online magazines and databases, brochures and other promotional materials, books, and the like, with the Internet as a medium for publication.

''What are the benefits and advantages of online publishing to business?'' &lt;br&gt;

Among the benefits of using online media are low-cost universal access, the independence of time and place, and ease of distribution. These are the reasons why the Internet is regarded as an effective marketing outreach medium and is often used to enhance information service.

''What are the problems and issues in online publishing?'' &lt;br&gt;

The problems in online publishing can be grouped into two categories: management challenges and public policy issues.

There are two major management issues:

The ''profit question'', which seeks to address how an online presence can be turned into a profitable one and what kind of business model would result in the most revenue; and

The ''measurement issue'', which pertains to the effectiveness of a Web site and the fairness of charges to advertisers.

The most common public policy issues have to do with copyright protection and censorship. Many publishers are prevented from publishing online because of inadequate copyright protection. An important question to be addressed is: How can existing copyright protections in the print environment be mapped onto the online environment? Most of the solutions are technological rather than legal. The more common technological solutions include encryption for paid subscribers, and information usage meters on add-in circuit boards and sophisticated document headers that monitor the frequency and manner by which text is viewed and used.

In online marketing, there is the problem of unsolicited commercial e-mail or “spam mail.” Junk e-mail is not just annoying; it is also costly. Aside from displacing normal and useful e-mail, the major reason why spam mail is a big issue in online marketing is that significant costs are shifted from the sender of such mail to the recipient. Sending bulk junk e-mail is a lot cheaper compared to receiving the same. Junk e-mail consumes bandwidth (which an ISP purchases), making Internet access clients slower and thereby increasing the cost of Internet use.42</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{MatlabNav}}

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A '''vector''' in MATLAB is defined as an array which has only one dimension with a size greater than one. For example, the array [1,2,3] counts as a vector. There are several operations you can perform with vectors which don't make a lot of sense with other arrays such as matrices. However, since a vector is a special case of a matrix, any matrix functions can also be performed on vectors as well provided that the operation makes sense mathematically (for instance, you can matrix-multiply a vertical and a horizontal vector). This section focuses on the operations that can only be performed with vectors.

== Declaring a vector ==

Declare vectors as if they were normal arrays, all dimensions except for one must have length 1. It does not matter if the array is vertical or horizontal. For instance, both of the following are vectors:

 &gt;&gt; Horiz = [1,2,3];
 &gt;&gt; Vert = [4;5;6];

You can use the ''isvector'' function to determine in the midst of a program if a variable is a vector or not before attempting to use it for a vector operation. This is useful for error checking.

 &gt;&gt; isvector(Horiz)
 ans = 1
 &gt;&gt; isvector(Vert)
 ans = 1

Another way to create a vector is to assign a single row or column of a matrix to another variable:

 &gt;&gt; A = [1,2,3;4,5,6];
 &gt;&gt; Vec = A(1,:)
 Vec = 1   2   3

This is a useful way to store multiple vectors and then extract them when you need to use them. For example, gradients can be stored in the form of the Jacobian (which is how the symbolic math toolbox will return the derivative of a multiple variable function) and extracted as needed to find the magnitude of the derivative of a specific function in a system.

=== Declaring a vector with linear or logarithmic spacing ===

Suppose you wish to declare a vector which varies linearly between two endpoints. For example, the vector [1,2,3] varies linearly between 1 and 3, and the vector [1,1.1,1.2,1.3,...,2.9,3] also varies linearly between 1 and 3. To avoid having to type out all those terms, MATLAB comes with a convenient function called ''linspace'' to declare such vectors automatically:

 &gt;&gt; LinVector = linspace(1,3,21)
  LinVector = Columns 1 through 9 
    1.0000    1.1000    1.2000    1.3000    1.4000    1.5000    1.6000    1.7000    1.8000
  Columns 10 through 18 
    1.9000    2.0000    2.1000    2.2000    2.3000    2.4000    2.5000    2.6000    2.7000
  Columns 19 through 21 
    2.8000    2.9000    3.0000

Note that linspace produces a row vector, not a column vector. To get a column vector use the transpose operator (') on LinVector.

The third argument to the function is the total size of the vector you want, which will include the first two arguments as endpoints and n - 2 other points in between. If you omit the third argument, MATLAB assumes you want the array to have 100 elements.

If, instead, you want the spacing to be logarithmic, use the ''logspace'' function. This function, unlike the linspace function, does  '''not''' find n - 2 points between the first two arguments a and b. Instead it finds n-2 points between 10^a and 10^b as follows:

 &gt;&gt; LogVector = logspace(1,3,21)
  LogVector = 1.0e+003 *
  Columns 1 through 9 
    0.0100    0.0126    0.0158    0.0200    0.0251    0.0316    0.0398    0.0501    0.0631
  Columns 10 through 18 
    0.0794    0.1000    0.1259    0.1585    0.1995    0.2512    0.3162    0.3981    0.5012
  Columns 19 through 21 
    0.6310    0.7943    1.0000

Both of these functions are useful for generating points that you wish to evaluate another function at, for plotting purposes on rectangular and logarithmic axes respectively.

== Vector Magnitude ==

The magnitude of a vector can be found using the ''norm'' function:

 &gt;&gt; Magnitude = norm(inputvector,2);

For example:

 &gt;&gt; magHoriz = norm(Horiz) 
 magHoriz = 3.7417
 &gt;&gt; magVert = norm(Vert)
 magVert = 8.7750

The input vector can be either horizontal or vertical.

== Dot product ==

The dot product of two vectors of the same size (vertical or horizontal, it doesn't matter as long as the long axis is the same length) is found using the ''dot'' function as follows:

 &gt;&gt; DP = dot(Horiz, Vert)
 DP = 32

The dot product produces a scalar value, which can be used to find the angle if used in combination with the magnitudes of the two vectors as follows:

 &gt;&gt; theta = acos(DP/(magHoriz*magVert));
 &gt;&gt; theta = 0.2257

Note that this angle is in radians, not degrees.

== Cross Product ==

The cross product of two vectors of size 3 is computed using the 'cross' function:

 &gt;&gt; CP = cross(Horiz, Vert)
 CP = -3   6   -3

Note that the cross product is a vector. Analogous to the dot product, the angle between two vectors can also be found using the cross product's magnitude:

 &gt;&gt; CPMag = norm(CP);
 &gt;&gt; theta = asin(CPMag/(magHoriz*magVert))
 theta = 0.2257

The cross product itself is always perpendicular to both of the two initial vectors. If the cross product is zero then the two original vectors were parallel to each other.

__TOC__

== How important is e-commerce to SMEs in developing countries? How big is the SME e-business market? ==

For SMEs in developing countries e-commerce poses the advantages of reduced information search costs and transactions costs (i.e., improving efficiency of operations-reducing time for payment, credit processing, and the like). Surveys show that information on the following is most valuable to SMEs: customers and markets, product design, process technology, and financing source and terms. The Internet and other ICTs facilitate access to this information.43 In addition, the Internet allows automatic packaging and distribution of information (including customized information) to specific target groups.

However, there is doubt regarding whether there is enough information on the Web that is relevant and valuable for the average SME in a developing country that would make investment in Internet access feasible. Underlying this is the fact that most SMEs in developing countries cater to local markets and therefore rely heavily on local content and information. For this reason, there is a need to substantially increase the amount and quality of local content (including local language content) on the Internet to make it useful especially to low-income entrepreneurs.44

:'''Box. 9. ICT-4-BUS: Helping SMEs Conquer the E-Business Challenge45'''
{{TextBox|The Information and Communication Technology Innovation Program for E-business and SME Development, otherwise known as the ICT-4-BUS, is an initiative by the Multilateral Investment Fund and the Information Technology for Development Division of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to enhance the competitiveness, productivity and efficiency of micro-entrepreneurs and SMEs in Latin America and the Carribean through the provision of increased access to ICT solutions. This is in line with the regional and worldwide effort to achieve a viable “information society.” Programs and projects under this initiative include the dissemination of region-wide best practices, computer literacy and training programs, and coordination efforts to facilitate critical access to credit and financing for the successful implementation of e-business solutions. The initiative serves as a strategic tool and a vehicle for maximizing the strong SME e-business market potential in Latin America manifested in the $23.51 billion e-business revenues reached among Latin American SMEs.46
|}}

eMarketer estimates that SME e-business revenues will increase: from $6.53 billion to $28.53 billion in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East combined; $127.25 billion in 2003 to $502.69 billion by 2005 in the Asia-Pacific region; $23.51 billion in 2003 to $89.81 billion by 2005 in Latin America; from $340.41 billion in 2003 to $971.47 billion by 2005 in Western Europe; and from $384.36 billion in 2003 to $1.18 trillion by 2005 in Northern America.

''How is e-commerce useful to developing country entrepreneurs?'' &lt;br&gt;

There are at least five ways by which the Internet and e-commerce are useful for developing country entrepreneurs:

1. It facilitates the access of artisans47 and SMEs to world markets.

2. It facilitates the promotion and development of tourism of developing countries in a global scale.

3. It facilitates the marketing of agricultural and tropical products in the global market.

4. It provides avenues for firms in poorer countries to enter into B2B and B2G supply chains.

5. It assists service-providing enterprises in developing countries by allowing them to operate more efficiently and directly provide specific services to customers globally.

:'''Box 10. IFAT: Empowering the Agricultural Sector through B2C E-Commerce'''
{{TextBox|The International Federation for Alternative Trade (IFAT) is a collective effort to empower the agricultural sector of developing countries. It is composed of 100 organizations (including 70 organizations in developing countries) in 42 countries. Members of the organization collectively market about $200-400 million annually in handicrafts and agricultural products from lower income countries. In addition, IFAT provides assistance to developing country producers in terms of logistical support, quality control, packing and export.
|}}

:'''Box 11. Offshore Data Processing Centers: E-commerce at Work in the Service Sector'''
{{TextBox|Offshore data processing centers, which provide data transcription and “back office” functions to service enterprises such as insurance companies, airlines, credit card companies and banks, among others, are prevalent in developing countries and even in lowwage developed countries. In fact, customer support call centers of dot-coms and other ICT/e-commerce companies are considered one of the fastest growing components of offshore services in these countries. India and the Philippines pride themselves in being the major locations of offshore data entry and computer programming in Asia, with India having established a sophisticated software development capability with highly skilled personnel to support it.48
|}}

Developing country SMEs in the services sector have expanded their market with the increased ability to transact directly with overseas or international customers and to advertise their services. This is especially true for small operators of tourism-related services. Tourism boards lend assistance in compiling lists of service providers by category in their Web sites.

In addition, for SMEs in developing countries the Internet is a quick, easy, reliable and inexpensive means for acquiring online technical support and software tools and applications, lodging technical inquiries, requesting repairs, and ordering replacement parts or new tooling.49

The Internet is also instrumental in enabling SMEs in developing countries to join discussion groups with their peers across the globe who are engaged in the same business, and thereby share information, experiences and even solutions to specific technical problems. This is valuable especially to entrepreneurs who are geographically isolated from peers in the same business.50

''What is the extent of ICT usage among SMEs in developing countries?'' &lt;br&gt;

Currently the Internet is most commonly used by SME firms in developing countries for communication and research; the Internet is least used for e-commerce. E-mail is considered an important means of communication. However, the extent of use is limited by the SMEs’ recognition of the importance of face-to-face interaction with their buyers and suppliers. The level of confidence of using e-mail for communication with both suppliers and buyers increases only after an initial face-to-face interaction. E-mail, therefore, becomes a means for maintaining a business relationship. It is typically the first step in e-commerce, as it allows a firm to access information and maintain communications with its suppliers and buyers. This can then lead to more advanced e-commerce activities.

ICT usage patterns among SMEs in developing countries show a progression from the use of the Internet for communication (primarily e-mail) to use of the Internet for research and information search, to the development of Web sites with static information about a firm’s goods or services, and finally to use of the Internet for e-commerce.

:'''Box 12. E-Mail and the Internet in Developing Countries'''
{{TextBox|To date, e-mail is the predominant and most important use of the Internet in developing countries. In Bangladesh, 82% of Internet use is attributed to e-mail, vis-à-vis 5% in the United States. The Web accounts for about 70% of Internet use in the U.S.51 This is due to the relatively high Internet access costs in most developing countries. However, the Internet is considered an inexpensive, although imperfect, alternative to the telephone or facsimile machine-i.e., it is inexpensive due to the higher speed of information transmission, and imperfect because it does not provide two-way communication in real time unlike the telephone.52
|}}

Many firms use the Internet to communicate with suppliers and customers only as a channel for maintaining business relationships. Once firms develop a certain level of confidence on the benefits of e-mail in the conduct of business transactions and the potential of creating sales from its use, they usually consider the option of developing their own Web site.

Studies commissioned by The Asia Foundation on the extent of ICT use among SMEs in the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia, show common use patterns, such as:

1. wide use of the Internet for e-mail because of the recognized cost and efficiency benefits;

2. use of Web sites more for promotion than for online sales or e-commerce, indicating that SMEs in these countries are still in the early stages of e-commerce;

3. common use of the Internet for basic research; and

4. inclination to engage more in offline transactions than in e-commerce because of security concerns.

SMEs go through different stages in adopting e-commerce. They start with creating a Web site primarily to advertise and promote the company and its products and services. When these firms begin generating traffic, inquiries and, eventually, sales through their Web sites, they are likely to engage in e-commerce.

:'''Box 13. Women and Global Web-Based Marketing: The Case of the Guyanan Weavers’ Cooperative'''
{{TextBox|The Guyanan Weavers’ Cooperative is an organization founded by 300 women from the Wapishana and Macushi tribes in Guyana, northern South America. The cooperative revived the ancient art of hammock weaving using 19th century accounts and illustrations of the hammocks made by European travelers and the cultivation of cotton on small family plots and hand-weaving. The organization then hired someone to create a Web site, which was instrumental in bringing their wares online. Not long after, in the mid-1990s, the group of weavers (the Rupununi Weavers Society) was able to sell hammocks to Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, the Smithsonian Institute, and the British Museum. Since 1998, they have sold about 20 hammocks through the Internet at $1,000 per piece. This case also shows that SMEs have great potential to compete in markets for high-end, bespoke products despite the low sales volume.|}}

In addition, many Web sites providing market and technical information, agronomic advice and risk management tools for SMEs (to coffee and tea farmers in developing countries, for example) have emerged.53

''What are the obstacles, problems and issues faced by SMEs in their use of ICT in business or in engaging in e-commerce?'' &lt;br&gt;

According to recent surveys conducted in select Southeast Asian countries, the perceived external barriers to e-commerce include the unfavorable economic environment, the high cost of ICT, and security concerns. The internal barriers are poor internal communications infrastructure within SME firms, lack of ICT awareness and knowledge as well as inadequacy of ICT-capable and literate managers and workers, insufficient financial resources, and the perceived lack of relevance or value-added of ICTs to their business.

In general, the main issues of concern that act as barriers to the increased uptake of information technology and e-commerce are the following:

* '''Lack of awareness and understanding of the value of e-commerce'''. Most SMEs in developing countries have not taken up e-commerce or use the Internet because they fail to see the value of e-commerce to their businesses. Many think e-commerce is suited only to big companies and that it is an additional cost that will not bring any major returns on investment.

* '''Lack of ICT knowledge and skills'''. People play a vital role in the development of e-commerce. However, technology literacy is still very limited in most developing countries. There is a shortage of skilled workers among SMEs, a key issue in moving forward with using information technology in business. There are also doubts about whether SMEs can indeed take advantage of the benefits of accessing the global market through the Internet, given their limited capabilities in design, distribution, marketing, and post-sale support. While the Internet can be useful in accessing international design expertise, SMEs are not confident that they can command a premium on the prices for their goods unless they offer product innovations. They can, however, capitalize on returns on the basis that they are the low cost providers.

Furthermore, more often than not, the premium in design has already been captured-for example, in the textile products industry-by the branded fashion houses. SMEs doubt whether Web presence will facilitate their own brand recognition on a global scale.54

* '''Financial costs'''. Cost is a crucial issue. The initial investment for the adoption of a new technology is proportionately heavier for small than for large firms. The high cost of computers and Internet access is a barrier to the uptake of e-commerce. Faced with budgetary constraints, SMEs consider the additional costs of ICT spending as too big an investment without immediate returns.

Many SMEs find marketing on the Internet expensive. Having a Web site is not equivalent to having a well-visited Web site. One reason is that there may be no critical mass of users. Another reason is the challenge of anonymity for SMEs. Because of the presence of numerous entrepreneurs in the Internet, it seems that brand recognition matters in order to be competitive. Moreover, it is not enough that a Web site is informative and user-friendly; it should also be updated frequently. Search engines must direct queries to the Web site, and news about the site must be broadly disseminated. Significantly, the experience of many OECD countries attests to the fact that the best e-marketing strategies are not better substitutes for the conventional form of media.55 One solution may be to encourage several SMEs to aggregate their information on a common Web site, which in turn would have the responsibility of building recognition/branding by hyperlinking or updating, for example.

* '''Infrastructure'''. The national network/physical infrastructure of many developing countries is characterized by relatively low teledensity, a major barrier to e-commerce. There are also relatively few main phone lines for business use among SMEs.

* '''Security'''. Ensuring security of payments and privacy of online transactions is key to the widespread acceptance and adoption of e-commerce. While the appropriate policies are in place to facilitate e-commerce, lack of trust is still a barrier to using the Internet to make online transactions. Moreover, credit card usage in many developing countries is still relatively low.56

Also, consumers are reluctant to use the Internet for conducting transactions with SMEs due to the uncertainty of the SMEs’ return policy and use of data.

* '''Other privacy- and security-related issues'''.57 While security is commonly used as the catch-all word for many different reasons why individuals and firms do not engage in extensive e-commerce and use of Internet-based technologies, there are other related reasons and unresolved issues, such as tax evasion, privacy and anonymity, fraud adjudication, and legal liability on credit cards. In many countries, cash is preferred not only for security reasons but also because of a desire for anonymity on the part of those engaged in tax evasion or those who simply do not want others to know where they are spending their money. Others worry that there is lack of legal protection against fraud (i.e., there is no provision for adjudicating fraud and there may be no legal limit on liability, say, for a lost or stolen credit card). It is necessary to distinguish these concerns from the general security concerns (i.e., transaction privacy, protection and security) since they may not be addressed by the employment of an effective encryption method (or other security measure).

== Is e-commerce helpful to the women sector? How has it helped in empowering women? ==

In general, the Internet and e-commerce have empowered sectors previously discriminated against. The Guyanan experience can attest to this.

Women have gained a foothold in many e-commerce areas. In B2C e-commerce, most success stories of women-empowered enterprises have to do with marketing unique products to consumers with disposable income. The consumers are found largely in developed countries, implying that there is a need for sufficient infrastructure for the delivery of products for the business to prosper and establish credibility. For example, if an enterprise can venture into producing digital goods such as music or software that can be transmitted electronically or if such goods can be distributed and/or delivered locally, then this is the option that is more feasible and practicable.

Aside from the Guyanan experience, there are many more successful cases of e-commerce ventures that the women sector can emulate. Some concrete examples are: Tortasperu.com ( http://www.tortasperu.com.pe), a business involving the marketing cakes in Peru run by women in several Peruvian cities; Ethiogift ( http://www.ethiogift.com), involving Ethiopians buying sheep and other gifts over the Internet to deliver to their families in other parts of the country, thereby dispensing with the physical delivery of goods abroad; and the Rural Women’s Association of the Northern Province of South Africa, which uses the Web to advertise its chickens to rich clients in Pietersburg.58

While most of the examples involve B2C e-commerce, it must be noted that women are already engaged in wholesale distribution businesses in developing countries. Thus, they can begin to penetrate B2B or B2G markets.

:'''Box 14. Women Empowerment in Bangladesh: The Case of the Grameen Village Phone Network'''
{{TextBox|The Grameen Village Phone Network is a classic example of women’s empowerment in Bangladesh. Operators of the village phones are all poor women (who have been selected for their clean and strong credit record). These village phones are regularly visited by members of male-dominated villages. Notably, the women entrepreneurs (village operators) enjoy wider discretion in expending their profits from their phone services than with their household income.

== What is the role of government in the development of e-commerce in developing countries? ==

While it is generally agreed that the private sector should take the lead role in the development and use of e-commerce, the government plays an instrumental role in encouraging e-commerce growth through concrete practicable measures such as:

1. Creating a favorable policy environment for e-commerce; and

2. Becoming a leading-edge user of e-commerce and its applications in its operations, and a provider to citizens of e-government services, to encourage its mass use.

''What is a favorable policy environment for e-commerce?'' &lt;br&gt;

Among the public policy issues in electronic commerce that governments should take heed of are:

* “bridging the digital divide” or promoting access to inexpensive and easy access to information networks;

* legal recognition of e-commerce transactions;

* consumer protection from fraud;

* protection of consumers’ right to privacy;

* legal protection against cracking (or unauthorized access to computer systems); and

* protection of intellectual property.

Measures to address these issues must be included in any country’s policy and legal framework for e-commerce. It is important that government adopt policies, laws and incentives that focus on promoting trust and confidence among e-commerce participants and developing a national framework that is compatible with international norms on e-commerce (covering for instance, contract enforcement, consumer protection, liability assignment, privacy protection, intellectual property rights, cross-border trade, and improvement of delivery infrastructure, among others59).

''How can government use e-commerce60?'' &lt;br&gt;

Government can use e-commerce in the following ways:

* '''E-procurement'''. Government agencies should be able to trade electronically with all suppliers using open standards-through ‘agency enablement’ programs, ‘supplier enablement’ programs, and e-procurement information systems.

* '''Customs clearance'''. With the computerization of customs processes and operations (i.e., electronic submission, processing and electronic payment; and automated systems for data entry to integrate customs tables, codes and pre-assessment), one can expect more predictable and more precise information on clearing time and delivery shipments, and increased legitimate revenues.

* '''Tax administration'''. This includes a system for electronic processing and transmission of tax return information, online issuances of tax clearances, permits, and licenses, and an electronic process registration of businesses and new taxpayers, among others.

More often than not, the e-commerce initiatives of government are a barometer indicating whether or not the infrastructure supports e-commerce use by private firms. This means that if government is unable to engage in e-procurement, secure records online, or have customs fees remitted electronically, then the private sector will also have difficulties in e-commerce uptake. Virtually, the benefits from e-commerce accrue to the government, as the experiences of some countries reflect.61

''Are existing legal systems sufficient to protect those engaged in e-commerce?'' &lt;br&gt;

Unfortunately, the existing legal systems in most developing countries are not sufficient to protect those engaged in e-commerce. For instance, with respect to contracts, existing laws were conceived at a time when the word “writing,” “document” and “signature” referred to things in paper form. On the other hand, in today’s electronic business transactions paper is not used for record-keeping or entering into contracts.

Another important and common legal issue faced by many developing countries is uncertainty regarding whether the courts will accept electronic contracts or documents and/or electronic signatures as evidence. One view is that the issue of admissibility of electronically generated evidence will not be resolved unless a law specifically referring to it is passed. This gap in existing legal systems has caused the emergence of at least two divergent views: one bordering on the conservative interpretation of the word “document” as to exclude non-paper-based ones; and the other involving a liberal construction, which allows electronic counterparts of documents.

In the ASEAN region, only three countries-Singapore (Singapore Electronic Transactions Act), Malaysia (Cyberlaws), and the Philippines (Philippine E-commerce Act)-have a legal framework for e-commerce. These frameworks provide for the legal recognition of electronic documents and signatures and penalize common crimes and offenses committed in cyberspace.

''What other relevant policy issues should be addressed?'' &lt;br&gt;

Other policy issues concern basic prerequisites of infrastructure for successful e-commerce, as follows:

'''1. Telecoms pricing and performance''' &lt;br&gt;

One of the aims of telecommunications policy and legislation should be to ensure that the public has access to basic telecommunications services at a reasonable cost. The goal should ultimately be ''universal accessor'' widespread access to reliable information and communication services at a reasonable cost and its availability at a reasonable distance.

To enhance the quality of telecommunications services, policies should encourage:

* '''open access''', which refers to the absence of non-competitive practices by network providers;

* '''open architecture''', which pertains to the design of a system that facilitates interconnection among different systems and services currently and as they develop over time; and

* '''flexible access''', which pertains to interconnected and interoperable networks of telecommunications, broadcasting, and electronic publishing, where the format will be digital and the bandwidth will be adjusted according to the demands of the user and the character of communications.62

'''2. Quality and speed of distribution logistics (i.e., roads and bridges)'''&lt;br&gt;

Roads and bridges, especially in developing countries, still form part of the e-commerce infrastructure. Very few goods are delivered over the information infrastructure or the Internet (the exceptions are music and software). Most of the goods purchased over the Internet are still delivered the conventional way (i.e., physical delivery). Hence, poor roads and bridges, inefficient transport systems, coupled with the high cost of international parcel services and bureaucratic customs clearance processes, are major obstacles in the uptake of e-commerce in developing countries.63 Government should therefore create a policy environment that will:

* encourage investments in the national physical and transport infrastructure; and
* provide for electronic customs clearance processing to streamline the bureaucracy and allow for more transparent, predictable and efficient customs operations.

Both of these will contribute to the reduction of distribution and logistics costs.

''How can government intervene in the promotion and development of e-commerce among SMEs?'' &lt;br&gt;

The following are the more relevant areas for government intervention with respect to SME uptake of e-commerce:64

'''E-SME Development'''. The market ultimately drives e-commerce development, but it is the private sector that fuels it. Government can provide incentives to encourage widespread e-commerce use by SMEs. An “e-SME development program” in which various sectors can provide technical assistance to SMEs to promote e-commerce uptake, can also be developed. Banks, financial lending and training institutions, and corporations should be encouraged to develop “SME desks” that will address the specific needs of SMEs. In particular, steps should be taken to:

* provide incentives to individuals to become entrepreneurs by lowering borrowing rates;
* provide incentives to SMEs that intend to use e-commerce in their business operations;
* broaden credit extension facilities to SMEs in order for them to use ICT and e-commerce; and
* offer discounts on business solution software packages and software licenses.

Moreover, big businesses and corporations should be encouraged to transfer technology to SMEs by offering them free training in ICT and e-commerce.

'''Awareness Campaign'''. Evidence suggests that SMEs have insufficient knowledge of information technology and e-commerce. Many SMEs have identified their lack of knowledge of technology as one of the main barriers to using e-commerce. Government and private sector partnerships can engage in a campaign to disseminate information to SMEs about e-commerce policies, best practices, success stories, and opportunities and obstacles relating to the use of ICTs and e-commerce. These awareness campaigns could include free training courses and workshops on e-commerce, security and privacy, awards programs, and information centers to assist SMEs. Ultimately, this information campaign should come in the form of an overall e-commerce development strategy for the economy, focusing on its various innovative applications for SMEs.

'''E-Government'''. Government should be the lead-user of e-commerce if various business and private-sector related activities are to be prompted to move online. In effect, government becomes a positive influence. E-government can take the form of various online transactions such as company registration, taxation, applications for a variety of employee- and business-related requirements, and the like.

'''Network Infrastructure and Localization of Content'''. A developed national information infrastructure is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for e-commerce uptake of SMEs. Without reliable and inexpensive telecommunications and other information services, SMEs will not be able to go online. An important strategy in this regard is the construction of “telecenters” or electronic community centers that would serve as a community-shared access and connectivity platform especially in the rural areas (e.g., an electronic agri-information center which provides market information to farmers in rural areas). These telecenters can also be a venue for capacity building, skills enhancement, training, communications and content development.65 Government can also adopt agglomerative approaches to Internet use to reduce costs (e.g., export aggregators, such as B2B or B2C portals/exchanges for SMEs, which will facilitate trading with fellow SMEs and with other companies in the international market).

'''Strengthening Consumer Protection'''. Among the more common trust-related issues that SMEs take note of in considering whether to engage in e-commerce are: where and how payment takes place (whether real or virtual); when settlement takes place (before, during or after the transaction); who settles; whether the transaction is B2B or B2C; and whether settlement can be traced. Generally, however, among e-commerce users in developing countries, including SMEs, there is very low willingness to provide sensitive financial information over the Internet.66 On the other hand, consumers have reservations about transacting with SMEs through the Internet due to the lack of a clear policy on returns and use of data. To address this concern, government can encourage companies/ SMEs to make their privacy policy explicit in their Web sites.

A more comprehensive measure that government can undertake to ensure security in e-commerce transactions is the establishment of a Certification Authority, which verifies seller and buyer identities, examines transactions and security procedures, and issues digital certificates to those who are able to meet the set security standards. A good example of this government effort is Singapore’s Certification Authority, Netrust. This suggestion does not to discount the importance of private-driven security solutions such as Web sites like Hypermart, which host and build storefronts for SMEs while providing them a common system for secure payments.68

:'''Box. 15. Data Protection and Transaction Security'''
{{TextBox|Transaction security pertains to three important components and related issues, namely:

* Transaction Privacy, which means that transactions must be held private and intact, with unauthorized users unable to understand the message content;

* Transaction Confidentiality, implying that traces of transactions must be dislodged from the public network and that absolutely no intermediary is permitted to hold copies of the transaction unless authorized to do so; and

* Transaction Integrity, which pertains to the importance of protecting transactions from unlawful interference-i.e., transactions must be kept unaltered and unmodified. In an open network like the Internet, it seems difficult to ensure these. There are, however, technological solutions that seek to address these security concerns. These solutions usually come in the form of authorization schemes, i.e., programs that make sure that only authorized users can gain access to information resources such as user accounts, files, and databases. Typical examples of authorization schemes are: password protection, encrypted smart cards, biometrics (e.g., fingerprinting, iris-scanning), and firewalls.67 A firewall is a system of cryptographic methods supported by perimeter guards to ensure the safe arrival and storage of information and its protection from internal and external threats. The most common data and transaction and data security scheme is encryption, which involves a set of secret codes that defends sensitive information crossing over online public channels. It makes information indecipherable except to those with a decryption/decoding key.
|}}

Government can also provide guidelines for SMEs in the development of a system of collaborative ratings, which these entrepreneurs can display on their Web sites not only to inform but also to assure their consumers of security. For instance, in electronic exchanges, customers should be able to rate suppliers in terms of quality of product or service and speed of delivery, among others. To minimize fraud, certain safeguards should be built into the rating system like imposing the requirement of presenting evidence of purchase before one’s rating can count, with ratings of regular customers having more weight. Trends in ratings and comments should be made readily available to all users. SMEs should also be encouraged through appropriate government incentive schemes to participate in internationally accredited Web-based online rating schemes.69

Government can also design and establish a legal and judiciary framework that provides for minimum standards of and requirements for transparency, impartiality and timeliness. While in many developing countries this may be a very ambitious goal, in the medium term SMEs may use self-regulated codes of conduct covering, for example, return policy, data protection, and acceptable forms of content, that are applicable within associations, cooperatives or their respective groups of peers and e-entrepreneurs.70 It is important to have not only a rating system but also an enforcement regime that people trust.

'''Human Resources Development'''. The government can initiate pilot projects and programs for capability-building, training and e-commerce support services, such as Web design. In Kenya, for instance, the youth from Nairobi’s slums are being trained in Web design skills.

In general, government initiatives should be in line with current efforts in the foregoing areas of concern. Coordination with development cooperation agencies is important to avoid any duplication of initiatives and efforts.</text>

== Foreword ==

Since its origins over 30 years ago, the Internet has become a major new global telecommunications infrastructure. It is no wonder, then, that it has become a central topic in the more general discussion being held under the auspices of the Information Society. A World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was first held in December 2003 in Geneva. At that Summit, a number of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were discussed, focused on harnessing Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for the benefit of the world’s population. The Internet, seen as a prototype for the technologies that would underlie the Information Society, understandably became a focal point (and a flashpoint) of discussions. Ultimately, in response to debates over the concept of “Internet governance”, a Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) was established, with the objective of defining the term and providing input to the second phase of the World Summit, planned for Tunis in November 2005. The Working Group released its report on 18 July 2005 and offered a definition of Internet governance as well as some options for approaches to it. The primer you have before you is intended to provide background on the Internet and its operation as a contribution to the dialogue underway in preparation for the next Summit.

The Internet is a global, distributed system of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of independently operated and interconnected computer communication networks. All of these networks use a standard set of protocols, sometimes referred to as the TCP/IP protocol suite. TCP and IP are the core protocols of the Internet and had their origins in research sponsored by the US Defense Advanced Research Agency in 1973. It is a system that, by design, is relatively insensitive to national boundaries.

For most of its existence, the Internet has been developed in the private sector with very light oversight on the part of the US Government. The official roll-out of the system occurred on 1 January 1983 in the US and at locations in the UK and Norway. By 1994, the Internet was becoming available to the public through commercial networks, and by 1995, a collection of commercial, interconnected public Internet backbones had replaced the private, US Government-sponsored backbone. The scene was set for the so-called “dot-com boom” of the late 1990s. During this period, massive amounts of capital went into “Internet” companies, many of them bereft of serious business models other than a plan to go public. By April 2000, the bubble had burst. But the Internet continued to grow, even during the financial winter following the madness. Amidst the hyperbole, some very successful Internet businesses thrived or were born (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Google). Not counting early research in the 1970s, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) arrived in 1993 but did not really take off until 10 years later, threatening to disrupt the century-old business model of the local and inter-exchange carriers. As the network and its applications became more widespread, and as the global economy began to rely upon its operation, governments began to realize that this new infrastructure, and what was done with it, might be tactically and strategically important to the well-being of their citizens.

The Government of Tunisia called for the second phase of WSIS, not focused solely on the Internet, but on the more general notion of a global economy interlinked in a web of information and the ability to process it with powerful, programmable and often portable tools. As the discussions unfolded in Geneva in 2003 and in regional fora, debates ensued as to the meaning of “governance” in this online environment. Particular focus was placed on Internet governance and the role that the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) plays in that arena.

In the course of the WSIS debates, there have been calls for increased governmental oversight and even regulation of the Internet. It is important to recall that this is a network of hundreds of thousands of networks, not a single entity run by a single organization. It has operating components around the world. It has over a billion users. It is, by design, distributed and its components operated by a vast range of government, private sector and academic organizations. Few would dispute the importance of the Internet and its content to a wide swath of modern society. It is therefore vital that in the debates surrounding the perceived abuses of the Internet, we do not destroy all that is so beneficial in this system of systems.

One of the central reasons for the Internet’s success thus far has been its largely apolitical management. It seems important that any modifications to the general oversight and operation of the Internet avoid unnecessary and disruptive politicization. The Internet should remain a key infrastructure and not become a political football, subject to disputes between or among countries. We should build on the existing systems and bodies that have thus far served the Internet community with reasonable success. With few exceptions, most of the public policy issues associated with the Internet lie outside the purview of ICANN and can and should be addressed in different venues. For example, ‘spam’ and its instant messaging and Internet telephony relatives, ‘spim’ and ‘spit’, are pernicious practices that may only be successfully addressed through legal means, although there are some technical measures that can be undertaken by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and end users to filter out the unwanted messages. Similarly fraudulent practices such as ‘phishing’ and ‘pharming’ may best be addressed through legal means. Intellectual property protection may, in part, be addressed through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and business disputes through the World Trade Organization (WTO) or through alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation and arbitration.

As these examples suggest, there can be little doubt that the development of a global Information Society will require extraordinary cooperation, collaboration and coordination. The Internet and its many players illustrate this observation and draw attention to what is possible when a spirit of cooperation can be fostered in the long term.

Only through understanding the full range of players in the Internet arena, their roles, responsibilities, authorities and limits of capabilities can we fashion reasonable outcomes for Internet governance and, more generally, an agenda for the development of an Information Society. This primer represents contributions towards the dialogue that is needed to frame Information Society goals and the methods to achieve them. The participants in these dialogues have an opportunity to help shape a constructive approach to the opportunities before us. We can but hope that they will take up the challenge and pursue the MDGs in a positive and successful fashion.

== Preface to the First Edition ==

At the start of 2005, there were an estimated 750 million Internet users worldwide. This figure is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, home to over half the world’s population. In fact, the Asia-Pacific region already contributes a larger share of users (about one-third of the total) than either North America or Europe.

Inevitably, such numbers will have a profound impact on the structure and use of the Internet. In turn, this impact will have a transformative effect on development around the world. Making the Internet work for sustainable human development, therefore, requires policies and interventions that are responsive to the needs of all countries. It requires a strong voice from different stakeholders and their constructive engagement in the policy-making processes related to Internet governance.

Achieving these goals is a challenge, especially for developing countries who participate in the governance process at a disadvantage. Most of the foundational rules of the Internet are already well-established, or under long-term negotiation. Newcomers to the Internet have had little opportunity to generate awareness among stakeholder groups, mobilize the required policy expertise and coordinate strategies for effective engagement.

Developing countries are further challenged by the global nature of the Internet, which means that many areas of governance require cooperation at the global level, often in fora dominated by the developed world. Furthermore, participating in conferences and meetings at these fora is often expensive, or otherwise difficult for stakeholders from developing countries.

In sum, the continuing march of Internet governance threatens to leave behind developing countries. Fortunately, such an outcome is not inevitable. The Open Regional Dialogue on Internet Governance (ORDIG) is a response to this threat, and an attempt to transform the challenges of governance into an opportunity. Since October 2004, ORDIG has gathered and analyzed perspectives and priorities through an extensive multi-stakeholder and participatory process that has involved more than 3,000 people in the Asia-Pacific region. This represents the first step in greater involvement by the region, and particularly by traditionally under-represented nations.

ORDIG activities thus far have included a regional online discussion forum involving more than 180 participants; a multilingual survey on Internet governance that collected 1,243 responses from 37 countries; a series of sub-regional consultations; and a variety of research on various topics and issues such as access costs, voice over Internet protocol, root servers, country code top-level domains, internationalized domain names, IP address management, content pollution, and cybercrime.

Based on these activities and research, ORDIG has produced a report entitled, “Voices from Asia-Pacific: Internet Governance Priorities and Recommendations”, which was considered by the High Level Asia-Pacific Conference for WSIS in Tehran, 31 May-2 June 2005, and was tabled at the Fourth Meeting of the UN Working Group on Internet Governance in Geneva in June 2005.

This primer is another important output. It is designed to help all stakeholders (government, private sector and civil society) gain quick access to basic facts, concepts and priority issues, laying the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of Internet governance issues from a distinctively Asia-Pacific perspective.

We welcome and encourage feedback from any constituency in the Asia-Pacific region. For more information on ORDIG, please visit the online knowledge portal at www.igov.apdip.net or contact &lt;info@igov.apdip.net.&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic interpreter scans a line of code before executing it, so that the calculator won't freeze or worse..
If it encounters an error, it will stop executing the code, and tell you that an error occurred.
It even tells you what kind of error it was, and in some cases there is an option that will take you to the error.

In TI-basic, error messages occur for a number of reasons.

1. Incorrect code
2. Not enough memory
3. Overflow
4. Non-real answers (negative root) 

INCORRECT CODE
The calculator says

''ERR:SYNTAX
1.QUIT
2.GOTO
'' 

Or

''ERR:ARGUMENT
1.QUIT
2.GOTO''

Option one quits from the program and returns you to the home screen.

Option two is more interesting; It takes you to the line of the program where the error occurred,
So you can go fix it!

'''Hazelnut Tort'''

==Ingredients==

* 10 [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg whites]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|caster sugar]]
* 200g (7oz) [[Cookbook:Hazelnut|hazelnut meal]]
* 250ml (8 fluid oz) [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Coffee|instant coffee powder]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Chocolate|cocoa powder]]

==Procedure==

# Pre-heat oven to Very Hot.
# Beat egg whites with electric mixer till stiff. During mixing, add caster sugar in small amounts to make sure it dissolves into egg. 
# Once mixture forms stiff peaks, gently fold in the hazelnut meal.
# Line a lamington or slice tray (approximately 40cm X 25cm) with foil. Spread mix evenly into tray. Do not bang the tray - it is important to keep as much air in the cake as possible.
# Once cake is in oven, immediately turn temperature down to 180°C (350°F). Bake for 20 minutes, or until cake is sealed and springs back when touched lightly with finger.
# Allow cake to cool in the tray. Cake should only be about an inch high.
# Once cooled, cut cake into 3 equal sections to be stacked on top of each other. 
# In a bowl, dissolve coffee and cocoa into cream. Once dissolved, whip cream until stiff. 
# Layer cream between the sections of cake to make a log. Decorate top with extra cream.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Cake is best made the day before serving to allow the flavors to mature.

'''Dog training''' is the process of teaching a [[dog]] to exhibit certain desired behaviours in specific circumstances. Some examples are:

*Teaching a dog basic obedience commands (part of [[obedience training]])
*Teaching a dog to perform tricks casually or for [[circus]] acts
*Teaching a [[guide dog]] to lead a [[blindness|blind]] person
*Teaching a [[rescue dog]] to find victims of a [[disaster]]
*Helping a [[hunting dog]] learn to perform its instinctive behaviours at appropriate times

The specific behaviours taught in each case are different, but the underlying principles are similar. 

In the wild as [[pack (canine)|pack]] animals, canines have natural instincts that favour training. These instincts are manifested when the dog lives with humans as a desire to please a handler, as a dog would please senior members in a pack in the wild.   The '''handler''' is simply whoever is working with a dog at the time.

==Basic training==
Most dogs, no matter their eventual advanced training or intended purpose, live with people and therefore must behave in a way that makes them pleasant to have around and for their own safety and that of other people and [[pet]]s.  Dogs do not figure out basic obedience on their own; it must be trained.  

The hardest part of this process is communicating with your dog clearly, in a  way that he understands.    Communication is possible by praising positive behavior while ignoring or correcting negative behavior.  

&quot;Correction&quot; should never include harmful physical force or violence (i.e., no rolled up newspaper) because even if it makes the dog stop the behavior in the short term, it will make your dog fear you rather than want to make you happy by doing what you ask.  

===Puppies and Learning===

The prenatal period is a recent addition to the developmental periods of puppies.  It is thought that “long-term effects on behavioral development may also be produced in some mammals by events occurring in utero.”  (Serpell, 1995, p. 80)  Previous studies tended to overlook the existence of this period, since the puppy’s behavior could not be observed.  With the development of the ultrasound machine, a puppy could be observed within the mother as early as the fourth week of gestation.  

It was found that puppies would react to touch and/or pressure from the outside of the mother’s abdomen.  In addition, it is theorized that since puppies have such a well-developed sense of touch at birth, the sense of touch would also be well-developed before birth.  Puppies may be sensitive to touch received by the mother while still unborn.  Studies have found that “when a pregnant animal is petted her litter is more docile (Denenberg and Whimbey 1963, in Fox 1978).”  According to Fox (1975, in Fox 1978) this facilitates relaxation, emotional attachment, and socialization as well.  Other studies have indicated that puppies that receive outside contact (petting of the mother) while in utero have a higher tolerance for touching than puppies who receive no contact at all.  One could deduce that gentle petting of the mother’s abdomen could help to facilitate positive, beneficial puppy socialization with people. 

During the first two weeks of a puppy's life, also known as the neonate period, puppies can learn simple associations.  (Serpell, 1995)  However, early experience events are unlikely to carry over into later periods.  Studies indicate that puppies in the neonate period do not seem to learn by experience. (Scott and Fuller, 1965)  It is theorized that this is due to the fact that the puppy’s brain, sense, and motor organs are still undeveloped.  Based on its limited capacity to sense and learn it would be difficult to affect the puppy psychologically, either in a positive or negative sense.  (Scott and Fuller, 1965)

The next period of development is known as the socialization period.  This is arguably the most important developmental period, beginning around 3 weeks (21 days) old, and ending around 12 weeks old. (Beaver, 1999)  The biggest aspect of this period is social play.  Social investigation (curiosity), playful fighting and playful sexual behavior (body contact) is very important to developing social relationships during its life. (Scott and Fuller, 1965)  New behavior patterns are directly influenced by the puppy’s interaction with its mother and other puppies in the litter.

This is a time for developing social relationships, both among other puppies as well as with people.  These behaviors are relatively easy for any individual who stays with the puppies during this period.  However, there is a point where the puppies can develop a fear of strangers.  At 3-5 weeks of age, puppies will actively approach strangers.  Shortly thereafter stranger avoidance begins and slowly escalates until it peaks around 12-14 weeks of age. (Beaver, 1999)  While this natural fear of strangers could serve as a way to keep a curious puppy away from predators, it can also hinder normal relationships with people.  

During this period, startle reactions to sudden movement and sounds is now present.  This serves to help the puppy learn to differentiate between which events are dangerous, and which events are safe or insignificant.  (Scott and Fuller, 1965) During the socialization period, the development of attachment to certain locations occurs.  This is displayed by an extreme disturbance in the puppy whenever a change in location occurs.   This is known as “localization”.  (Serpell, 1995)   “Localization” often peaks in puppies between 6-7 weeks old (Scott and Fuller, 1965), and then tapers off after that time to the point where a change in location is no longer distressing to the puppy.

Dogs that are handled and petted by humans regularly during the first eight weeks of life are generally much more amenable to being trained and living in human households. Ideally, puppies should be placed in their permanent homes between about 8 and 10 weeks of age. In some places it is against the law to take puppies away from their mothers before the age of 8 weeks. Before this age, puppies are still learning tremendous amounts of socialization skills from their mother. Puppies are innately more fearful of new things during the period from 10 to 12 weeks, which makes it harder for them to adapt to a new home. 

Puppies can begin learning tricks and commands as early as 8 weeks of age; the only limitations are the pup's stamina, concentration, and physical coordination. It is much easier to live with young dogs that have already learned basic commands such as ''sit''.  Waiting until the puppy is older and has already learned undesirable habits makes the training much more challenging.  (Beaver, 1999; Lindsay, 2000; Scott and Fuller 1965; Serpell 1995)

===Basic training classes===
Professional &quot;dog trainers&quot; usually do not train the dogs, but actually train the ''owners'' on how to train their own dogs. Although it is also possible to send a dog away to a training school, the owner still must at some point learn what the dog has learned and how to use and reinforce the techniques.  Some call this a shortcut, but plenty of work is still required and training must continue over the course of the dog's life.  Owners and dogs who attend class together have an opportunity to learn more about each other and how to work together under a trainer's guidance. Training is most effective if everyone who handles the dog takes part in the training to ensure consistent commands, methods, and enforcement.  Classes also help socialize your dog to other people and dogs.  Ask your vet or the owner of a well behaved dog for recommendations in your area.

Formal training in classes is not always available until the puppy has completed all its vaccinations at around 4 months; however, some trainers offer puppy socialization classes in which puppies can enroll immediately after being placed in their permanent homes as long as disease risk is minimal and puppies have received initial vaccinations. In most cases, basic training classes accept only puppies who are at least 3 to 6 months old.

==Communicating with the dog==
Fundamentally, dog training is about communication. From the human perspective the handler is communicating to the dog what behaviors are correct, desired, or preferred in what circumstances. From the canine perspective the handler must communicate what behaviors will give the dog the most satisfaction to his natural instincts and emotions.  Without that inner satisfaction a dog will not work well.

A successful handler must also understand the communication that the dog sends to the handler. The dog can signal that he is unsure, confused, nervous, happy, excited, and so on. The emotional state of the dog is an important consideration in directing the training, as a dog that is stressed or distracted will not learn efficiently. 

According to Learning Theory there are four important messages that the handler can send the dog:
; Reward or release marker: Correct behavior. You have earned a reward. For example, &quot;Free&quot; or &quot;Okay&quot; followed by a reward. 
; Keep going signal: Correct behavior. Continue and you will earn a reward. For example, &quot;Good&quot;.
; No reward marker: Incorrect behavior. Try something else. For example, &quot;Uh-uh&quot; or &quot;Try again&quot;.
; Punishment marker: Incorrect behavior. You have earned punishment. For example, &quot;No&quot; or more specific commands like &quot;off,&quot; &quot;out,&quot; or &quot;leave it.&quot;

Using '''consistent''' signals or words for these messages enables the dog to understand them more quickly. If the handler sometimes says &quot;good&quot; as a reward marker and sometimes as a keep going signal, it is difficult for the dog to know when he has earned a reward. 

It is important to note that the dog's reward is not the same as the reward marker.  The reward marker is a signal that tell the dog that he has earned the reward.  Many novice dog owners make the mistake of using effusive verbal praise as both a reward marker ''and'' a reward, which can confuse dog and owner. 

Rewards can be praise, treats, play, or anything that the dog finds rewarding. Failure to reward after the reward marker diminishes the value of the reward marker and makes training more difficult.

These four messages do not have to be communicated with words, and nonverbal signals are often used. In particular, mechanical [[clicker]]s are frequently used for the reward marker. Hand signals and body language also play an important part in learning for dogs.  The meanings of the four signals are taught to the dog through repetition, so that he may form an association by classical conditioning.  For example, if the handler consistently gives the dog a reward marker immediately before he gives the dog a food treat, the dog soon will learn to associate the reward marker with receiving something pleasant (clicker trainers call forming this association &quot;charging up&quot; the clicker).  Likewise, if the dog is always given a punishment marker before he is scolded or put outside for bad behaviour, he will soon learn to associate the punishment marker with the punishment itself.

Dogs usually do not generalize commands easily; that is, a dog who has learned a command in a particular location and situation may not immediately recognize the command to other situations.  A dog who knows how to &quot;down&quot; in the living room may suffer genuine confusion if asked to &quot;down&quot; at the park or in the car.  The command will need to be retaught in each new situation, though it may be substantially easier after being taught at home where there are fewer distractions. This is sometimes called &quot;cross-contextualization,&quot; meaning the dog has to apply what's been learned to many different contexts.

==Reward and punishment==
Most training revolves around giving the dog consequences for his behaviour, in the hope of influencing the behaviour the dog will exhibit in the future.  [[Operant conditioning]] defines four types of consequences:

'''Positive reinforcement''' adds something to the situation to increase the chance of the behaviour being exhibited again  (for example, giving a dog a treat when he sits.) 

'''Negative reinforcement''' removes something from the situation to increase the chance of the behaviour being exhibited again (for example, releasing the tension on an uncomfortable training collar when the dog stops pulling on the leash).

'''Positive punishment''' adds something to the situation to decrease the chance of the behaviour being exhibited again (for example, verbally growling at a dog to make it stop jumping up).

'''Negative punishment''' removes something from the situation to decrease the chance of the behaviour being exhibited again (for example, walking away from a dog who jumps up).

Most modern trainers say that they use &quot;positive training methods&quot;, which is a different meaning of the word &quot;positive&quot; from that in operant conditioning. &quot;Positive training methods&quot; generally means preferring the use of reward-based training to increase good behavior over that of physical punishment to decrease bad behavior. However, a good trainer understands all four methods, whether or not they can put operant-conditioning terminology to them, and applies them as appropriate for the dog, the breed, the handler, and the situation.

===Rewards===
Positive reinforcers can be anything that the dog finds rewarding - special food treats, the chance to play with a tug toy, social interaction with other dogs, or the owners attention.  The more rewarding a dog finds a particular reinforcer, the more work he will be prepared to do in order to obtain the reinforcer.

It is important that the dog is not &quot;bribed&quot; to perform.  In dog training, the term &quot;bribery&quot; means that the dog is aware of the presence of the reward before he is asked to complete the command.  The risk with bribery is that the dog will refuse to comply with commands when he cannot see the reward, since he knows from experience that he will only be rewarded when he can see the reward.  Experienced trainers will hide the reward from the dog, and only produce the reward once the dog has already complied with the command.  The goal is to produce a dog who will perform even on occasions that the handler has no reward to offer, since the dog's training has taught him that the handler may have a reward even if the dog cannot see it.

Some trainers go through a process of teaching a puppy to strongly desire a particular toy, in order to make the toy a more powerful positive reinforcer for good behaviour.  This process is called &quot;building prey drive&quot;, and is commonly used in the training of Narcotics Detection and Police Service dogs.  The goal is to produce a dog who will work independently for long periods of time, in the hopes of earning access to its special toy reward.  

===Punishments===
Positive punishment is probably the consequence that is least understood and commonly misused by modern dog trainers, as it must be used very carefully.     

Punishments are administered only as appropriate for the dog's personality, age, and experience.  A sharp '''No''' works for many dogs, but some dogs even show signs of fear or anxiety even with mild verbal corrections.  Punishment must never involve hitting as this creates fear of other forms of contact. The use of &quot;Alpha rolls&quot; and similar techniques should never be used.

===Avoiding punishment===
Keeping a puppy on a leash in challenging situations or in his crate or pen when not closely supervised prevents the puppy from getting into situations that might otherwise invite an owner's harsh reaction (such as chewing up a favorite pair of shoes).

==The command voice==

&lt;!-- This article uses the convention of '''bolding''' all command words, omitting &quot;quotes&quot; and exclamation points --&gt;
When giving commands to a dog,  a calm, firm, authoritative voice is most effective. Dogs do not respond well to hesitant, pleading voices, nor to yelling, which might sound to the dog like threatening barking or scolding. It is also important that the word used for the command and the pitch of the voice be consistent each time the command is delivered so that the dog can more easily learn what the owner means ('''siiiiiiiiiiiit''' does not sound the same as '''sit''', for example).

Using the puppy's name before a command ensures that the dog knows that a command is coming, that it is for him (rather than for other dogs, children, or people), and that he should pay attention. This is important because dogs hear a lot of human speech that has no relevance for them at all, and it is easy for them to disregard commands amongst the babble. 

To reinforce the command, the dog always gets some kind of reward or reinforcement (praise and usually  a treat or toy) when it performs the action correctly. This helps the dog to understand that he has done a good thing.  

Note that not all dogs are trained to voice command. Many [[working dog|working breeds of dog]] are not trained to a voice command at all; they are taught to obey a combination of whistles and hand signals. Deaf dogs are perfectly capable of learning to obey visual signals alone.  Many obedience classes teach hand signals for common commands in addition to voice signals; these signals can be useful in quiet situations, at a distance, and in advanced obedience competitions.

The specific command words are not important, although common words in English include '''sit''', '''down''', '''come''', and '''stay'''. Short, clear words that are easily understood by other humans are generally recommended;  that way, people will understand what a handler is telling his dog to do and other handlers have a good chance of controlling someone else's dog if necessary.  In fact, dogs can learn commands in any language or other communications medium, including whistles, mouth sounds, hand gestures, and so forth.

==Training tricks==  
Many dog owners teach their dogs tricks. This serves several purposes: Develops a stronger relationship between the dog and human; provides entertainment; and engages the dog's mind, which can help to alleviate problems caused by boredom. For example, the '''shake hands''' trick involves the dog raising its paw and placing it into an outstretched hand. An example of a useful trick is teaching a dog to ring a bell to go outside. This helps prevent the stress placed on an owner when trying to recognize whether the dog needs to relieve itself. For more information, see [[clicker training]] or [[bridge and target]] training.

Many habits can come up with different dogs. Begging at dinner should not be seen. Don't pay attention to your dog at dinner time, and your dog will notice that you won't give them food.

==Shock Training==

One of the most controversial training methods involves using a &quot;remote training collar&quot;, otherwise known as an &quot;e-collar&quot; or &quot;shock collar&quot;.

These have been banned in a number of countries and are considered inhumane by the majority of companion animal welfare and rescue charities.  Such devices are designed to cause a painful experience similar to other forms of positive punishment like hitting or slapping. There is scientific evidence that these collars may produce persistent negative associations that result in anxiety.

==Teething==
At anywhere from three to six months of age, a puppy begins to get its adult set of teeth. This period can be quite painful and many owners do not recognize the natural need to chew.  By providing specific chew toys designed to ease the pain of teething (such as a frozen nylon bone), attention can be diverted from table legs and other furniture. Many people also use a bad-tasting, bad-smelling spray on favorite items, such as shoes, furniture, or even wallpaper,  to discourage chewing. [[Bitter apple]] is a commonly used spray, but there are several commercial sprays available. Different sprays work better for different applications, owners, or puppies.

==Specialized training==
Dogs are also trained for specific purposes, including:
*[[Detection dog]]s
*[[Assistance dog]]s
*[[Herding dog]]s, [[livestock guardian dog]]s, and [[sheep dog]]s
*[[Hunting dog]]s
*[[Police dog]]s
*[[Rescue dog]]s
*[[Schutzhund]] German training method/sport

===Guard animals===
{{sect-stub|Guard animals}}
Due to dogs' natural social structure, which is territorial/protective of companions, even non-trained companion animals will exhibit some form of alert behaviors toward intruders.  However true guard dogs and police dogs are dedicated animals in the sense that they are not simultaneously intended to be companion animals.

Guard dogs are defined as canines who either by training, or by instinct, protect either property, persons or objects.  A well-trained guard dog protects person, property or objects on command and &quot;turns-off&quot; on command as well.  Properly trained animals will guard on command and then when commanded to &quot;out&quot; will approach and accept in a friendly manner those that may have attempted to gain entry, cause harm, or steal protected items. 

There are several methods regarding the training of guard animals, western (e.g. Koehler Method) and eastern, and certain breeds are typically used in this capacity.  The [[Schutzhund]] method also contains a portion relating to protection, and generally means the animal will bite on command, and will not release until commanded.

In some circumstances, when dogs are left alone to guard property it may be necessary to train them to not eat treats or other food items offered by unknown persons.  Positive punishment can include electric shocks related to attempting to eat food other than in the designated food receptacle, or from a designated individual or individuals.

===Service animals===
[[Assistance dog]]s, such as [[Guide dog|guide]] and [[hearing dog]]s, are carefully trained to utilize both their sensory skills and the protective instincts of dogs (as pack animals) to bond with a human and help that person to offset a disability in daily life. The use of assistance dogs is an every-growing field, with wide range of special adaptations.

[[User:Tintina|Tintina]] 03:04, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

I think this a great start on the topic of Dog Training, but as the topic is both broad and general, I believe the treatment of it, so far presented, is not a NPOV. 

Dog Training is an umbrella, composed of many facets(some noted), including Basic Obedience training.


I suggest that the existing content be retitled as Positive Only Dog Training and presented as chapter under the general title Dog Training, or retitled as a stand alone on Positive Only Dog Training, otherwise it necessitates heavy editing . The simplest solution is to rework it into a chapter or retitle it.

All opinions on what methods are outdated, humane , etc. are opinions. 
The existing text implies that this is the standard in training which is simply not accurate. It is directly misleading the reader who is expecting an unbiased text.


[[User:Tintina|Tintina]] 02:48, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

&quot;Wikibooks has a strict neutral point of view (NPOV) policy, which basically states that its mission as a book collection is best served not by advancing or detracting particular points of view on any given subject, but by trying to present a fair, neutral description of the facts -- among which are the facts that various interpretations and points of view exist. (Of course, there are limits to what POVs are considered worth mentioning, which can be an area of conflict.)

Consequently, modules should be written from a neutral point of view, which means that modules should represent differing views on a subject fairly and within the context particular to the Wikibook's scope (in other words, if the scope of the Wikibook is the consensus view of physics, then non-mainstream views on this subject are almost always irrelevant; but competing mainstream views can and should be presented).

&quot;Neutral point of view&quot; should not be confused with &quot;point of view espoused by an international body such as the United Nations&quot;; writing in NPOV style requires recognising that even widely held or widely respected points of view are not necessarily all-encompassing.&quot;

.......................................
I'm certainly not claiming any of this as the last word, but I thought we needed an article on dog training, so I did this brain dump.  Please feel free to add or subtract as you think appropriate.  The ''training techniques'' in particular are very skimpy.  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]] 06:37, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:Not a bad start at all. This article really needed writing. I kept thinking about doing it myself, but I am no good at writing full articles. A couple of things I think need some attention: 
*the article in general has a slight POV feel to me for some reason, but I can't point to anything specific... it might just be me though...
*breaking of the &quot;[[fourth wall]]&quot; isn't real good
:[[User:Lachatdelarue|Lachatdelarue [[User talk:Lachatdelarue|(talk)]]]] 16:08, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

The POV all comes from my dog.  I'm as neutral as can be.  Seriously, most of it probably comes because I was trying to avoid the term ''owner'', which left me with only ''master'' and ''keeper''.  But I know that people are put off by the idea of being the ''master'', and the only thing I could think of was to say it right out, fourth wall be damned: 

:Do not let the term master put you off. Dogs are not humans and having a master does not make them slaves.

Same for the ''command voice'' section.  Using it scares some people.  Maybe this stuff could be better handled in a section on '''Responsibilities of dog keepers'''.  

I don't expect my first draft to survive intact, but I didn't feel like waiting until I had solved all the problems of writing the article before writing it. I meant it as an open-ended opportunity for all to join in, Wikipedia style.

Completely missing are:
*Specific techniques for teaching each command
*A section on housebreaking
*Crate training
*Problems -- barking, jumping up, etc.  
*Advanced and specialized training
*Dog tricks
*Grooming and training.  The '''stand''' command, for instance, helps a lot.  Many furry dogs have to be combed every day, and often are groomed by strangers, so training to be groomed helps a lot, not to mention the effect of bonding with the dog.

Much more to be said.  Woof woof, bow-wow, barky barky, and out.[[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]] 17:50, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:That's &quot;Woof-woof, Bow Wow, woooooooooooooooooo and a bark&quot; to YOU.  We need to make sure that this isn't a how-to article--that it describes the concepts in an encyclopedic manner but doesn't turn into a user guide.  For that, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Dog_Care Wikibooks Dog Care]. Maybe. [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 02:39, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I think the trick to being encyclopedic but not a user guide would be to put enough detail in to guide a reasonable dog trainer and lead the less confident to the Wikibook.  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]]
  
== Drop (it) or Down? ==

I learned commands the same way they are described here (mumble, mumble years ago as Elf would say).  Have a comment/question, though.  I'm told that what I call 'Down!' to tell the dog to lie down immediately is now called 'Drop!' to distinguish this from (get)down (off of something).  However, I understand 'drop' to mean 'drop it'--leggo of whatever's in your mouth.  What do the modern gurus use for 'drop it' if not 'drop'?  [[User:Quill|Quill]] 04:03, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)
:The professional trainers I know (not including the one that exclusively uses correction-based training &lt;shudder&gt;) use &quot;down&quot; for lie down, &quot;drop (it)&quot; for such, and &quot;off&quot; for get off that. [[User:Lachatdelarue|Lachatdelarue [[User talk:Lachatdelarue|(talk)]]]] 15:22, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:I had ''drop'' (meaning drop the ball or the garbage) and ''down'' (mezning lie down) in the first draft, then when I came to write about the &quot;universal-cease-and-desist&quot; command, I wrote ''drop'' again, then changed it to ''stop''.  Actually, my dog and assistant dog don't do this one.  I saw a guy at the park one day teaching his dog to do it, and he was using the [[Yiddish]] ''plotz'' as the command.  

:The article could say something like this:

::Commands in this article are described as to function – a list of behaviors you should be able to get your dog to perform when you want – but you may use different command words than those given here.  While it may be simplestto choose short clear words that are easily understood by other humans, in fact, dogs can learn commands in any language or other communications medium, whistles, mouth sounds, hand gestures, and so forth.  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]] 17:25, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:I agree; think of all those deaf dogs out there who obey sign language just fine.  There are also some fairly standard gestures for common behaviors, but that's a little challenging for this venue.  However, I also think that mentioning words most commonly used by English-speakers is useful.  FWIW, I have always preferred the most common, time-honored terms, because if someone else is in charge of my dog for some period of time, I'd like the person to be able to use commands that they're likely to think of, such as ''down'' for lie down and ''sit'' for sitting and such. ''Plotz'' I hear fairly often (but still by a small minority of trainers); I don't know what the equivalent words are for other common behaviors.  Some people deliberately use unusual words for their dogs because they ''don't'' want other people to be able to get the dog to follow orders.
:As a somewhat related example, it's interesting to see agility handlers take over someone else's dog (usually because the regular handler/owner is injured); they are interested in two things: &quot;how would you handle your dog (body language and positioning) in such-and-such a situation&quot;, and &quot;what commands do you use for the various obstacles&quot;?  Everyone has his theory on why certain commands are best for certain situations.  (e.g., is the table &quot;hop&quot;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;table&quot;, &quot;flat&quot;?  And if your dog's name is Riot, what do you use instead of &quot;right&quot; in your right/left commands?) You'll see the same thing in obedience training.  
:The only challenge I've found in common commands is that most people w/out a lot of dog experience use &quot;down&quot; meaning &quot;get off me/that&quot; and &quot;lie down&quot; meaning, um, lie down.  So I always have to explain that dogs don't understand synonyms and they need to use &quot;off&quot; for &quot;get off&quot;.  (Although there's not a really good reason why &quot;liedown&quot; can't be taught as a different command from &quot;down&quot;; it just takes a little  more effort for the dog to get the distinction.) [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 02:05, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)

==Muzzle?==
&quot;A light muzzle also helps to train the dog&quot;? I'm not familiar with this one. I've seen muzzles only for dogs who have a tendency to use their mouths too much, and that's a chewing or biting issue rather than the same kind of training that collars and leashes are used for. I await enlightenment--  [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 01:02, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:I was referring to the light halter or hackamore that allows simply pointing the dog's head in the direction you want to go, literally leading it by the nose.  Probably should say bridle instead of muzzle.  I'll change.  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]]
 
==Training methods==
I edited out a couple of things. For example, I'd never use &quot;stay&quot; for a crate because Stay means stay in the position I left you, and you don't want to put that kind of restriction on a dog in a crate; I changed rewarding the dog for a stay to rewarding while in the stay because that's the behavior you want to reward, not getting up and coming to you for a reward.  Everything else I merely identified as &quot;one method is--&quot;; for example, I teach dogs down from a stand, not from a sit, because how many dogs do you see given the &quot;down&quot; command who dawdle into a sit and then get stuck there or dawdle their way the rest of the way to the ground?  Anyway, I wouldnt' call that one ''wrong'', just different. :-)   [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 18:37, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:I just stuck it back in, before I saw this comment.  Edit it back out, if you like, but I had two thoughts in mind.  
:# the crate is the &quot;den equivalent&quot;, just like the under-table, under-bench choices, and many people use the open crate that way. 
:#the article didn't mention [[crate training]] anywhere else and I thought it was better to mention it in the context of indoor behavior control rather than simply under a Related topics list.  
:I really liked your copy edit. [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]] PS - crate training has never worked for me, but under the Swedish day bed works fine.  

I understand about an open crate--but even so, do you really want your dog in a single position in the crate the whole time? I wouldn't--in any case, in such a general discussion I wouldn't present Stay as a common command for a dog in a crate.  I was thinking to instead include a separate fairly common command such as &quot;in&quot; or &quot;go to bed&quot; for either crate or bed--means the dog has to remain in that restricted space but can stand up or lie down as desired.  (I've heard lots of people say &quot;crate training doesn't work for me&quot; but I've never seen a correctly presented and trained crate NOT work for any dog. But that's a whole different topic.)

:I don't really like crate training, don't like locking them up, don't mind having dogs lying all over the house, so my heart wasn't in it.  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]]
::Ah, my friend, I once was like  you. ;-)   See my blather at [[Talk:Crate training]]. [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 21:47, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Also, I removed the &quot;used in conjunction with sit&quot; etc. from the one command because everything is used in combination with everything else; it's not particular to that one command and so seems both misleading and confusing.  

I left both of these items in for the moment because I didn't want to look like I was starting an edit war :-), but I'd rather take them out again.   [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 20:08, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:No fear, moved it to make the point in conjunction with '''Sit''' and '''Stay''' rather than with '''Come'''.  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]]

==Collar photos==
I put some photos on the [[collar]] article.  Question for you--for the quick-release collar, do you prefer [[:Image:QuickCollarNeck wb.jpg]] or [[:Image:QuickCollarHead wb.jpg]] for use on that page (other than the fact that I discovered that they are both slightly out of focus &amp; I'll have to redo later)?  Thanks.  [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 18:37, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:The caption should say &quot;quick release collar&quot; rather than &quot;slip collar&quot; because it is more self-xplanatory.  Both pictures are a little hard to &quot;read&quot; not only because of focus, but because of the decorations on the collar and the angle, and, in the second, that huge green thing in the dog's mouth that's in the center of the picture.  What is a quick release collar for anyway?  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]] 19:54, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Captions--oops; it's OK in the article but I was in a copy-and-paste frenzy in the image pages.  The quick-release collar is just a different form of buckle collar that's easier to put on and take off.  The big green thing is a toy that he didn't want to put down :-) and it is very distracting, which is why it occurred to me to edit it out.  So let me rephrase the question--would you prefer a close-up of the collar with tags and not showing the rest of the dog, or would you prefer a photo of the dog's head and neck with collar?  I'll try to find a plain-color collar and get the little black dog to sit still without something in his mouth. (Not my dog so I'm not taking responsibility for the training ;-) .)   [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 20:08, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:The closeup shot you chose is fine.  More at [[Talk:collar]].  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]] 20:35, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

==Why me? Why now?==
'''''Argggggghhhhh!''''' I was doing so good at staying away from Wikipedia--who got me started on dog training topics?!?!  I blame everyone!   [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 23:14, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)


==Latest edits==
I agree with most of the latest edits. Original material didn't mean to say that you couldn't train your pup, only that classes often weren't available for younger puppies. I have clarified that, hopefully, so it's completely clear.  

I disagree with the statement that &quot;Pinch or prong collars are not acceptable&quot;; there are cases in which they can be used effectively when other methods don't work--in my (somewhat) limited experience, more often with dogs who haven't been properly trained at a young age, particularly the very large breeds and older rescues.  I don't know of any trainer in my circle of friends who recommends using slip or prong collars any more except in certain carefully controlled situations (and most of them will say that they don't recommend them, period, but sometimes they do--).  

And I think the latest edits missed the point about the command voice--sure, dogs can learn hand signals, but when commands are used, most dogs don't respond well to &quot;come Oooonnnn, pleeeeeze siiiiiit&quot; in a whiny, questioning, or uncertain voice. An authoritative voice absolutely does NOT mean yelling or harshness. It is the voice of command. I've attempted to rewrite that section, too. [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 20:56, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

==&quot;Master&quot; vs &quot;Handler&quot;==
As I read the article, the use of the word &quot;master&quot; kept throwing me out. It's not a word that I am used to seeing in regard to training. I have no philosophical objection, it is just not what I consider common usage. The word I am used to seeing/hearing is &quot;handler&quot;. Sometimes the word &quot;trainer&quot; is used, but the trainer is not always the hardler. A dog's handler is the person holding the leash and giving the commands. A trainer might be a second person directing the handler and perhaps performing some specialized training function. In keeping with Wikipedia philosophy, I am going to edit the article to use &quot;handler&quot; instead. [[User:Dsurber|Dsurber]] 22:52, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

==Tricks training==
Whole section was removed by anon user saying it's incorrect and out of place; I see nothing wrong with a mention of trick training in an article on dog training, since that's a large part of many experienced dog owners' training regimen.  I left out the part about shaking hands becoming an annoying or dangerous dominance behavior, as I've not seen it myself among many dogs, although i don't tend to see the problem dogs or owners. :-)   [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 23:18, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

== POV ==

The entire article is POV and unreferenced. It misses out major parts of training and doesn't provide information about controversy over different types.-[[User:Localzuk|localzuk]] 22:10, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Merge? ==

Does anyone else think that this article would be better of merged with the [[Obedience training]] article? They contain almost the same info and maintaining 2 seems a bit pointless IMO.-[[User:Localzuk|localzuk]] 09:04, 5 January 2006 (UTC)
:Oh, well I just left a message at your talk page. '''Merge'''. Definately!--[[User:ViolinGirl|&lt;font color=&quot;#FF6699&quot;&gt;Violin&lt;/font&gt;]]'''''[[WP:EA|&lt;font color=&quot;339900&quot;&gt;G&lt;/font&gt;]]'''''[[Special:Contributions/ViolinGirl|&lt;font color=&quot;9999FF&quot;&gt;irl&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:ViolinGirl|&lt;font color=&quot;CC00FF&quot;&gt;♪&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:39, 5 January 2006 (UTC)
::I don't think they should be merged but we should consider what kind of info goes into each. IMHO, dog training is for the general case--one trains dogs in many different ways for many different things &amp; this might best address the general concepts of training dogs and point from there to more-specific articles (if there are others besides obedience training); &quot;obedience training&quot; is pretty specific to your standard sit-down-stay kind of stuff and leads into &quot;obedience competitions&quot;--which it's possible might be a separate article itself but that hasn't been clear when I've worked on that article in the past so I haven't (yet) done it; that also would require some thinking about the dividing line.  [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 19:35, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

== Oh, and BTW ==

By the way, everyone...I put the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{inuse}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template because I'm focusing on the article right now, renovating it as much as I can to it makes more sense. I think it needs major work. However, unlike the template says, feel free to help me edit it, because I definately cannot do it all myself. Feel free to [[User_talk:ViolinGirl|talk to me]] if you have complaints or questions.

When I come across it I don't edit the article (even if I otherwise would), I sit on the page refreshing it to see what big change has been made.

==How-to stuff removed==
I removed the following from the article &amp; it should never have been here because it's too specifically how-to and can't be made encyclpedic; also the methods are each only one variety of many ways to teach. [[wikibooks]] has a book on dog care but not sure about dog training; haven't looked in a while. Presevering here for easier retrieval later for something outside wikipedia itself.

Now, you are going to actually train your dog in some easy steps.

'''Sit'''  Get a treat or favourite toy to tempt your dog. Then, hold the treat or toy in a closed hand. Raise the treat or toy above and back over your dog's head and say '''Sit'''. Repeat this process and then, after about twenty goes, just say '''Sit''' without the hand movement.

'''Leave it/Take it'''  Every time you give your dog breakfast, lunch or dinner, tell him to sit. Then, say '''Leave it'''. Start putting your dog's meal down. He will rush to it so when he rushes at it, bring it back up, tell him to '''Sit''' (see above) and '''Leave it''' again. Keep doing it until he gets the point. Then, when he has successfully '''Left it''', say '''Take it'''. If he doesn't, shake the bowl to tempt him. This can also be used for things your dog isn't allowed to touch.

'''Stay'''  Get a treat or favourite toy to tempt your dog. Then, tell your dog to '''Sit''' (see above). Then, with your hand out flat, put your hand out in front of your dog's nose and say '''Stay''' and walk two or three steps away from your dog. Then say '''Take it''' (see above). Repeat this process several times. Each time you do it, take one or two steps further.

'''Drop''' or '''Down'''  Get a treat or favourite toy to tempt your dog. Then, tell him to '''Sit'''. Then, bring the treat down just in front of his front paws on the ground and say '''Drop'''. I don't recommend pushing down on his back because most dogs will bite you. When he is lying down, say '''Drop''' or '''Down''' again. Repeat this process about twenty-five times. Then, say '''Drop''' or '''Down''' without the hand movement.

'''Look'''  Get a treat or favourite toy to tempt your dog. Tell him to '''Sit''' (see above). Then, raise the treat or toy to your eye and say '''Look'''. Keep eye contact for three seconds then give him the treat. Repeat this process ten times and then five times without the hand movement.

'''Shake paws'''  Get a treat to tempt your dog. Then, tell him to '''Sit''' (see above). Then, take his paw and shake it like you would shake someone you didn't know's hands and say '''Shake''' or '''Paw'''. Repeat this process ten times, then five more times without picking up his paw.

'''Twirl'''  Get a treat to tempt your dog. Then, put it in front of your dog's nose and go round in a circle and say '''Twirl'''. Make sure your dog follows. Repeat this process seven times and then three more except without the hand movement.

==Question Regarding External Link Removal==
I added an external link to Cesar Millan's Dog Psychology Center, because I think he is the best dog trainer out there right now.I thought the link would be useful to people interested in dog training. I guess I just wanted to know why it was removed. This is my first time editing on Wikipedia. I'd appreciate any information you can give me! Thanks! [[User:Queequeg22|Queequeg22]]
:Be glad to. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a collection of links. Therefore, links to external pages should provide an extension of the encyclopedic information.  For example, a great link would be to a nonprofit site that has lots of info about training dogs and no ads, pop-ups, or the like.  In addition to that, attempting to maintain thousands of external links (which is what this would grow to if every trainer could have a link here) would be impossible.  I've added some additional information to your user talk page. Feel free to ask other questions on my talk page or on specific articles, like this.  Welcome to WP and sorry for the quickie revert without much explanation.  [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 21:31, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

==Untrained dogs?==
This paragraph was recently added:
:There are some professional trainers who disagree with this idea, particularly those who train working dogs, detection dogs, police dogs, etc. They feel that obedience work shouldn't start until the dog is at least a year old, or after the prey drive has fully developed. These trainers also take the position that spaying and neutering is harmful to the training process, again because of its negative impact on the dog's prey drive.

Can anyone enlighten me as to what trainers think it's a good idea to have a full-grown dog who doesn't have any idea about sit or down or not jumping up on people or walking on a leash? I can't imagine why one would think it's a good idea to let bad habit be practiced until they're well established and until the dog is well past its early rapid-learning stages and then try to train these things?  Can anyone provide references for this?  [[User:Elf|Elf]] | [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 00:36, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

I have never read any evidence to support benefits of delay of training until the dog is a year old.  In fact, the only evidence I've seen is in support of training of dogs as early as 8 weeks old.

== Use of term 'reinforcer' questionable ==

In this article, it states: &quot;This is seen most clearly in the fact that, according to the laws of operant conditioning, positive reinforcers lose their effectiveness if they're given every single time a dog does what is desired of him; the more predictable the reinforcer, the less reliable the behavior.&quot;

What source did you derive this from?  Actually, how you've written this is inaccurate.  Continual reinforcement of a behavior will maintain the behavior, although it may not strengthen it.  The problem with continual reinforcement is that behaviors are subject to easy extinction; an animal trained receiving a reinforcer for every correct behavior response will stop responding quickly once that 100% reinforcement is removed.  Intermittent reinforcement (for example, reinforcing every third or fifth correct response) works by making the behavior more resistant to extinction; the lack of predictibility of when the reinforcer will appear keeps the organism motivated.  Think of all the people who play the slot machines in Las Vegas.  That's intermittent reinforcement at work!

I believe that what you're talking about is the contrast effect of the reinforcer.  Contrast effects of primary reinforcers of food can affect learning.  For example, a handler is training his dog to increase the speed of the recall.  The handler offers kibble as a reinforcer for a quick recall.  On the fifth trial, the dog expects a piece of kibble as a reward for recall, but instead the handler gives it a piece of gorgonzola cheese. The dog has never had gorgonzola before, but it reacts by consuming the new, smelly cheese with great enthusiasm.  As a result, the dog’s speed increases in the following recall trials.  This is known as positive behavioral contrast.  The handler offered the gorgonzola for several more trials, then ran out, and began offering the same kibble as before.  The dog may not respond as quickly on the recalls anymore because the reinforcer does not hold as much value.  This is known as negative behavioral contrast.  It is important to note that the “contrast effect is quite transient and usually only lasts for 1-2 trials after the discrepant reward.”  (Reid, 1996, p. 46)

A positive reinforcer is something that the organism seeks out and strengthens the behavior that preceeds it.  If the presentation of something makes the behavior weaker, or results in a decrease of intensity, then it would be considered a punisher. (Chance, 2003; Lindsay, 2000; Burch and Bailey, 1999)  If a reinforcer is highly desirable to the organism, then predictibility of the reinforcer would not result in a decrease in behavior.

The article continues: &quot;Yet detection dogs only work well when they are always rewarded with a toy, every single time they find drugs or explosives, etc. The reason for this disparity is that when a dog is trained through the prey drive, the training activates an instinctive, automatic sequence that has to be completed in order for the dog to feel satisfied. That sequence is: search, eye-stalk, chase, grab-bite, and kill bite. So when a dog searches and finds drugs or explosives, he feels he hasn't finished his job unless he can bite something. This is the primary reason he's always given the toy. It's not really a positive reinforcer. If it were it would reduce the reliability of the behavior overall.&quot;

Again, technically, '''anything''' that results in an increase of behavior is a reinforcer.  If it results in a reduction of behavior, then it would be considered a punisher.  Your last two phrases contradict each other.  

Not all dogs are qualified to become 'drug-sniffing' dogs.  A desirable trait that this type of dog would need to have is a high grab-bite drive; this would make rewarding the dog with a toy very easy, thus easy to apply a reinforcer (toy) when necessary.  It is quite possible that in the training scenario you describe above, the dog is deprived of the 'toy' reinforcer outside of the 'drug drills', which increases the value of the reinforcer.  This would keep the reliability of the behavior quite high.  To state that the dog would consider his &quot;job&quot; as incomplete unless he can bite something is questionable.  It has more to do with allowing the dog to perform highly reinforcing innate drives than anything else.

This is related to the Premack Principle:  &quot;Reinforcement involves a ''relation'', typically between two responses, one that is being reinforced, and another that is responsible for the reinforcement.  This leads to the following generalization:  Of any two responses, the more probable response will reinforce the less probable one.&quot; (Premack, 1965, p. 132)  In short, the opportunity to engage in high probability behavior (playing with a toy) reinforces performance of low probability behavior (sniffing for drugs).

Consider three establishing operations when dealing with reinforcement (Burch and Bailey, 1999):

1. '''Motivation:'''  if a dog is not motivated to obtain something, then it cannot act as a reinforcer.  If the dog described above doesn't like hot dogs, then it will not work for them.  If it likes tugging on a toy, then the toy is highly motivating.

2. '''Deprivation:'''  if a dog is deprived of a reinforcer, it will increase the value of it.  An example would be that the drug-sniffing dog described above is not allowed to tug on toys in everyday life.  However, it is provided access to the toy and tugging contingent on finding drugs.  This would make the toy highly rewarding every time, especially if the dog loves the toy.

3. '''Satiation:'''  if the dog has had enough of a certain reinforcer, then it will lose some of its value.  Especially when using primary reinforcers, such as food, it's important to make sure the dog has not just had a huge meal before training.  The training treats will have much lower value if the dog is full versus if the dog has been fasted for 12 hours prior to the training session.

== Instincts that favor training- cite source, please ==

The article states:
*In the wild as pack animals, canines have natural instincts that favor training. These instincts are manifested when the dog lives with humans as a desire to please a handler, as a dog would please senior members in a pack in the wild.

Please cite your source for this information.

== Real dog problems ==

I edited the main article page to add an external reference to some articles about real dog problems. After reading the guidelines it appears as if I should have added it here instead. So...I would like to suggest adding a link to some articles that address real dog problems and how to deal with them, as written by a professional dog trainer. The site is http://www.dogtrainingbasics.com/articles.htm . Thanks, Shawn [[User:64.230.24.94|64.230.24.94]] 17:00, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

==Learning Theory==

Does anyone have a reference for this: &quot;According to Learning Theory there are four important messages that the handler can send the dog:
Reward or release marker 
Correct behavior. You have earned a reward. For example, &quot;Free&quot; or &quot;Okay&quot; followed by a reward. 
Keep going signal 
Correct behavior. Continue and you will earn a reward. For example, &quot;Good&quot;. 
No reward marker 
Incorrect behavior. Try something else. For example, &quot;Uh-uh&quot; or &quot;Try again&quot;. 
Punishment marker 
Incorrect behavior. You have earned punishment. For example, &quot;No&quot; or more specific commands like &quot;off,&quot; &quot;out,&quot; or &quot;leave it.&quot; 

I've never heard of these &quot;four messages&quot; before, and I know quite a lot about learning theory.

==Controversy==

Does anyone else think there should be a section on the controversy between different schools of thought in dog training?    For example, some people strongly believe that positive punishment is inhumane and that all dogs can be trained using postive punshment/negative reinforcement alone (e.g Karen Pryor, Turid Rugaas), whereas others think that positive punishment is necessary to proof dogs against distractions to have a reliable dog (e.g Koehler, Ed Frawley, Monks of New Skeete).  Some trainers believe that using &quot;pack theory&quot; is sufficient in order to have a well behaved dog (e.g Cesar Millan, Jan Fennell) whereas others think it is completely unnecessary (e.g most behaviourists, such as Karen Pryor and Jean Donaldson).  Some trainers are keen on correction collars or headcollars, whereas others think that either (or both) are inhumane.  

I think it's imporant to reflect these differences of opinion in the article, since they reflect fundamental differences in how trainers work with dogs, and they are a real source of argument and division between dog trainers.  Thanks, Rachel  7 Oct 2006.</text>

== '''Programming paradigms''' ==
A '''[[w:programming paradigm|programming paradigm]]''' is a model of programming based on distinct concepts that shapes the way programmers design, organize and write programs.  A [[w:multiparadigm programming language|multi-paradigm programming language]] allows programmers to choose a specific single approach or mix parts of different programming paradigms. C++ as a multi-paradigm programming language supports single or mixed approaches using Procedural or Object-oriented programming and mixing in utilizations of Generic and even Functional programming concepts.

=== Procedural programming ===
'''[[w:Procedural programming|Procedural programming]]''' can be defined as a subtype of [[w:Imperative programming|imperative programming]] as a programming paradigm based upon the concept of procedure calls, in which '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements|statements]]''''' are structured into procedures (also known as subroutines or [[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions|functions]]). Procedure calls are modular and are bound by scope. A procedural program is composed of one or more [[w:module (programming)|modules]]. Each module is composed of one or more [[w:subprogram (programming)|subprograms]]. Modules may consist of procedures, functions, subroutines or methods, depending on the programming language. Procedural programs may possibly have multiple levels or scopes, with subprograms defined inside other subprograms. Each scope can contain names which cannot be seen in outer scopes.

Procedural programming offers many benefits over simple sequential programming since procedural code:
* is easier to read and more maintainable
* is more flexible
* facilitates the practice of good program design
* allows modules to be reused in the form of '''''[[C++ Programming/Compiler/Linker/Libraries|code libraries]]'''''.

{{NOTE|Nowadays it is very rare to see C++ strictly using the Procedural Programming paradigm, mostly it is used only on small demonstration or test programs.}}

=== Statically typed ===
'''Typing''' refers to how a computer language handles its variables, how they are differentiated by '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type|type]]'''''. Variables are values that the program uses during execution. These values can change; they are variable, hence their name. ''Static typing'' usually results in compiled code that executes more quickly. When the compiler knows the exact types that are in use, it can produce machine code that does the right thing easier. In C++, variables need to be defined before they are used so that compilers know what type they are, and hence is statically typed.  Languages that are not statically typed are called ''dynamically typed''.

Static typing usually finds type errors more reliably at compile time, increasing the reliability of compiled programs. Simply put, it means that &quot;A round peg won't fit in a square hole&quot;, so the compiler will report it when a type leads to ambiguity or incompatible usage. However, programmers disagree over how common type errors are and what proportion of bugs that are written would be caught by static typing. Static typing advocates believe programs are more reliable when they have been type checked, while dynamic typing advocates point to dynamic code that has proved reliable and to small bug databases. The value of static typing, then, presumably increases as the strength of the type system is increased.

A statically typed system constrains the use of powerful language constructs more than it constrains less powerful ones. This makes powerful constructs harder to use, and thus places the burden of choosing the &quot;right tool for the problem&quot; on the shoulders of the programmer, who might otherwise be inclined to use the most powerful tool available. Choosing overly powerful tools may cause additional performance, reliability or correctness problems, because there are [[w:Computational complexity theory|theoretical limits]] on the properties that can be expected from powerful language constructs. For example, indiscriminate use of [[w:recursion|recursion]] or [[w:global variable|global variable]]s may cause well-documented adverse effects.

Static typing allows construction of libraries which are less likely to be accidentally misused by their users. This can be used as an additional mechanism for communicating the intentions of the library developer.

=== Type checking ===
'''Type checking''' is the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types, which can occur at either compile-time or run-time. Compile time checking, also called ''static type'' checking, is carried out by the compiler when a program is compiled. Run time checking, also called ''dynamic type checking'', is carried out by the program as it is running. A programming language is said to be ''strongly typed'' if the type system ensures that conversions between types must be either valid or result in an error. A ''weakly typed'' language on the other hand makes no such guarantees and generally allows automatic conversions between types which may have no useful purpose. C++ falls somewhere in the middle, allowing a mix of automatic type conversion and programmer defined conversions, allowing for almost complete flexibility in interpreting one type as being of another type. Converting variables or expression of one type into another type is called '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type Casting|type casting]]'''''.

=== Object-oriented programming ===
'''[[w:Object-oriented programming|Object-oriented programming]]''' can be seen as an extension of procedural programming in which programs are made up of collection of individual units called '''objects''' that have a distinct purpose and function with limited or no dependencies on [[w:implementation|implementation]]. For example, a car is like an object; it gets you from point A to point B with no need to know what type of engine the car uses or how the engine works. Object-oriented languages usually provide a means of [[w:documentation|documenting]] what an object can and cannot do, like instructions for driving a car.

==== Objects and Classes ====
An '''object''' is composed of '''members''' and '''methods'''. The members (also called ''data members'', ''characteristics'', ''attributes'', or ''properties'') describe the object. The methods generally describe the actions associated with a particular object. Think of an object as a noun, its members as adjectives describing that noun, and its methods as the verbs that can be performed by or on that noun.

For example, a sports car is an object. Some of its members might be its height, weight, acceleration, and speed. An object's members just hold data about that object. Some of the methods of the sports car could be &quot;drive&quot;, &quot;park&quot;, &quot;race&quot;, etc. The methods really do not mean much unless associated with the sports car, and the same goes for the members.

The &quot;blueprint&quot; that lets us build our sports car object is called a '''class'''. A class does not tell us how fast our sports car goes, or what color it is, but it does tell us that our sports car will have a member representing speed and color, and that they will be say, a number and a word, respectively. The class also lays out the methods for us, telling the car how to park and drive, but these methods can not take any action with just the blueprint - they need an object to have an effect.

===== Encapsulation =====
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=''«No component in a complex system should depend on the internal details of any other component.»''|caption=&lt;small&gt;--Dan Ingalls (Smalltalk Architect)
&lt;/small&gt;}}

Encapsulation, the principle of [[w:Information hiding|information hiding]] (from the user), 
is the process of hiding the data structures of the class and allowing changes in the data through a public interface where the incoming values are checked for validity, and so not only it permits the hiding of data in an object but also of behavior. This prevents clients of an interface from depending on those parts of the implementation that are likely to change in future, thereby allowing those changes to be made more easily, that is, without changes to clients. In modern programming languages, the principle of information hiding manifests itself in a number of ways, including encapsulation and polymorphism.

'''[[w:Generic programming|Generic programming]]''' or '''[[w:polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]''' is a programming style that emphasizes techniques that allow one value to take on different types as long as certain contracts such as [[w:subtype|subtypes]] and [[w:signature (computer science)|signature]] are kept. In simpler terms generic programming is based in finding the most abstract representations of efficient algorithms. [[w:template (programming)|Templates]] popularized the notion of generics. Templates allow code to be written without consideration of the [[w:datatype|type]] with which it will eventually be used. Templates are defined in the [[C++ Programming/STL|Standard Template Library (STL)]], where generic programming was introduced into C++.

=== Free-form ===
'''Free-form''' refers to how the programmer crafts the code. Basically, there are no rules on how you choose to write your program, save for the semantic rules of C++. Any C++ program should compile as long as it is legal C++.

The free-form nature of C++ is used (or abused, depending on your point of view) by some programmers in crafting obfuscated C++ (code that is purposefully written to be difficult to understand). In the right context this can also be seen as a show of craftsmanship (non functional but artful control over the language) but in general the use for obfuscation is seen only useful as a source security mechanism, ensuring that the source code is more intentionally difficult to analyze, replicate or use by third parties. With enough understanding about the compilers, source code can also be designed to preserve &quot;water marks&quot; in its compiled form that will permit tracing it to the original source.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[Beach Conflict]]==

I just wanted to let you know that your book, [[Beach Conflict]] had been [[WB:VFD|nominated for deletion]], and it has been deleted. One of the biggest concerns was that you said in the text of that page that the material was under copyright, and that it could not be used without permission. All text on wikibooks must be released under the terms of the [[GFDL]], or a compatable license. Since your text was not released under this license, it had to be deleted. 
There are a few options for you:

#If you would like to save a copy of the material for your own personal records, or if you would like to move the material to another website with a different copyright policy, I will undelete the page for you temporarily, and provide you with a complete copy of the page text.
#If you would like to release the material under the terms of the [[GFDL]], I will delete the page for you, and give you time to remove any copyright notices that are in violation of the [[GFDL]]. Keep in mind that your page might be deleted again if it violates any of the other [[WB:PAG|Wikibooks policies]]. 

If you have any questions about this, please let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:25, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like to use a library of XML Schema simple types with restrictions to validate your form.

== Notice ==
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Most type validation with the exception of the most simple types does not currently work under the FireFox extension.&lt;/font&gt;

== Sample Program sample.xhtml==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

      &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:string&quot;&gt;
         &lt;!-- bad pattern: matches any sequence of 5 digits, even if there are more digits or non-numeric. --&gt;
         &lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;\d{5}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
   &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
   &lt;xs:simpleType name=&quot;zip2Type&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:string&quot;&gt;
         &lt;!-- good pattern: matches only 5 digits, nothing extra --&gt;
         &lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;^\d{5}$&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
   &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Sample instance document instance.xml ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">12/17/2012:  Hello, what I am planning on doing for this section of this wiki book take the information on the page and make it a bit more accessible.  I will attempt to comply with the requests you, Dr. Barton, have made at the top of the page.  Along with making the information more accessible, I would like to attempt to expand and add examples as I see fit throughout the section.  Finally, I will work to incorporate any information I can to address the suggestions listed below.  Essentially, my goal is to make this portion of the book accessible and aesthetically pleasing.  -E. Kelly.


I am not sure we are really need to talk about how to write an essay (i.e. thesis statements) in how to write a rhertorical analysis. I think the bigger situation that needs to be addressed is what is seen in the numbered list. Shouldn't we expand on these a bit?

I also think somewhere someone should mention how a rhetorical analysis differs from a review. What about a section on Aristotle's rhetoric? Ethos, pathos, logos?

Today I just made the page look more aesthetically pleasing, while making some minor grammatical corrections. Later this week I'll try adding more content.

12/4
Does anyone think we should put up an exemplary rhetorical analysis? It might be a nice thing to have. I found some good ones online, and have a couple from past classes, but would need to get the appropriate people's permission.

11/12/08 I am in the process of elaborating this entire page. I have already added a fairly comprehensive list of fallacies, and am working next on the rhetorical devices beyond the Aristotelian pathos, ethos, and logos.</text>

{{ay_prerequisite|Recreation|Geocaching}}
==2. Briefly describe the origin of the global positioning satellites? What is their history – when and how did they get there? By whom?==
===History===
The design of GPS is based partly on the similar ground-based radio navigation systems, such as LORAN and the Decca Navigator developed in the early 1940s, and used during World War II.  Additional inspiration for the GPS system came when the Soviet Union launched the first Sputnik in 1957.  A team of U.S. scientists led by Dr. Richard B. Kershner were monitoring Sputnik's radio transmissions.  They discovered that, because of the Doppler effect, the frequency of the signal being transmitted by Sputnik was higher as the satellite approached, and lower as it continued away from them.  They realized that since they knew their exact location on the globe, they could pinpoint where the satellite was along its orbit by measuring the Doppler distortion.  

The first satellite navigation system, Transit, used by the United States Navy, was first successfully tested in 1960.  Using a constellation of five satellites, it could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour.  In 1967, the U.S. Navy developed the Timation satellite which proved the ability to place accurate clocks in space, a technology the GPS system relies upon. In the 1970s, the ground-based Omega Navigation System, based on signal phase comparison, became the first world-wide radio navigation system.

The first experimental Block-I GPS satellite was launched in February 1978.  The GPS satellites were initially manufactured by Rockwell International and are now manufactured by Lockheed Martin.

=== Timeline ===
*In 1972, the US Air Force Central Inertial Guidance Test Facility (Holloman AFB) conducted developmental fight tests of two prototype GPS receivers over White Sands Missile Range, using ground-based pseudo-satellites.
*In 1978 the first experimental Block-I GPS satellite was launched.
*In 1983, after Soviet interceptor aircraft shot down the civilian airliner Korean Air Flight 007 in restricted Soviet airspace, killing all 269 people on board, U.S. President Ronald Reagan announced that the GPS system would be made available for civilian uses once it was completed.
*By 1985, ten more experimental Block-I satellites had been launched to validate the concept.  
*On February 14, 1989, the first modern Block-II satellite was launched.
*In 1992, the 2nd Space Wing, which originally managed the system, was de-activated and replaced by the 50th Space Wing.
*By December 1993 the GPS system achieved initial operational capability.  
*By January 17, 1994 a complete constellation of 24 satellites was in orbit.
*Full Operational Capability was declared by NAVSTAR in April 1995.
*In 1996, recognizing the importance of GPS to civilian users as well as military users, U.S. President Bill Clinton issued a policy directive declaring GPS to be a dual-use system and establishing an Interagency GPS Executive Board to manage it as a national asset.
*In 1998, U.S. Vice President Al Gore announced plans to upgrade GPS with two new civilian signals for enhanced user accuracy and reliability, particularly with respect to aviation safety.
*On May 2, 2000 &quot;Selective Availability&quot; was discontinued as a result of the 1996 executive order, allowing users to receive a non-degraded signal globally.
*In 2004, the United States Government signed a historic agreement with the European Community establishing cooperation related to GPS and Europe's planned Galileo system.
*In 2004, U.S. President George W. Bush updated the national policy, replacing the executive board with the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee.
*November 2004, QUALCOMM announced successful tests of Assisted-GPS system for mobile phones.
*In 2005, the first modernized GPS satellite was launched and began transmitting a second civilian signal (L2C) for enhanced user performance.

==3. Define latitude, longitude. What is meant by degrees, minutes, seconds?==
;Latitude: Latitude describes the north-south position on the globe and is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds.  The 0° line is a circle around the Earth's equator.  Latitude changes as one moves north to south, or south to north.  It does not change as one moves from east to west or west to east.
;Longitude: Longitude describes the east-west position on the globe, and like latitude, is also measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds.  All longitude lines begin and end at the North and South Poles.  The 0° longitude line begins at the North Pole, passes through Greenwich, England, and then continues to the South Pole.  Longitude changes as one moves east to west, or west to east.  It does not change as one moves from north to south or south to west.

;Degrees:  Most people become familiar with the angular measurement of a ''degree'' in a mathematics class when they are introduced to the protractor.  The ''degree'' used in Geocaching is this very same measurement.  Latitude measures the angle made by two lines which both originate at the very center of the Earth.  The first line extends from the center of the Earth to the equator, and the second line extends from the center of the Earth to the position being described.  Longitude is similar, measuring the angle formed by two lines - one extending from the center of the Earth to the equator directly south of Greenwich, England, and the other extending from the center of the Earth to a position on the equator directly north or south of the measured position.
;Minutes:  A degree is not a very precise measurement of an angle when considering something as large as the planet Earth.  If only degrees were used to specify a person's position, we could only get within about {{units|100km|62 miles}} of the person's position.  Therefore, a degree is divided into 60 finer measurements called ''minutes''.  Minutes in Geocaching has little to do with time.  
;Seconds: Even with the finer angular resolution of minutes, we can still only get to within about {{units|1670 meters|one mile}} of a person's position, so the minute is divided into seconds.  One second can get us to within about {{units|28 meters|92 feet}} of a position, so they are typically specified to a couple of decimal places, as in &quot;25.65 seconds&quot;.

Latitude and longitude are specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds, as in 43°22'54.31&quot;.  Here the number preceding the ° symbol (43) is the number of degrees, the number preceding the ' (22) is the number of minutes, and the number before the &quot; (54.31) is the number of seconds.  When we go down to one hundredth of a second, we can specify a location to within about {{units|28 cm|11 inches}}.

==4. Complete two or more of the following:==
===a. Establish and maintain a new geocache in your area for at least 6-months.===
Be sure to read these [http://www.geocaching.com/about/hiding.aspx guidelines for hiding a geocache].  In short:
*Choose an area to hide your geocache
**Make sure it's legal, and that you have permission.  
**Make sure that the added attention of geocachers will not damage a sensitive site (historic or natural)
**Hide it out of sight of casual passersby.
*Prepare your cache
**Choose a container.  Popular choices include plastic food-storing containers such as Tupperware, ammo boxes, and water-proof boxes used on boats.  The container should be waterproof and be able to withstand the rigors of the weather.
**Add a logbook and (optionally), a pencil.  Ink freezes.
**Write a note to the geocachers who find your cache.
**Add a small gift (optional)
**Add a Travel Bug (optional)
*Get the GPS coordinates
**Make sure they are accurate.
**Take several readings and average them
**Follow your GPS to the site from different directions
**Write the coordinates on the container and in the logbook.
*Register your cache
**Find the form at http://geocaching.com
**Write up a good description of the area, including notes of interest (history, etc.)
**Double-check for accuracy
*Maintenance
**Check that the container is still water-tight and seals properly
**Check that the logbook is still there
**Assess the area for damage caused by cachers and make adjustments if necessary

===b. Send out and follow a TB (travel bug) for 6 months.===
You can order travel bugs from [http://www.geocaching.com/track/order.aspx geocaching.com] and from other places as well.  Think of some sort of goal for your TB, and plant it in a cache - maybe even one you have started yourself in requirement 6a above.

===c. Find 2 travel bugs and follow for 6 months===
Though travel bugs are not expensive, it's even cheaper to find them and track them than it is to buy one and send it out.  Watch the geocaches in your area and look for TB's to be dropped off in them.  Then pick them up and help them meet their goals.

===d. Participate in a geocache meeting or event in your area (attend).===
Check the geocaching [http://www.geocaching.com/calendar/ calendar] to find an event near you.  If there is not one, you could always host one yourself.  If you host it at your church you will raise your community's awareness of your church.  However, do not try to make this an evangelistic meeting, as this would be frowned upon by the geocaching community and would give you and your church a bad name.  It is enough that people learn where your church is.

==5. What are the laws/rules/guidelines for placing caches in the following locations?==
===a. State Parks National Park Service===
The U.S. National Park Service prohibits geocaches on land it manages.
===b. Roads and Railroad Right-of-Ways===
It is a federal offense in the United States to trespass on an active railroad right-of-way.  Geocaches should be located a minimum of {{units|45 meters|150 feet}} from any active rail line.

===c. Placing caches while traveling===
A person who places a cache is responsible for maintaining it.  This means it must be physically visited on a regular basis. Unless the cache placer is able to pay frequent visits to the cache site, the cache should not be placed.
===d. Wilderness Areas in National Forest Areas===
National Forests are managed by the U.S. Forest Service, which recognizes geocaching as a legitimate recreational activity.  However, geocachers must be careful to observe the rules of using the National Forests.  Trees, plants, and streams are not to be damaged.

Wilderness areas within National Forests are not to be used for geocaching.  These areas are to remain undeveloped, and all traces of human activity are to be minimized.

===e. USDA Forest Service===
* Guidelines at Wayne National Forest - http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/wayne/recreation_sites/geocache.html

==6. Find and record at least 18 geocaches; include: &lt;br&gt;a. Traditional cache with 3-star difficulty &lt;br&gt;b. One Multi-level &lt;br&gt;c. One virtual &lt;br&gt;d. One micro==
You can record your finds on the geocaching website, so don't worry about setting up some sort of elaborate system.  Getting each of these types of cache will most likely come naturally, so you don't really need to pay particular attention to that when you get started.  As you near your 18th cache, check them over and see how many of these four types you already got &quot;automatically&quot; - then work on getting the rest.  By the time you log your 18th, you will likely have found a new hobby, and more will come.

==1. Define the following terms: ==
===a. Elements ===

A class of substances that cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means.

===b. Compounds  ===

A uniform substance composed of two or more elements.

===c. Chemical symbols  ===

Every element is represented using an abbreviation of one or two characters that represent the name of the element. The first character is always capitalized, and the second character if it exists is always lower case. 
:H represents hydrogen
:He represents helium
:Li represents lithium
:C represents Carbon

Some of the symbols do not represent the modern name, but an original name. 
:Ag represents argentum (''Latin'') or silver 
:Au represents aurum (''Latin'') or gold
:W represents wolfram (''German'') or tungsten

There are 94 elements that are found naturally on earth, and there are another 17 that have been created in atomic accelerators, and have very short half lives. A further 7 elements have been reported but they are still in the confirming/naming stage. All of these elements are organized using a &quot;Periodic Table of Elements&quot; which was created by Dimitri Mendeleev.

===d. Solutions ===

A mixture of two or more substances that do not react chemically. If you dissolve sugar, salt, or another substance in water, you are creating a solution.

===e. Atoms  ===

Atoms are basic building blocks of matter. Atoms range in size from .5Å to 24Å. ( Å is the symbol for a unit of measure known as an angstrom.  A blond hair is between 170,000 and 500,000Å  in diameter and a black hair is between 560,000 and 1,810,000Å in diameter) 

Atoms are mostly empty space, but because the electrons are moving so rapidly, the matter we touch can feel very solid. Hydrogen is the simplest atom, it is made of one proton and one electron. A classical model of an atom is to think about the electron orbiting the central proton. If we created a model of this atom with the proton the size of a basket ball, then the electron would be the size of a grain of salt and will be orbiting at a distance of 40,000 feet. 

We cannot directly see atoms with a regular microscope. Light has a wavelength of between 4,000Å and 7,000Å which is about 1000 times the diameter of an atom. Because the wavelength of light is so long it has almost no interaction with the atom. The center of an Atom can be &quot;viewed&quot; and the positions of the electron cloud around an atom can be determined by using an X-ray, (neutron, or electron) beam (which have much smaller wavelengths than light) in such techniques as  
[[w:X-ray_crystallography|X-ray crystallography]], [[w:Neutron_crystallography|Neutron crystallography]], or [[w:Electron_crystallography|Electron crystallography]].  Or a [[w:Scanning_tunneling_microscope|scanning tunneling microscope]] can be used.

===f. Molecules ===

Two or more atoms that have bonded to each other.

===g. Periodic Table===

The periodic table of the chemical elements is a tabular method of displaying the chemical elements. The table illustrates recurring (&quot;periodic&quot;) trends in the properties of the elements.
{{Small Periodic table}}

===h. Combustion ===

We often use the word combustion to describe the chemical process of a fuel combining rapidly with a oxidizer (usually oxygen)i.e. burning. This process usually is associated with flames, light, heat, and smoke.

=== i. Acid===

The word acid is from the Latin word ''acidus''  which means sour. In the early days of chemistry, it was a common practice to taste or smell things and record the sensation. Many things that are acidic are sour. Lemon juice is sour because of the citric acid in it.

Because many substances can be toxic, this probably killed a number of chemists including the famous scientist, Humphry Davy, the man who came up with the theory that explained the nature of an acid.

Davy's hypothesis was that acids were substances that contained replaceable hydrogen. This hydrogen could be replaced by metals and this reaction would leave behind a salt.

:2HCl + Zn → ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
:Fe +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

===j. Salt===

A salt is a term for the solid form of an ionic compound, such as Sodium Chloride (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) or potassium hydroxide (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(OH)&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).

===k. Proton===

A positively charged particle that is a part of the nucleus of an atom. Protons have a mass of &lt;math&gt;1.67 \times 10^{-27}&lt;/math&gt; kg. One cubic centimeter of water contains &lt;math&gt;6.02 \times 10^{24}&lt;/math&gt;protons that form the nucleus of the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen has one proton at its center and oxygen has 8 protons.

===l. Neutron ===

A neutrally charged particle that is a part of the nucleus of an atom. Neutron's have a mass of &lt;math&gt;1.67 \times 10^{-27}&lt;/math&gt; kg. When we look at water we find that it is made up of Hydrogen and Oxygen. Hydrogen has no neutrons, but each atom of oxygen has 8 neutrons.

Neutrons are held together by what is called the &quot;Weak Force&quot;. Free [[W:Neutron_decay|neutrons decay]] with a half life of about 10.3 minutes into a proton, electron and an electron nutrino. In the neucleus of an atom, the neutrons can be quite stable because of another force known as the &quot;Strong Force&quot;

===m. Electron===

A negatively charged particle with a mass of &lt;math&gt;9.11 \times 10^{-31}&lt;/math&gt; kg. Electrons form a cloud about the positively charged nucleus of an atom.

===n. Distillation ===
Distillation, which is heating the liquid to boiling and collecting the condensed vapors, is a useful technique to separate components based on different boiling points. Distillation separates two volatile liquids where the more volatile component is more pure. The farther apart the boiling temperatures, the more likely that the distillation will be successful. The lower the boiling point, the more volatile the compound is and therefore the faster it will vaporize. Success also depends on the interactions between particles, since two dissimilar liquids that are dissolved in each other are likely to form '''azeotropes'''. If this occurs, the liquid and gas phase will both have the same composition and therefore boiling will not cause further separation.

===o. Fractional Distillation===
[[File:Fractional distillation lab apparatus.svg|thumb|350px|Fractional distillation aparatus]]
Fractional distillation is a technique in which several distillations occur in the same column, mediated by some sort of porous medium. It allows the separation of substances with closer boiling points than simple distillation, and also makes the distillation of the same solutions more efficient. Fractional distillation yields better separation in comparison to simple distillation due to few factors. One is that the distillation column is usually packed with copper, stool wire or glass beads. This increases the surface area, which enables efficient and continuous vaporization and condensation by exchanging heat between the vapor and the condensate.
{{clear}}

===p. Filtration ===

Filtration is a technique in which a solid precipitate (or solid waste) is separated from a liquid. The mixture is placed on filter paper, which allows the liquid to pass through, leaving the solid behind. Typically the liquid is first brought to a temperature such that there is little solid dissolved in the liquid, so that separation is most effective. This filtration can be done using only gravity or suction can be used.

==2. What gases extinguish life, and how? Explain the principle of one kind of chemical fire extinguisher.==

In the extreme, almost any gas can kill a person. Even pure oxygen can kill because the body cannot deal effectively with pure oxygen. The gases can kill by:

:1) Suffocation- The gas displaces oxygen and the body now starved of oxygen dies. Some of the most dangerous suffocants are oxidation compounds such as &lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt; or CO

:2) Poison- There are gases such as Cyanide gas HCN which are highly poisonous. Cyanide binds to the iron atoms in the enzyme known as cytochrome c oxidase and thus blocks the production of ATP. ATP is the universal energy currency of all living organisms.

:3) Explosion- Many gases are quite flammable and can explode quite destructively. Most of the light Hydrocarbons in mines can be set off with only a small spark.

Fire, like life, requires oxygen, so a common method used in fire extinguishers is to use a gas or liquid that will keep the oxygen from getting to the fuel.

==3. Name two common sources of carbon monoxide. Why is it dangerous? ==

Automobile exhaust before the catalytic converter contains large amounts of CO (Carbon Monoxide). If the exhaust system is damaged before this point, then there is a danger of breathing the suffocating gas. The catalytic converter converts most of the CO to &lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt; (Carbon Dioxide) There may still be enough CO in automobile exhaust to be fatal, but since most is now &lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt; which has an odor or at least sensation, there is less chance of accidental asphyxiation.(  &lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt; can be fatal as well, but is quite caustic, creating a burning sensation in the nose and lungs. If you have ever breathed the bubbles from a Soda Pop can, you have smelled &lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt;.)

Another common source of CO is natural gas or propane stoves, heaters, hot water heaters, or clothes dryers. If these appliances become damaged they can be quite dangerous. It is a good idea to have a CO detector near an old furnace or water heater to provide an early warning.

Oxygen is carried to the cells from the lungs by red blood cells and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is carried back to the lungs to be breathed out. Red blood cells have a 3-D space that fits oxygen and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but allows them to be ejected when they reach their destination. CO can also fit the space but won't let go, so a red blood cell that has CO loaded is no longer available to do its job. If enough red blood cells are affected, the body cells cannot get the oxygen they need and waste CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; builds up, leading to death.

==4. What are the states of matter? ==
;[[W:Solids|Solid]]
:The atoms are in a fairly rigid structure that at the macroscopic level feels hard or solid. The atoms may be arranged in  a very rigid crystaline structure, but there is still vibration within the structure.
;[[w:Liquid|Liquid]]
:The atoms are free to move around, but do not separate like a gas. Liquids can flow and in general do not feel solid or rigid.  Liquids are not compressible.  When helium is cooled close to absolute zero, it behaves oddly, turning into a superfluid. It is dangerous to handle because of its temperature.
;[[w:Gas|Gas]]
:The molecules of a gas are completely free to move around and at standard room temperature they move tens of meters before hitting another molecule. A gas is airy. You will not necessarily know that it is there unless you move through it and feel the wind.
;[[w:Plasma|Plasma]]
:The molecules of a plasma are ionized, which causes them to repel each other, so a plasma can appear to flow almost like a liquid, and it glows as some of the molecules change ionization states.

The states of matter are largely defined based on the level of interaction between the molecules and atoms that form the matter. This interaction is temperature (and pressure) dependent, and there are well defined freezing (liquid to solid) points, melting(solid to liquid) points, boiling (liquid to gas) points, condensation( gas to liquid) points, for each element or molecule at a particular air pressure(i.e. normal sea level pressure). 


''This is why water boils at a lower temperature on a mountain which has less air pressure than at sea level. This can effect the efficiency of sterilizing water by boiling and a longer time is needed.''


''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a unusual gas as in its solid form it doesn't melt but goes straight to a gas (sublimate). This is why frozen CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is known as Dry Ice as it does not go through a liquid form so is not 'wet'.''

==5. Do five of the following, and explain the chemical action that takes place: ==
===a. Try to light a sugar cube, first without and then with some ash applied to the cube, thus showing the action of a catalyst. ===

;Materials:
*Sugar Cubes
*Ash from fireplace or campfire
*Matches or lighter
*Aluminum foil
*Piece of wood or trivet to act as insulator
;Method
*Lay a piece of aluminum over the trivet or a piece of wood.
*Place the sugar cube near the center of the foil.
*Take another sugar cube and coat it with ash.
*Place the ash-coated sugar cube next to the first sugar cube, but do not let them touch.
*Try to light each sugar cube.  It should be easier to light the ash-coated sugar cube.

===b. Place an ice cube in a glass of water, place a four-inch (10.2 cm) string on top of the glass and ice, then solve the problem of taking the ice cube out of  the water without touching it. ===

;Materials
*Ice
*Salt
*Water
*Glass
*String 10 cm long
;Method
*Put the ice cube in the glass 
*Tie a loop on the string and place it on the cube
*Put a pinch of salt on the loop and cube
*Wait a while then pull up the string

===c. With the use of water, turpentine, and soap, transfer a newspaper picture to a blank sheet of paper. ===

;Materials:
* 30 ml soap powder (example: Ivory Snow)
* 60 ml hot water
* 15 ml turpentine 
* Small bowl
* Measuring cup
* Paint brush
* Newspaper or old magazine

;Method:

* Dissolve soap powder in hot water and then add turpentine.
* To use, dip a brush into the ink and brush over the picture to be transferred, wait about ten seconds then place a piece of paper over the picture and rub the back of it with a spoon. The picture will be transferred to the paper. 

The ink will solidify in its container after a little while. To reverse this simply set the bottle in a pan of warm water until melted and then shake.

===d. With the use of a candle and a piece of cardboard, demonstrate visually the three parts of a candle flame. ===
[[Image:Kaarsvlam-kl.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]

;1) Blue zone : The blue area is the base of the flame. In this area, '''[[W:Pyrolysis|pyrolysis]]''' takes place (where the candle wax ''changes state'' into the combustible gas). Also, part of ''combustion'' takes place here. The temperature in this area is about 1200-1400ºC.

;2) Dark zone : The dark area in the middle of the flame just above the tip. This dark core of the flame is around 800-1000ºC. Within these bluer regions, hydrogen is being separated from the fuel and burned to form water vapor. 

;3) Luminous zone : The yellow luminous area is above the dark area. This brighter, yellower part of the flame is the remaining carbon being oxidized to form carbon dioxide. The incandescent soot particles causes the orange and yellow glow. This area is approximately 1200ºC.

;4) Flame Mantle : this is on the outer rim of the flame, and is colorless, or a very faint blue, and is the hottest part of the candle flame. About 1400ºC.

===e. With a bowl of water, wooden match sticks, a lump of sugar, and small amount soap, demonstrate the action of sugar and soap on the floating match sticks. ===

;Materials:
* Sugar cube
* Dish soap
* 2 Small bowls
* 12 Toothpicks (or wooden match sticks)
* Water

;Method:
*Fill both bowls water.
*Drop half the toothpicks into each bowl
*Place the sugar cube in one bowl.  The toothpicks should be drawn to it.
*Place one drop of dish detergent in the other bowl.  The toothpicks should be repelled from it.

Sugar absorbs water, and as it does, it creates a small current that draws the toothpicks toward it.  The Soap, on the other hand, breaks the surface tension of the water and immediately spreads out over the surface.  As it moves across the surface, it too creates a current, carrying the toothpicks along as it goes.

===f. Place a fresh egg in fresh water and then salt water, noting the difference.===
;Materials
* Fresh (uncooked) egg
* {{units|1 liter|4 cups}} Water
* {{units|120 ml|½ cup}} Salt
* 2 Bowls

;Methods
*Add the salt and {{units|a half liter|2 cups}} of water to a bowl and stir until the salt dissolves.
*Add the other {{units|half liter|2 cups}} of water to the other bowl - do not add any salt.
*Place the egg in the salted water.  It should float
*Move the egg to the unsalted water.  It should sink.

Salt water is more dense than fresh water, meaning that a volume of salt water will weigh more than an equal volume of fresh water.  The density of an egg is between the density of salt water and fresh water.  An item will float if it is less dense than the liquid in which it is placed.  Since the egg is more dense than fresh water, it sinks.  But because the egg is less dense than the salt water, it floats. NOTE: If nothing happens, then get two eggs and place one in the fresh water and the other in the salt water.  The fresh water egg should expand and the salt water egg should shrink due to osmosis.

===g. Demonstrate that rust uses up oxygen with the use of steel wool, a pencil, a rubber band, a water glass, and a dish of water. ===
;Materials
*Steel wool (plain, without soap)
*Pencil
*Rubber band
*Drinking glass (clear glass)
*Bowl
*Water

;Method
Use the rubber band to attach the steel wool to the eraser end of the pencil.  The pencil should be short enough that it can fit inside the glass without sticking out the top.  Fill the glass halfway with water, and place the pencil in the glass with the wad of steel wool at the bottom.  Place a bowl upside-down over the top of the glass, and carefully turn the glass and the bowl over so that the glass is upside-down and the bowl is right-side-up.  Add some water to the bowl and mark the water level on the side of the glass.  Place the apparatus some place where it will not be disturbed.  After a few days, check the steel wool - it should be rusty.  

As the steel wool rusts, it uses up oxygen trapped in the glass.  This reduces the volume of air inside the glass, and the atmospheric pressure outside the glass will compensate by pushing down on the water inside the bowl.  This will in turn push the water in the glass higher.  Verify by comparing the current water level to the level marked at the beginning of the experiment.

===h. Demonstrate the colors produced when the following are burned: salt, copper sulfate, and boric acid. ===
* '''Salt''' : Common table salt is ''Sodium Chloride'' [http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/jcesoft/cca/cca2/STHTM/FLAME/9.HTM Orange-Yellow]
* '''Copper Sulfate''' : Blue-Green
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Flametest--Cu.swn.jpg|Copper Sulfate
Image:Flametest-Co-Cu.swn.jpg|Copper Sulfate (through Cobalt glass)
Image:Flametest--Na.swn.jpg|Sodium Chloride
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* '''Boric Acid''' : [http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/jcesoft/cca/cca2/STHTM/FLAME/1.HTM Bright Green]


'''More Colors/Flames''' (because they are colorful)
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Flametest--.swn.jpg|Gas Flame
Image:FlammenfärbungSb.png|Antimony, Sb
Image:FlammenfärbungAs.jpg|Arsenic, As
Image:FlammenfärbungB.png|Boron, B
Image:FlammenfärbungCa.png|Calcium, Ca
Image:Flametest--Cu.swn.jpg|Copper, Cu
Image:FlammenfärbungPb.png|Lead, Pb
Image:FlammenfärbungLi.png|Lithium, Li
Image:FlammenfärbungK.png|Potassium, K

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===i. Make an invisible ink. ===

;Materials
*Water
*Vinegar, Lemon juice, sugar, onion
*Small cups
*Candle or stove flame
*Tooth picks
*Paper

;Methods
You can mix vinegar, lemon juice, sugar or onion juice with water to create an invisible ink.  To make the ink visible, carefully hold it over a heat source.  The &quot;ink&quot; will turn colors and become visible.  Try mixing a small amount of ink using each type of ingredients to see which works better.

===j. Show that washing soda or sodium carbonate contains water.===
;Materials
*Test tube/tongs
*washing soda (baking soda does pretty much exactly the same thing, but the requirements say washing soda)
*Candle or stove flame

;Methods
Put a small amount of the washing soda into the test tube.  Hold the test tube with the tongs over a flame.  You will see a tornado-like effect inside the test tube as the water makes its &quot;escape&quot;.  Very fun for everyone to watch!

Crap, I think The one in the Modern Physics book came up while I was planning this.  Does anyone think I should just edit that?  Or make Stat-Mech its own book?

I'll continue this book, the Modern Physics book is more or less specifically Thermodynamics, I plan to make this book have a more foundational statistical mechanics flare to it.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 17:55, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

=List of Known Problems for editors=

* Needs Latex formatting instead of HTML tags.
* Examples are really sparse, in reality I'm really rushing ideas through here.
* Prior to Debye Theory I don't believe I mentioned the energy-representation T v. Kelvin-scale T
* It would probably be best to make Foundations and its subsections as one complete section.  
* The Quantum Gases section can use Density of states material to study the fermi/bose gases in further depth.
* The Van-der-Waals Equation should be fit in somewhere.
* As mentioned in the Thermodynamic Potentials page, if anyone could do a /teeny/ amount of art for me.....

If there are any calls for further clarification, I will do so.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 10:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/86.164.114.114|86.164.114.114]] ([[User talk:86.164.114.114|talk]]) to last version by Avicennasis</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In English, as in most languages, it is common to use verbs together in a sentence - e.g. &quot;I '''enjoy playing''' football&quot;.  In some languages the second verb used must always be used in the infinitive (dictionary form).  In English there are three common forms for the second verb used:

* infinitive - to play, to see, to love, to hate, etc.
* ing - playing, seeing, loving, hating, etc.
* bare infinitive - play, see, love, hate, etc.

The form of the second verb depends on the first verb.  Look at the three examples below and you'll see what form the second verb should take after the verbs '''enjoy''', '''want''' and '''will''':

#I '''enjoy playing''' football.
#I '''want to play''' football.
#I '''will play''' football.

Examination of the above sentences should reveal that:

* ENJOY is followed by '''ing'''
* WANT is followed by '''infinitive'''
* WILL is followed by '''bare infinitive'''

== Verbs followed by ing ==

* Phrasal verbs
* Suggest, Avoid, Depend on, Object to, Be/Get used to/accostumed to, Deny To, refer to,  Can't help/stand/bear, Finish ,Admit

== Verbs followed by infinitive ==

* want, wish, would like, afford, agree, aim, decide, help, mean, offer, prefer, promise, refuse, tend, happen

If in doubt about which form to use you should use the infinitive as this is the most common form.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

e.g. I want '''to go''' home.  He offered '''to open''' the window.

== Verbs followed by bare infinitive ==

*Modals Verbs: Can/Could   May/might   Shall/Should    Will/Would   Must  Needn't   Would Rather  Had better
* Let s.o do sth.    Make s.o do sth.   Help s.o (to) do
e.g. I might '''go''' to bed.  You should '''do''' more exercise.

== Verbs with both forms ==

* Verbs followed by infinitive or geround without change of meaning:

Like Dislike Hate Begin Love Detest Start Adore Loathe....

-situacion continua: I like playing tennis
-situacion concreta: I would like to play basketball instead

* Verbs followed by infinitive ir geround with cange of meaning:

Remember Regret Forget Try Stop Mean Go on

e.g.: Efford: i tried to lift the box
     Experiment: i tried lifting the box

     I really want: i mean to be a ballet dancer
     Implies: It means doing lots of execrices

      <text xml:space="preserve">A number of the chapters in this book are improperly named (i.e., not as chapters but as books), and need to be moved to the book space. 

If they're not moved, they're likely to be mistaken for articles and/or definitions, and could end up deleted. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:24, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

== Important Persons ==

I'm worried that the titles refer to technologies rather than concepts and persons.  The folk history, particularly of the personal computer era, is full of famous names.  Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, Lee Felsenstein, Jef Raskin, Brenda Laruel, Alan Kay, Richard Stallman, Doug Englebart, Ted Nelson, Chris Crawford, Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, Grace Hopper, John McCarthy, Vint Cerf, Len Kleinrock, John Draper, Kevin Mitnick, Michael Hauben, and hundreds of others.

== Conventions ==
I moved this from the timeline page, since no one adopted and I see it as extremely hard to implement some innovations are in multiple fields for instance the Internet was both a software and a hardware innovation.

The proposal was that in the timeline page the:

Color codes:
* &lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt; will be used for hardware entries.
* &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; will be used for system software entries.
* &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; will be used for Internet entries.

Should be used. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:14, 24 February 2012 (UTC)

== Introduction to Python - text seemed added to wrong page ==

An anonymous editor added text about Python to the page on Object Oriented Programming, overwriting the previous text concerning OOP. I think they intended to create a new page, but only made a new link to the OOP page by mistake. I have reverted the edits to the OOP page, and corrected the link to the page on Python so that the author can add their text again to the correct page. I have not done this myself as it could confuse the attribution of the material to the correct author, but the Python text is still accessible in the page history of the OOP page.

There's a nice periodic chart on wikimedia commons at http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table

Scroll down a little.  You might want to use it here.

== Liquid Helium ==

Liquid Helium is not a separate state of matter - it's a liquid.  It should not be listed as a separate state. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:50, 16 April 2007 (UTC)
: Aren't there two different liquid states of helium? (Helium-I and Helium-II I think they're called). Though I think you're right, they're both liquid. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 01:49, 16 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

This page is going to be used to maintain a list of all the different versions available for the [[Control Systems]] book. Each different version will contain different amounts of material presented in different orders. Each version will target a different audience. Instructors can pick and choose which versions best meet their needs and the needs of their students. Readers can choose to print only the particular information that they are interested in reading. 

See the [[Talk:Control Systems/All Versions|Discussion Page]] to discuss the child versions of this book. All child versions should include the {{tl|Control Systems/Child}} template.

All printable versions contain the standard cover page, and all the necessary end-texts. '''Warning''': Printable versions are typically very large pages, and can take a long time to load in your browser.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{displaytitle|title=C++ Programming Wikibook Conventions}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
== Adopted Rules ==
If not stated otherwise here as a general rule, all guidelines from [[Wikibooks:Manual_of_Style]] are in effect.

The following conventions are the [[Wikibooks:Local manuals of style|local manual of style]] for the C++ Programming book in an attempt to provide stability and consistency to the project.

=== Page naming and structure [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===
We are using the ''slash convention'' as described in [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy]].&lt;br&gt;
'''Proposed:''' [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Conventions&amp;oldid=235696 never] '''Contested''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:32, 27 July 2010 (UTC) '''Changed:''' on the grounds of being the actual setup --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:32, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

=== One book with many faces [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===
There are two indexes: A chapter-by-chapter version and a all-in-one page version (via transclusion). New pages should be listed in both
the [[C++ Programming/All Chapters]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;[ [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/All_Chapters&amp;action=edit edit] ]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;  index and
the [[C++ Programming]] index.

=== Size of pages [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===
A chapter indexed from the main page should be on one Page. However, no single page should be larger than about 30k. Larger pages should be split up.

=== Use specialized topics [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===
By adding contributions, try to help us give some structure to the book, do so by creating as much different and separate chapters/sections and sub-sections possible using unique (if doable) specialized topics so to give the reader the most complete and logic understanding of the language, your are also encouraged to add empty ones, so future contributors my add to them.

=== Authors section [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===
Every person making non-trivial changes to this book may add themselves to the [[C++ Programming/About the Book/Authors|Authors]] section. This can be done by adding your name/alias and including a link to one of your wikimedia page, web-page or an active email address where you can be reached.

'''Proposed:''' 19 Sept 2005 '''Voted:''' 21 September 2005 '''Moved to adopted by:''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Level 1 Heading Nummeration  [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===
We are using level 1 headers (&lt;nowiki&gt;=header=&lt;/nowiki&gt;) for the parts. To allow transclusion, main submodules should always start with and have at most 1 level 2 header (&lt;nowiki&gt;==header==&lt;/nowiki&gt;). 

'''Proposed:''' 20 Sept 2005 '''Not Contested''', '''Moved to adopted by:''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Source code style [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===
To allow adoption from other sources, there is no mandatory brace / indentation style throughout the book for code examples. However, please be consistent within one example.

There is a non adoption of a single standard on styles (i.e.: brace style) so to make the work of importing any other snips of code easier, it also shows readers all the options they can make, so you can use the style you prefer and modify any existing code on the book, but authors are not expected to follow a particular style.

=== Common Programming Errors [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===
Common programming errors should pointed out throughout the book. 

'''Proposed:''' 18 Sept 2005 '''Not Contested''', '''Moved to adopted by:''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

This page is going to serve as a local manual of style for the [[Control Systems]] book. Guidelines listed in this page should be followed when adding new content to this book. Sections of the book not conforming to this manual should be changed. To discuss changes to the guidelines on this page, make a note on the [[Talk:Control Systems/Manual of Style|discussion page]].

== Page Formatting ==

Pages should all have the {{tl|Control Systems/Page}} template at the top of the page, and the {{tl|Control Systems/Nav}} template at the bottom of the page. These templates both take 2 optional arguments, the first one is a link to the previous page, and the second one is the link to the next page in the book. These links should be accurate.

== Examples ==

Examples should appear in the {{tl|TextBox}} template.

== Sidenotes ==

Side notes should appear in the {{tl|SideBox}} template.

== New Pages ==

When you create a new page, follow these steps:

#Update the [[Control Systems|main page TOC]] to show your new page.
#Format the page with the {{tl|Control Systems/Page}} and {{tl|Control Systems/Nav}} templates, as described above.
#Update the pages before and after your new page, so that their links point to your new page as appropriate.
#Add your new page into the [[Control Systems/Print version|full print version]] of this book, in an appropriate place. Make sure to use the {{tl|Print chapter heading}} template to lable the page. Use the {{tl|Print unit page}} template, if necessary, to start a new subject unit.
#Add your new page into any of the other [[Control Systems/Printable Versions|printable versions]], following the above guidelines, where appropriate. Not every page is appropriate to include into every print version.

== New Child Versions ==

&quot;Child versions&quot; represent suggested reading orders for the material in this book. To create a new child version, follow these steps:

#Add an entry to [[Control Systems/All Versions]].
#Create a new Table of Contents for your child version at &quot;Control Systems/(Child Version Name)&quot;, where '''(Child Version Name)''' is the title of your child version. Be sure to include the {{tl|Control Systems/Page}}, {{tl|Control Systems/Nav}}, and {{tl|Control Systems/Child}} templates on the Table of Contents page.
#Create a new print version at &quot;Control Systems/(Child Version Name)/Print version&quot;.
#List the length of your child version's printable version on the [[Control Systems/All Versions]] page.

==Rewrite Begun: 7 December 2006==
I'm currently a senior ME student and, as a project for the stupid holidays (today I gave my last final exam), I intend to make a serious textbook out of this. I will be adding content regularly until around 8 January, after which I may occasionally do so. There wasn't much content in the book to begin with, so I wiped it in favor of starting fresh. I don't mean to piss anyone off (likely will reuse it in the future when the book is further developed).

Stay tuned,&lt;BR&gt;

I'm going to be out for two weeks. I will do work before school resumes, but not much.

This is very nice, I'm quite jealous that you've been able to make something like this, good job Ben.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 03:31, 14 January 2007 (UTC)


I'm able to make something like this because I have nearly no social life. So, don't be jealous. Thanks, though.

[[User:Ben pcc|Ben pcc]] 19:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)


Am going to be busy with another project (modest homework that's turned into software development...) for maybe as long as a month. So, little or no work from me until then.

== Please choose another title ==

Could you please choose another title for you wikibook. Something like &quot;Applied PDEs&quot; or &quot;PDEs for Engineering Sciences&quot; or &quot;PDEs for Engineering Students&quot; would be more appropriate. I'm a mathematician working in PDEs. I must admit that even the start of your book is worlds away from what is done in mathematics of PDEs. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:128.131.37.74|128.131.37.74]] ([[User talk:128.131.37.74|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/128.131.37.74|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

:In the next half year, I will try to transform this wikibook into a book which is what mathematicians look for. --[[User:Mathmensch|Mathmensch]] ([[User talk:Mathmensch|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mathmensch|contribs]]) 01:45, 24 November 2013 (UTC)

::Hi [[User:Mathmensch|Mathmensch]], how interested in the existing contributed material are you?  I am considering requesting for this project to be moved a new book called Advanced Mathematics for Engineers and Scientists (leaving the space open for Partial Differential Equations), and might be able to keep the current PDEs material in there since it is more of the brief and applied nature an engineer would take it.  Do you think you'd be better off starting from scratch or would much of what's here be useful for you? [[User:Rememberlands|Rememberlands]] ([[User talk:Rememberlands|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rememberlands|contribs]]) 04:18, 26 November 2013 (UTC)
:::Actually, this might be a good idea (moving the current book and then starting from scratch). I thought I would just somehow include the current stuff, but starting from scratch would probably be a lot easier, because then I don't have to think so much about the structure of the book.
:::But if you move the book, please don't move the section about distributions, which I created some days ago and which might already be OK for the new book on PDEs. --[[User:Mathmensch|Mathmensch]] ([[User talk:Mathmensch|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mathmensch|contribs]]) 16:27, 26 November 2013 (UTC)

::::Ok. Let's move the book.  The easiest thing will probably be to bring your section back after recreating a new overall PDEs page. [[User:Rememberlands|Rememberlands]] ([[User talk:Rememberlands|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rememberlands|contribs]]) 19:46, 26 November 2013 (UTC)

::::The book is moved!  I could only move a page at a time, so your page has stayed put.  I'm leaving the various redirects for the time being.  Have fun!  [[User:Rememberlands|Rememberlands]] ([[User talk:Rememberlands|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rememberlands|contribs]]) 20:25, 26 November 2013 (UTC)

:::::I will probably do the most work in the christmas holidays, because I will be busy with studying and also working on [[Abstract_Algebra/Group_Theory/The_Sylow_Theorems|this]] too. Thanks for moving the other book. --[[User:Mathmensch|Mathmensch]] ([[User talk:Mathmensch|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mathmensch|contribs]]) 18:47, 27 November 2013 (UTC)


== Examples? ==

Could you please consider including real, worked out examples versus general, vague examples with undefined variables? Thanks!

I attempted to make this, and did produce something tasty, however it's not solid enough even after chilling for eight hours in the fridge to hold a sphere shape.  Will try again and post updates.

One of the beauties of UNIX/Linux are pipes. Pipes are used for redirecting STDOUT (standard out) to STDIN (standard in).

 $ command1 '''|''' command2

command1 standard output is redirected as standard input to command2.

== Overview ==

'''''Evanesco''''' is the Vanishing Spell, used for causing an object to disappear, almost like Disapparition.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This charm is mentioned only in passing; it is used to make objects vanish and in the books is most often seen used for cleaning. In a number of places in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] class, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] will use this charm to clear an incorrectly made potion out of a cauldron; on one occasion, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] used it to clear up a potion that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] wasn't done with yet. It is also used by Harry to clean [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]]'s cage, in the seventh book.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] is asked the question &quot;Where do Vanished objects go?&quot; by the Ravenclaw door-knocker, to which she replies &quot;Into non-being, which is to say, everything.&quot; This suggests that Vanished objects cease to exist, until they are re-conjured.

&lt;!-- A variation of the Evanesco spell, ''Vipera Evanesco'', was used by Professor Snape in the Dueling Club to make the snake summoned by Malfoy disappear. However, that was only in the film, not the books, if I recall correctly, and so should not be included here. --&gt;

== Analysis ==

This spell seems to be used for cleaning things out of containers; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Scourgify|Scourgify]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tergeo|Tergeo]], while similar in effect, seem to be used for cleaning things off surfaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Digital Rights Management (DRM)'''or ''Multimedia Content Security'' or '''Digital Watermarking'''

1. Digital Rights Management (DRM) can be viewed as an attempt to provide &quot;remote control&quot; of digital content. The required level of protection goes beyond simply delivering the digital contents--restriction on the use of the content must be maintained after it has been delivered. In other words, DRM requires &quot;persistent protection&quot;, i.e., protection that stays with the contents. 
 
2. Recent advances in multimedia document production, delivery and processing, including the wide availability of increasingly powerful devices for the production, communication, copying and processing of electronic documents, have made available a large number of new opportunities for the dissemination and consumption of multimedia content (audio, video, images, 3D models, …).. At the same time, these rapid developments have raised several important problems regarding intellectual property, digital rights management, authenticity, privacy, conditional access and security, which risk impeding the diffusion of new services. Multimedia data can undergo, during their 'life', a wide variety of (possibly lossy) data manipulations that does not modify their substance (e.g. a change in file format, some processing for quality enhancement, the extractions of subparts,..) and that are not even perceived by the human perception system. This particular characteristic makes sometimes ineffective the classical solutions for security based on cryptography, but on the other hand offer the opportunity to design new solutions exploiting the fact that different documents bearing the same semantic information can be judged as equivalent by the human perceptual system. Driven by the necessities outlined above, the last few years have seen the development of new tools to tackle the problems encountered in media security applications leading to the concept of Secure Media Technologies. Secure Media encompasses a wide range of diverse technological areas working together to cope with the complex problems characterizing this rapidly evolving field. Enabling technologies include watermarking, data hiding, steganography and steganalysis, cryptography, biometrics, fingerprinting, network security and digital forensics. In particular, there are presently research activities concerning the following areas:

a. Robust digital watermarking techniques for images and video sequences: they allow to robustly hide some data useful for proving the content ownership and then to track the copyright violations, identify the content, monitor its usage, etc. They are often designed to be used in the framework of a Digital Rights Management System for the protection of the Intellectual Property Rights. The robustness here means that the embedded information remains intact even after that the content has been altered. 

b. Digital watermarking techniques for 3D models: it is a more recent research area with respect to image and video watermarking. Since a mesh (geometrical representation of 3D objects) can't be easily represented in a frequency domain, it is not possible to directly apply to them transformations and filters in the frequency; processing methods for this kind of data then turn to ad hoc mathematical representations, that are different to the methods operating on other multimedia content.

c. Fragile or semi-fragile digital watermarking techniques for the authentication of images: these techniques allow to hide into an image some information useful to prove subsequently its authenticity. In this case, the embedded information is removed when the content is modified. It is possible to assure that an image has not been tampered, and in some cases also to locate the manipulations occurred that altered the original content of the image.

d. Fingerprinting: these techniques allow to unambiguously identify each copy of a multimedia content. In this way, it is possible to identify who, in a group of users in possession of a copy of a same document, illicitly distributed his/her own copy of the content, failing to meet possible limitations of use and distribution.

e. Digital forensic: they are processing techniques supporting detective activities to use multimedia content as an evidence of possible criminal acts. In our case, we are interested in proving if a image or a video sequence we have at disposal has been acquired with a given digital camera. 

f. Signal processing in the encrypted domain: it is a new research field studying new technologies to allow the processing of encrypted multimedia content without removing the encryption. Most of technological solutions proposed so far to cope with multimedia security simply tried to apply some cryptographic primitives on top of the signal processing modules. These solutions are based on the assumption that the two communicating parties trust each other, so that the encryption is used only to protect the data against third parties. In many cases, though, this is not the case. A possible solution to the above problems could consist in the application of the signal processing modules in the encrypted domain.

g. Steganography: it is the science of hiding sensitive messages into an apparently innocuous document in such a way that no one apart from the intended recipient knows of the existence of the message. In case of a multimedia document, the information is hidden by means of the application of not perceivable modifications.

h. Steganalysis: it is the science of detecting the presence into a document of messages hidden using steganography techniques, exploiting perceptual or statistical analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Biometrics'''

1. &quot;Biometrics&quot; is the science of human identity recognition based on physiological or behavioural characteristics that are unique to each individual. 
 
2. Due to recent advances in the use of Biometrics in Passport Documents, ATM, Credit Card, Cellular Phone, PDA, Airport Check-in, Electronic Banking, web Access, Network Logon, Laptops Data Security there are presently research activities concerning the following areas:

a. Advanced finger recognition: it focuses on the finger retrieval from large database which is crucial part of the automatic fingerprint identification system. Conventional exclusive fingerprint classification partitions fingerprints into a few pre-specific non-overlapping classes(usually 4 or 5 classes) based on the Henrry classes. This limits the efficiency the efficiency of the fingerprint indexing. The continuous fingerprint classification overcome limitation of the number of classes. However, the exhaustive search of the whole fingerprint database required by this approach could be time-consuming. Research is going on in sxploring the methods that inherits the merits of both the exclusive and continuous fingerprint classifications and overcomes the limitations and drawbacks of these two conventional approaches.   

b. Multi-scale image processing of the fingerprint image to enhance fingerprint verification accuracy: Multi-scale image processing provides an effective way to find the optimal image enhancement of the fingerprints, which is very important to improve the quality of heavily corrupted fingerprint images.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== why ps2pdf? ==

What's the good point of doing tex--&gt;ps--&gt;pdf to create a PDF if you can simply do tex--&gt; PDF? in the first (old) approach you get bad fonts, no hyperlinks, etc. Creating the PDF straight away you'll get a good document with high quality pictures and internal links, why shouldn't we suggest to use ''pdflatex'' whenever possible?? [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 13:07, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

You might be using a package like pstricks to draw lines etc. These won't appear in the PDF if you just run pdflatex. [[Special:Contributions/131.111.232.123|131.111.232.123]] ([[User talk:131.111.232.123|talk]]) 23:52, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

== How exactly do I create output from my *.tex source file? ==

This chapter lacks precise information on how exactly output files (*.pdf, *.dvi, *.eps, etc.) are obtained from the *.tex source file. I myself have downloaded MikTeX 2.7 and ''pdflatex'' is included. I also have my *.tex file. Where do I place it and how exactly do I use this ''pdflatex'' plugin to produce an output file?
:See the section &quot;A Typical Command Line Session&quot;. The details regarding ''pdflatex'' aren't there, but they should be (and I'll add it). You might also want to consider installing a nice editor to write the tex files, and compile the PDF, etc. documents by pressing buttons (rather than typing commands from a command prompt). I'd recommend Texmaker, which is free. From this program, I just click on the &quot;PDFLAT&quot; button, then the Adobe reader button, and then I can see the output. &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;[[User:Mwtoews|mt]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; 22:29, 6 September 2007 (UTC)
:Lots of tex editors have compliers built right into them. I use TeXnicCenter and it has a button &quot;build and view current file&quot; that does the wacky command line stuff for you. Perhaps the command line is used because there's such a huge amount of tex editors out there (with no real standard version I guess), or because of a million other reasons, but if you're using a tex editor that's fairly mainstream, there should be a button that does the cmd line stuff for you. -ai 1:24, 26 May 2008

== Explanation of environments ==
Where can I get more information about &lt;tt&gt;environments&lt;/tt&gt; which is used by &lt;tt&gt;\begin&lt;/tt&gt; command? These &lt;tt&gt;environments&lt;/tt&gt; are used in many pages like in &quot;Title Creation&quot; but I can not find in the right side floating TOC the explanation of them.

== UTF? ==

In instructionto make first document:
:Edit/Create your LaTeX input file. This file must be plain ASCII text. On Unix all the editors will create just that. On Windows you might want to make sure that you save the file in ASCII or Plain Text format. 

But in internationalizations topic are mentioned that I can write unicode characters as well. So file cannot by ASCII!! After reopening I'll get mess. But if saving in UTF-8, BOM is allowed or not?
     
:If you save in UTF-8, in order for the characters to appear correct, one must add \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}.[[Special:Contributions/187.106.55.135|187.106.55.135]] ([[User talk:187.106.55.135|discuss]]) 06:33, 25 March 2011 (UTC)

== Special Characters ==

The special characters &lt; and &gt; are not explained, i get the spanish version of ? and ! (turned by 180 degree) instead. Would be quite helpful if this chapter would explain why.</text>

{{recipe}} | [[:Category:Fermented food recipes|Fermented food recipes]]

'''Sauerkraut''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] vegetable food made from cabbage. This is a basic recipe that produces a tangy sauerkraut with live bacteria. No cooking is required.

==Ingredients==

* 1 large (2.5 [[Cookbook:Kg|kg]] - 5 lb) fresh [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Salt|non-iodised salt]]

==Procedure==

# Clean and dry a large (3 litre) preserves jar or crock, chopping board, and large bowls if needed
# Quarter the cabbage and remove the core
# [[Cookbook:Slicing|Slice]] the cabbage finely or thickly, as you prefer
# Optional: bruise the sliced cabbage by beating with a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]] or [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]]
# Layer the cabbage in the jar or crock, sprinkling salt in between layers
# Pack tightly into the jar, leaving 1cm space at the top; don't seal the jar yet
# Juice should rise to top of jar as you tightly pack the cabbage in; if not, add a little [[Cookbook:Water|chlorine-free water]]

==Fermentation==

Don't seal the jar while it is fermenting, as it will build up gas pressure and might break the jar. Just cover with a cloth, or cling-wrap. Set the jar in a bowl or on a plate, so that any juice that might overflow will be collected and won't make a mess.

The sauerkraut will be fermented in about a week. Wipe any excess liquid from around the jar, and put the lid on tightly before moving it to a cool place (e.g. the refrigerator) to mature. It is ready to eat after the first week, but will improve with age and as the bacteria slowly consume the more complex sugars in the cabbage.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The salt used should be non-iodised salt if possible - e.g. pickling salt, kosher salt. This is because the iodine in iodised table salt will inhibit the fermentation a little. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the iodine.
*Add other vegetables, fruits, or spices for variations, e.g.
**[[Cookbook:Juniper Berry|juniper berries]]
**[[Cookbook:Apple|cored and sliced apple]]
**[[Cookbook:Pineapple|diced pineapple]]
**[[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
**[[Cookbook:Chili|chili]]
**[[Cookbook:Grater|grated]] [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]
*The cabbage can be quickly sliced to a regular thickness by using a [[Cookbook:Mandoline|mandoline]].

== Discussion ==
This is similar to the horizontal tab menu.  It uses the CSS-3 target pseudo element.

==Radiation brain injury==
'''''For brain tumor patients after brain irradiation:'''''
*'''Introduction'''
**Radiation induced injury is manifested by fatigue, confusion, and cognitive impairment.
**Imaging studies show demyelination, decreased cerebral perfusion, decreased cerebral metabolism, and decreased cerebral N-acetyl aspartate (ref: PMID 16549835)


*'''Wake Forest; 2007''' PMID 17869448 -- &quot;A Phase III, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial of d-threo-methylphenidate HCl in Brain Tumor Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy.&quot; (Butler JM Jr, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Sep 13; [Epub ahead of print])
**Randomized. 68 patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors. Arm 1) prophylactic d-MPH 5mg BID -&gt; 15mg BID vs. Arm 2) observation. Outcome measure QOL and cognitive function
**Outcome: No difference in fatigue, QOL, or cognitive function
**Conclusion: Prophylactic d-MPH not beneficial in brain tumor patients

*'''Donepezil (Aricept)''' - acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
**Wake Forest, '''2006''' (2001-2003) - PMID 16549835 &amp;mdash; &quot;Phase II study of donepezil in irradiated brain tumor patients: effect on cognitive function, mood, and quality of life.&quot; Shaw EG et al. J Clin Oncol. 2006 Mar 20;24(9):1415-20.
***Phase II. 5 mg/d x 6 weeks, then 10 mg/d x 18 weeks. Total of 24 weeks, followed by washout. Evaluated by multiple cognitive tests
***35 pts receiving partial or whole brain RT &gt; 6 months before the study; KPS &gt;= 70%; no evidence of tumor progression; steroids allowed but had to be stable or decreasing dose.
***24 of 35 pts remained on study for 24 weeks. Significant improvement from baseline to 24 weeks for attention/concentration, verbal memory, and figural memory and a trend for verbal fluency. Improvement in confused mood and a trend for fatigue and anger. Improved health-related QOL. 48% of pts chose to continue taking donepezil after the 24 weeks.

==Driving impairment==
Imposing driving restrictions on patients with brain tumors or neurologic symptoms from cancer

*See [[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Brain_Metastases/Guidelines|Official guidelines]]


*'''U.Wisconsin, 2011''' PMID 20972603 -- &quot;Current practices of driving restriction implementation for patients with brain tumors.&quot; (Thomas S, J Neurooncol. 2011 Jul;103(3):641-7.)
**Survey of U.S. practitioners
**&quot;This survey highlights the lack of consensus regarding the responsibilities of physicians treating brain tumor patients in designing and enforcing driving restrictions. We propose that a panel of experts generate driving restriction guidelines to be used in conjunction with objective testing of motor and sensory impairment. These would aid practitioners in developing individualized driving restrictions for every brain tumor patient.&quot;



==Review==
*'''Wake Forest; 2006''' PMID 17032563 -- &quot;Managing the cognitive effects of brain tumor radiation therapy.&quot; (Butler JM, Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2006 Nov;7(6):517-23.)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''diagonal matrix''', &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, is a square matrix in which the entries outside of the main diagonal are zero. The '''main diagonal''' of a square matrix consists of the entries which run from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. 

In the example below the main diagonal are &lt;math&gt;a_{11}, a_{22}, ..., a_{nn}\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \quad A=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{nn}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are numerous recorders that is available, be it a standalone hardware or a software for your computer.

==Hardware==
*4-track tape recorder
*8-track tape recorder using 1-inch , open-reel tape
*16-track tape recorder using 1-inch , open-reel tape
*16-track tape recorder using 2-inch , open-reel tape
*24-track tape recorder using 2-inch , open-reel tape

==Software==
===Commercial===
*'''DK Hit Kit''' ($15 CDN). Cheap, comes with a lite version of emagic Logic. Can edit 8 audio track and 16 midi track. Comes with a good quality mic too, easily the price of the Hit Kit itself. For Windows and OS X.


===Free and Open Source===
*'''[http://audacity.sourceforge.net Audacity]''': Released under GNU.  As many audio tracks as your computer can handle, and have lots of effects and plugin. For Windows, OS X, Linux, BSD, and Solaris.
*'''[http://ardour.org Ardour]''': Released under GNU. 64 audio tracks and 16 MIDI tracks available. For Linux and OS X
*'''[http://www.dynebolic.org Dyne:bolic]''' Multimedia oriented LiveCD Linux that includes Audacity, Ardour, drum machine, and audio streaming engine, as well as tools to edit videos. Version 1.4.1 Can run on any 586+ PC (with CD reader) with 64mb RAM and X-Box; version 2.2 can run on most computer made within last 2 years.

I would recommend '''Audacity''' if possible. Yes, I do know that Audacity is not perfect, and many commericial software ARE better. However, there are a few reasons why I would recommend Audacity:
#It's free and libre, and suitable for home recording... and semi-professional graded too if needed
#It can be used for any operating system, not just Windows or Linux or Mac. This allow any computers that have Audacity program to open Audacity project files, without the need for a Live CD (which is useless on a Mac, as far as i know).
Get version 1.3.2b. for the most part, it is stable enough.
The user manual for Audacity is located at [http://audacityteam.org/manual/index.php?title=Main_Page here].

==Seting up==
#Get Audacity 1.3.2b [http://audacity.sourceforge.net here], and install it.
#Get LAME ver. 3.97 release [http://www.rarewares.org/ here]. Get the bundle version.
#Extract the lame_enc.dll from the Bundle, and place it inside the Audacity folder.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Process Control? ==

The manipulation of an object (actuation device) to maintain a parameter within an acceptable deviation from an ideally required condition. 

There are two basic process control philosophies, feedback and feedforward control.
=== Feedback Control ===
In feedback control, the controlled variable is measured and compared with a set-point. The deviation between the controlled variable and the set-point is the error signal. The error signal is then used to reduce the deviation of controlled variable from set-point.
==== Direct Acting Control ====
If the controlled variable increases as the manipulated variable increases, then direct acting control is used.
==== Reverse Acting Control ====

=== Feedforward Control ===
=== Advanced Control  ===

== Mathematical Modeling ==

=== Conservation Laws ===

=== Process Reaction Curve ===

=== Statistical Models ===

== Glossary ==

; Actuator : The mechanical device that cause the activation or movement of a final control element.

; Direct Synthesis : 

; Final Control Element : A physical device whose activation or movement causes a change in a dynamic process.  In process control, the most common final control elements are control valves.

; Frequency Domain : 

; Internal Model Control :

; IMC-PID Tuning : A method for PID tuning that selects tuning parameters to approximate an IMC-derived controller.

; Ladder Logic : A semi-graphical programming language used to represent control algorithms.  The language is expressed using symbols for logic devices.  The arrangement of the device symbols and their connections has the appearance of a ladder.

; Laplace Transform : An integral transformation from time domain to Laplace domain.  Given a function of time &lt;math&gt; f(t) &lt;/math&gt;, the Laplace transform is given by the following

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; F(s) = \int_0^\infty \! f(t)\; e^{-s t} dt &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:The use of &lt;math&gt; F(s) &lt;/math&gt; to represent the Laplace transform of &lt;math&gt; f(t) &lt;/math&gt; is a common convention; however, in dynamics and control it is common to use &lt;math&gt; f(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(s) &lt;/math&gt; to represent a time-domain function and its Laplace transform, respectively.

; PID Controller : 

; PLC : '''P'''rogrammable '''L'''ogic '''C'''ontroller, a microprocessor-based electronic device for implementing control algorithms.

In the late 20th Century, permaculture started to become used as a design tool by gardeners and farmers as a way to ecologically design gardens.
Permaculture had 3 main guiding design ideas:
# Care for all the people.
# Care for the planet.
# Pass on any surplus created in a system. For example, if a wall retains heat, pass on the heat to a plant that needs it; if a plant provides shelter, place it on a wall that needs cooling.

'''Bubur Candil''' are traditional Indonesian glutinous rice balls in a sweet soup

==Ingredients==
*225 gram [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|glutinous rice flour]] 
*120 gram [[Cookbook:Tapioca Starch|tapioca flour]] 
*175 ml [[cookbook:water|water]] 
*¼ tsp [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] 

===Sauce===
*750 ml [[cookbook:water|water]] 
*250 ml [[cookbook:Coconut Milk|coconut milk]] 
*125 ml diluted [[cookbook:Gula Jawa|gula jawa]] (palm sugar)
*1 piece pandan leaves (or optionally, some [[Cookbook:Pandan Essence|pandan paste]])
*¼ tsp [[cookbook:salt|salt]]

===Condiments===
*300 ml [[cookbook:Coconut Milk|coconut milk]], boiled for few minutes 
 
==Procedure==
#Mix Glutinous Rice Flour and Tapioca Flour until well mixed. Make a well in the middle, pour in water and salt little by little. Mix well with hand until it formed a soft dough, so you can make a little balls shape with 1 cm diameter. Make sure that the dough is not to hard, if necessary add a bit more of water. 
#Boil a lot of water in a big stock pot. Put the little balls one by one in the boiling water. Cook for about 5 minutes until they emerge on the surface of the boiling water. Take them out and drain. 
#For the sauce, mix all the sauce ingredients and boil until bubbly. Place the rice balls in the sauce. Cook for further 20 minutes and set aside. 

''To serve, pour the coconut milk on top of Bubur Candil. Best to serve while it's hot and this dish is great in Winter''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Introduction to The Elements'''==

The whole universe is built of matter. Right now, you are surrounded by it. The air we breathe is matter, and all the things you see around you are matter. The odors you smell are matter and the sounds you hear are caused by the movement of matter in your ears.

Matter is everything that takes up space and has weight. Scientists say that matter has volume and mass. Matter is made up of tiny building blocks called atoms. The purest type of atom is called an element. The elements are what give matter its different qualities.

Today we can see atoms by using a special instrument called an ''electron microscope''. An electron microscope lets us see things that are millions of times smaller than the things we can see with a powerful optical microscope.

Most of the matter around us has more than one element in it. But some matter is made up of just one element. If you have ever held a diamond, for example, it is made of just one element, Carbon. Surprisingly, the graphite in a pencil that you use for drawing or writing is also Carbon, just its atoms are differently arranged.

Some other examples of matter that contain just one element are:

* An aluminium drink can
* 24 carat gold
* The helium gas in a balloon that floats upwards
* Cast iron garden railings
* Lead sheeting used by builders on the roofs of houses

NOTE: These examples are not truly pure elements, because metals will always have tiny amounts of other elements present as impurities.

Not many elements occur as a pure substance. Some elements like Gold and Sulphur do naturally occur as a pure substance, as does Carbon when it is a diamond. But most substances are made up of several elements bonded together. For example, water has the chemical formula H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O meaning that one molecule of water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

Ancient people knew how to extract the element iron from iron oxide. They heated iron oxide dug from the ground with charcoal. The iron was originally a &quot;compound&quot; of two elements, iron and oxygen. By heating them, they separated. The oxygen joined with the carbon in the charcoal leaving the purified iron behind.

The [[Wikijunior The Elements/Periodic Table|Periodic Table of Elements]] is a table showing the different kinds of elements arranged according to their different characteristics. Much of it was worked out many years ago. So far we have identified 90 elements that occur naturally. There are approximately 25 more that are man-made.

[[Image:Card-mille-1975b-roll.png|right|200px]]
'''Mille Bornes''' (also '''Mille Bournes''') is a [[w:France|French]] card game.  In the United States, Mille Bornes is published by Parker Brothers and is commonly available in game stores, as well as toy stores and department store]]s. There are also several computer-based versions. It is believed to be based on Touring (card game)|Touring, an earlier American card game.

Some Mille Bornes decks are printed in both English and French language. In the Netherlands, this game is known as ''rijwielspel'', and deals with cycling instead of driving. The hazards and distances are different, but the mechanics of the game are exactly the same.

The premise of Mille Bornes is that the players are in a Auto racing.  Each &quot;race&quot;, or hand, is usually 700 miles or kilometers long (1000 for the standard 4-player game), but the first player to complete that distance exactly has the option to declare an ''extension'' in which case the race becomes 1000 miles, hence the name of the game which means &quot;one thousand milestones&quot;.  The object of the game is to reach 5000 points, which normally takes several hands.

Mille Bornes is listed in the GAMES Magazine Hall of Fame. 

== Playing the game ==

=== Deck ===

Mille Bornes is played with a special, unusual deck of cards. There are '''Hazards''', '''Remedies''', '''Safeties''', and '''Distance cards''' (km stones). Each hazard is corrected by a corresponding remedy and prevented by a corresponding safety. The object of the game is achieved by playing Distance cards. 

Note that the '''Right of Way''' card is unique in that it protects against both the '''Speed Limit''' and '''Stop''' hazards.

Included in the deck are also nonplayable cards that list the playable cards and summarize the scoring. In some decks, some of these are printed entirely in French.

=== Play ===

Mille Bornes is based very loosely on the Rummy family of card games. The deck is shuffled and 6 cards are dealt to each player; the remainder becomes a draw pile and a discard pile forms next to it. Each player's turn begins with a draw of one card and a play of one card, so that each player always holds 6 cards at the end of his turn. If he cannot play he must discard. Discarded cards are dead and cannot be taken for any reason. 

Each player (or team) builds a tableau; in team play, only one is built for a single team. This tableau is divided into Battle, Speed, Distance, and Safety areas; cards in the Battle and Speed areas are stacked so that only the top card shows. The example shows a typical tableau midway through a game. 

Hazards and Remedies (with the exception of Speed Limit and End of Limit) are played in the Battle Area, where a Roll card is shown in the example. Speed Limit and End of Limit cards are played in their own area. Distance (km stone) cards are played according to value; it's common to play the 200 km cards distinctly, rather than fanned. Safety cards are played along the top of the tableau; note that the horizontal placement of the Extra Tank card in the example has a special significance. 

[[Image:MB-tableau1.svg|336px|right]]
In turn, a player may choose to play one of the following: 

* A Distance card on his own tableau ''if'' a Roll card is showing in his Battle area

* A Remedy on top of a corresponding Hazard ''if'' one is showing in his Battle area

* An End of Limit on top of a Speed Limit ''if'' one is showing in his Speed area

* A Hazard on top of his ''opponent's'' Roll ''if'' one is showing ''and'' his opponent has not already played the corresponding Safety

* A Safety in his own Safety area (at any time)

* A Roll card in his own Battle area ''if'' a Stop or Remedy is showing, or if his Battle area is empty

Note that a Hazard cannot be played unless one's opponent is &quot;moving&quot;, except for the Speed Limit. 

Once an Accident, Out of Gas, or Flat Tire Hazard has been played, and the appropriate Repair card played as a counter; one must next play a Roll card to get &quot;moving&quot; again. 

Playing a Safety corrects the corresponding Hazard ''and also'' protects against future Hazards of this type. However, when the Safety is played normally, a Roll must still be played before any Distance cards. Whenever the Safety is played, the same player draws another card immediately and plays again. It is possible to play another Safety and another, each time drawing a card before playing again. 

When a player's speed is limited (as shown in the example) he may only play 25 and 50 km cards. No more than two 200 km cards may be played by any team in a single hand. 

The Right of Way card both remedies and protects against Stop and Speed Limit Hazards; if a player (or team) has played this card then he (or they) need not display a Roll card in order to &quot;move&quot;; any Stop or Speed Limit showing is removed to the discard pile at the time the Right of Way card is played. However, the player is still vulnerable to other Hazards. 

A player ''may'' always discard, even if he has a legal play available. If a player cannot play in any other way he ''must'' discard. 

Under no circumstances may a Distance card be played that would put one's total over the race goal of 1000 km. 

Play continues until either: 

* One player (or team) reaches exactly 1000 km in total Distance cards; or

* Every player has played or discarded all his cards. 

Note that play continues after the draw pile is exhausted, each player playing or discarding one card per turn. 

==== Coup Fourré ====

In the event that a player holds the corresponding Safety ''at the moment'' when a Hazard is played in his Battle area, he may call ''&quot;Coup Fourré&quot;'' and immediately play the Safety in his own Safety area; when doing so the Safety is placed horizontally (as the Extra Tank is shown in the example). The Hazard is removed to the discard pile, revealing the Roll card beneath it. As when any Safety is played, the player who calls ''Coup Fourré'' draws another card at once and plays again. Play resumes to ''his'' left, not to that of he who played the offending Hazard; thus any intervening players lose their turns. 

Note that because the Hazard is removed and not merely corrected by the ''Coup Fourré'', a Roll card now shows and Distance cards may be played immediately. This is an advantage over playing a Safety later (normally), when it merely corrects the Hazard and a Roll card is still required to &quot;move&quot;.  The exception is the Right of Way card; as soon as it is played (normally or by ''Coup Fourré'') the player is considered to be &quot;moving&quot; (unless he suffers from another Hazard). 

The Safety may only be played as a ''Coup Fourré'' immediately after the offending Hazard; as soon as the next player plays or discards the opportunity is lost.

==== Extension ====

''Mille'' means 1000 and the game is normally played to a total of 1000 km. In some variations it may be agreed that the goal is 700 km, instead. If one player reaches this total then he may choose either to end the hand immediately and collect the appropriate scores for trip completion; or to call '''Extension''', in which case the hand continues to a goal of 1000 km. One must still reach the goal of 700 km exactly either to win the hand or call for extension. 

Trip completion itself is worth 400 points in either case; but there is a bonus for the extension itself. Note that it is possible to reach 700 km, call for extension, and fail to reach 1000 km. If one's opponents reach 1000 km first, ''they'' collect all trip completion scores and bonuses.

=== Scoring ===
When a hand ends it is scored with the following points:

In a 2-player game, the maximum score that can be made in one hand is 5,000 points. In a standard 4-player game there is no extension, so the maximum score is 4,800. In a 3-player or 6-player game, two shutout bonuses are achievable, yielding a perfect score of 5,500.

Note that some points are scored even if a side does not complete a trip; it is possible for the completing side to score fewer points than their opponents. If the hand ends by exhaustion rather than by completion, each side still scores its distance and safety points. 

According to the printed rules distributed by Parker Brothers, a game continues until one or both sides reaches a cumulative point total of 5,000. If both sides go over 5,000 during the same hand, the higher point total wins the game. When the game is played for fun the exact point total is irrelevant, so long as one is higher. Note that it is possible for the game to end in a tie, in which case the rules are silent. 

If the game is played for money, then generally the point difference is paid from the loser to the winner, and every point is significant.

=== With larger or smaller groups ===

The game is normally played with 4 players in two teams of two each. Each team shares only one tableau. Either player may make a ''Coup Fourré'' in response to a Hazard. 

When 4 players are not available, the game may be played with some variations. 

==== 2 or 3 player version ====

Three players play cutthroat, each one for himself. In some versions, a player may only play Hazards on the person to his left.

Some rulebooks say that one of each Hazard should be removed, since not having a partner makes it harder to hold a full set of Remedies. 

This version is usually played to 700 km with the Extension option, but the normal goal of 1000 km is also playable.

==== 6 player version ====

This is theoretically possible as two teams of three or three teams of two, but isn't really practical. It is played to 700 km with the Extension option.

=== Strategy ===

As in most card games the most important skill is remembering what cards have been played or discarded. ''Who'' has discarded may be quite as important as ''what''. 

As in other games of the Rummy family, one may spend many turns discarding while waiting for a needed card. It is vital to spend this time improving one's hand; so one must constantly re-evaluate one's hand to determine which card is most discardable. Often this devolves into a choice between the least of several evils. 

==== By card ====

'''Safeties:'''

* The Right of Way card is the most valuable in the deck. Every effort should be made to delay playing it normally, as it can be played in ''Coup Fourré'' to a total of 9 Hazards. 

* All Safeties ''should'' be retained against the corresponding Hazard, as a ''Coup Fourré'' is worth bonus points. 

* Safeties may ''always'' be played and at any time, so there is no excuse for being caught with one in hand at trip completion (and absurd to discard it). Watch the other side's Distance total. 

: Ordinarily, when one side reaches 800 km (or 500 if playing to 700) it is time to play all one's Safeties, since a single 200 km would allow the other side to go out. However there are exceptions in which one might retain a Safety while still hoping to use it in ''Coup Fourré'': 

:* In 2 or 3 player games if another player is &quot;stopped&quot; due to some Hazard (not Stop or End of Limit) then there is no risk of his going out immediately since he must first correct the Hazard before playing any Distance. But in team play the other side will have two opportunities to play -- one partner correcting the Hazard with a Safety and taking the extra turn to play a Roll card, then the other partner playing the fatal 200 km. If the needed Safety is known to be unavailable to the threatening team then one may continue to hold one's own Safety, as it will take 3 distinct turns for the opponents to correct the Hazard, Roll, and play any Distance. 

:* In 2 or 3 player games another player may be &quot;stopped&quot;, having corrected the Hazard, while waiting for a Roll card; or may be &quot;stopped&quot; with a Stop. In this case it ''may'' be safe to retain a Safety for the moment. This depends on the possibility that the threatening player may play the Right of Way card and immediately follow it with Distance, ending the hand. 

:* If the other side is &quot;stopped&quot; due to some Hazard and ''all'' of the corresponding Remedies and Safety have been seen then of course they are going no further and there is no threat to catch one's Safety in one's hand. The same may be said when (unusually) all Roll cards and the Right of Way have been seen. 

:* Although a km total of 800 is clearly threatening, a total of 600 is hazardous if one's opponents have not yet played any 200 km cards. (Recall that it is only permitted to play two of these in a hand.) A total of 700 threatens if only one 200 km card has been played. However, note that odd combinations of Distance, such as 650 km, are not threatening, since no possible combination of two Distance cards could put one's opponents out. 

:* In 2 or 3 player games one's opponents have only a single opportunity to play before one's own chance comes again, so it is easier to determine if one must relinquish a Safety. 500 (to a goal of 700) is a threat if a 200 km is still available; 550 is not; 600 certainly is; and 650 is threatening even if one's opponent's speed is limited. 

:* Don't be led astray by the relative values of playing a Safety normally or by ''Coup Fourré''. The former is worth 100 points, the latter a total of 400; so it's tempting to wait. But a corresponding Hazard may remain unplayed; you or your partner may draw it or your opponents may not choose to play it against you. The 100 is a sure thing -- ''if'' you are not caught with the Safety in your hand. 

'''Remedies:'''

* There are 3 each of Accident, Out of Gas, and Flat Tire Hazards (2 each if one has been removed before play). When all of one type has been seen, there's no need to keep the corresponding Remedy or Safety in one's hand. The former may be discarded and the latter played normally. 

* There are 4 Speed Limit Hazards (or 3 if one has been removed); again, once all have been seen there is no need to keep any End of Limit Remedies. However the Right of Way should probably be retained. 

* There are only 5 Stop cards, but it's not wise to discard Roll cards because you've seen all the Stops. You may still need Rolls in order to get &quot;moving&quot; after another Hazard. 

* It's probably wise to retain one of each major Remedy if at all possible; if no corresponding Hazard has been seen, it's essential. It's probably unwise to keep ''two'' of the same Remedy and certainly pointless to do so if only one corresponding Hazard remains. 

* Discarding a Remedy leads one's opponents to the natural conclusion that one may have the corresponding Safety in hand (or at least another of the same Remedy), thus discouraging them from retaining or playing that Hazard. This opens the door to an element of '''bluff''' and the possibility of confusing the other team. If one has a reputation of bluffing then discarding a Remedy may provoke the Hazard, permitting one to ''Coup Fourré''; if one has a reputation for &quot;honesty&quot;, then it may be better not to telegraph one's riches by discarding the Remedy. 

'''Hazards:'''

* Stop and Speed Limit are minor Hazards, the former corrected with a mere Roll and the latter not even entirely &quot;stopping&quot; the opposition. The other, major Hazards are more valuable. 

* Retaining two or more of the same Hazard may be dubious. If the corresponding Safety is available to the other team then both Hazards may be rendered useless at a stroke. 

* If one's opponent's have already played a given Safety then all corresponding Hazards are worthless; if the Safety is unavailable to them then the Hazards gain in value. 

* Count played and discarded Remedies. Each increases the value of the corresponding Hazard and of each remaining Remedy of the same type. 

'''Distance:'''

* Distance cards are numerous and usually should be discarded before other cards. Discard smaller Distance cards first. 

* The need to reach the race goal ''exactly'' imposes certain restrictions on the combinations that may be played. It's common to reach a Distance total of, say, 975 km and lose the hand while waiting for a final 25 km; any other Distance cards are useless. It may be wise to hold a 25 km against such a possibility. 

* Since 100 km cards are relatively common, one may wish to hesitate before playing smaller values unless one also has others in hand. The closer to the end of the hand, the more important this becomes. When the other team seems about ready to complete a trip it's easy to get flustered and play a lone 25 or 50, because that's all one has got; but it might be wiser to wait and see if another 100 is drawn. 

* Playing a lone 50 km card requires that one later play one of the following combinations (to arrive at a round point total): one other 50, two 25s, or two 75s. Thus this is fairly safe. 

* Playing a lone 25 km requires a later play of: one 75, one 50 and one 25, or three more 25s. Since one may well have discarded several 25s this may be a risky play. 

* Playing a lone 75 km requires a later play of one 75 and one 50, or of one 25. Thus this is the most risky Distance play. It's safer to wait until one has a pair of 75s before playing either, especially close to the end. 

* It may be better to discard a 75 km before discarding 25s and 50s -- because of the above-noted disadvantage and also because a 75 exceeds a possible Speed Limit. 

* If a player or team has already played two 200 km cards, then any others are worthless. Likewise, there's no need to keep more than two in hand.

==== By phase of play ====

'''Opening:''' 

If you are dealt the Right of Way card, since everyone technically has a Stop, you may play it immediately before anyone else plays as a 'Coup Fourre'. This means you never need a roll and you may draw 2 cards and play one. One may or may not have a Roll card initially dealt; one may or may not have a Hazard initially dealt; one may or may not have first play. Since the other team's hands are completely unknown at first, the primary determinate of opening strategy is one's aggressiveness. 

* If one has first play and a Roll card, it's clearly best to play it. 

* If you have first play but no Roll card, look for a Speed Limit card before discarding; it is the only Hazard you can play when your opponent is not &quot;moving&quot;. 

* Lacking a Roll card, you might be tempted to play Right of Way on first play. (See above)''Don't if you have already drawn a card or if someone else has taken a turn.'' Hold it against possible ''Coup Fourré'' as the chances are very good for this card. 

* If the other team has first play, or you are forced to discard on first play, then watch discards closely; don't just draw to the Roll. 

* You often face the situation where your opponent has played Roll and now it is your turn; you hold both a Roll and one or more Hazards. It's aggressive to play the Hazard; Parker Brothers recommends playing the Roll instead. If you have a major Hazard it may be wise to play it, especially if you are fairly well-off in Remedies and Roll cards generally; your opponent may have to Remedy the Hazard, then play a Roll, by which time you will already have played your Roll and some Distance. If you can only play a minor Hazard it's probably unwise; a single Roll will get your opponent moving again after a Stop, while a Speed Limit may not interfere at all with his coming out with a small Distance card. 

: Note that regardless of the Hazard played, your opponent may well ''Coup Fourré'', playing Distance immediately and adding points to the insult. Against this risk is the hope of holding the other team to a Shut Out. 

* Until you have played ''some'' Distance, you face a potential Shut Out yourself. If your opponent ''has'' played Distance, you must bend your efforts to breaking Shut Out ahead of every other consideration. 

* Keep a small Distance card in hand when waiting to get &quot;moving&quot;. This is better than an End of Limit card; you might see two or three Speed Limits played on your team and not be able to move when you get that Roll. Better to discard the End of Limit or a larger Distance card. 

'''Middle Game:'''

* Never forget to draw before playing. Who knows? The draw may be the card you need. 

* Be alert for Hazards played on your team. It's exasperating to miss one's chance for ''Coup Fourré''. 

* If you have large Distance in hand, play it at once instead of an uncertain Hazard. If you have only small Distance then the Hazard is more attractive. Of course, if you know your opponent will have trouble with the Hazard then it's a good play. 

* Remember that Speed Limit is a weak card; your opponent may still make good progress 50 km at a time. It's generally unwise to play Speed Limit on a &quot;stopped&quot; opponent; he may ''Coup Fourré'' with the Right of Way card even if he cannot then play any Distance. 

* Constantly be ready to re-evaluate the relative strengths of the cards you hold in light of those you have seen. Play strong Hazards before weak ones; discard worthless cards before useful ones and cards of lesser use before those more likely to be useful. 

* Since there are 3 of each major Hazard (perhaps only 2), it is, relatively speaking, fairly likely that you will face each one at least once. So it is wise to keep a full set of Remedies (or corresponding Safeties) at first. However, with each Hazard seen the risk of taking another of the same Hazard falls -- and so does the value of the Remedy. 

* If you have corrected a Hazard with a Remedy and have no Roll card, one may play Right of Way normally to get &quot;moving&quot; again ''and'' play Distance on the same turn. One forgoes an ordinarily-good chance at ''Coup Fourré'' for certain Distance. This is a great way to break a difficult Shut Out. 

'''End of Hand:'''

* When you near trip completion it is mandatory to take care to go out evenly; going over the trip limit is not allowed. You may want to put together ''all'' of the last 200 km in your hand before playing any of it. 

* When your opponent is getting ready to go out and you are far from completion you may want to discard Remedies quickly. Your situation is desperate and you will need a lot of Distance to overtake; if you take a Hazard and cannot go at all you may not have lost much. 

* Play for fun and play for money imposes different end game strategies. In play for fun, all that matters is exceeding 5000 points; if necessary, exceeding the other team as well. There is no need to take any risks if you can win without them. Playing for money, every point counts and it may be a good gamble to go for the Extension or ''Coup Fourré''. 

'''Extension:'''

When playing with the possibility of Extension, the decision (when reaching 700 km) whether to go out immediately or call for the Extension is critical. The Extension itself is worth 200 points; there is also the opportunity to score another 300 points' worth of Distance. There is also considerable risk. 

Generally, Extension should be used to aggravate one's existing superior position. Lacking overwhelming superiority, Extension may backfire on the caller. 

* The safest time to call for Extension is when one is protected against all possible Hazards -- by holding at least one appropriate Remedy ''and'' one or more Roll cards, by holding or having played the appropriate Safety, or by exhaustion of that Hazard. 

* It may be wiser to call an Extension when one's opponent is already facing an intractable Hazard. Holding, say, two Accident cards ''and'' the Driving Ace when several Repairs have already been played places one in a strong position for Extension. 

* Be careful to avoid Extension unless one has the needed 300 km in hand unless sufficient cards remain in the draw pile. 

* Let us say that '''Blue''' has played a total of 300 km and is &quot;stopped&quot; due to a Flat Tire when '''Red''' reaches 700 km. Red chooses to extend, hoping for an additional 500 points. Before Red reaches 1000 km, Blue corrects the Hazard and rolls on to 900 km. Red completes the trip and scores 500 more points than he would have had he ''not'' called for Extension. However, Blue has scored 600 more than ''he'' would have; Red faces a 100-point net loss for his Extension call. 

* Having an unplayed Safety in one's hand at the time 700 km is reached raises the stakes. One might dare Extension hoping for ''Coup Fourré''. Don't forget, though, to play the Safety normally just before going out.  

* It's not enough merely to have appropriate Remedies in case of Hazard; one must also have Roll cards. For this reason, having the Right of Way card in one's favor is a strong indicator of a good possible Extension; conversely, failure to hold this card may be a good reason to decline. 

* Successful Extension is demoralizing to the opposition, so an aggressive strategy here may have a payoff beyond the hand. 

* The riskiest time to call Extension is when one's opponent has, so far, been Shut Out. The Shut Out is worth 500 points by itself; it would be a shame to lose that advantage. You should be entirely sure of keeping your opponent &quot;stopped&quot; in this case. 

* The strategic points in this section apply generally to the case of Delayed Action. You may be ''able'' to complete a trip before the draw pile runs out, yet continue to discard until you can score the additional 300 points. Do so with care only.

== 2 or 4 players ==

I don't understand the section '2 player game'. Since the default is the 2 player game, why should any hazards be removed? It seems to contradict what's being said at the 3-player game variant. [[User:Abigail-II|Abigail]] 12:32, Mar 1, 2004 (UTC)

:As far as I know, the 'default' version of Mille Bournes is the 4 player game.  That's at least how any instruction manual I've ever found is written, having more emphasis on the 4 player game than 2 player.  The name of the game also makes more sense that way, as 4 player lacks the Extension rule by default (games must go to 1000 miles, not 700 with an Extension afterward).  A game called ''Sept Cents Bournes'' would just be silly. :-) [[User:CaptainSpam|CaptainSpam]] 16:37, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::Seconded: the four player game is the default, per Parker Brothers. [[User:DanielCristofani|DanielCristofani]] 11:27, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== Safety Card Questions ==

I don't think this article is right about this bullet point about the Safety Card rules:
&quot;Safety cards are four special cards that can be played to avoid a certain type of hazard for the remainder of the game. These cards are also worth 100 points.&quot;

1. I think the Safety Cards last for the rest of the hand, not the rest of the game.

2. I don't think you get 100 points for playing them. 

Can anyone confirm that?

Thanks, [[User:Throbblefoot|Throbblefoot]] 06:25, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:The deafening silence compels me to continue. Additional research indicates that you not only don't get 100 points, you also get to draw a card immediately after playing the Safety Card. Here's a source: :http://www.centralconnector.com/GAMES/Milleborne.html

::I've got the Parker Brothers rulebook here (copyright 1962) and you got 2 out of 3 right: they last for the rest of the hand, you do get 100 for playing them, and you get a new turn right after. I've updated the article. [[User:DanielCristofani|DanielCristofani]] 11:27, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== Jeu des mille bornes ==

I placed the link to the French wiki so you can change the name of this article. [[User:Marc Venot|Marc Venot]] 23:48, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

== Major refactor ==

I've shuffled the sections a little, mostly to expand the outline, demoting most sections to subsections. The page as it stands is almost all about ''playing'' the game but there is much more to be said about it. Gameplay can be condensed and reorganized, too. I'm not finished working. 

Coming up: 

* Untangle the text formerly under '''Types of cards''' into discussion of the '''Deck''' and explanation of the '''Play'''. The game should be explained as other card games: Deck, Play, Scoring, Strategy. 

* Deck information should be presented in table form. 

* Condense all the minor sections under '''With larger or smaller groups''' into a single bullet list. Four-player play ''is'' the &quot;default&quot;, the way that the game should be explained under the previous sections -- no need for recap here. 

* More history of the game, particularly of the different deck versions. 

* I'd like to see the French names for the cards in the English version of the article -- once only, in table form. This ''is'' '''en''', but much of the charm of the game comes from the French terms. I wouldn't play with someone who slapped down a Right-of-Way card without shouting &quot;coup fourré&quot;. 

* Discussion of the game ''outside'' the context of the game itself. MB has been around for a long time and millions of people have played it, no? What might a little research discover? 

This article cries out for graphics. At least half the fun is in the beautiful cards of the 1962 deck. I think we can claim fair use on a card or two from each deck, but for obvious reasons we need one complete deck. We can solve this along both dimensions by contacting Parker Brothers for permission; who knows what we might get? For the time being, a symbolic deck can be whipped up shortly.

== Bornes vs Bournes ==

I won't enter into any discussion of which name is &quot;more correct&quot;; but the official [[Hasbro]] deck I have at hand now is titled &quot;Mille Bornes&quot;. Google gives 9830 hits for &quot;mille bournes&quot; with a ''did you mean: mille bornes''; 648,000 hits for the latter. [[User:John Reid|John Reid]] 04:09, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

== Versions ==

Such a popular game has been released in many different versions. I suggest that variants in which the ''style of the cards'' is different are notable; however let's not clog up the article by attempting to list every variation in ''packaging''. The sole notable exception is the &quot;race car&quot; package. Somebody get a photo of that? [[User:John Reid|John Reid]] 06:38, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

== [[Talk:Mille Bornes/work]] ==

This is a work page of source material, images, and text-in-process, only rudely sorted. We may have copyright issues to deal with before some of it can be moved to the article itself.

== Four Safety bonus ==

The versions of the game I have says the 700 for having all four safeties is total, that is one only gets an additional 300 points for having all four. This means by my math that the most points one can get in a hand is 4600 (1000 miles + 400*4 coup-fourees + 300 bonus + 400 finish + 300 delayed + 500 shutout + 300 safe trip + 200 extension if played). Could someone check that? [[User:Jonpin|Jonpin]] 00:50, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

:I'll confirm that. [[User:DanielCristofani|DanielCristofani]] 10:57, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

== Grass ==

The card game '''Grass''' should get a mention somewhere... [[User:John Reid|John&amp;nbsp;]][[User talk:John Reid|Reid]] 23:39, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

== Strategy ==

{{copy|User talk:John Reid}}Say, I just thought I should say as a courtesy: although I (obviously, from my edits) think that the &quot;strategy&quot; section of the [[:Mille Bornes]] article is at the extent where it is best suited to the WikiBooks leisure bookshelf, I also think it looks like the makings of a ''good'' WikiBook, and certainly appreciate the work you've obviously put into it.

As a little further background, I'll note that the proper resolution of strategy sections in game articles vs. [[WP:NOT]] (specifically with respect to advice, suggestions, and such) has been a topic of discussion over at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Board and table games|WikiProject Board and table games]], which might be of interest to you. -[[User:Stellmach|Stellmach]] 14:00, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

When you're not confident with pronunciation or you have only a limited knowledge of the grammar and vocabulary, maintaining a conversation can be a major challenge.  The key to attempting effective communication is to be a good listener and make use of the vocabulary and grammar used in the question to help phrase your answer.  Knowing what might be said in such a conversation will also help you prepare what you're going to say.  Think about conversations you have regularly in English and think about how you might do similar in Polish.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This page will help you with questions and answers to everyday conversations.&lt;br/&gt;

-Dzień dobry (Good morning)&lt;br&gt;
-Dzień dobry, chcesz coś zjeść? (Good morning. Do you want something to eat?)&lt;br&gt;
-Tak, poproszę dwa jajka (Yes, I'll have two eggs, please - &quot;proszę&quot; is the Polish equivalent of &quot;please&quot;, as used in this sentence, and a very useful word)&lt;br&gt;
-Może chcesz się czegoś napić? (Maybe you want to drink something?)&lt;br&gt;
-Tak, poproszę herbatę z mlekiem. (Yes, I'll have tea with milk, please)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-Cześć! Jak się masz? (Hello, how are you?)&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
This guide is about building a '''house of cards'''. It can be difficult, but persevere and you can do it!

The house of cards relies on nothing more than balance to stay upright.  There's no glue, and no damage or alterations are made to the cards themselves.  The larger your house, the more likely it is to fall.


==Construction==
One of the most familiar form of a house of cards involves the creation of a triangular pyramid-style structure formed from a series of identical smaller structures that each emulate an inverted letter V.

1.) First, lean two cards against each other to form an A-frame, with the short ends resting upon a flat and stable surface:

  /\
 /  \

2.) Next, place two more cards in a similar fashion immediately adjacent to the existing structure:

  /\  /\ 
 /  \/  \

3.) Then bridge the space between the two structures with an additional card to form a level platform:

   ----
  /\  /\ 
 /  \/  \

4.) On the developed platform, place two more cards (as described in step 1) completing the pyramid:

    /\
   /  \
   ----
  /\  /\ 
 /  \/  \

5.) This entire process can be repeated, each additional structure placed on the lowest level allowing for an increase in the overall height of the house of cards.  The example above is two structures wide and two structures high, but with the addition of another eight cards it would become three structures wide and three structures high:

      /\
     /  \
     ----
    /\  /\
   /  \/  \
   --------
  /\  /\  /\
 /  \/  \/  \

==World Records==

A prominent house of cards builder is Bryan Berg. Berg broke the former world record in 1992 for &quot;The Tallest House of Cards&quot; with a tower that stood fourteen feet, six inches tall!

Another tower was built by Berg at the Department of Architecture at Iowa State University in 1998. It stood at approximately 25 feet tall and utilized over 1500 decks of standard playing cards that weighed over 250 pounds. It took two and a half weeks to build, with construction taking place in shifts that lasted anywhere from four to twelve hours each day. During construction, the tower was surrounded by scaffolding, which also formed the means of reaching the top of the tower to place additional cards.

On November 6 1999, Berg built an even taller tower in the lobby of the casino at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin. This time it stood at approximately 25.29 feet tall and utilized over 1700 decks to stack up to 131 stories high!

When he was asked whether it would be possible to build even taller (reaching for instance, about 100 feet), Berg just responded with a simple: &quot;You bet!&quot;. Why don't you give it a go?

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. '''For wet chemicals''', immediately flush the area with large amounts of  water, using a shower or hose, if available. Do not apply water too forcefully. Continue to flood the area while the clothing, including shoes and socks, is being removed. Continue to flush with running water for at least 20 minutes.
:'''For dry chemicals''', brush off the chemical, ''then'' flush with water as above.
::For acid burns caused by phenol (carbolic acid), wash the affected area with alcohol because phenol is not water soluble; then wash with water. If  alcohol  is  not  available,  flushing  with water is better than no treatment at all. 

2. Call an ambulance

      <text xml:space="preserve">Carbon  monoxide is present in exhaust gases of internal combustion engines as well as in sewer gas, lanterns, charcoal grills, and in manufactured gas used for heating and cooking. It gives no warning of its presence since it is completely odorless and tasteless. The victim   may lose consciousness and suffer respiratory distress with no warning other than slight dizziness, weakness, and headache. The lips and skin of a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning are characteristically cherry red. Death may occur within a few minutes. 

The first stage of treatment for an inhalation poisoning is to remove the victim from the toxic atmosphere immediately.  '''WARNING:''' Never try to  remove a victim from the toxic  environment if you do not have the proper protective mask or breathing apparatus or if you are not trained in its use.  Too often, well intentioned rescuers become victims.  When in doubt, call for trained personnel.  If help is not immediately available, and if you know you can reach and rescue the victim, take a deep breath, hold it, enter the area, and pull the victim out.  If the victim is not breathing, begin CPR.  Get the victim to a hospital as soon as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'd like to point out that the use of &quot;natural numbers&quot; isn't definitive.  In some contexts it includes 0, and in others it doesn't.  You may want to consider revising that part of the book.


****

Let us have a look of the following excerpt from the page&quot;

&quot;The Real numbers include the rational numbers, and also includes all the numbers that cannot be formed as a ratio of two integers. The Complex numbers are all &quot;

1 + 2i is a complex number. Hence it is a number according to the above. Also it cannot be formed as a ratio of two integers. Thus according to the above definition of real numbers, 1 + 2i is a valid candidate for being a real number. Any definition in mathematics must be defining the underlying mathematical phrase, very much precisely. It cannot be vague or unclear or contradictory. Here it is. The definition of real numbers needs certain development and results. For example, you can refer to any good book on real analysis or any high school course.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Knowing who one is writing for will in large part determine how one writes. That doesn't mean that if you don't fit the target audience, you won't find this useful, of course! It does mean that you may have to adapt (or even ignore) some material.

===The reader is a native English speaker with high-school/newspaper reading ability.===
* No linguistic knowledge is assumed
* No knowledge of other languages is assumed
* No detailed knowledge of English grammar is assumed
* The reader may be of any age from roughly teenager upwards
* Annotated English examples will be understood
* Ample wikilinks to Wikipedia articles and other Wikibooks should always be provided

The reader who does have any of these things may therefore find some concepts over-explained. They can skip these sections far more easily than an unknowledgable reader can fill in the gaps, however.

===The reader is learning by themselves (not in a classroom situation).===
* They have no personal access to an instructor/teacher
* They have no personal access to other learners

Ample examples should be provided, annotated as completely as possible. Space within the Wikibook should be provided for interactive feedback, e.g. for requests for further explanations or examples of some points.

===The reader does not have access to Uyghur native speakers.===
Therefore sound recordings (and possibly video if appropriate) should be used liberally.

===The reader has internet access and is accessing this Wikibook primarily via their web browser.===
Once the book reaches a certain level of completeness, it may be appropriate to devote more attention to preparing the material for offline use (for example: printed textbook + audio CD). At the moment, however, the wiki format should be exploited through liberal use of wikilinks and links to sound recordings. In particular, pages should remain short and tightly focused.

===The reader desires to become conversationally fluent in the Uyghur tongue, eventually attaining native speaker-like understanding in listening, speaking, reading and writing.===
* They want to learn Modern Uyghur as it is spoken today, not any other variety including written/literary Uyghur

The reader may want to only learn to read Uyghur, or perhaps only learn to speak it. In such cases they can easily ignore material as they see fit.

===The reader wants to learn to read and write the Arabic script.===
There are at least three distinct scripts that can be used to represent Uyghur. Since the Arabic script is the &quot;official&quot; script in Xinjiang and the one primarily in use on the internet,  we will assume that the reader wants to learn this script and devote more material to that end. We will, as much as possible, also provide the Latin and Cyrillic scripts, and create flexible technical solutions that allow the reader to easily adapt the material to their purpose.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">See [[Wikijunior:Life/Structure plan]]. 

There are two reasons I started with this project. 1) I am an ex-teacher and an ex-software engineer. It has been a long-term ambition of mine to develop good educational content in an online medium. 2) I make no bones about it, I am a passionate defender of evolution and I regard the creationist movement as a threat to rationality. Particularly disturbing are the moves to get creationism into schools and the production of creationist material aimed at children. Despite my passions, I have come to the conclusion that a strict NPOV approach to the whole business is the best one. A scrupulous adherence to the evidence and the facts is, in my view, the best way to provide a genuine education in the matter to children. The last thing I want to see here is the old origins knockabout. I chose the title, 'Life' in order to avoid, as long as possible, the bogeyword, beginning with 'e', that denotes the scientific theory of the development of life, both while building up this project and before it is encountered by a reader. I do not consider this a subterfuge, given the prejudice that many readers might bring to the subject. As time goes on, I will try ::** What vestigial characteristics are found in this group?
to develop a more detailed structure. [[User:Barry Desborough|Barry Desborough]] 17:22, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

The interest in a project is good, but what is this book going to cover? It is relatively vague. What is each article/page going to be about? It also lacks the format of the official Wikijunior books, such as links to all of the articles being on the main page to easily find them, or questions on each page. By &quot;official&quot; I mean that they are chosen by vote each quarter and are listed on the Wikijunior page; go look at them and see what I mean by their structure and format. I would love to help, but I'm not sure what direction this book is supposed to go. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 13:41, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
:Hello Milton. Thanks for your input. This is just a quick note for the moment. I'll reply more fully as soon as I can. I will study what you say about official standards, and I'll try to fill out the aims and the intended structure. Basically, I intend to set out a course on the theory of evolution. Will get back with more as soon as I can. --[[User:Barry Desborough|Barry Desborough]] 18:20, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:Update. I've sketched out a plan for the structure of the project in a different file, in order to facilitate its evolution. The file is [[Wikijunior:Life/Structure plan]]. --[[User:Barry Desborough|Barry Desborough]] 02:02, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

::It may be difficult to fit this concept into the Wikijunior model. As it stands the structure is too taxing for the intended age group. I agree that teaching young kids to understand evolution is important. &lt;strike&gt;But the structure plan was hard for me to get through and I'm a college educated 40 year old with an interest in the subject.&lt;/strike&gt; I would propose a very different structure more in keeping with the Wikijunior model. The structure of the book would be based around biological families or orders (in the scientific classification sense). Then there would be a series of questions related to that family/order. 

::* Target age: Standard Wikijunior (8-12)

::** What are some early examples?
::** What are some present day examples?
::** What vestigial characteristics are found in this group?

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;There are lots and lots of living things. They come in all shapes and sizes. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Just think about spiders. People have counted nearly forty thousand (40,000)

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;different kinds of spiders in the world. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Then there are different sorts of beetles. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;There are at least a quarter of a million of them (250,000). 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;There are all sorts of different fishes and birds. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;There are all the different kinds of plants.

{{recipe}} | [[:Category:Fermented food recipes|Fermented food recipes]]

'''Kefir''' is a fermented milk drink originating in the Caucasus. It is liquid, thicker than milk, sour, and a little yeasty. It can have small amounts of alcohol, but typically much less than &amp;frac12;% by volume. It is traditionally fermented using '''kefir grains''', a symbiotic culture of yeasts and bacteria passed down from generation to generation.

==Ingredients==
* 50 [[Cookbook:Gram|grams]] (1&amp;frac34; oz) of kefir grains (see note)
* 500 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] (1 pint) fresh [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (see note)

==Preparation==
# Remove kefir grains from previous batch of starter, using a [[Cookbook:Sieve|sieve]] or [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]].
# Shake kefir grains to remove excess kefir. Rinsing is not necessary (but optionally, rinse in fresh milk)
# Place kefir grains in glass jar or jug with fresh milk. Generally, keep a ratio of kefir grains to milk of about 1:10
# Set aside to ferment at room temperature for up to 24 hours (see note)

==Notes, tips, and variations==
[[Image:Kefirpilze.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Kefir grains]]
* Kefir grains are gelatinous lumps. You can often get them for free, or for the cost of postage - see link below. Once you've got some, they grow in the milk until you have enough to give to someone else.
* As an alternative to kefir grains, some health food shops carry a powdered kefir starter. This will never make kefir grains, but the powdered starter will make good kefir and is easier for some people to manage.
* Milk can be almost any milk from a mammal. Full cream cow's milk is best, but kefir can be made from low-fat milk, goat's milk, or sheep's milk.
* Non-milk kefir can be made from sugary water, fruit juice, coconut juice, rice milk, or soy milk. However, the kefir grains will stop growing in these liquids, so it is best to only use excess kefir grains or powdered kefir starter for this.
* In warm weather, kefir will ferment very quickly and can become separated into curds and whey. An easy way to prevent this is to start the new batch of kefir at night, when it's cooler, and put the fermenting kefir into the refrigerator during the daytime when it gets hot.
* In cold weather, kefir will ferment very slowly. Put the jar or jug in a warm place, but not where it will get too warm (see above!)

==Care of kefir grains==
When kefir grains are not in use they may be stored wet or dry. They can be stored wet up to 8 to 10 days in water at 4°C. Alternatively they may be wrapped in cheese cloth and allowed to dry for 36 to 48 hours at room temperature, and these dried grains may be stored at room temperature in an envelope for 12 to 18 months. Dried kefir grains may be reactivated by several successive growth cycles in milk. The grains are ready for kefir production when the kefir they produce looks and smells like the original (wet) form. This re-growth stage is required to re-establish the correct bacterial balance within the culture.

Kefir grains may become contaminated with undesirable bacteria such as coliforms and other spoilage bacteria that shorten the kefir shelf-life. To guard against this, kefir-making containers should be washed and sanitized prior to making kefir. Suitable containers include glass jars such as jam jars or pickle jars, but any suitably sized glass container will work. When necessary to wash kefir grains they should be also washed in pre-boiled and chilled water or fresh milk. Use of chloraminated tap water should be avoided, but if necessary it should be de-chloraminated.

==Production of kefir==
To make kefir, milk should be inoculated with kefir grains (5% w/w) and incubated until a smooth [[Cookbook:yoghurt|yoghurt]]-like consistency develops. This is generally 12 hours at 18 - 22°C. Carbonated kefir may be produced by sealing the fermented product into beer bottles for ripening (1 to 3 days at 10°C). Kefir should be kept out of direct sunlight. If you have no means to regulate the temperature of fermentation, then the top of a warm refrigerator or a cupboard above the stove are suitable places. In warm to hot climates, kefir may be produced by placing the fermentation vessel into the refrigerator during the day and on the counter top at night.

# Strain the prior day's kefir batch with a sanitized sieve.
# Return the grains to a sanitized glass jar. Add fresh pasteurized or raw milk, and cover loosely.
# Enjoy the liquid kefir portion that went through the strainer.
# Leave the new batch to sit and ferment.

Available commercial starter cultures do not make traditional kefir. These starters contain selected bacteria and yeasts isolated from kefir grains and will not produce kefir grains. These starter cultures result in a more consistent product as opposed to traditional kefir which varies from batch to batch.

==Kefir as leavening agent==
Kefir can be used as a [[Cookbook:Leavening Agent|leavening agent]] when baking [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], because it contains active yeasts and bacteria. It can be used directly in a recipe, by replacing the yeast and half the water with kefir. Recipes that specify [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]] or [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]] can be made just as well (or better!) with kefir.

Alternatively, kefir can be used to create a [[Cookbook:Sourdough Starter|sourdough starter]]. Add ½ teaspoonful of kefir to ½ cup flour and ½ cup water, mix well, and set aside to ferment for 12 - 24 hours.

==Kefir Beverages==
Kefir is delicious when consumed on its own, but it also makes a brilliant base for flavored milkshake or lassi-like drinks.

===Sweet Elderflower Kefir===
Add the following to a glass of kefir to make an absolutely delicious sweet drink:

* A good dash of elderflower cordial.
* 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.
* A shake of ground nutmeg.
* Mix well, and enjoy.

===Spiced Kefir===
There is so much to experiment with adding spices to kefir, here is a an example that is something like a spicy lassi:

* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1.5 teaspoons ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander

I have noticed a rather strange thing happening to this combination of kefir and spices. After about 3 or 4 days being carried around in my bag (it takes me a while to get through it), the cream in the kefir spontaneously forms little spicy buttery globules that float on top.

They are slightly similar in shape to popcorn, and between the size of a pea and a grape. I think the agitation caused by being in my bag whilst walking may play a part in their formation. They're lovely to eat, spicy and creamy if you are brave enough to eat them. You could also skim them out and then you've got naturally fat-reduced kefir (if that's your thing).

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Carolus Linnaeus lived from 1707 to 1778. He became famous for his way grouping and naming living things.

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;In Europe in the 1700s, people were discovering more and more of the world. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;They were finding out about lots of new plants and animals. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Just naming them all was a big problem. People just made up names by themselves. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;There were lots of problems when they wanted to write about them and talk about them.

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Linnaeus thought of a way of naming living things that everybody started to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stackguard is implemented in the following files.

These files translates GIMPLE to RTL.They take advantage of the CFG to
instrument function prolog and epilog.

1) cfgexpand.c 

Stackguard is created in function expand_used_vars(). Depending on
stackguard flag either all arrays or character arrays only are
allocated first.

tree_expand_cfg() takes care of prolog when it calls
stack_protect_prologue(). The corresponding function
stack_protect_epilogue() is called from calls.c to take care of tail
calls and from tree_expand_cfg();

2) function.c 

stack_protect_prologue(), stack_protect_epilogue()

The functions use machine definition targetm.

3) targhooks.c

Contains default initializers of target architecture hooks. 

default_stack_protect_guard() builds a VAR_DECL tree node that
represents variable __stack_chk_guard.

default_stack_protector_fail() builds a call to function
__stack_chk_fail().

These ASTs are converted into RTL trees using expand_expr_stmt(). The
prolog and epilog functions add RTL expressions directly as well. For
example, to detect a compromise function epilog generates a
conditional statement that compares the canary word on the stack with
its initial value:

  emit_cmp_and_jump_insns (x, y, EQ, NULL_RTX, ptr_mode, 1, label);

where x and y are corresponding declaration RTLs:

  x = validize_mem (DECL_RTL (cfun-&gt;stack_protect_guard));
  y = validize_mem (DECL_RTL (guard_decl));



Stackguard implements a certain amount of static analysis to make sure
that suspicious functions with arguments of fixed length do not
have vulnerabilities. The underlying mechanism is that of
builtins. Stackguard has file strcpy.h that defines functions of interest,
for example strcpy(). The new definition uses builtins __ssp_bos() to
find out object size and __builtin___strcpy_chk():

#define __ssp_bos(ptr) __builtin_object_size (ptr, __SSP_FORTIFY_LEVEL &gt; 1)
#define strcpy(dest, src) \
  ((__ssp_bos (dest) != (size_t) -1)                    \
   ? __builtin___strcpy_chk (dest, src, __ssp_bos (dest))        \
   : __strcpy_ichk (dest, src))

The builtins are evaluated at compile time. Function warning() called in
maybe_emit_chk_warning() prints out a message if the destination buffer is overflown.

In case when Stackguard is unable to find out statically if the buffer is overrun
function __strcpy_chk() is called at run-time. Library
libssp provides the function. However, the protected program does not
require linking with this library explicitly. Instead, GCC instructs
the loader to use a shared library.

== Basic navigation ==

Basic navigation in vim is covered below.  

=== Moving around ===

{{:Learning the vi Editor/Moving around}}

=== VIM Help system ===

vim is a very feature rich application.  Unlike the 'vi' editor it includes a help system.  Because the help system will allow you to teach yourself much more than any book on vim possibly could, you will benefit from the power of the vim editor much more if you learn to use it.  On a normal vim installation you should be able to start the online help by pressing the {{Vi/key|HELP}} key . If your keyboard does not feature a {{Vi/key|HELP}} key then you can try {{Vi/key|F1}} instead.  (Some system administrators may have changed how vim behaves.  If you cannot get into vim's help system with these commands, perhaps your administrator can help.)

 {{Vi/Ex|:help}}

Start vim and enter command mode by pressing escape.  To get help on any command simply type &lt;tt&gt;{{Vi/Ex|:help}} ''command''&lt;/tt&gt;.

For example, if you would like to learn all the different ways the {{Vi/Ex|:x}} command can be used you could type &lt;tt&gt;{{Vi/Ex|:h}} x&lt;/tt&gt;.  To move around in the help files the same keys work, {{Vi/key|h}}, {{Vi/key|j}}, {{Vi/key|k}}, {{Vi/key|l}}.  To leave the help files type {{Vi/Ex|:quit}}.  If you know you want to do something, but you aren't sure what the command might be you can type partial commands like this &lt;tt&gt;{{Vi/Ex|:help}} cut&lt;/tt&gt;.  To learn to switch text from upper case to lower case you could type {{Vi/Ex|:help lowercase}}&lt;/tt&gt;

When you search for help on any subject, vim will (normally by default) create a window (buffer) which you can navigate just like any window in vim.  You can close the help window by typing {{Vi/Ex|:quit}} or {{Vi/Ex|:q}} and pressing enter. 

The default help file (shown when you type &quot;{{Vi/Ex|help}}&quot;) explains basic navigation for vim and for vim's help files.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Modes ==

VIM offers more modes than vi (which offers only the &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;insert&quot; and &quot;command&amp;ndash;line&quot; modes). Theses additional modes make VIM more powerful and easier to use; because of this, vim users should at least be aware that they exist.  (NOTE: ''If you ever enter a mode you are unfamiliar with, you can usually press {{Vi/Ex|ESC}} to get back to ''normal'' mode.'')

Here a short overview of each mode available in vim:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
! Name !! Description !! help page 
|-
|normal ||For navigation and manipulation of text. This is the mode that vim will usually start in, which you can usually get back to with {{Vi/Ex|ESC}}. ||&lt;code&gt;:help Normal-mode&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|insert ||For inserting new text.  The main difference from vi is that many important &quot;normal&quot; commands are also available in insert mode - provided you have a keyboard with enough meta keys (such as Ctrl, Alt, Windows-key, etc.). ||&lt;code&gt;:help Insert-mode&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|visual ||For navigation and manipulation of text selections, this mode allows you to perform most normal commands, and a few extra commands, on selected text. ||&lt;code&gt;:help visual-mode&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|select ||Similar to visual but with a more MS-Window like behavior. ||&lt;code&gt;:help select-mode&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|command-line ||For entering editor commands - like the help command in the 3rd column. ||{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;:help Command-line-mode&lt;/code&gt;}}
|-
|Ex-mode ||Similar to the command-line mode but optimized for batch processing.  ||&lt;code&gt;:help Ex-mode&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Each mode is described below.

=== insert (and replace) ===

In insert mode you can type new text.  In classic vi the insert mode was just that: insert text and nothing else.  Vim makes use of many meta keys on modern keyboards; with a correctly configured vim, cursor keys should work in insert mode.

Insert mode can be reached in several ways, but some of the most common ones are {{Vi/key|a}} &lt;small&gt;(append after cursor)&lt;/small&gt;, {{Vi/key|i}} &lt;small&gt;(insert before cursor)&lt;/small&gt;, {{Vi/key|A}} &lt;small&gt;(append at end of line)&lt;/small&gt;, {{Vi/key|I}} &lt;small&gt;(insert at beginning of line)&lt;/small&gt;, {{Vi/key|C}} &lt;small&gt;(change to end of line)&lt;/small&gt;, and {{Vi/key|s}} &lt;small&gt;(substitute characters)&lt;/small&gt;.

If you wish to edit text by selecting and replacing, as is common in many GUI-based editors, {{Vi/key|C}} does nicely.  The selected text is deleted before entering insert mode.

=== normal (command) ===

Unless you use the evim interface this is the standard mode for vim (vim starts in normal mode).  Everything the user types in normal mode is interpreted as commands (including those which switch the user to other modes).

If vim is started as evim (''evim'' on the command line), vim keeps the user in insert mode all the time.  Normal mode can be reached for individual commands by pressing {{Vi/key|Ctrl-O}} followed by the desired command.  After one command, the user is returned to insert mode.  (Each normal command must be started first by pressing {{Vi/key|Ctrl-O}}).

=== visual ===

There are three different types of highlighting in visual mode.  Each allows the user to highlight text in different ways.   Commands that normally only affect one character, line, or area will affect the highlighted text (such as changing text to uppercase ({{Vi/key|Ctrl-~}}), deleting text ({{Vi/key|d}}), indenting lines (&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;, and =), and so forth).

There are  three (sub)types of the visual modes which are ''visual'', ''block-visual'' , and ''linewise-visual''

==== plain visual mode ====

The plain ''visual'' mode is started by pressing 'v' in normal mode.  At any point, pressing ESC or {{Vi/key|v}} will leave VISUAL mode without performing an operation.  Movement commands change the selection area, while other commands will generally perform the expected operation on the text (there are some exceptions where the behavior will change or where the command won't work, but if it doesn't do what you hoped you can always undo with {{Vi/key|u}}).

==== block visual mode ====

'''block-visual''' is started by pressing {{Vi/key|Ctrl-V}} (or {{Vi/key|Ctrl-Q}} in some windows versions.  If neither of these works use &quot;:help visual-block&quot; to find out how).  Visual blocks always maintain a rectangular selection, highlighting only specific columns of characters over multiple lines.  In this following example the user wants to put a dash in each phone number between the second and third number fields:

The user first moves the cursor to the top of the column (you could start at the bottom if you want).

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
| [[Image:vim_block_change_example.jpg]]
|}

Next, press {{Vi/key|Ctrl-V}}.  This puts you in block-visual mode (VISUAL BLOCK appears at the bottom to tell you what visual mode you're in).  Next, move down to the bottom desired line.  You can see a single column highlighted in this example, but you could move right or left and highlight more columns.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
| [[Image:vim_block_change_example2.jpg]]
|}

In this case, the user wants to ''change'' the spaces to dashes.  To change text, we press 'c'.  The spaces all disappear, and the changes are shown only in the current line while we type:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
| [[Image:vim_block_change_example3.jpg]]
|}

when we press {{Vi/key|ESC}}, though, the change is duplicated on all the lines.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
| [[Image:vim_block_change_example4.jpg]]
|}

(Note: if you simply want to ''insert'' text rather than change it, you will need to use '{{Vi/key|I}}' or '{{Vi/key|A}}' rather than '{{Vi/key|i}}' or '{{Vi/key|a}}'.)

==== linewise visual mode ====

In '''linewise-visual''' mode, enterd by {{Vi/key|Shift-V}}, entire lines are highlighted.  Otherwise, it generally works like the plain '''visual''' mode.

=== select ===

like the visual mode but with more [[w:Common_User_Access|CUA]] like behavior. This means that if you type a single character it replaces the selection. Of course you lose all the one key operation on selection like {{Vi/key|U}} to make a selection uppercase.

This mode is usually activated by:

 :{{vi/Ex|behave}} mswin

which is default for MS-Windows installations. You can get the normal mode with

 :{{vi/Ex|behave}} xterm

=== command-line ===

Within the command-line you can run [[w:Ex_(editor)|Ex]] commands, enter search patterns, and enter filter commands. At the bottom a command line appears where you can enter the command.  Unlike vi - vim supports cursor keys which makes entering commands a lot easier. After one command the editor returns into normal mode.

You can enter an Ex command by typing a &lt;tt&gt;:&lt;tt&gt; in normal mode.  Some examples include:

 :{{Vi/Ex|set}} number
 :{{Vi/Ex|substitute}}/search/replace/ig

You can enter a search pattern by typing &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;tt&gt; to search forward, or &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;tt&gt; to search backward.  You can use vim's expanded regular expressions in these search patterns.  For example,

 /word

will jump to the next occurrence of &quot;word&quot; (even if it is &quot;sword&quot; or &quot;wordlessly&quot;), but

 /\&lt;word\&gt;

will jump only to a complete word &quot;word&quot; (not &quot;sword&quot; or &quot;wordless&quot;).

You can enter a filter by typing {{Vi/Ex|!}} followed by a motion command, then a shell command to run on the text captured by the motion.  For example, typing

 {{Vi/Ex|!}}22jsort

in Linux will sort the current and 22 following lines with the ''sort'' system command.  The same thing can be done with

 :.,.+22{{Vi/Ex|!}}sort

As a matter of fact, vim creates the above command for you if you follow the first example!

=== Ex-mode ===

The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter [[w:Ex_(editor)|Ex]] commands. Unlike the command-line mode you won't return to normal mode automatically. You can enter an Ex command by typing a &lt;tt&gt;Q&lt;/tt&gt; in normal mode and leave it again with the &lt;tt&gt;:visual&lt;/tt&gt; command. Note that the Ex mode is designed for Batch processing and as such won't support mappings or command-line editing.

For batch processing the Ex-mode is normally started from outside by calling the editor with the &quot;-E&quot; option. Here is a real live example from the [[w:RPM Package Manager|RPM Package Manager]] specification:

 vim -E -s Makefile &lt;&lt;-EOF
    :%{{Vi/Ex|substitute}}/CFLAGS = -g$/CFLAGS =-fPIC -DPIC -g/
    :%{{Vi/Ex|substitute}}/CFLAGS =$/CFLAGS =-fPIC -DPIC/
    :%{{Vi/Ex|substitute}}/ADAFLAGS =$/ADAFLAGS =-fPIC -DPIC/
    :{{Vi/Ex|update}}
    :{{Vi/Ex|quit}}
 EOF

The RPM uses [[w:Bash|Bash]] as script language which make the example a little difficult to understand as two different script languages are mixed in one file.

; &lt;code&gt;vim -E -s&lt;/code&gt; : starts vim in improved Ex mode which allows for more advanced commands than the vi compatible Ex-mode &lt;small&gt;(which is started with &lt;code&gt;vim -e -s&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;. 
; &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;-EOF&lt;/code&gt; : tells bash to copy all lines that follow into the standard input of the external program just started. The '-' tells the shell to strip the tab characters.
; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; : are lines with Ex commands which vim will execute. The &lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt; is optional but helpful when two script languages are mixed in one file
; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; : A beginners mistake is to forget to actually save the file after the change - falsely assuming that this happens automatically.
; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;quit&lt;/code&gt; : Last not least: don't forget to actually exit vim again.
; &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; : marks the end of the standard input redirection - from now on bash will execute the command itself again.

If your shell does not allow such nifty redirection of standard input then you can always use a more classic approach to I/O redirection using two files:

 vim -E -s Makefile &lt;Makefile-Fix1.vim

And if have no standard input redirection available then you can try the &lt;tt&gt;-c&lt;/tt&gt; option in combination with the &lt;tt&gt;source&lt;/tt&gt; command:

 vim -E -s -c &quot;{{Vi/Ex|source}} Makefile-Fix1.vim&quot; Makefile

With the improved Ex mode many tasks classically performed by [[w:AWK programming language|awk]] or [[w:sed|sed]] can be done with vim and often better so:

* [[w:AWK programming language|awk]] and [[w:sed|sed]] are stream oriented - they only read the file forward from beginning to end while vim is buffer oriented - you can move forward and backward in the file as you like.
* vim's [[w:Regular expression|regular expressions]] are more powerful than [[w:AWK programming language|awk]]'s and [[w:sed|sed]]'s expressions - for example vim can match over several lines and supports zero matches.

'''''Hydrangea petiolaris''''' is a species of hydrangea native to the woodlands of Japan, Korea and Sakhalin in easternmost Siberia.

It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of the closely related ''[[../Hydrangea anomala/]]'' from China, Myanmar, and the Himalaya; that species differs in being smaller (to 12 m) and having flower corymbs up to 15 cm diameter. The common name Climbing hydrangea is applied to both species.

==Description==
It is a vigorous woody climbing plant, growing to 20 m height up trees or rock faces, climbing by means of small aerial roots on the stems. The leaves are deciduous, ovate, 4-11 cm long and 3-8 cm broad, with a heart-shaped base, coarsely serrated margin and acute apex. The [[flower]]s are, produced in flat corymbs 15-25 cm diameter in mid-summer; each corymb includes a small number of peripheral sterile white flowers 2.5-4.5 cm across, and numerous small, off-white fertile flowers 1-2 mm diameter. The fruit is a dry urn-shaped capsule 3-5 mm diameter containing several small winged seeds.

==Growing Conditions==
''Hydrangea petiolaris'' is grown as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America, where it is grown either on walls or on trellises or fences. Its clinging rootlets are not as strong as most other wall-climbing vines, and so is often anchored artificially.

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
As a climber on walls and fences.

==Maintenance==
May beed cabling, as the adhesive roots are weak.

==Propagation==
Stem and root cuttings, seed.

==Pests and Diseases==
See ''[[../Hydrangea/]]'' for a list of pests and diseases.

'''''Hydrangea quercifolia''''' ('''Oakleaf hydrangea''') is a species of hydrangea native to the southeastern United States, from North Carolina west to Tennessee, and south to Florida and Louisiana.

==Description==
It is a deciduous shrub growing to 2.5 m tall with an open crown. The leaves are lobed, somewhat resembling a Red oak leaf in shape, 8-20 cm long and 5-17 cm broad; they differ from oak leaves in being borne in opposite pairs (not alternately), and having a wrinkled surface. The flowers are produced in conical panicles 10-25 cm long; each panicle comprises a large number of small (3-5 mm) creamy-white fertile flowers, and a few larger, pure white sterile bract-like flowers 25-35 mm diameter.

==Useful things for programmers to know==

There are quite a few things programmers ought to know about vim that will make their experience that much easier.  Programmers can save hours and weeks of man-hours over the long haul with effective editors.  Here are some tricks and tools that vim provides.  With the time you save, you might speed up your work and have some extra time for a quick Quake deathmatch or eventually increase your productivity to help justify a larger wage increase.

===Word, variable, function, and line completion===

Sometimes the word you're typing is really long.  You shouldn't have to type it all out.  If it's in your dictionary, or in the current file, you can save a lot of time with {{Vi/key|Ctrl-P}} and {{Vi/key|Ctrl-N}}.   Let's take a closer look at how this works:

* ''Word/variable/function name Completion''

Generally, any word in the current file, or any of the other files (buffers) you are editing in the same instance of vim, will match for completion.  This means once you've typed it once, you can type the first couple letters next time, and press Ctrl-N (several times if you need to cycle through several options) until you find the word you're looking for.

Technically, this isn't true.  You can tell vim where to look for words in the &lt;tt&gt;complete&lt;tt&gt; function.  In Vim 7, the &lt;tt&gt;complete&lt;tt&gt; function will generally be set to figure out a lot about what you're typing &amp;mdash; drawing information from function libraries (As of the last update on this book, the author knows C and C++ are supported by default). Keyword completion since Vim 7 will also show a popup menu.

You can also define a dictionary of your own for completion.  For more detail, you might want to consult the vim help system &quot;:help complete&quot;, &quot;:help complete-functions&quot;, and so forth.

'' '''Example 1''' ''

As an example, you might edit a C program file, &quot;blah.c&quot;.  You want a function that starts with &quot;str&quot;, but you can't remember what it is.  You first type &quot;str&quot;.  It remains regular text until you press {{Vi/key|Ctrl-P}} or {{Vi/key|Ctrl-N}}.  In vim 7, you will see a menu appear, like this:

[[Image:vim_completion1.jpg]]

You can use {{Vi/key|Ctrl-N}} and {{Vi/key|Ctrl-P}} to cycle through the entries shown.  In Vim versions 7 and higher, you can actually use the arrow keys to cycle through entries in the menu.  There might be too many to show on the screen at once (you will notice the black box on the right represents a scroll position on a gray bar--not all the options are shown on-screen in this example.)  The files from which the options were drawn are shown, to help you decide if it's what you're looking for.

(You will also notice in this example that words show up from files the author has recently edited, such as 'strict' from 'cgi-bin/ftplist.pl' -- we certainly don't want that.)

'' '''Example 2''' ''

Now, suppose you need the sine function, but you know it has an odd name.  You type &lt;tt&gt;sin&lt;tt&gt; and press {{Vi/key|Ctrl-P}}, and it doesn't show up:

[[Image:vim_completion2.jpg]]

You're not out of luck, you just haven't included the math library yet.  All you have to do is add the line

 #include &lt;math.h&gt;

and try again.  This time you see the function name you wanted (it wasn't easy to remember since it has an odd name)

[[Image:vim_completion3.jpg]]

* ''Line Completion''

You can complete entire lines if you need to, though this is less likely.  {{Vi/key|Ctrl-X}}, {{Vi/key|Ctrl-L}} will load the matching lines (white space matters!) into the menu, and from there you can move forward and backward with arrows or {{Vi/key|Ctrl-P}} and {{Vi/key|Ctrl-N}} (for '''P'''revious and '''N'''ext)

===Indentation===

Vim can figure out how to indent most common filetypes.

For most of the popular programming languages, vim can detect the file type by the filename's extension, and from there it will decide how to indent your files.  If you don't see it automatically creating the proper indentation for you, try

 :filetype indent plugin on

In the GUI version, you might be able to turn it on at the same time you turn syntax highlighting on for that file.  Choose Syntax -&gt; on/off for this file, or Syntax -&gt; Show Filetypes in menu, then go back into the syntax menu and choose the appropriate file type from the list.

You might want to put the above-mentioned &quot;:filetype ...&quot; line in your vimrc file (discussed earlier) and open your program file again, though this really shouldn't be necessary.

If you still have problems, you might want to check that your runtimepath variable is set properly (:help runtimepath).  It's also possible (though unlikely) that your programming language is rare enough that nobody has written an indent plugin for it yet.  The official site for vim, vim.org, may have an indent plugin file that meets your needs, even if it didn't come with your default installation of vim.

For those times when you've pasted some text in and the indentation is wrong, (your indent plugin must be loaded), you can use the = command.  It's probably easiest to type '10=' to re-indent the next ten lines, or to use visual mode and press {{vi/key|1==}}.

If you want, you can indent lines with &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; and unindent them with &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;.

If you are in insert mode, use {{vi/key|Ctrl-D}} and {{vi/key|Ctrl-T}} to change the indentation of the line ({{vi/key|Ctrl-D}} decreases indentation by one level and Ctrl-T increases it by one level)

If you can't manage to get filetype specific indentation working, you might try setting one or more of the following options: smartindent, autoindent, cindent, and copyindent.  Chances are these won't work completely right, so {{vi/key|Ctrl-D}} and {{vi/key|Ctrl-T}} will be more important.  To turn autoindent on, type &lt;tt&gt;:set autoindent&lt;tt&gt;.  To turn autoindent off, type &lt;tt&gt;:set noautoindent&lt;tt&gt;

=== Repeating commands, or Performing the Same Command Many Times ===

If you feel comfortable with vim, you might record your keystrokes to an invisible register and repeat them later.  It might be easier to write a vim script, or even filter your file with another program (such as a perl script) for complex enough actions.

That said, sometimes it really is easier to record a command and reuse it, or even perform it on any matching line.  For more advanced execution patterns (e.g. executing one command on the whole file), see below.  You might also consider creating a mapping (discussed below) or running a :global command (also discussed below).

==== Repeating the last single command ====

Suppose I want to put a semicolon on the end of a few lines, where I forgot:

 cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello world\n&quot;
 i = j + k
 cout &lt;&lt; &quot;i is &quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl

On the first line, I type &lt;tt&gt;A;&lt;tt&gt; followed by the &lt;tt&gt;ESC&lt;tt&gt; key.  I move to the next line and press &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;tt&gt; (the period tells vim to repeat the last command -- don't worry, it doesn't duplicate movement commands).

==== Recording a command macro ====
Vim has a powerful form of command repetition available through the use of macros.   A user can record a series of commands into a register and run the register as a macro.  Macros can be recorded into any of 26 registers (a through z).

To start recording a macro, press &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;/tt&gt; followed by a register name (any letter &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; through &lt;tt&gt;z&lt;/tt&gt; -- Registers are defined by only one letter of the alphabet, so only one character may be used as the storage buffer).  After performing a series of commands, finish recording the command macro by pressing &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;/tt&gt; again.  For example to start recording into register z, press &lt;tt&gt;qz&lt;/tt&gt; and press &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;/tt&gt; again to finish recording.

To run a macro from a register, run it with &lt;tt&gt;@'''x'''&lt;/tt&gt; where '''x''' is the register with the desired macro recording.  Register &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;tt&gt; is the default register for macro recordings, so if you have recorded into register &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;/tt&gt; you may simply type &lt;tt&gt;@@&lt;/tt&gt; to run the macro.

(Note: Keep in mind that scripts or mappings may sometimes use an arbitrary register--so if you have a conflict, especially with a third party script or mapping, you should consider recording to a different register.  You can view the contents of a register with the '':registers'' command.)

=====Example 1=====
As a simple example, suppose you have the following lines in the buffer, and you want each line to repeat the last word on the line.  Initially, the buffer looks like this:

 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
 The sly gray fox circles around the unsuspecting rabbit
 The slow gray fox crawls under the rotting fence

And you want the buffer to look like this: (where additions are highlighted in bold)

 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog '''dog'''
 The sly gray fox circles around the unsuspecting rabbit '''rabbit'''
 The slow gray fox crawls under the rotting fence '''fence'''

To do this, start recording into the default register with &lt;tt&gt;qq&lt;tt&gt;, then append the line with &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;tt&gt;, type a space, then &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-P&lt;tt&gt;, then press the &lt;tt&gt;ESC&lt;tt&gt; key.   To finish recording, press &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;tt&gt; again.   Now the macro has been recorded into register '''q'''.  To repeat the command, move down one line, and repeat the command by typing &lt;tt&gt;@@&lt;tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;@q&lt;tt&gt;.  You can use &lt;tt&gt;@@&lt;tt&gt; to run this macro because q is the default register for macros.

=====Example 2=====
In another example, suppose you have the following lines in the register:

 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog dog
 The sly gray fox circles around the unsuspecting rabbit rabbit
 The slow gray fox crawls under the rotting fence fence

and you want to put HTML tags around the animal names (fox, dog and rabbit) to make them bold (eg, &lt;tt&gt;fox&lt;/tt&gt; needs to become &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;fox &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;).  Suppose you want to use register '''a''' for the macro.  

To start, move the cursor onto the first animal name--''fox''.  Place the cursor somewhere on the word, such as on the 'o' in fox.   Begin recording by typing &lt;tt&gt;qa&lt;/tt&gt;.  Next, delete the word into register '''b''' by typing &lt;tt&gt;&quot;bdaw&lt;/tt&gt; ''(see &lt;tt&gt;:help aw&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;:help d&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;:help &quot;&lt;/tt&gt; for an explanation of this command)''.  Next, enter insert mode by typing &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; and then type &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; followed by &lt;tt&gt;'''Ctrl-O'''&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;&quot;bP&lt;/tt&gt; ''(see &lt;tt&gt;:help i_CTRL-o&lt;/tt&gt; for an explanation of this command)''.  Next,  type &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and press ESC.  Finally, stop the recording by typing &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;/tt&gt;.  To repeat the command, move the cursor over the next word you wanted to surround with the HTML tags and run the macro by typing &lt;tt&gt;@a&lt;/tt&gt;.   You can see what the macro looks like by examining the register.  To do so, you may run the command &lt;tt&gt;:registers a&lt;/tt&gt;.  In this case, vim will show the following output:

 --- Registers ---
 &quot;a   &quot;bdawi&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''^O'''&quot;bP&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''^['''  

Note that a recording remembers all your movement commands, so you will need to put the cursor in the correct starting position before you begin recording.

=====Example 2b: fixing a macro=====
Suppose you made a minor mistake in your macro, but the macro is rather complex and you don't want to repeat all those commands again.  We would like to modify the contents of a register. In order to do this, we use the feature that typing &lt;tt&gt;&quot;''x''&lt;/tt&gt; in the escape mode uses the contents of register ''x'' for the next delete, yank, or put.

Assume that we are using register '''a''', 
* create a new line (this line will be eventually deleted) and put the register's contents on the line with &lt;tt&gt;&quot;ap&lt;/tt&gt; in the escape mode. This command is pasting (note the p in the command) the contents of register a (via &quot;a) into the line.
* Make the modifications as needed, and 
* put the modified line back into register '''a''' by moving to the start of the line (with &lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;) and typing &lt;tt&gt;&quot;ad$&lt;/tt&gt; in the escape mode.  (Do not use &lt;tt&gt;&quot;aD&lt;/tt&gt; because D will capture the newline character in the buffer as well.)  
* Test the macro to be sure it is working properly, then use it as needed.

==== Executing a command macro ====
To execute a macro stored in register &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;/tt&gt; once, you can just press &lt;tt&gt;@q&lt;/tt&gt;. But often, you would not write a macro to execute it only once and here the full power of Vim kicks in.

To apply the command to the lines 23 through 42, use &lt;tt&gt;:23,42norm! @q&lt;/tt&gt;, to apply it to all lines in your document use you can use &lt;tt&gt;:%norm! @q&lt;/tt&gt;.

The same also works for single commands that you can access with the dot.  If you have forgotten semicolons on some lines in your document, you would just execute &lt;tt&gt;A;&lt;tt&gt; followed by the &lt;tt&gt;ESC&lt;tt&gt; key. Then the command &lt;tt&gt;:23,42norm! .&lt;/tt&gt; will apply the same action to the lines 23 to 42 and insert a semicolon at the end of each line. 

==== Mapping a command ====

One of the advantages of mapping a new command is that you can put the mapping into your vimrc file for use later.  I have the following mapping
 map &amp;lt;C-k&amp;gt; :!%:p&amp;lt;C-m&amp;gt;  
What this does is maps the ''normal'' command Ctrl-K to run the current file as a script.  You could also perform the second &quot;Recording a command&quot; exercise from above (encase a word in bold tags) with this mapping:
 map &amp;lt;C-x&amp;gt;b &quot;bdawi&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;C-o&amp;gt;&quot;bp&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ESC&amp;gt;  
Note that in this case, I can get away with &quot;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&quot; because it doesn't match a special character name.  However, if I needed to avoid a conflict (if I wanted to map an insertion of &quot;&amp;lt;ESC&amp;gt;&quot;) I would use &amp;lt;lt&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;gt&amp;gt; for the less than and greater-than symbols.  (See &quot;:help key-codes&quot;)

If you want to map a command for insert mode, use imap instead of map.

If you want to prevent any of the commands in your map definitions from being interpreted in other mappings, use noremap (or inoremap for insert mode ''inoremap meaning '''i'''nsert mode '''no''' '''re'''-'''map''''')

== Enhancing Vim ==

=== The .vimrc file ===

You can make a configuration-file called .vimrc in your home directory and save any particular settings.
The existence of a '''vim'''rc has the side effect of making Vim enable all of Vim's incompatible changes to vi, making it more user-friendly. The name of the file depends on the operation system and user interface used:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|.vimrc ||Text-User-Interface on UNIX and VMS
|- 
|_vimrc ||Text-User-Interface on MS-Windows and VMS
|- 
|.gvimrc ||Graphical-User-Interface on UNIX and VMS 
|- 
|_gvimrc ||Graphical-User-Interface on MS-Windows and VMS 
|}

The alternatives with the underscore are for compatiblity with older filesystem. If you use Vim on several operating system and use a modern MS-Windows filesystem you don't have to maintain two configurations files. It is perfectly OK to set _vimrc to:

 {{Vi/Ex|source}} ~/.vimrc

and do all your configurations in &lt;tt&gt;.vimrc&lt;tt&gt;.

This is an example .vimrc file here:

 &quot;Everything after a double quote is a comment.
 
 &quot;Wrap text after 72 characters
 set textwidth=72
 
 &quot;Set tabs to 4 spaces
 set tabstop=4
 set shiftwidth=4
 set stselect=4
 set expandtab
 
 &quot;Tell Vim I use a dark background. Syntax highlighting (color coded text) will adjust to more appropriate colors.
 set background=dark
 
 &quot;Misc overwrites of default color highlighting.
 hi Comment ctermfg=DarkGreen
 hi String ctermfg=DarkMagenta
 hi pythonPreCondit ctermfg=Green
 
 &quot;Make sure that bottom status bar is running.
 set ruler
 set laststatus=2
 
 &quot;Make a mapping for &quot;Q&quot; which will reformat the current paragraph, comment,
 &quot;or code block according to the formatoptions setting:
 map Q gqap

=== Syntax Highlighting ===

Syntax highlighting is what allows you to highlight program code and other files for better readability, using colorization, bold, and other font modifications.

You may want to write simple syntax highlighting statements for easily detected patterns in your file.  That said, if you are thinking you need syntax highlighting for HTML, don't worry: most users do not need to define a syntax highlighting file for common filetypes--most of the file types common developers are interested have already been given a default syntax highlighting definition with Vim. Even if it doesn't come with vim, you can usually find someone who has shared their work on vim.org. However, if you need to write something simple, this section is for you. (If you need a syntax highlighting definition that will correctly show Perl code even inside an HTML &quot;pre&quot; tag inside a Perl print statement within a shell heredoc in a shell script, you're probably out of luck and this section probably won't meet your needs--but you might as well search vim.org, just in case someone has done it for you already).

Syntax highlighting is one of the most powerful features of Vim. However, it can also be one of the most difficult things to set up--if you don't know what you're doing (or if you just don't have the patience, or if you're dealing with complex program language grammars). So lets have a look at some easy highlighting definitions:

==== Lesson 1: Highlight Tabs ====

: ... or how to highlight a special characters

Say you need to know where in your file are tabs and where are spaces. With the following highlight you make tabs visible: 

 {{Vi/Ex|:syntax}} match Special &quot;\t&quot;

A syntax match matches a regular expression and applies the given color to it. In this case it is the color &quot;Special&quot;. You must make sure that the color &quot;Special&quot; has a non-standard background - otherwise you won't see a difference: 

 {{Vi/Ex|:highlight}} Special guifg=SlateBlue guibg=GhostWhite

You can also create a map in your .vimrc - so you can always activate the tab highlight:

 {{Vi/Ex|:nnoremap}} {{Vi/key|F12}}{{Vi/key|Tab}}      {{Vi/Ex|:syntax}} match Special &quot;\t&quot;{{Vi/key|CR}}
 {{Vi/Ex|:inoremap}} {{Vi/key|F12}}{{Vi/key|Tab}} {{Vi/key|C-O}}{{Vi/Ex|:syntax}} match Special &quot;\t&quot;{{Vi/key|CR}}

Another approach is to use listchars. These would be tabs, trailing spaces and line ends.
Note the use of &quot;&gt;-&quot; instead of the default &quot;^I&quot;. That prevents the layout change when showing/hidding listchars:
 {{Vi/Ex|:set}} lcs=tab:&gt;-,trail:%,eol:$ {{Vi/key|CR}}
 {{Vi/Ex|:map}} {{Vi/key|F12}} {{Vi/Ex|:set}} list!{{Vi/key|CR}}

==== Lesson 2: Highlight Space errors ====

: ... or how to highlight spaces at the end of line
: ... or how to find spaces and/or tabs

 {{Vi/Ex|:syntax}} match Error &quot;\s\+$&quot;

==== Lesson 3: Highlight Tab errors ====

: ... or how to not highlight characters serving as delimiter

Knowing where tabs are is good. But what about spaces before tabs? They just waste space in your file. The following highlight will show them to you:

 {{Vi/Ex|:syntax}} match Error &quot; \+\t&quot;me=e-1

The regular expression &lt;code&gt;&quot; \+\t&quot;&lt;/code&gt; searches for one or more space followed by a tab. That alone would solve the problem but would highlight the tab as error as well. Even better would be if we could highlight only the spaces and leave the tab as it is. And indeed this is possible and done by the &lt;code&gt;me=e-1&lt;/code&gt;. Basically it says: End the highlight one character before the last character found.

==== Lesson 4: Highlight Line length ====

: ... or how to highlight at a specific column
: ... or how to highlight inside other patterns
: ... or how to allow other pattern inside

The following match will highlight the column 78 when the line is 78 characters long. This can serve as a warning when you have a line which is longer than you wish it to be. Of course, such a highlight should not interfere with any other highlight you might use:

 {{Vi/Ex|:syntax}} match Error &quot;\(^.\{79\}\)\@&lt;=.&quot; contains=ALL containedin=ALL

Here is a description of how it works:

# The regular expression &lt;code&gt;\(^.\{79}\)&lt;/code&gt; searches for exactly 79 characters from the beginning of the line &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; and group &lt;code&gt;\( \)&lt;/code&gt; the result.
# &lt;code&gt;\@&lt;=&lt;/code&gt; will now &quot;zero match&quot; the group from 1. &quot;zero match&quot; means the text must be present, but is ignored once found.
# with &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; one more character is matched. This character is highlighted using the Error colour.
# With &lt;code&gt;contains=ALL&lt;/code&gt; we allow other highlight patterns to start inside our pattern.
# &lt;code&gt;containedin=ALL&lt;/code&gt; we allow our highlight pattern to start inside another pattern.

An alternative method is suggested by the Vim help system. This pair of commands will highlight all characters in virtual column 79 and more:

 {{Vi/Ex|:highlight}} rightMargin ctermfg=lightblue
 {{Vi/Ex|:match}} rightMargin /.\%&gt;79v/

And this will highlight only column 79:

 {{Vi/Ex|:highlight}} col79 ctermbg=red
 {{Vi/Ex|:highlight}} col79 guibg=red
 {{Vi/Ex|:match}} col79 /\%&lt;80v.\%&gt;79v/

Note the use of two items to also match a character that occupies more than one virtual column, such as a TAB.
In the last example, a separate ctermbg and guibg definition was added so that col79 does something in both Vim and gVim.

=== Omni Completion ===

From version 7 onwards Vim supports omni completions. This form of completions should work over several files and support all the twirks of a programming language. However, for it to work you need an appropriate &quot;*complete.vim&quot; script in your &quot;autoload/&quot; directory. This script must define a function called {{vi/Fn|...#Complete}} which does all the completion work for the programming language at hand.

However writing a useful complete function can be a difficult task. All the provided complete functions span several hundred lines of code.

Here a simple implementation used for the [[Ada Programming|Ada programming language]] described in detail so you can create your own. This implementation need a &quot;tags&quot; file which - for ada - you can create with &lt;code&gt;gnat xref -v&lt;/code&gt;.

The full version can be download from the [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1609 vim.org side]

==== Step by Step walkthrough ====

Set completion with {{vi/key|C-X}} {{vi/key|C-O}} to autoloaded function. This check is in place in case this script is sourced directly instead of using the autoload feature.

 {{vi/Ex|if}} {{vi/Fn|exists}} ('+omnifunc') &amp;&amp; &amp;omnifunc == &quot;&quot;
     {{vi/Ex|setlocal}} omnifunc={{vi/Fn|adacomplete#Complete}}
 {{vi/Ex|endif}}

Omnicompletion and autoload won't work with any version of Vim less than 7.00.

 {{vi/Ex|if}} version &lt; 700
     {{vi/Ex|finish}}
 {{vi/Ex|endif}}
 
All {{vi/Fn|complete#Complete}} functions have to cover two options: &lt;code&gt;a:findstart == 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a:findstart != 1&lt;/code&gt;.

     {{vi/Ex|function}} {{vi/Fn|adacomplete#Complete}} (findstart, base)

===== Findstart equals 1 =====

When &lt;code&gt;a:findstart == 1&lt;/code&gt; then we have to find out how many characters left of the cursor could be a part of an completion:

 	{{vi/Ex|if}} a:findstart == 1

For our simple example finding the beginning of the word is pretty simple. We look left until we find a character which cannot be part of a word. For most languages searching for “\i” should do the trick. However, for Ada we want to expand [[Ada Programming/Attributes|Attributes]] as well - hence we add “'” to the list of word characters.

 	    {{vi/Ex|let}} line = {{vi/Fn|getline}} ('.')
 	    {{vi/Ex|let}} start = {{vi/Fn|col}} ('.') - 1
 	    {{vi/Ex|while}} start &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; line[start - 1] =~ &lt;nowiki&gt;'\i\|'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 		{{vi/Ex|let}} start -= 1
 	    {{vi/Ex|endwhile}}
 	    {{vi/Ex|return}} start

===== Findstart not equal 1 =====

When &lt;code&gt;a:findstart != 1&lt;/code&gt; then we need to find possible completions for &lt;code&gt;a:base&lt;/code&gt;. There are two options open to return the found completions:

# returning them all as a {{vi/Type|List}} with {{vi/Ex|return}}.
# calling {{vi/Fn|complete_add}} for each completion found.

You can also use a combination of both - they will be merged then - so beware not to create duplicates. A completion can either be a {{vi/Type|String}} or a {{vi/Type|Directory}}.

In this example we use {{vi/Fn|complete_add}}.

 	{{vi/Ex|else}}

The search pattern should look for a:base at the beginning of the text matched.

 	    {{vi/Ex|let}} l:Pattern    = '^' . a:base . '.*$'

In a first step we add all known Ada [[Ada Programming/Keywords|Keywords]], [[Ada Programming/Pragmas|Pragmas]], [[Ada Programming/Attributes|Attributes]] and [[Ada Programming/Types|Types]]. They have been prepared as a {{vi/Type|List}} of {{vi/Type|Directorys}} by the [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1548 Ada file-type plugin]. All we have to to is iterate over the list and add all where the {{vi/Type|Directory}} entry “word” matches the pattern.

 	    {{vi/Ex|if}} {{vi/Fn|exists}} ('g:Ada_Keywords')
 		{{vi/Ex|for}} Tag_Item {{vi/Ex|in}} g:Ada_Keywords
 		    {{vi/Ex|if}} l:Tag_Item['word'] =~? l:Pattern

Add the value - incl. simple error handling.

 			{{vi/Ex|if}} {{vi/Fn|complete_add}} (l:Tag_Item) == 0
 			    {{vi/Ex|return}} []
 			{{vi/Ex|endif}}
 			{{vi/Ex|if} {{vi/Fn|complete_check}} ()
 			    return []
 			{{vi/Ex|endif}}
 		    {{vi/Ex|endif}}
 		{{vi/Ex|endfor}}
 	    {{vi/Ex|endif}}

===== Searching for matches =====

Here the real work is done: We search for matches inside the tag file. Of course you need a tag file first. There are many tools to create Vim compatible tag files. Just have a look around for one.

 	    {{vi/Ex|let}} l:Tag_List = {{vi/Fn|taglist}} (l:Pattern)

Again we need to iterate over all {{vi/Type|List}} elements found.

 	    {{vi/Ex|for}} Tag_Item {{vi/Ex|in}} l:Tag_List
 		{{vi/Ex|if}} l:Tag_Item['kind'] == ''
 		    {{vi/Ex|let}} l:Tag_Item['kind'] = 's'
 		{{vi/Ex|endif}}

Since the {{vi/Type|Directory}} structure for tags and completions are different the data needs to be converted.

The informations available inside the tag depend on the tag-file creation tool. But the minimum is:

; “name”: Name of the tag.
; “filename”: Name of the file where the tag is defined.
; “cmd”: Example command used to locate the tag in the file.
; “kind”: Type of the tag. The value for this entry depends on the language specific kind values generated by the ctags tool.

The contest of the completion is fixed and contains the following:

; “word”: The actual completion
; “kind”: The type of completion, one character, that is, “v” for variable.
; “menu”: Short extra info displayed inside the completion menu.
; “word”: Long extra info displayed inside an extra window.
; “icase”: Ignore case

So for simple tags without any extras the conversion could look like this:

 	        {{vi/Ex|let}} l:Match_Item = {
 		    \ 'word':  l:Tag_Item['name'],
 		    \ 'menu':  l:Tag_Item['filename'],
 		    \ 'info':  &quot;Symbol from file &quot; . l:Tag_Item['filename'] . &quot; line &quot; . l:Tag_Item['cmd'],
 		    \ 'kind':  l:Tag_Item['kind'],
 		    \ 'icase': 1}
 		{{vi/Ex|if}} {{vi/Fn|complete_add}} (l:Match_Item) == 0
 		    {{vi/Ex|return}} []
 		{{vi/Ex|endif}}
 		{{vi/Ex|if}} {{vi/Fn|complete_check}} ()
 		    {{vi/Ex|return}} []
 		{{vi/Ex|endif}}
 	    {{vi/Ex|endfor}}

; Please note: The current Ada plugin has been extended to also support &lt;code&gt;ctags&lt;/code&gt; which gives more information than &lt;code&gt;gnat xref -v&lt;/code&gt;. However we have not updated the walkthrough as we want to keep the example simple and easy to follow.

We already added all matches via {{vi/Fn|complete_add}} so we only return an empty list.

 	    {{vi/Ex|return}} []
 	{{vi/Ex|endif}}
     {{vi/Ex|endfunction}} {{vi/Fn|adacomplete#Complete}}
     {{vi/Ex|finish}}
 {{vi/Ex|endif}}

One last piece of advice: It your tag tool does not sort the entries then you should sort them separately. Searches on sorted tag-files are significantly faster.

VimL (aka [[w:Vimscript|Vimscript, or Vim script]]) is a full feature scripting language, meaning it can solve almost any text processing problem.

== Statements ==
{{incomplete}}

create a file to use do, while loop to key in person data

== Data types ==
There are five datatypes:

=== Number ===
A 32 bit signed integer.

=== String ===
A NULL terminated string of 8-bit unsigned characters (bytes). Strings can be created by either ‘'’ or ‘&quot;’ quotes. When using strings quoted with the double quote ‘&quot;’ the text is interpreted i.e. &quot;\n&quot; becomes a new line while strings quoted with a single quote ‘'’ are not interpreted, i.e. '\n' means just that, a backslash and an n. The following two strings are identical:

 {{vi/Ex|let}} String_1 = &quot;C:\\WinNT&quot;
 {{vi/Ex|let}} String_2 = 'C:\WinNT'

Any other datatype can be converted into a string using the {{Vi/Fn|string}} () function.

=== Funcref ===
A reference to a function. A Funcref can be created from a string by the use of the {{vi/Fn|function}} function.

 {{vi/Ex|let}} Function_1 = {{vi/Fn|function}} (&quot;MyFunc&quot;)

=== List ===
An ordered sequence of items.

 {{vi/Ex|let}} List_1 = [
     \ &quot;a&quot;,
     \ &quot;b&quot;,
     \ &quot;c&quot;]

A list can be created from a string by the use of the {{vi/Fn|split}} function.

 {{vi/Ex|let}} List_2 = {{vi/Fn|split}} (&quot;a b c&quot;)

=== Dictionary ===
An associative, unordered array: Each entry has a key and a value. 

 {{vi/Ex|let}} Dictionary_1 = {
     \ 1: 'one', 
     \ 2: 'two',
     \ 3: 'three'}

=== Objects ===
VIM also supports object oriented programming by combining {{vi/Type|Funcref}} and {{vi/Type|Dictionary}} to an Object:

 {{vi/Ex|let}} mydict = {
     \'data': [0, 1, 2, 3]}
 
 {{vi/Ex|function}} {{vi/Fn|mydict.len}} () dict
    {{vi/Ex|return}} {{vi/Fn|len}} (self.data)
 {{vi/Ex|endfunction}} {{vi/Fn|mydict.len}}

for more information see [[#Object oriented programming|Object oriented programming]]

== Control Structures ==
The existence of control structures is the main difference between vi's ex commands and vim's scripting language. They make the difference between a simple command set (vi) and a full features script language (vim).

=== condition ===
 {{Vi/Ex|if}} ''condition''
     ''operations''
 {{Vi/Ex|elseif}} ''condition''
     ''operations'' 
 {{Vi/Ex|else}}
     ''operations'' 
 {{Vi/Ex|endif}}

=== loop ===

==== while ====
 {{Vi/Ex|while}} ''condition''
     ''operations''
 {{Vi/Ex|endwhile}}

==== for ====
For loops are available from vim 7 onwards. They iterate over List or Directory structures.

 {{Vi/Ex|for}} ''var'' {{Vi/Ex|in}} ''list''
     ''operations''
 {{Vi/Ex|endfor}}

=== exceptions ===
 {{Vi/Ex|try}}
     ''operations''
 {{Vi/Ex|catch}} /''pattern''/
     ''error handling operations''
 {{Vi/Ex|finally}}
     ''clean-up operations''
 {{Vi/Ex|endtry}}

== Subprograms ==

=== Simple Subprograms ===
Like most [[w:Shell (computing)|Shell-Languages]] all subprograms are stored in separate files which you load either with the {{Vi/Ex|source}} or {{Vi/Ex|runtime}} command. The difference lies in the use of a search path. {{Vi/Ex|runtime}} uses a search path and allows wildcards to find the sub-program while {{Vi/Ex|source}} need the full path. The following commands do the same - provided that &quot;~/vimfiles&quot; is part of your runtime search path:

 {{Vi/Ex|runtime}} setup.vim
 {{Vi/Ex|source}}  ~/vimfiles/setup.vim

For both commands need to add the &lt;code&gt;.vim&lt;/code&gt; extension. Since {{Vi/Ex|runtime}} supports both a search path and wildcards more than one match is possible. If you want {{Vi/Ex|runtime}} to load all the matches - and not just the first hit - use {{Vi/Ex|runtime!}}.

=== Functions ===
 {{Vi/Ex|function}} ''f'' ( ''parameter'' )
     ''operations''
 {{Vi/Ex|endfunction}}

New with vim 7 is the autoload option for functions. If you name a function ''Filename''#''Functionname'' or ''Directory''#''Filename''#''Functionname'' then the function will be automatically loaded on first call. The file containing the function must be placed in one of the &quot;autoload&quot; runtime directories and be named &quot;Filename.vim&quot; or &quot;Directory/Filename.vim&quot;. This option is especially useful for functions which you don't always need on in [[#Object oriented programming|Object oriented programming]].

=== Commands ===
 {{Vi/Ex|command}} '''Command''' ''Command''

Command are often used as shortcut for functions and subprograms:

 {{Vi/Ex|command}} '''C''' -nargs=* {{Vi/Ex|call}} F ( &lt;f-args&gt; )
 {{Vi/Ex|command}} '''C''' {{Vi/Ex|source}} ~/vimfiles/s.vim

== Object oriented programming ==
Vim 7 now allows [[Object Oriented Programming|object oriented programming]]. However, in order to make it real you need to combine several features, namely [[#Dictionary|Dictionaries]], [[#Funcref|Funcrefs]] and the new [[#Functions|function autoload]].

The following example class is taken from the gnat compiler plugin for vim. The actual functions implementations have been removed as they are not needed to understand the concept. If you like to have a look at the full version you can download the plugin from  [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1609 vim.org site].

=== Step by Step walk-through ===
We add our new class to a autoload script. That way the class is available when and only when needed:

 {{Vi/Ex|if}} {{Vi/Fn|exists}} (&quot;g:loaded_gnat_autoload&quot;) || version &lt; 700
     {{Vi/Ex|finish}}
 {{Vi/Ex|else}}
    {{Vi/Ex|let}} g:loaded_gnat_autoload=1

Each function we define need to be defined with the &quot;dict&quot; attribute. Apart from that they are just normal scripting functions.

    {{Vi/Ex|function}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#Make}} () dict
       ...
       {{Vi/Ex|return}}
    {{Vi/Ex|endfunction}} gnat#Make
 
    {{Vi/Ex|function}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#Pretty}} () dict
       ...
       {{Vi/Ex|return}}
    {{Vi/Ex|endfunction}} gnat#Make
 
    {{Vi/Ex|function}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#Find}} () dict
       ...
       {{Vi/Ex|return}}
    {{Vi/Ex|endfunction}} gnat#Find
 
    {{Vi/Ex|function}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#Tags}} () dict
       ...
       {{Vi/Ex|return}}
    {{Vi/Ex|endfunction}} gnat#Tags
 
    {{Vi/Ex|function}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#Set_Project_File}} (...) dict
       ...
       {{Vi/Ex|return}}
    {{Vi/Ex|endfunction}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#Set_Project_File}}
 
    {{Vi/Ex|function}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#Get_Command}} (Command) dict
       ...
       {{Vi/Ex|return}} ...
    {{Vi/Ex|endfunction}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#Get_Command}}

The most important step is the composition of the object. In most OO languages this happens automatically - But with vim we have to do this ourselves. For best flexibility the use of a so called constructor function is suggested. The constructor is not marked with &quot;dict&quot;:

    {{Vi/Ex|function}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#New}} ()

The constructor creates a dictionary which assigns all the object functions to one element of the dictionary:

       {{Vi/Ex|let}} Retval = {
 	 \ 'Make'	      : {{Vi/Fn|function}} ('gnat#Make'),
 	 \ 'Pretty'	      : {{Vi/Fn|function}} ('gnat#Pretty'),
 	 \ 'Find'	      : {{Vi/Fn|function}} ('gnat#Find'),
 	 \ 'Tags'	      : {{Vi/Fn|function}} ('gnat#Tags'),
 	 \ 'Set_Project_File' : {{Vi/Fn|function}} ('gnat#Set_Project_File'),
 	 \ 'Get_Command'      : {{Vi/Fn|function}} ('gnat#Get_Command'),
 	 \ 'Project_File'     : '',

We optionally can now add data entries to our object:

 	 \ 'Make_Command'     : '&quot;gnat make -P &quot; . self.Project_File . &quot;  -F -gnatef  &quot;',
 	 \ 'Pretty_Command'   : '&quot;gnat pretty -P &quot; . self.Project_File . &quot; &quot;',
 	 \ 'Find_Program'     : '&quot;gnat find -P &quot; . self.Project_File . &quot; -F &quot;',
 	 \ 'Tags_Command'     : '&quot;gnat xref -P &quot; . self.Project_File . &quot; -v  *.AD*&quot;',
 	 \ 'Error_Format'     : '%f:%l:%c: %trror: %m,'   .
 			      \ '%f:%l:%c: %tarning: %m,' .
 			      \ '%f:%l:%c: (%ttyle) %m'}

If needed additional modifications to the object are also possible. At this stage you can already use the OO-way:

       {{Vi/Ex|if}} {{Vi/Fn|argc}}() == 1 &amp;&amp; {{Vi/Fn|fnamemodify}}({{Vi/Fn|argv}} (0), ':e') == 'gpr'
 	 {{Vi/Ex|call}} {{Vi/Fn|Retval.Set_Project_File}}(argv(0))
       {{Vi/Ex|elseif}}  {{Vi/Fn|strlen}}(v:servername) &gt; 0
 	 {{Vi/Ex|call}} {{Vi/Fn|Retval.Set_Project_File}}(v:servername . '.gpr')
       {{Vi/Ex|endif}}

The last operation of the  constructor is the return of the newly created object.
 
       {{Vi/Ex|return}} Retval
    {{Vi/Ex|endfunction}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#New}}

It is also possible to defined additional non dict functions. These functions are the equivalent to the &quot;static&quot; or &quot;class&quot; methods of other OO languages.
 
    {{Vi/Ex|function}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#Insert_Tags_Header}}()
       ...
       {{Vi/Ex|return}}
    {{Vi/Ex|endfunction}} {{Vi/Fn|gnat#Insert_Tags_Header}}
 
    {{Vi/Ex|finish}}
 {{Vi/Ex|endif}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are three main spectroscopic techniques which can be used to identify organic molecules: infrared (IR), mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

IR and NMR spectroscopy are based on observing the frequencies of electromagnetic radiation absorbed and emitted by molecules. MS is based on measuring the mass of the molecule and any fragments of the molecule which may be produced in the MS instrument.

=Mass Spectroscopy=

A mass spectroscope measures the exact mass of ions. An organic sample can be introduced into a mass spectroscope and ionised. This also breaks some molecules into smaller fragments.

The resulting mass spectrum shows:

1) The heaviest ion is simply the ionised molecule itself. We can simply record its mass.

2) Other ions are fragments of the molecule and give information about its structure. Common fragments are:
&lt;center&gt;
{|
|'''species'''
|'''formula'''
|'''mass'''
|-
|methyl
|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|15
|-
|ethyl
|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|29
|-
|phenyl
|C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|77
|}
&lt;/center&gt;


=NMR Spectroscopy=

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is one of the most useful analytical techniques for determining the structure of an organic compound. There are two main types of NMR, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR (Proton NMR) and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR (Carbon NMR). At A-level we only need to know about &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR.

NMR is based on the fact that the nuclei of atoms have a quantised property called spin. When a magnetic field is applied to a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nucleus, the nucleus can align either with (spin +1/2) or against (spin -1/2) the applied magnetic field.

These two states have different potential energies and the energy difference depends on the strength of the magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field about a nucleus, however, depends on the chemical environment around the nucleus. For example, the negatively charged electrons around and near the nucleus can shield the nucleus from the magnetic field, lowering the strength of the effective magnetic field felt by the nucleus. This, in turn, will lower the energy needed to transition between the +1/2 and -1/2 states. Therefore, the transition energy will be lower for nuclei attached to electron donating groups (such as alkyl groups) and higher for nuclei attached to electron withdrawing groups (such as a hydroxyl group).

In an NMR machine, the compound being analysed is placed in a strong magnetic field and irradiated with radio waves to cause all the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei to occupy the higher energy -1/2 state. As the nuclei relax back to the +1/2 state, they release radio waves corresponding to the energy of the difference between the two spin states. The radio waves are recorded and analysed by computer to give an intensity versus frequency plot of the sample. This information can then be used to determine the structure of the compound.

=Infrared spectroscopy.=



Absorbing infrared radiation makes covalent bonds vibrate. Different types of bond absorb different wavelengths of infrared:
 
Instead of wavelength, infrared spectroscopists record the wavenumber; the number of waves that fit into 1 cm. (This is easily converted to the energy of the wave.)

For some reason the spectra are recorded backwards (from 4000 to 500 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is typical), often with a different scale below 1000 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (to see the fingerprint region more clearly) and upside-down (% radiation transmitted is recorded instead of the absorbance of radiation).

The wavenumbers of the absorbed IR radiation are characteristic of many bonds, so IR spectroscopy can determine which functional groups are contained in the sample.  For example, the carbonyl (C=O) bond will absorb at 1650-1760cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Typical method ==

&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Infrared_spectroscopy|Wikipedia article.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IR_spectroscopy_apparatus.svg|thumbnail|centre|400px|Typical apparatus]]

A beam of infra-red light is produced and split into two separate beams. One is passed through the sample, the other passed through a reference which is often the substance the sample is dissolved in. The beams are both reflected back towards a detector, however first they pass through a splitter which quickly alternates which of the two beams enters the detector. The two signals are then compared and a printout is obtained. 

A reference is used for two reasons:
*This prevents fluctuations in the output of the source affecting the data

*This allows the effects of the solvent to be cancelled out (the reference is usually a pure form of the solvent the sample is in).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Each functional group has its characteristic reactions. Synthetic chemists use their understanding of how chemical changes take place (reaction mechanisms) to devise efficient synthetic routes for the preparation of organic compounds.
In order to give details of the main types of chemical reaction you should be able to recognise and give examples of various reaction types:
==Redox==
Oxidation is defined as when a molecule or atom:
*Loses electrons
*Loses hydrogen atoms
*Gains oxygen atoms

(These are really the same process. Hydrogen normally exists chemically as the hydrogen ion, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Losing a hydrogen atom is equivalent to losing a hydrogen ion and an electron.
Oxygen normally exists as the oxide, O&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. When a molecule gains an oxygen atom, it has to lose two electrons to convert oxygen to oxide.)
Oxidising agents include potassium manganate (VII) (‘permanganate’, KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and potassium dichromate (VI) (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;). The metals in these compounds have lost many electrons (7 and 6 respectively). They oxidise other compounds to recover their own lost electrons.
 
Reduction is the opposite of oxidation (fill in the blanks):
*
*
*
Reducing agents include hydrogen itself and hydrogen-rich metallic compounds such as lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and sodium borohydride (NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

*Alkenes can be oxidised to alcohols
*Alcohols can be oxidised to aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids.
*Aldehyes can be oxidised to carboxylic acids.
*Carboxylic acids can be reduced to alcohols.

==Hydrolysis (as a substitution reaction)==
The hydroxide ion (OH-) can replace the –NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group of an amine or a primary amide.
Secondary amides and esters can be split into carboxylic acids and alcohols or amines by the addition of a water molecule. This is the reverse of the condensation process that forms amides and esters. An acid or base catalyst is used.
If a base catalyst is used, the salt of the carboxylic acid is obtained, not the acid itself. If an acid catalyst is used to hydrolyse an amide, the ammonium salt is generated, not the amine.
==Esterification==
Esters are formed when an alcohol and a carboxylic acid react. To catalyse the reaction an acid is added. Concentrated sulphuric acid is used because it also removes the water formed and so helps drive the reaction forwards.
==Condensation polymerisation==
Esterification links two molecules to form a larger one, but many more molecules can be incorporated if required. With a diol and a dicarboxylic acid, for example, we can make a polyester:

Secondary amides form from amines and carboxylic acids in the same way as esters form from alcohols and carboxylic acids:

Not surprisingly, we can make polyamides from diamines and dicarboxylic acids:

Polyamides are also made from amino acids. Proteins are polyamides. Artificial polyamides are commonly known as nylons.

These polymeric substances are useful as fibres and gears.
Your notes should include balanced chemical equations for the various types of reaction.
You should note the reagents that are used in the reactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Organic compounds and functional groups==
The chemistry of carbon is almost entirely due to covalent bonding. Almost without limit, carbon can form four covalent bonds with a wide range of non-metallic elements.
Carbon is able to form long chains of atoms to form quite stable molecules. The chains may be branched or form loops. Many other atoms will form stable bonds to carbon. Carbon can also form multiple bonds e.g. a carbon atom can form a triple bond to another carbon atom, or a nitrogen atom.
Here are some examples of organic compounds. For each element, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, count how many covalent bonds the element forms. For each element, does the number of bonds change?

Because the bonding of each element is so regular, it is common to write the structures without showing every atom and bond:
 	 
 
Draw the full structures (showing all atoms and bonds) of these molecules:

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; '''pentane'''

'''''trans'''''-'''3-methylhex-3-ene'''

===Aliphatic compounds===
‘Aliphatic’ organic compounds are based on simple chains of carbon atoms. Other organic compounds are based around the ring structure of benzene and are known as ‘aromatic’.

Classify these compounds as aromatic or aliphatic:

Pentane
Butanamide
Aspirin

The naming and chemistry of aromatic compounds is not covered in these notes.

Naming aliphatic compounds is fairly simple. The name is based on the longest single chain of carbon atoms:

|Ethane	
|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

These are simple ‘alkane’ compounds. Some other patterns of atoms are seen over and over again. These are called ‘functional groups’ and each has characteristic chemistry.
They are named by attaching a suffix or prefix to the name of the relevant alkane e.g. ethanol (ethane + -ol) is an alcohol with two carbon atoms, butanamide (butane + -amide) is an amide with four carbons. 
Complete the following table:

Structural formulae and three-dimensional shapes.
The basic shape of organic molecules is based on the tetrahedron and the equilateral triangle.
Use models (either on the computer or the plastic kits available in class) to examine and draw the following shapes:
Carbon with just single bonds: e.g. CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Carbon with one double bond: e.g. CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Nitrogen and oxygen are similar, but without all four bonds:
Compare:

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;	CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH	CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;	CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Isomers==
There are two molecules with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. What are their structures? What are their names?

These molecules are isomers: different compounds with the same formula. Because the bonding is different in the two C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; isomers, they are called ‘structural isomers’.
Note that to make one isomer into another, you need to break at least one bond.
There are three structural isomers of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O. Try to draw and name them:

Numbers are included in the name when the functional group could be attached more than one carbon atom.
There are six isomers with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. How many can you draw? How many can you name?

==Conformations==
Using models, notice how a single bond can easily rotate. Double bonds will not rotate unless broken. Because you need to break the double bond to rotate it, there are two isomers of but-2-ene:

The bonding is the same in these two molecules, so they are not ‘structural isomers’. They are ‘stereoisomers’.
Draw the stereoisomers of these compounds and name them. If there are no stereoisomers then say so.
Propen-1-ol

Propen-2-ol

Pent-2-ene

      <comment>/* External factors as theme and motif */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The character’s external aspects include factors such as age, race, gender, physical strength, health, disability, clothing, and jewelry. 

A character's appearance is probably the most basic technique of characterization and individualization: what a person looks like reveals a great deal about who that person is, his attitude, perhaps even his mental state, his economic and social status, and so on. We form our initial attitude about a person based on his appearance, and we either like or dislike him; we either take him seriously or we dismiss him. Although some stories rely on external character aspects in their plot—for instance in the film Speed, the antagonist is caught because one of his fingers is missing—not all stories do so. This does not mean, however, that the author does not need to know what his character looks like. The author should know his character's external aspects even if none of these will make it into the story, even if the plot will not rely on them. When the author does include external aspects of character in the story, he must make sure that every aspect mentioned serves a purpose. No aspect should be brought up unless it will be paid off; the external aspects must have story consequences. External aspects of character matter: they are the significant details that reveal character nature and past, they affect the formation of character, they can create a need, have thematic significance, serve as motifs, limit and create opportunities for action, and be consistent or contrast with the character's story function. Let us examine each of these aspects. 


== External aspects as significant details ==

	
Significant details are those that create an impression of something larger than themselves. What detail is significant depends, of course, on what the author is attempting to convey about the subject he is describing. Details are significant if they convey a character's past, and this is what the author wishes to convey. The detail should be such that it is telling of something about the character's nature, life, goals, etc.  
	
An important thing to remember when considering significant details is that you should not lump them all into a single paragraph. A sentence or two suffices, and you are served better when you dole out description throughout the story action rather than force the reader to wade through paragraphs of it. Of course, remember that each detail mentioned serves a narrative purpose; don't mention something just because it sounds good, or is interesting for its own sake—you have a person to portray, so pick the details that evoke who he is. 


== External aspects and formation of character ==


The most obvious external factors of a character that influence his formation as a person are sex, race, and physical appearance. This is because sex, race, and physical appearance influence the formative experiences a person will go through, experiences that determine who he becomes and affects his way of seeing the world as well as himself. 
The life of a woman is very different, obviously, from that of a man, even if they come from the same family. Their parents treat them differently, and they go through vastly different sexual experiences. 

Race is another external factor that affects the development of a person's nature because race determines what kind of experiences a person will have, how he will be treated, and it comes with expectations, like gender, of what is acceptable and what is not. An African-American or Asian or Arab child experiences different things than does a white child, even if they live in the same neighborhood. This is so because, in a predominantly white environment, such outsiders are treated differently. Of course, a Hispanic teen attending a predominantly Hispanic high school in Southern California has different experiences than a Hispanic teen who attends Beverly Hills High School. 

Besides race and gender, physical factors have a great deal of influence on the formation of a character. A fat kid lives in a different world than an attractive, slim child, even if they live in the same neighborhood and are the same sex and race. An attractive person lives a different kind of existence than an unattractive one; being desired by others enables certain personality traits and retards others. Conversely, an unattractive person struggles constantly with self-esteem issues, living the life of someone who is not desired. 

Of course, sex, race, and physical appearance are not the only external factors that can affect a character's formation. Take for instance a teenager who can’t afford the right clothes, and has to wear clothing from a thrift store instead. This will have an impact on him, one way or the other. It will affect how he feels about himself, and it will motivate him to do something to fit it, perhaps he will take a job at the expense of academics. It may force him to compensate by focusing on being a perfect student. Whatever happens as a result, his clothing will affect him in a way that will have consequences. And what about a teen whose wealthy father forces him to wear used clothes as a way to build his son’s character? How does he feel about these character-building exercises? You can be sure that consequences will flow from this experience.


== External factors and need ==


Let's consider the unattractive person from the previous section. His great need is to be desired. Of course, he won't be desired for his looks, so he must find an alternate avenue of showing merit. This is known as compensation. Often, unattractive people, or, of course, people who feel unattractive, make up for being unattractive by excelling in something, such as math, art, or sports. By demonstrating extraordinary skill or ability, they are accepted into the group and receive respect and attention from the others. In practical terms, this may mean that the character's need is to be desired, to be accepted by his peers, or to be respected, and his goal will be to get into a brand name school, get a particular kind of a car, or do something that his peers respect, which may mean stealing a car just as well as winning a sports tournament. Why would a character want to steal? Because what is worthy of respect depends entirely on who his peers are, and the environment in which he exists. 



== External factors as theme and motif ==


A motif is something that is introduced in one context, and then brought up in different contexts so that meaning will result. For instance, a character may gain extraordinary physical strength, which may be a motif that runs through a story. How the character uses his strength, in different contexts, contributes to the story meaning or theme. 
In Spiderman, the protagonist is transformed into a spider man through a genetically altered spider's bite. Initially, as the protagonist explores his newfound power, the motif of strength is presented in neutral or fun scenes. Having such awesome power is fun, the story is saying. But the change in his physical nature reflects a theme about strength and responsibility. This theme is revealed through the motif in several ways. When Spiderman does not stop the robbery in the wrestling arena office, he chooses not to use his strength to stop an evil deed. He is still acting in a light-hearted manner, ignoring, or perhaps unaware of, the true realities of his new found abilities. What are the consequences? The thief that Spiderman chose not to stop kills his uncle, and the story changes drastically. Later, the consequence of his power, his secret life that it necessitates, prevents him from having the girl that he desires. How a character gains his strength, how he uses it, what he loses and gains in his life, how he ends up as a result of using it—these are the building blocks of meaning.

== External factors as limits and opportunities ==


Factors of physical nature limit and give rise to opportunities for particular avenues of action a character can take; an older character will not do what a younger one may, a character who is in-shape will not take the same road as a weakling, and a character dressed in rags will be treated differently than a man in an expensive suit. 
While a character’s physical nature and physical aspects may seem somewhat trivial as a concept in story development, they can, in fact, have a major impact. The impact lies in the consequences of the attribute, and anything that has consequences for the character, now or later, is relevant in story development.

In the novel “Code to Zero” by Ken Follett, the protagonist is attempting to uncover his identity. His initial plan of action to achieve this goal is to seek the help of the police. The obstacle to this is something very humble, and seemingly inconsequential-he’s dressed in bum’s attire. The police officer he encounters, however, beats him up instead of helping him. This forces the protagonist to go on a quest to obtain proper attire so that he can resume his quest to find his identity, and a major sequence of action follows. And for anyone interested in theme and meaning, the fact that the officer beats up a man dressed in rags instead of helping him shows the kind of a world America of the 50s was. From this example we can see how something as trivial as clothing can have a major impact on how the protagonist can pursue his goal, and what avenues of action are available to him. 



== External factors and story role ==


External factors and the role a character plays in the story can contrast or reinforce one another. In the film Alien, the antagonist and its appearance complement one another perfectly. Although appearance often signals to the audience the story role of the character, one must be careful not to fall into stereotype with this approach. 
	

Consider these questions: 

1.	Why have I chosen these particular aspects of appearance and what will the effect of my choice be on the story? 

2.	Are these factors in contrast or in harmony with the role this character plays in the story, and why? 

3.	In what way do aspects of physical characterization reveal the character’s nature? 

4.	Is an aspect of physical nature or appearance a source of conflict, and why?

5.	Is a physical attribute a source of the character’s goal or need, and why? 

6.	How does the character feel about his appearance? 

7.	How does his appearance affect him? 

8.	Is there a contrast between how he is and how he imagines himself to be? 

9.	What does this contrast reveal about him? 

10.	How would he like to be? 

11.	What does the contrast between how he is and how he would like to be cause? 

12.	Does it make him compensate? 

13.	What does he do to compensate for what he doesn’t have? 

14.	How does his desire to be what he would like to be inform his goal? 

15.	Does the character act his age, his gender? 

16.	What does he wear? 

17.	Are his clothes expensive or cheap? 

18.	What is the story behind his clothes? 

19.	Does he have a lucky pair of pants, for instance? 

20.	Does he have any body decorations? 

21.	What kind of jewelry does he have?
 
22.	What is the story behind his jewelry? 

23.	Did he get that Rolex from a man he'd shot? 

24.	What’s his manner like? 

25.	Does he speak with an accent? 

26.	What does his voice sound like? 

27.	How much does he weigh?
 
28.	Does he have hair? 


	At the end of this section you should have a clear image of your character in mind. He should be an individual with logical reasons for his appearance and physical attributes, reasons that hint at his past, and perhaps his future; he should look as if he had a past and has a future. You can go further by drawing your character or finding a picture of someone who resembles your character.

{{Control Systems/Stub}}
== Nonlinear General Solution ==
{{Wikipedia|Non-linear control}}
A nonlinear system, in general, can be defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = f(t, t_0, x, x_0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x(t_0) = x_0&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''f'' is a nonlinear function of the time, the system state, and the initial conditions. If the initial conditions are known, we can simplify this as:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = f(t, x)&lt;/math&gt;

The general solution of this equation (or the most general form of a solution that we can state without knowing the form of ''f'') is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t f(\tau, x)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

and we can prove that this is the general solution to the above equation because when we differentiate both sides we get the general solution. 

=== Iteration Method ===

The general solution to a nonlinear system can be found through a method of infinite iteration. We will define ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; as being an iterative family of indexed variables. We can define them recursively as such:

:&lt;math&gt;x_n(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t f(\tau, x_{n-1}(\tau))d\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_1(t) = x_0&lt;/math&gt;

We can show that the following relationship is true:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \lim_{n \to \infty}x_n(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; series of equations will converge on the solution to the equation as n approaches infinity.


=== Types of Nonlinearities ===
Nonlinearities can be of two types:
# '''Intentional non-linearity''': The non-linear elements that are added into a system. Eg: Relay
# '''Incidental non-linearity''': The non-linear behavior that is already present in the system. Eg: Saturation

== Linearization ==

Nonlinear systems are difficult to analyze, and for that reason one of the best methods for analyzing those systems is to find a linear approximation to the system. Frequently, such approximations are only good for certain operating ranges, and are not valid beyond certain bounds. The process of finding a suitable linear approximation to a nonlinear system is known as '''linearization'''.

[[Image:Linear Approximation.svg|500px|center]]

This image shows a linear approximation (dashed line) to a non-linear system response (solid line). This linear approximation, like most, is accurate within a certain range, but becomes more inaccurate outside that range. Notice how the curve and the linear approximation diverge towards the right of the graph.

{{info|The topics in this chapter will rely heavily on topics from a calculus-based background in probability theory. There currently are no wikibooks available that contain this information. The reader should be familiar with the following concepts: Gaussian Random Variables, Mean, Expectation Operation.}}

== Noise-Driven Systems ==

Systems frequently have to deal with not only the control input ''u'', but also a random noise input ''v''. In some disciplines, such as in a study of electrical communication systems, the noise and the data signal can be added together into a composite input ''r = u + v''. However, in studying control systems, we can not combine these inputs together, for a variety of different reasons:

#The control input works to stabilize the system, and the noise input works to destabilize the system.
#The two inputs are independent random variables.
#The two inputs may act on the system in completely different ways.

As we will show in the next example, it is frequently a good idea to consider the noise and the control inputs separately:

{{TextBox|1='''Example:''' Consider a moving automobile. The control signals for the automobile consist of acceleration (gas pedal) and deceleration (brake pedal) inputs acting on the wheels of the vehicle, and working to create forward motion. The noise inputs to the system can consist of wind pushing against the vertical faces of the automobile, rough pavement (or even dirt) under the tires, bugs and debris hitting the front windshield, etc. As we can see, the control inputs act on the wheels of the vehicle, while the noise inputs can act on multiple sides of the vehicle, in different ways.}}

== Probability Refresher ==

We are going to have a brief refesher here for calculus-based probability, specifically focusing on the topics that we will use in the rest of this chapter.

=== Expectation ===

The expectation operatior, '''E''', is used to find the ''expected, or mean value'' of a given random variable. The expectation operator is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;E[x] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_x(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

If we have two variables that are independent of one another, the expectation of their product is zero.

=== Covariance ===

The '''covariance''' matrix, ''Q'', is the expectation of a random vector times it's transpose:

:&lt;math&gt;E[x(t)x'(t)] = Q(t)&lt;/math&gt;

If we take the value of the ''x'' transpose at a different point in time, we can calculate out the covariance as:

:&lt;math&gt;E[x(t)x'(s)] = Q(t)\delta(t-s)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;delta; is the impulse function.

== Noise-Driven System Description ==

We can define the state equation to a system incorporating a noise vector ''v'':

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = A(t)x(t) + H(t)u(t) +B(t)v(t)&lt;/math&gt;

For generality, we will discuss the case of a time-variant system. Time-invariant system results will then be a simplification of the time-variant case. Also, we will assume that ''v'' is a '''gaussian random variable'''. We do this because physical systems frequently approximate gaussian processes, and because there is a large body of mathematical tools that we can use to work with these processes. We will assume our gaussian process has zero-mean.

== Mean System Response ==

We would like to find out how our system will respond to the new noisy input. Every system iteration will have a different response that varies with the noise input, but the average of all these iterations should converge to a single value. 

For the system with zero control input, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)v(t)&lt;/math&gt;

For which we know our general solution is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \phi(t, t_0)x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t \phi(t, \tau)B(\tau)v(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

If we take the '''expected value''' of this function, it should give us the expected value of the output of the system. In other words, we would like to determine what the expected output of our system is going to be by adding a new, noise input.

:&lt;math&gt;E[x(t)] = E[\phi(t, t_0)x_0] + E[\int_{t_0}^t \phi(t, \tau)B(\tau)v(\tau)d\tau]&lt;/math&gt;

In the second term of this equation, neither &amp;\phi; nor B are random variables, and therefore they can come outside of the expectaion operation. Since ''v'' is zero-mean, the expectation of it is zero.  Therefore, the second term is zero. In the first equation, $phi; is not a random variable, but x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; does create a dependancy on the output of ''x''(t), and we need to take the expectation of it. This means that:

:&lt;math&gt;E[x(t)] = \phi(t, t_0)E[x_0]&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the expected output of the system is, on average, the value that the output would be if there were no noise. Notice that if our noise vector ''v'' was not zero-mean, and if it was not gaussian, this result would not hold. 

== System Covariance ==

We are now going to analyze the covariance of the system with a noisy input. We multiply our system solution by its transpose, and take the expectation: &lt;small&gt;(this equation is long and might break onto multiple lines)&lt;/small&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E[x(t)x'(t)] = E[\phi(t, t_0)x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t\phi(\tau, t_0)B(\tau)v(\tau)d\tau]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;E[(\phi(t, t_0)x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t\phi(\tau, t_0)B(\tau)v(\tau)d\tau)']&lt;/math&gt;

If we multiply this out term by term, and cancel out the expectations that have a zero-value, we get the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;E[x(t)x'(t)] = \phi(t, t_0)E[x_0x_0']\phi'(t, t_0) = P&lt;/math&gt;

We call this result ''P'', and we can find the first derivative of P by using the chain-rule:

:&lt;math&gt;P'(t) = A(t)\phi(t, t_0)P_0\phi(t, t_0) + \phi(t, t_0)P_0\phi'(t, t_0)A'(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = E[x_0x_0']&lt;/math&gt;

We can reduce this to:

:&lt;math&gt;P'(t) = A(t)P(t) + P(t)A'(t) + B(t)Q(t)B'(t)&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, we can analyze the system ''without needing to calculate the state-transition matrix''. This is a good thing, because it can often be very difficult to calculate the state-transition matrix.

== Alternate Analysis ==

Let us look again at our general solution:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \phi(t, t_0)x(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^t \phi(t, \tau)B(\tau)v(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

We can run into a problem because in a gaussian distribution, especially systems with high variance (especially systems with infinite variance), the value of ''v'' can momentarily become undefined (approach infinity), which will cause the value of ''x'' to likewise become undefined at certain points. This is unacceptable, and makes further analysis of this problem difficult. Let us look again at our original equation, with zero control input:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = A(t)x(t)+B(t)v(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We can multiply both sides by ''dt'', and get the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;dx = A(t)x(t)dt + B(t)v(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

{{SideBox|This new term, ''dw'', is a random process known as a '''Weiner Process''', which the result of transforming a gaussian process in this manner.}}

We can define a new differential, ''dw(t)'', which is an infinitesimal function of time as:

:&lt;math&gt;dw(t) = v(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can integrate both sides of this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^t A(\tau)x(\tau)d\tau + \int_{t_0}^tB(\tau)dw(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;
{{wikipedia|Ito Calculus}}
However, this leads us to an unusual place, and one for which we are (probably) not prepared to continue further: in the third term on the left-hand side, we are attempting to integrate with respect to a ''function'', not a ''variable''. In this instance, the standard Riemann integrals that we are all familiar with cannot solve this equation. There are advanced techniques known as '''Ito Calculus''' however that can solve this equation, but these methods are currently outside the scope of this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An essential part of the first-aid treatment is immobilizing  the  injured  part  with  splints so that the sharp ends of broken bones won’t move around and cause further damage to nerves, blood vessels, or vital organs.  Splints are also used to immobilize severely injured joints or muscles and to prevent the enlargement of extensive wounds. 

Before you can use a splint, you need to have a general understanding of the use of splints. In an emergency, almost any firm object or material can be used as a splint. Such things as umbrellas, canes, tent pegs, sticks, oars, paddles, spars, wire, leather, boards, pillows,  heavy clothing, corrugated cardboard, and folded newspapers can be used as splints.   A   fractured leg may sometimes be splinted by fastening it securely to the uninjured leg. Splints, whether ready-made or improvised, must meet the following requirements: 

* Be light in weight, but still be strong and fairly rigid. 
* Be long enough to reach the joints above and below the fracture. 
* Be wide enough so the bandages used to hold them in place won’t pinch the injured part.
* Be well padded on the sides that touch the body. If they’re not properly padded, they won’t fit well and won’t adequately immobilize the injured part. 
* To improvise the padding for a splint, use articles of  clothing,  bandages,  cotton,  blankets,  or  any other soft material. 
* If the victim is wearing heavy clothes, apply the splint  on  the  outside,  allowing  the  clothing  to serve as at least part of the required padding. 

Although  splints  should  be  applied  snugly, '''never''' apply them tight enough to interfere with the circulation of the blood. When applying splints to an arm or a leg, try to leave the fingers or toes exposed. If the tips of the fingers or toes become blue or cold, you will know that the splints or bandages are too tight.  You should examine a splinted part approximately every half-hour, and loosen the fastenings if circulation appears to be cut off. Remember that any injured part is likely to swell, and splints or bandages that are all right when applied may be too tight later.

To secure the limb to the splint, belts, neckerchiefs, rope, or any suitable material may be used. If possible, tie the limb at two places above and two places below the break. Leave the treatment of other types of fractures, such as jaw, ribs, and spine, to medical personnel. '''Never try to move a person who might have a fractured spine or neck.'''  Moving such a person could cause permanent paralysis. Don’t attempt to reset bones.

      <comment>/* Tips */ &quot;Best&quot; Song</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">From wikihow.com

So you are a musician and want to make a rock album? Well, here are some things you might want to consider!

==Song types==
*A &lt;b&gt;power song&lt;/b&gt; A memorable riff, well-suited for arena rock with a classic chorus, deriving mainly between a lead guitarists' riff and the powerful singers' voice. -- example: Def Leppard's &quot;Love Bites&quot; (Hysteria 1987).
*A &lt;b&gt;Hard Rock Song&lt;/b&gt; is a power song but has more of a punch then most of them. It is all the way down with one heavy rhythm guitar riff and one hi-gain lead guitar with a lot of hit-hat in drums. '''THE HARD ROCK SONG HAS A COMBINED RIFF BETWEEN THE RHYTHM AND LEAD GUITARS THEREFORE CREATING A MUCH MORE POWERFUL SOUND'''. -- Example: AC/DC - Highway To Hell
*A &lt;b&gt;dark song&lt;/b&gt; is the &quot;bridge&quot; between the power song and the slow emotional one. It is mainly a story-telling song about an experience or event. It has a very heavy rhythm guitar with a touch of lead guitar, more suited for bass. Example: Black Sabbath (Black Sabbath)
*The &lt;b&gt;slow emotional song&lt;/b&gt; is your classic rock ballad, with acoustic guitar, light percussion, and killer lyrics. You want it to make girls pull their hair and scream your name! Great example: &quot;Forever&quot; by KISS
NO PUNK --- PUNK IS NOT ROCK!!!! 
*If you didn't understand what the &lt;b&gt;electric guitar solo&lt;/b&gt; meant, listen to Angus Young, Jimi Hendrix or Eddie Van Halen.

==Steps==
#  Define your trademark and intrigue the public. There must always be a connection between your message, your style and the public's expectations. In short, you need to find your own secret formula.
#  Choose your songs. This is an example of how a 10-song rock album could be organized:
##Hard Rock song 1
##Hard Rock song 2
##Dark Song 1
##punk song 1
##Punk Song 2
##Chill-out Song
##Dark Song 2
##Electric Guitar Solo 
##Acoustic Song
##Power Song 1
# Make sure you have a unifying theme.
# Find an agent and/or publicist and begin to market your album. Play gigs wherever you can to get the word out.

==Tips==
*It's important to finish with a power song if you start an album with one. Why? it gives the impression of a brilliant album. The listener's mood must change through the album but return to where it was when he/she started to listen to it. This is more a psychological effect. In 60%? of the cases, listening to a vivid, vibrant song makes you want to listen to the next, in this case, to start listening to the album all over again. which is . . .well, exactly what you hoped for, right?
*When you ask someone for their opinion keep in mind that the same song does not relate to EVERY person in the world the same way. In the media, there is a rule when it comes to news: if it is confirmed by 3 different sources, then it is a valid news story. Choose at least 3 people with different ages, cultures, personalities or styles, to &quot;test&quot; the song on. It's important NOT to get discouraged if they have suggestions or just don't like it. Practice makes perfect, and even though you aim for the sky, you've gotta keep your feet on the ground.
*Determine your &quot;best&quot; song of the album, preferably with the feedback of other informed and honest listeners. In the business, it would be used as the prospective hit single promoting the album. There are three possibilities where to put the best song: Newcomer albums often use the best song as the ''first'' song. Works well in connection with a successful hit single (Example: &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot; on Phil Collins' solo debut album &quot;Face Value&quot;). Most artists put their best song in the ''second'' place. The first song serves as an introduction to the album. The listener gets used to the sound of the music, may adjust the volume and is ready to fully appreciate the best song when the first song is over (Examples: &quot;Loosing My Religion&quot; on R.E.M.'s &quot;Out of Time&quot;, &quot;We Didn't Start the Fire&quot; on Billy Joels &quot;Storm Front&quot;, &quot;Song 2&quot; on Blur's &quot;Blur&quot; and many others). Then there is the Bowie formula where the best song is the ''third'' song on the album. The best song does not as much stand out as in the first or second place and enhances the musical experience of the whole album (Examples: Many David Bowie albums, &quot;Perfect Day&quot; on Lou Reed's &quot;Transformer&quot; album, produced by Bowie. Nirvana's major debut &quot;Nevermind&quot; also counts for this category as &quot;Come As Your Are&quot; was expected by Geffen to be the hit single, but the opener &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; already gained a ground-breaking success by popular appeal). 
*Don't treat this and other similar pages as a bible.  The most important thing should be to make the album how you visualize it sounding, the rules should come as an afterthought.  If your album still doesn't sound good, load all of the songs into iTunes, put 'em into a playlist and hit shuffle and see what happens.
*The last song is always a chance to do whatever you want, experiment, add little snippets of miscellaneous stuff. Or, if you have the newest greatest rock ballad or ground breaking, moderately slow song, put it here. Basically, this is the place to put whatever song doesn't fit.

== Warnings ==

* Don't make a solo that's longer than 5 minutes. According to some scientific studies, the brain stops being attentive after 5 min. so it's best to keep it short, or you risk  boring your public.
* 15.  NOTE: when you have two power songs one after the other, it is best if the styles are as different as possible!

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Forearm_splint.jpg|frame|right]]
There are two long bones in the forearm, the radius and the ulna.   When both are broken, the arm usually appears to be deformed.  When only one is broken, the other acts as a splint and the arm retains a more or less natural  appearance.  Any fracture of the forearm is likely to result in pain, tenderness, inability to use the forearm, and a kind of wobbly motion at the point of injury. If the fracture is open, a bone will show through. If the fracture is open, stop the bleeding and treat the wound.  Apply a sterile dressing over the wound. Carefully  straighten  the  forearm. (Remember that rough handling of a closed fracture may turn it into an open fracture.)  Apply two well-padded splints to the forearm, one on the top and one on the bottom.  Be sure that the splints are long enough to extend from the elbow to the wrist.   Use bandages to hold the splints in place.   Put the forearm across the chest.  The palm of  the hand should be turned in, with the thumb pointing upward. Support the forearm in this position by means of a wide sling and a cravat bandage (see illustration). The hand should be raised about 4 inches above the level of the elbow.  Treat the victim for shock and evacuate as soon as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Upper_arm_splint.jpg|frame|right]]
The signs of fracture of the upper arm include pain, tenderness, swelling, and a wobbly motion at the point of fracture.  If the fracture is near the elbow, the arm is likely to be straight with no bend at the elbow. If the fracture is open, stop the bleeding and treat the wound before attempting to treat the fracture. 

;NOTE: Treatment  of  the  fracture  depends partly upon the location of the break. 

If the fracture is in the upper part of the arm near the shoulder, place a pad or folded towel in the armpit, bandage the arm securely to the body, and support the forearm in a narrow sling. 

If the fracture is in the middle of the upper arm, you can use one well-padded splint on the outside of the arm.  The splint should extend from the shoulder to the elbow.  Fasten the splinted arm firmly to the body and support  the  forearm  in  a  narrow  sling,  as illustrated. 

Another way of treating a fracture in the middle of the  upper  arm  is  to  fasten  two  wide  splints  (or  four narrow   ones)   about   the   arm   and   then   support   the forearm in a narrow sling.  If you use a splint between the arm and the body, be very careful that it does not extend  too  far  up  into  the  armpit;  a  splint  in  this position  can  cause  a  dangerous  compression  of  the blood vessels and nerves and may be extremely painful to the victim. If the fracture is at or near the elbow, the arm may be either bent or straight.   No matter in what position you   find   the   arm, '''DO NOT ATTEMPT TO STRAIGHTEN IT OR MOVE IT IN ANY WAY.''' Splint the arm as carefully as possible in the position in which you find it.   This will prevent further nerve and blood vessel damage.   The only exception to this is if there is no pulse on the other side of the fracture (relative to the heart), in which case gentle traction is applied and then the arm is splinted. Treat the victim for shock and get him under the care of a medical professional as soon as possible.

'''Grandma-Ag's Orange Bread''' - ''This bread is a fond memory of my childhood, visiting Agnes Frances Primm, my Grandma-Ag. As a young adult, I tried to duplicate the recipe, and unable, I went back and begged her for the secrets of it. When I asked her how long it had taken to develop the tricky recipe, she flattened my ego by telling me she'd gotten it out of a magazine years before!'' 
&lt;br&gt;I like to make it for Christmas.

==Ingredients==
'''List 1'''
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] grated orange peel 
*½ cup [[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]]

'''List 2'''
*1 beaten [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

*2½ cups white all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1¼ cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*½ tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
#Cover grated orange peel with water and [[Cookbook:boil|boil]] 5 minutes.
#Drain and rinse, discarding water.
#Barely cover with cold water, about ¼ cup.
#Add ½ cup sugar and cook until peel is tender and water is cooked away; cool.
#Preheat the oven to 350°F.
#Mix thoroughly all items under List 2.
#Add cooled peel to this mixture and 
#Pour into greased and floured 9 x 5 x 3 inch pan.
#[[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out dry when inserted in the loaf.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

{{danger}}

The experimental details given here are given in good faith and are believed to be safe and workable methods. However, '''the authors cannot take responsibility for the consequences of performing these experiments.''' 

The experiments are written for experienced science teaching staff to use as instructions for a supervised class of students. The experiments are not designed for students or inexperienced members of the public to perform without supervision. If you wish to attempt the experiments, ensure that you have completed a legally adequate risk assessment beforehand and that you work within the constraints of the risk assessment.

=Choice of preparations=

Your portfolio requires you to present two practical reports. One making a solid and the other a liquid. The two compounds should be made using different reactions. The four preparations below cover these criteria and are designed so that the first two preparations provide experience which will help you to do the final two experiments competently.

=Laboratory report template=

How to use this template: The text consists of hints, checklists and suggestions. Replace this text with your own account of the experiment, as prompted.

==Introduction==

Explain what this report is about, and how you have also included information about organic compounds and reactions in general; and a discussion of infrared spectroscopy.

Organic compounds involved: 
*Naming
*Structure
*Electronegativity of the elements and polarity of molecules.
*Functional groups
*Physical properties e.g. boiling/melting points, solubility in water, health &amp; safety data.
*Shape
*Type of reaction - classify the type of reaction
*Give balanced equations and describe the reagents and conditions required for the reaction.
*Spectroscopy - What spectroscopy tells us about the molecules.

==Preparation of the compound==
Give details of the structures and properties (e.g. melting/boiling points, IR spectra) of the organic reactant(s) and the product.

Include copies of methods found through research.

Annotations describing the main features of the methods – What types of reaction are taking place? How do the purification methods work?

Suggest a method based on literature methods and available resources.

Include a risk assessment for your procedure.

Calculate the expected maximum yield of product.

Discuss how spectrscopy can be used to assess the procedure (e.g. contamination of product by reactants).

==Results==
Your teacher will have to write a statement assessing how safely and skilfully you performed the preparation.

Comprehensive observations and extensive data are to be recorded and measurements are to be as precise as possible.

Data should be clearly and logically presented – consider using tables, diagrams and graphs if appropriate.

From the mass of product, calculate the percentage yield.

From the melting/boiling point of product, deduce the purity.

==Conclusions==
Summarise the main points of your work.

Make suggestions to either improve the experiment to give more/purer product.

==Bibliography==

Include a reference to every source of information you have used.

When using information from that source, make a note of the source (e.g. briefly show the source of a spectrum next to where it appears in your report, and then make a full reference in the bibliography).

=Preparation of ethanal=
&lt;ref name=&quot;M&amp;S&quot;&gt;Mann, FG &amp; Saunders, BC (1960): ''Practical Organic Chemistry'' 4th ed, Longman, London. ISBN 0-582-44228-1&lt;/ref&gt;
==Theory==
Ethanol can be oxidised by the dichromate (VI) ion in acidic solution. The first product of the oxidation is ethanal, which can be further oxidised to form ethanoic acid. By carefully changing the reaction method, one or other product can be obtained.

The ethanal preparation should be performed in a fume cupboard.

==Chemicals==
*sodium dichromate (VI)
*ethanol
*ethanal (product)
*concentrated sulphuric acid	   
*anti-bumping granules
*deionised water

==Precautions==
Wear eye protection and laboratory coat.

Work in the fume cupboard when preparing ethanal.

Wear gloves when taking samples of concentrated sulphuric acid

==Method==
Into a round-bottomed flask, add first 50 cm³ deionised water and then 17 cm³ concentrated sulphuric acid. Add the acid slowly, with shaking. Finally, add some anti-bumping granules to the flask and set up the apparatus shown below:

[[Image:Ethanal_prep_apparatus.png]]
 
There should be rapid flow of water round the condenser. Ask your lecturer to adjust the flow if you do not feel confident – it is easy to create too much pressure in the rubber tubes.
Dissolve 50 g sodium dichromate (VI) in 50 cm³ deionised water and then add 40 cm³ ethanol. Mix well and add the mixture to the dropping funnel in the above apparatus. Ensure the tap is closed first.

Heat the acid in the flask until it boils gently, then turn off the heat.

Add the ethanol/dichromate mixture slowly: allow 20 minutes for adding the entire sample. The reaction is vigorous and will keep the mixture boiling at first. In the latter stages of the reaction you will have to heat the mixture to keep it boiling gently.

While the reaction occurs in the round-bottomed flask, ethanal solution will collect in the conical flask.

Cautiously note its characteristic smell. Stopper the flask and keep it in iced water. If you have time, take samples and test using the silver mirror, 2,4-DNPH or iodoform tests.

=Preparation of aspirin=

2-hydroxybenzoic (‘salicylic’) acid reacts with ethanoic acid and its derivatives to form 2-ethanoylhydroxybenzoic acid (‘aspirin’)
  	  	
==Chemicals and apparatus==
*Round-bottomed ‘Quickfit’ flask
*Vacuum filtration apparatus
*Reflux condenser
*Ice-bath
*Beaker, 100 cm³
*Heating mantle
*Balance
*Watch glass

*2.0 g of 2-hydroxybenzoic (‘salicylic’) acid	 
*3.0 cm³ of ethanoic anhydride	     
*5 drops of 85% phosphoric (V) acid
	   
==Precautions==
*Wear eye protection and laboratory coat at all times.   
*Tie back long hair when using Bunsen burners.	

==Procedure==
#Weigh out approximately but accurately 2.0 g of 2-hydroxybenzoic (‘salicylic’) acid and add it to a round-bottomed 'Quickfit' flask.
#With care, add 3.0 cm³ of ethanoic anhydride to the flask contents.
#Again with care add 5 drops of 85% phosphoric (V) acid and swirl gently to mix the flask contents.
#Using a heating mantle reflux the mixture gently for five minutes.
#Immediately after 5 minutes carefully add 2.0 cm³ of water down the vertical condenser.  Note:  this will produce a vigorous reaction.
#When the reaction has subsided carefully pour the flask contents into 40 cm³ of cold water in a small beaker.
#Allow the beaker contents to cool, scratching the inside of the beaker with a glass rod if crystallisation does not occur immediately.
#Once crystallisation has started cool the beaker and contents in an ice-bath.
#Filter the solid product using suction (vacuum) filtration and wash the solid with a little cold water.
#Recrystallise the product from the minimum of hot water, filtering and washing as before.
#Dry the material in air, scrape it onto a pre-weighed watch glass and determine the mass of product.

==Treatment of the product==
#Determine the percentage yield.
#Carry out a melting point determination.

==Conclusions and comments==
#What sort of reaction is occurring? What sort of bond is formed?
#What is the purpose of the phosphoric acid?
#What is the relationship between ethanoic anhydride and ethanoic acid?
#Look up and write a short account of how aspirin is manufactured. How is the 2-hydroxybenzoic acid made?

=Preparation of ethyl ethanoate=
&lt;ref name=&quot;M&amp;S&quot;/&gt;
==Chemicals and apparatus==

*Quickfit: Round bottom flasks (2x100 cm³)
**Condenser	
**Receiver adapter	
**Tap funnel	
**Stillhead 	
**Thermometer pocket
*4x Anti-bumping granules
*Conical flask (50 cm³) &amp; rubber bung
*Measuring cylinders (10, 100 cm³)
*Thermometer (110&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C)
*Funnel &amp; fluted paper
*Heating mantle
*Weighing scale

*Sodium carbonate 12.2cm3 (30% solution)
*Calcium chloride (granular)12.5cm3
*Sulphuric acid (conc.)5cm3
*Ethanoic Acid (conc.)25cm3
*Ethanol 25cm3
*Ethyl ethanoate (product)

==Method==
1.	Into one of the round bottom flasks, place ethanol (25 cm³) and glacial ethanoic acid (25 cm³). Add slowly, with cooling and shaking, concentrated sulphuric acid (5 cm³). Ensure that the mixture is homogeneous at each addition. Add some anti-bumping granules and boil the mixture under reflux for about 10 minutes.

2.	Rearrange the apparatus and distil off about two-thirds of the mixture. Transfer the distillate to the separating funnel.

3.	Add sodium carbonate solution (25 cm³) and shake carefully. (see Q 2).

4.	At frequent intervals, invert the funnel and open the tap in order to release the pressure. Allow the liquid to settle and separate the two layers. Discard the aqueous layer (Q3 - make sure you retain the correct layer!).

5.	To the organic layer, in the funnel, add a solution of calcium chloride (12.5 g anhydrous CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 12.5cm³ water) and shake vigorously (Q4). Allow the liquid to separate and run off and discard the lower aqueous layer. Run the ethyl ethanoate into a small conical flask and add a few pieces of granular calcium chloride. Allow to stand for approx.10- 20 minutes., shaking occasionally (Q5).

6.	Filter the liquid through fluted paper into the flask (100 cm³), add a few anti-bumping granules and fit up the apparatus for distillation.

7.	Reject the fraction which distils over in the range 35-40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C (Q6).

8.	Collect the fraction distilling in the range 74 - 79 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.

9.	Note the appearance and the smell of the final product.

===Questions===
#Why boil the mixture and why do this under reflux?
#State what is observed when the sodium carbonate is added and hence explain why it is used.
#How did you decide which is the aqueous layer?
#What is the purpose of the calcium chloride at this stage?
#What is the purpose of the calcium chloride at this stage?
#What might distil at this temperature range?
#Record your yield and calculate your percentage yield.

=Preparation of benzoic acid=

==Theory== 
Oxidations are a very important class of reactions in organic chemistry. Most oxidations require either a heteroatom in a reduced state (O in -OH, N in -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.) or a carbon-carbon pi-bond.

The oxidation of an aromatic side chain does not require any of these factors. All that is needed is a benzylic carbon with at least one hydrogen attached to it. The oxidising agents that can be used are chromic acid (using Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; or CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in sulphuric acid and water) or potassium permanganate (KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) . The product in each case is benzoic acid or a derivative of benzoic acid. The permanganate reaction requires work up with acid, because the permanganate reaction generates a basic solution as a by product): 
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOK + 2 MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + KOH
 
We will use potassium permanganate to oxidise methylbenzene (toluene) to benzoic acid.  Permanganate solutions are less hazardous than those containing chromium compounds, which are often carcinogenic.&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;&gt;[http://www.miracosta.edu/home/dlr/211exp6.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
*Potassium manganate (VII) (permanganate) is a strong oxidiser, and is corrosive, wear gloves while handling it (it will also stain skin and clothing).
*Sodium hydrogen sulphite (sodium bisulphite)  is an irritant--wear gloves while handling it.
*Concentrated hydrochloric acid is corrosive and toxic--wear gloves while handling it, and be sure to wash your gloves and your hands after handling it.
*Methylbenzene (toluene) is a flammable liquid, is toxic, and its vapours are narcotic--no flames will be allowed in lab, wear gloves while handling it, and avoid breathing its vapours.&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;/&gt;

==Method==
&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;/&gt;
'''Day 1''': Preparation of benzoic acid.

In a 100 cm³ round bottom flask (this will keep liquid to less than half of the capacity of the reaction vessel), mix the following:
*3.0 g of KMnO4 (Use caution not to get on skin) 
*About 0.7 g of methylbenzene (about 0.8 cm³ liquid) 
*35 g (cm³) of water. 

Reflux (with a few added anti-bumping granules) the reaction mixture for up to 4 hours. 

Refluxing for less time than this may result in left-over manganate (VII). 
Because of the volatility of methylbenzene, efficient cooling of the reflux condenser is necessary.
 
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OOK + 2 MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + KOH &lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;&gt;[http://basti.borec.cz/_english/e_phecooh.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
STOP, and leave your apparatus until the next lab period for purification.

'''Day 2''': Separation of benzoic acid 

Use suction filtration in a Büchner funnel (filter the hot solution, but do not wash with hot or cold water). Collect the filtrate (the liquid that passes the filter). 

The insoluble MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be retained by the filter, while the filtrate is collected in the suction flask. It can be thrown away. 

If the filtrate is still purple (indicating MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion is still present) transfer the filtrate to a new flask and cool on ice if it is still hot .

Slowly add small amounts of solid sodium hydrogen sulphite (NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ) to reduce any remaining permanganate ion.

Be careful because the reaction between sodium hydrogen sulphite and potassium manganate (VII) is highly exothermic (heat released).

When no more purple colour is present (the mixture will be a brownish suspension), you have added enough sodium hydrogen sulphite.

When the purple colour is no longer present, centrifuge the suspension for 5 minutes at 3-4000 rpm. (The MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formed at this stage is too fine to be filtered efficiently). Centrifugation will cause the precipitate to form a pellet and the rest of the solution can be decanted carefully.

If the solution is not colourless (it is still purple in colour) you will need to add more hydrogen sulphite and repeat the centrifugation in order to produce a clear solution (a slight brownish hue is acceptable, but it must not be purple). 

Put the clear and colourless solution (a slight brownish colour is acceptable) in the ice bath. Acidify the mixture by adding about 2.5 cm³ of concentrated HCl. Add the acid drop by drop until a white precipitate of benzoic acid is formed. (It may redissolve if not enough acid has been added). As few as 4-5 drops may be enough to make the solution acidic, and initiate the formation of solid material. Adding more acid will not affect your results, as you cannot add too much acid.

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOK + KOH + 2 HCl → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 KCl &lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;/&gt;
 
Collect the precipitated organic product using vacuum filtration and a Büchner funnel. You can use small amounts of cold water to wash the solid material and to remove the solid from the crystallisation container, prior to drying on a watch glass.

The solid product will be stored in the drying oven until the next lab period for recrystallisation.

'''Stop''' and store your solid material until the next lab period for purification. If you were not able to produce solid material during this lab period, you can store your sample until the next lab period.

'''Day 3''': Recrystallisation and analysis of the benzoic acid 

The purification method involves recrystallisation. It is necessary to select an appropriate solvent in which 
#the benzoic acid is very soluble at high temperatures but sparingly soluble at low temps, and... 
#either; impurities are insoluble at all temps, or....
#impurities are soluble at all temps 
A solvent which meets these criteria for this experiment is water.
 
===Example recrystallisation method===

This is an example of how the work might be recorded. Repeat this experiment – or improve on it if you feel able to. Note that not all data are recorded for you (the volume of hot water used, for example).

Benzoic acid was collected in a beaker (250 cm³).

A small quantity of water was poured into the beaker and the mixture brought to the boil over a Bunsen flame. The mixture was stirred to encourage dissolving.

Not all of the benzoic acid dissolved. A little more water was added, keeping the mixture stirred and simmering. The process was repeated until all of the benzoic acid appeared to dissolve.

The mixture was then filtered quickly through a pre-heated Buchner funnel. Any insoluble impurities remained on the paper as the residue.

The filtrate was cooled on ice and this caused most of the benzoic acid to crystallise. Soluble impurities were left in solution.

The mixture was again filtered at the pump, this time while cold. The residue on the filter is the purified benzoic acid.

This residue was washed by running a little deionised water over it in order to remove the salt solution. Running the pump for a short while after filtration encourages drying of the residue.

The residue was then carefully scraped off the filter paper onto a watch glass and allowed to dry in the oven at 60 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. When dry, the final product was weighed.

'''Results'''

Mass of benzoic acid at start 4.00 g

Mass of benzoic acid as product 3.50 g

==Discussion==
Analyse the benzoic acid by determining the melt temperature. Compare your observed value to the literature value. Determine a percentage yield based on the limiting reagent (methylbenzene).

Show the oxidation state of the methyl carbon of the methylbenzene, the carbonyl carbon of the acid, and for the Mn in both the permanganate ion and the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 

You may wish to record other details of the experiment which do not naturally fall in to any of the other categories e.g. mistakes which may have occurred; some theory which is new to you; some interesting application or detail which you may wish to record for future reference etc.

Hi Lukahn.  SB Johnny is correct, your work would be welcome at [http://StrategyWiki.org/ StrategyWiki]  The only caveat is that we would prefer that the transcribing be applied to each particular game's guide and not as part of a magazine transcription.  For example, you started with Issue 37 which contains an article about Lemmings.  We would like to see that article appear as part of the Lemming's strategy guide and not as &quot;Nintendo Power Issue 37 pages ''x'' through ''y''.&quot;  You can create an index to each of the articles as they appear in Nintendo Power, but that would be secondary to the fact that the articles themselves appear in the proper location, and can conceivably be edited by other users, and thus not preserved as a transcription.  I realize this may run counter to your goal of preserving the magazines, but we work very hard at maintaining the format and consistency of every contribution so that users of StrategyWiki can find content reliably.  That being said, we are flexible and are willing to help new users with their plans, and we would welcome you aboard.

== What are Layers in AutoCAD ==

When an Architect has to make a building drawing, the Architect may not want to show all portions of the building at once, say if he wants to concentrate on making construction drawings of one portion. The layer will then overlap if neccessary on the other layer. For example, Layers of Electrical wires may overlap the cement wall etc.

==Organising Data==

An important thing to realise about AutoCAD is that it is not some kind of digital drawing  board. A lot of inexperienced users approach the program as if it was MS Paint for  engineers, and end up creating horribly thought out and disorganised drawings that  can cause no end of strife and frustration for those who may later be required to work  with the files. Not only can badly created drawings cause ulcers to other AutoCAD  users, they make it a lot easier for design flaws to sneak into the process. ''A little bit of  preplanning and some attention to good draughting practice might be the difference  between a painless efficient project and a messy expensive rebuild.''

The most important thing to understand is that AutoCAD does not, strictly speaking,  create &quot;drawings&quot; in the classic sense of the word. The user should not consider  themselves to be making pictures or creating images. A much more useful and  accurate way of thinking about an AutoCAD drawing file is as being a database full of  information. The AutoCAD program allows the user to view and edit this information  through a graphical interface. Thus, when drawing a line between two points, realise  that you are entering two coordinates into your database. So if you want a line that links  the points 200,500 and 600,1200, than those should be the values you use. Do not,  under any circumstances, just scribble down a line in a place that &quot;looks&quot; right. What  kind of database user are you to be inserting 199.9813 when you mean 200? If you want  one line to begin where a previous one ends, then ensure they contact at EXACTLY the  same point. You can use the &quot;Object Snaps&quot; feature to make this work properly, and  there is no excuse for creating drawings that contain elements that look like they line up  until you zoom in to micrometer scales and discover why those polylines weren't joining correctly or those hatches weren't applying properly etc.

==The Layers Window==

The LAYERS window should be the hub around which any moderately well thought out drawing should revolve. It is through the layers window that all data is organised and controlled. A layer can be thought of as being a transparent sheet overlaying the drawing board. You can have as many as you wish. It is extremely useful to separate as much data as possible onto seperate layers. It allows you to have numerous &quot;drawings&quot; all existing together in the one file. When a layer is &quot;turned off&quot; all the information that was on that layer becomes invisible.

The Layers window can be opened by either hitting the layers button on the toolbar or by typing LAYER or LA at the command line. For a new drawing, the only layer available is the layer 0. This is a special layer which is required in all drawings. It is bad drawing practice to create linework on this layer. It should be used only for creating the componants of blocks and inserting xrefs. (More on these later). New layers can be created by hitting the &quot;New Layer&quot; button. By default, Autocad will name new layers &quot;Layer1&quot;, &quot;Layer2&quot; etc. It is advisable to rename the layer to match the content that will be drawn on it, eg. BRICKWORK, STORMWATER_PIPES, STORMWATER_MANHOLES etc.

==ByLayer==

An extremely important aspect of the layers window are the columns for Color, Linetype and Lineweight. Suppose you create a new layer, and call it STORMWATER. Next you might select the color value of this layer and set it to Blue. Upon hitting OK and returning to the drawing, you might start constructing linework. You will notice that the layers toolbar has several dropdown boxes in it, again showing color, linetype and lineweight. If all is well in the world, the words ByLayer should be written in all these boxes. This means that if you have a line on the layer STORMWATER whose color is set to ByLayer, it will automatically be Blue. If you reenter the layers window and change the Color of STORMWATER to something else, everything on the layer whose color is set to ByLayer will automatically change. It is possible to set the color of an object to something other than ByLayer, by selecting the object and than opening the color dropdown box on the Layers toolbar. This is very rarely recommended though. Think about it. Suppose you are drawing lots of pipes all over your STORMWATER layer, and they are all showing up Blue. Now suppose that there is one particular pipe that you want to appear green, because it is made of steel instead of plastic or something. The cheap and lazy option is to just change that objects color to green, but this means that you have given up some control over that line, because now you can no longer edit its color through the layers window. A good rule to bear in mind is, if something is diferent enough to deserve its own color, than it certainly deserves its own layer. In this case you would make a separate layer (colored green) called STORMWATER_STEEL upon which you would draw this one line. You would probably than rename the original layer to STORMWATER_PLASTIC, in order to retain consistency and to make it easier for someone else to understand the drawing.

==Linetypes==

Linetypes are a method of defining the pattern in which a particular line will print out, whether it be dashed or dotted or numerous other styles. The default setting is called Continuous, which just means a standard uninterupted line. However, cases will arise, in particular when printing in black and white, in which it will be necessary to differentiate between different pieces of linework. Defining linetype works exactly the same way as for color. It can be changed individually on an object by object basis but it is almost always preferable to leave everything set to ByLayer and adjust the settings through the layers window. By default, the only linetype available when you start AutoCAD is Continuous. To make others available, double click on Continuous in the layers window. The box that opens will have an option to &quot;Load&quot;. The following window should provide a good list of extra linetypes which you can load as you need them. AutoCAD doesn't load them all by default to keep file size minimal. An important aspect of linetypes is scale. All lines have a property called linetype scale, which by default is set to 1. However different linetypes may be defined in different ways. For example a dashed line may have gaps that are 100 units apart and nearby dotted line may have been defined with gaps of only 10. It would be necessary to change the linetype scale of the dotted line to 10 to maintain a degree of consistancy throughout the drawing. Just to confuse things, there is another variable called LTSCALE that effects linetype scale in the drawing at large. It is changed by typing LTSCALE at the command line. By default it is set to 1. Changes to this value are on top of changes to the object linetype scales, so if a line has its linetype scale set to 20 and LTSCALE is set to 10, the line will appear to have a scale of 200. The advantage of this is it allows you to have the same line appearing in different viewports at different scales without the linetype scale distorting.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Jags EPG v3.0 Pre-Beta 5 ==

This TAP is one of the main EPG replacement TAPs, it adds functionality over the built in EPG and is not dependent on any other TAPS, although it can make use of the &quot;DescriptionExtender 1.4&quot; TAP 

Jags EPG is also able to collect EPG data for use by MyStuff.

Since the new July 2006 “Bastille Day” firmware Jags has been less stable and the developer (Jag) will address the reported issues as soon as he can (he is currently moving house &amp; job).

Users have reduced instability by one or more of the following:
* uninstalling DescriptionExtender (changing option 52 Description extender support has no effect)
* option 49. &quot;EPG data base: background scan interval&quot; -&gt; a larger scan interval e.g.60
* manually delete the EPG buffer
* reducing the memory Jags uses by limiting the number of channels scanned
* Using the memory watcher TAP to help tune the settings
* opt 47 No of channels with extended info 
* opt 48 Max events per channel 
* reducing the number of other TAPS used


Good new behaviour caused by the July 2006 “Bastille Day” firmware is that the native EPG buffer is populated much more efficiently so Jags only needs a brief visit to each channel in order to sort its own EPG data out. Previously it was necessary to set Jags to scan each channel for maybe 90 seconds, but now a mere 5 seconds is reported to be enough.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:42, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== And ... ==

Anyone who alpha cats the cookbook really does deserve a welcome in my view!  All the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:43, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== Redirect ==

Done - feel free to look at the page to see how it happens.  Most of the things I know come from copying others! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:04, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
:OK don't copy me that wasn't a good edit as I did the talk page.  However we need to get the content of the page you mentioned onto the Cuisine of one then we can do a redirect - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:07, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
::Right, looking carefully at this the Cuisine of page seems to have everything the other one does so I have blanked the German Cuisine page and done the redirect.  Thanks and let me know if I can help --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:14, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
:::Thanks!
:::Now I'm thinking that all these articles in [[:Category:Cuisines]] should be ordered alphabetically by country, rather than so many of them being under 'C'. --[[User:David Edgar|David Edgar]] 17:34, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
::::I understand what you mean - worth posting your views on [[Talk:Cookbook]] maybe? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:12, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>fixed grammar also weakened the thing about 'talking politics' - that's very American attitude to not want to talk about politics</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">So you've just been hired to work in a summer [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_campsummer camp ] and you can't wait to get started. Here's what you should know to have a great summer.

==Golden Rules==
*Your job starts before you arrive.  Know your job, prepare well, get some rest and most of all, know how to get there!
*Your campers will want to do almost everything you do.  They get influenced very easily, especially at younger ages.  Jump out the window, and they will follow.  Finish your meal, and they will finish theirs.  Watch out for body language.
*Ask not what your camp can do for your campers, ask what you can do for them.
*Some say politics and camp doesn't mix.  Try not to discuss these things in detail.  A bit of joking about your country might be ok, but don't go any further.  It can cost you your reputation or more.  Even a very political person can forget about all that stuff for a summer and enjoy camp even better.
*Whatever you do, DON'T GET FIRED!  It never happened to anyone I knew or worked with, but it's not the same as getting fired from your fast food restaurant part-time job.  It's bad for you, the staff, and especially the campers.  Know your rules carefully and take your job seriously.
*Have fun.  the more you have fun, the more the kids will have fun.
*Sleep in!  Every occasion you have to sleep early or wake up late in weekends off for example should be used.  You really need your rest, especially after 5 or 6 weeks.
*Never make assumptions.  8 year olds don't necessarily know that they should use soap, and your fourth week or fourth session campers need to be reminded of the routine all over again, cause they weren't there in the first week.
*Establish expectations on the first night.  Failure to do so will often result in your campers breaking the rules for the rest of the session.
*Show lots of camp spirit. The more enthusiastic you are, the more fun it is for everyone

==Quotes==
Here are a few quotes to make your job seem more worthwhile.
*&quot;Children are the world's most valuable resource.  They're the only hope for the future.&quot;
*&quot;Firefighters save lives, cops prevent crime, doctors heal the sick, but it's camp counselors that are the real heroes.&quot;

==Links==
=== Associations ===
* The [http://www.acacamps.org American Camp Association] accredits camps which adhere to a set of national standards.
* The [http://www.ccamping.org/ Canadian Camping Association] is an association of camps across Canada.  Accreditation of camps in Canada happens at the provincial level. 
* The [http://www.ccca-us.org/ccihome/default.asp Christian Camp and Conference Association] connects Christian camping professionals and associations around the world.
* The [http://www.ontariocamps.ca/ Ontario Camping Association] accredits camps in Ontario, Canada
* The [http://www.camps.qc.ca/ Quebec Camping Association] accredits camps in Quebec, Canada

&lt;big&gt;'''Radiation Toxocity: Esophagus'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Etiology==
*Dysphagia = disordered eating potentially caused by a number of mechanisms, both neurologic and non-neurologic
*Odynophagia = painful swallowing
*Swallowing process includes three phases coordinated from the brainstem
**Oral phase: bolus processing, propelling food from oral cavity to oropharynx. Voluntary process.
**Pharyngeal phase: propelling food from oropharynx downward. Closure of nasopharynx via soft palate, closure of airway via epiglottis, opening of upper esophageal sphincter. Involuntary process. Aspiration significant concern
**Esophageal phase: peristaltic movement to propel food into stomach. Lower esophageal sphincter opened
*&lt;u&gt;Dysphagia&lt;/u&gt; may be caused by extrinsic compression of the esophagus, intrinsic narrowing of the esophagus, or disorders of the esophageal motility
**Extrinsic compression: Cervical LND, gastic cancer
**Intrinsic narrowing: Esophageal tumor, esophageal stricture
**Dismotility: achalasia, esophageal spasm, scleroderma
*&lt;u&gt;Odynophagia&lt;/u&gt; suggests disruption of esophageal mucosa (inflammation) or muscle spasms
**Infection, particularly candida and HSV
**Pill esophagitis
**Reflux esophagitis
**Radiation esophagitis
**Ulcerated neoplasm
**Caustic agent (acid/alkali) ingestion
*Infectious esophagitis
**Bacteria rarely cause primary esophageal infection
**Most common forms (frequently seen with concurrent chemotherapy: Candida, HSV
**Immunosuppression-associated forms: CMV, HIV 
**Treatment: 
***Oral nystatin
***Ketoconazole or fluconazole for more extensive involvement or if immunocompromized
***Amphotericin B if evidence of systemic spread
*Radiation esophagitis
**Acute reaction leads to inflammation, dysphagia and/or odynophagia, and dysmotility
**Secondarily, patients can develop dehydration and weight loss
**Rarely, patients may develop obstruction, perforation, or fistulas
**Late toxicity usually involves fibrosis leading to stenosis 
**Treatment is typically symptomatic

*Comment in text: information leading to these estimates was less than adequate
*Acute vs. late toxicity was not specified

==Acute==
Incidence overall: 5-13%. Incidence with chemo/RT: 18-46%.


'''''RT with concurrent chemotherapy:'''''

**Retrospective. 215 pts treated with concurrent chemo/RT (127 also with induction CT) and 3D-CRT. Most used carbo/taxol. Median dose 63.5 Gy in 35 fractions. RT was AP/PA followed by oblique off-cord fields. 
**7% - Grade 0, 27% - Grade 1, 45% - Grade 2, 20% - Grade 3, 0.4% - Grade 4.
**Predictors for grade 3 or worse acute toxicity: On univariate - mean dose to esophagus, aV15 (absolute volume &gt; 15 Gy, in mL)  through aV45, rV10 (relative volume &gt; 10 Gy, in %) through rV45.  Only rV20 was found to be significant on multivariate analysis.
**Conclusion: keep rV20 &lt; 45% and mean esophageal dose &lt; 28 Gy to keep risk of grade 3 or higher esophagitis &lt; 15%.

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; &quot;The inclusion of corrections, based on anatomic realities, to DVH-based dosimetric parameters may provide dosimetric parameters that are better correlated with clinical outcomes than are traditional DVH-based metrics.&quot;

'''In reirradiation:'''
*PMID 15936541 -- &quot;Combination of longitudinal and circumferential three-dimensional esophageal dose distribution predicts acute esophagitis in hypofractionated reirradiation of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer treated in stereotactic body frame.&quot; (Poltinnikov IM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
**Median RT dose was 32 Gy with a median fraction size of 4 Gy
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; &quot;Reirradiation using hypofractionated three-dimensional radiotherapy and SBF immobilization is an effective strategy for palliation of symptoms in selected patients with recurrent NSCLC. The length of the esophagus in the RT field does not predict for AE. However, an increasing number of EDs displaying the combination of longitudinal and circumferential three-dimensional dose distribution along the esophagus is a valuable predictor for AE.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Collecting Russian watches can be a rewarding experience, and at a very low cost.  I always have 5-10 of them at a time and have only had one fail.  The company name, Vostok (sometimes spelled Boctok), which means eastern in Russian, stands for its location outside Moscow.  Founded in 1942 to supply watches to Russian military forces the company still makes a tank of a watch.  Many of them are now automatic with over 30 jewels, and are very reliable, but the best accuracy is with the windup mechanical 17-jewel versions.  These can be purchased for as little as $10 brand new from buyers in the USA and abroad.  I use eBay for purchasing and leave the geographical locations open as to worldwide, thus giving me access to foreign watches.  These are usually from Russian neighbors and will cost about $20 for watch and shipping. The number of watch dials is astounding: tankers, parachutists, submariners, coast guard, and so on.  The list is practically endless and the joy of finding a really rare one is great!  The watches are made of brass covered with chrome, have a two-piece screwdown back, a gasket inside, and an easily accessible adjusting mechanism.  Most Vostoks have screwdown crowns and a wobbly end crown which takes some getting used to when winding.  I have never had one fail and it is a lot of fun to own something that few of your friends will have.  The only real problem with Vostoks is that you can hardly get enough of them!  I always quickly sell them on EBay because I buy carefully.  There are individual sellers and some online traders who charge way too much for the Vostoks but you will soon discover this for yourself.  Best sellers are individuals. Crystals are easily cleaned by rubbing with--toothpaste!  That's right...toothpaste works great, and brasso as well.  All band widths are 18mm which is a common size and a plain black leather one always looks great.  Vostok makes some watches with branded metal bracelets but they are rare.  Luminescense is usually not good except in the very newish Vostok Europes which are a bit more expensive and very good looking.  These watches sell for the over $140 range and if you can find one for less, buy it now as they are great looking and highly accurate bargains.


Vostok was established in 1942, when the Second Moscow Watch factory was evacuated to Chistopol. Very rugged, often with themed dials. 

Rakita (Rocket)/Pobeda Maker of civilian watches in Petrodvoretz, near St. Petersburg. 

Poljot--First Moscow Watch Factory.  Started by assembling foreign parts, eventually bought the defunct American Duber Hampton factory, and imported the machinery to Russia.   Sekonda was the export brand.  In England, Sekonda had the market position of Timex in the US, except with jeweled movements.  Eventually the Sekonda name was used on other Russian watches, some Asian watches, and finally it lost all ties to Russia.   Many Poljot watches are based on Swiss designs--In some cases by purchasing Swiss equipment, in some cases by merely copying a Swiss design.  

Slava--Second Moscow Watch Factory, another making watches for civilian use. First movements were based on a French design. 

Molnija--Primarily pocket watches



Markings

USSR--More than likely a watch for the export market, from before the fall of communism
CCCP--Domestic watch, pre-fall
Russia--Post-fall

== APDIP ==

The Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP) is an initiative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) that aims to promote the development and application of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for poverty alleviation and sustainable human development in the Asia-Pacific region. It does so through three core programme areas, namely, Policy Development and Dialogue; Access; and Content Development and Knowledge Management.

In collaboration with National Governments, APDIP seeks to assist national and regional institutions in Asia-Pacific through activities that involve awareness raising and advocacy, building capacities, promoting ICT policies and dialogue, promoting equitable access to tools and technologies, knowledge sharing, and networking. Strategic public-private sector partnerships and opportunities for technical cooperation among developing countries (TCDC) are APDIP’s key building blocks in implementing each programme activity.

Hi,
This looks like a bit of a cut &amp; paste, was there something specific you wanted to point out about my style or editing please?

:Hey no way.  It is a standard template used to &quot;welcome&quot; newbies (there one on my talk page too).  The idea is just to give a few pointer of places to look for info etc - no more no less.

'''Comments:'''
* I don't like this book. Compare it to [[Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine]]. Nanotechnology consists in major part of external links. There are no figures and a small amount of text. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
** The book is under construction and images are being uploaded. It will take long time to write this book because of its broad scope. The status of the individual pages is indicated with the {{stage short|25%}} icons on the main page. I'm happy it has been nominated by [[User:Panic2k4|Panic2k4]], and hope it will make more people contribute. So, have a look again one day and then I hope you will see thats its growing quite steadily and maybe even like it :-) [[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 08:14, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
*** I wish you the best, but when it comes to the current voting, I think that we should choose book that is the best at the moment. Currently Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine is far better, we should leave Nanotechnology for next month. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:12, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

===[[Raising Chickens]]===
Since no book made it to this month (the only one with three or more votes won, again) I will re-nominate this book and see how it goes.

==Voting Rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

*The book is a guide to a simple everyday task. This makes the book both usefull and editable to many. It has a clear structure which makes appending easy. The book contains already the most basic information regarding the subject, but has been lacking attention for a while. --[[User:Easyas12c|Easyas12c]] 20:07, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

'''Comments'''

* bxy says: qbj and i will make a Chinese translation of the book. Starting next week. Currently it's just us. Since the book is in very early stage, we think we can handle that. I know nothing about Italian and wants to learn a bit, qbj, went to Italy last month and will stay for 2 years began to learn the language. So this would be great fun for us. The Chinese translation will be hosted [http://blog.fltrp.com/tingda/index.php/%E5%AD%A6%E6%84%8F%E5%A4%A7%E5%88%A9%E8%AF%AD here] P.S I jsut realized a few months back there was a huge celebration about Italy Year in China, meaning much more cultural exchanges and during that peraticluar period of time. high-ranking officials pay state visits repectively. So, good timing.

The Chapter ''Mesh Functions'' mixes up code samples for NMESH and MESH.
The two classes are diffrent, the coding is not compatible. For a fine cookbook 
these classes should be presented seperatly. 
The is no use of a NMESH-codesnipet, for someone that is looking for a snipet for the same job to be done with an MESH-Class. --[[User:Master ollio|Master ollio]] 19:16, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Hierarchical Databases */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hierarchical Databases==
Hierarchical databases are the oldest database models.  Unlike other models, they do not have  a well documented history.
The hierarchical database was the first one developed and therefore was commonly used in the first mainframe database management systems.They were developed out of the 1950's and 60's Information Management Systems.  Many banks and insurance companies, as well as government departments and hospitals ( for inventory and accounting systems) still use them today.  

The hierarchical database stores data in a series of records.  These records have a set of field values attached to them.  All instances of a specific record are collected together as a &quot;record type&quot;.  It uses &quot;Parent Child Relationships&quot; to create links between record types.  It does this by using trees.  However, it is only able to cope with one tree.  As well, there can only be one parent per child, and no relationships among the child records are possible.

As an example, we could have a tree representing a university department, with subtrees representing staff members, students, courses, and facilities.  We could have numerous department trees, but we could not have one employee working for more than one department.  In order to do this, we would have to create two instances of the employee.  Obviously, this would create inaccuracies when updating information, as the information might not be the same for all records.  There is also the issue of data repetition in the various records.  

A hierarchical database has a very structured form, as it allows no links between layers in different branches of the tree.  Therefore, it is easy to use for adding, updating and deleting records.

===Advantages of the Database===
* it is easy to design
* it is cheap to maintain
* it is easy to use
* as all data are stored in a common database, it implies data sharing and security can be inforced
* a certain degree of data independence can be maintained

===Shortcomings of the Database===

* The hierarchical database is inflexible to information, for example; in a college setting, students may have a variety of classes/courses, but the hierarchical database is going to show only one of them and to the database the others don't exist.  
* Relationships are difficult to implement in a hierarchical model.
* Extensive programming activities required. Navigation inside the tree is complicated. 
*Difficult to solve the problem of single child with multiple parents
* Difficult to navigate through: with the exception of the root record, all records have to be accessed through the parent.
* Alteration of data is difficult due to rules governing the relationship of records.
Currently this type of database is not utilized to its full potential. [[Image:basic_tree.jpg]]
* It is simple and can not perform many to many correspondence

== Types of networks ==
'''Wide area Network WAN''' - a communication network that covers a wide geographical area. i.e. long distance telephone companies

'''Metropolitan Area Network MAN''' - a communication network that covers a city or suburb. i.e. local telephone companies and many cell phone companies

'''Local Area Network LAN''' - connects computers and devices in a limited geographic area. i.e. universities

'''Home Area Network HAN''' - wired cable or wireless networks. i.e. computers, printers, VCR, TV, home security systems.

'''Personal Area Network PAN''' - slightly different from HAN, because it doesn't use wires, it uses short range wireless technology.  i.e. cell phones, PDA's, MP3 players, bluetooth.

Charles Bachman invented the network database model.

The network database model is very similar to the hierarchical model. However, instead of using a single-parent tree hierarchy, the network model uses set theory to provide a tree-like hierarchy with the exception that the child tables were allowed to have more than one parent.  This allowed the network database model to support many relationships.  

When you picture a network database the look is more like several trees that share branches.  Children can have multiple parents and parents can have multiple children.
 
===Benefits of Network Database model===
Some data are more commonly modeled with more than one parent per child,so the network model allowed the modeling of many relationships in data.

This type of data has functioning information within it, allowing insignificant entries to be dropped, newer entries to replace older ones, and, for the paranoid, protection against certain classes of attacked with more than one parent per child,so the network model allowed the modeling of many relationships in data.

'''General Services'''
There is an online database to access clients, applicant, and jobs information. As well, about 24/7 access can through an Internet connection. In addition, online resume databases and Internet spiders can be accessed, too. Sharing,such as data, resources,information and research tools also works.

'''Research Services'''
Having access to research staff and services. Also, people have choice of customized the level of the research.You can get assistance with screening candidates and references which people can check as well. 

'''Technology Services'''
Having firewall security and virus protection. Converse data, set-up system, and training are the benefits of network database. By this, maintenance of database and nightly backup are the advantages. People alse get round-the-clock technical support and assistance with registering domain names. Lastly, individuals can customize e-mail addresses.

==Relational Database Model==
A relational database is a database system in which any database file can be a component of more than one of the database's tables. It is also a database system in which the database is organized and accessed according to the relationships between data items without the need for any consideration of physical orientation and relationship. Relationships between data items are expressed by means of tables.

It is a database that maintains a set of separate, related files (tables), but combines data elements from the files for queries and reports when required. The concept was developed in 1970 by Edgar Codd, whose objective was to accommodate a user's ad hoc request for selected data. Most every business database management system (DBMS), including Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, MySQL, etc., is a relational DBMS (RDBMS)

===Properties of Relational Databases===

;1. Values are atomic: Columns in a relational table are not repeating groups, this property ultimately simplifies data manipulation logic.

;2. Each column and row has a unique name: The columns and rows are not distinctive by position and therefore they must have a name which is distinct from the rest of the table in order to identify them.

;3. Each row is unique: No two rows are identical which ensures that every row has significance without duplication.

;4. The sequence of columns and rows is insignificant: This allows the information in the table to be retrieved with ease and without and disruption to the data within the table. Also, it allows many more users of the table because the data is not confined to one format and is not changed when information is added or removed.

;5. Column values are of the same kind: Each value within a specific column holds the same type of information and is of the same units as all the other data in the chart. i.e. monthly salaries and only monthly salaries are within the column.

===Keys===
*A '''key''' is the tool to unlock access to tables. Knowledge of the key enables us to locate specific records, and cross the relationships between tables. 

*Certain fields may be designated as keys, which means that searches for specific values of that field will use indexing 
*A '''candidate key''' is any field, or combination of fields, that uniquely identifies a record. The field/s of the candidate key must contain unique values (if the values were duplicated, they would be no longer identify unique records), and cannot contain a null value.
*A '''primary key''' is the candidate key that has been chosen to identify unique records in a particular table.
*A '''foreign key''' is a reference to a key in another table. A relationship between two tables is created by creating a common field to the two tables.
*Foreign keys allow us to ensure what is called &quot;referential integrity&quot;. This means a foreign key that contains a value must refer to an existing record in the related table. For example, take a look at these two tables:

==Object-Oriented Database==

====General====
The definition of '''object-oriented database''' according to authors Williams and Sawyer it &quot;''uses 'objects,' software written in small, reusable chunks, as elements within database files&quot;'' (Using Information &amp; Technology, p422) 

Multimedia, hypertext, and object relational are all databases connected with object-oriented databases.

====Multimedia Database====
Uses multiple forms of information content and information processing (e.g. text, audio, graphics, animation, video, interactivity).  This means it can store more types of data than a relational database. For example, an object-oriented student database might contain each student's photo, a sound bite, or even a short piece of video, in addition to grades and personal data. The object would store operations, which are called methods, the programs that objects use to process themselves. For example these programs might indicate how to calculate the student's grade point average.

====Hypertext Database====

[[File:Epiphany 2.18.2 en.png|300px|right]]

What is Hypertext database?

Any object, whether it be a piece of text, a picture, or a film, can be linked to any other object. Hypertext databases are particularly useful for organizing large amounts of disparate information, but they are not designed for numerical analysis.
{{clear}}

====Hypermedia Database====
Hypermedia Databases allow media files to be queried and used as a tool to develop an understanding of your originally searched question.
The goal of a hypermedia data base is to minimize error while saving space; this goal is obtained by linking to files via 'tags' or searchable text, then upon entry into the link (after a search is completed) the files format program is ran.

====Object-relational==== 
An object-oriented database uses software where little chunks are written within the database files. It is widely used in engineering design, telecommunications and multimedia. An object has two parts:
 *data that could be audio, video or graphics
 *instructions on what action to be taken on the data.
These types of databases are used by analysts, programmers and large corporation where complex software is required in order to maintain the company's inventory and structure.
Object-oriented database has the capability to handle from small files to very large files of information. It is easy to read and more efficient when it comes to managing a lot of data.
There are both free and commercial packages available that perform this mapping however many programmers create their Object Relational Object tools. This mapping is also referred to as a virtual object database.

===Multidimensional Databases===
====What is a Multidimensional Database?====
During the past decade, the multidimensional data model emerged for use when the objective is to analyze data rather than to
perform online transactions. Multidimensional database technology is a key factor in the interactive analysis of large amounts of data for decision-making purposes. In contrast to previous technologies, these databases view data as multidimensional cubes that are particularly well suited for data analysis.

Multidimensional models categorize data either as facts with associated numerical measures or as textual dimensions that characterize the facts. 

Multidimensional data models have three important application areas within data analysis.
• Data warehouses are large repositories that integrate data from several sources in an enterprise for analysis.
• Online analytical processing (OLAP) systems provide fast answers for queries that aggregate large amounts of detail data to find overall trends.
• Data mining applications seek to discover knowledge by searching semiautomatically for previously unknown patterns and relationships in multidimensional databases.

Pederson, T.B. &amp; Jensen, C.S. (2002).'' Multidimensional Database Technology''. Denmark: Aalborg University. 
http://infolab.usc.edu/csci599/Fall2002/paper/I1_pederson_p40.pdf

====When is a Multidimensional Database used?====
According to http://www.morebusiness.com/running_your_business/technology/d908484596.brc, if you have a large volume of data and/or categories and complex relationships between them, a multidimensional database (MDDB) should be considered.  Multidimensional databases are capable of storing, viewing and sorting the same data in different ways.  It would seem feasible to use this method in a national sales environment where geographic regions, months, people and products vs. sales are tracked.  Other databases may require the user to scroll through a long list or table, while MDDB's structured presentation enables all possible combinations of information to be viewed along one common dimensional position.  MDDBs are not for all organizations and applications.  For example, a payroll department would not benefit from a multidimensional database because the employee names differ, as do their SIN numbers.  MDDBs are only effective when the information is finite.

==Hybrid Database Model==
[[File:Relation.png|100px|thumb|A relational database]]
A hybrid database is a combination of two or more database types and models. An emerging type of hybrid database is the ''hybrid XML/relational database'', which is a type of database that can store and receive both XML and relational data. Both of the types of data can be accessed via quires and the databases can work together in a single application.

==Databases and the Web==

Databases are seen everywhere on the Web. Companies who offer product information, online ordering, research resources, or similar activities with a Web site use a database. For example IMDB is a database that has all of the information you need about movies and things similar to that. Another database is Amazon that shows you things on sale, customer reviews and customer information and orders. Some databases that we use to share our personal things are YouTube, Facebook, and Flickr. Databases are interesting things that are everywhere and keeps information together. Because of databases we can read our favorite books online. [[File:Amazon.com-Logo.svg|thumb|Amazon.com-Logo]]

===How web databases work===
Web databases work by a few steps to display the proper information to a user.  First a user visits a site and fills out a query box, i.e. a search box, and follows through with an &quot;enter&quot; or click to submit the query.  Next once the query is submitted the web server converts the information submitted by the user into a database query which gets sent to a database server for processing.  Lastly the database server looks up the query and sends back results to the query to the web sever or middleware, which is software that ties a web server and a database two separate applications, that gets converted to HTML that can be displayed back to the user. [[File:Gmail-search.png|thumb|query box]]

===Middleware===
Middleware is software used to connect two otherwise separate applications, such as a Web server and a database management system. Web database applications often use middleware written as scripts or sections of code written in a programming language; such as Java, C, or Perl; that are executed by another program. There are different types of scripts such as: CGI scripts (common gateway interface), ASPs (active server pages), and PHP scripts (PHP hypertext preprocessor). Middleware is used on almost all shopping sites; when you search for a specific item middleware searches the database query and converts the results into HTML which the web server can then display the results.

== Micro-Targeting ==

Micro-targeting is the use of analytical tools to identify groups of voters to target during a political campaign. They use public consumer data, voting histories, poll results etc. to identify a group of voters that will vote a particular way. These individuals are then contacted by the phone, in person, or by mail. When contacted they focus on the subjects that are important to the individual found by micro targeting. This can make a big difference in results for a vote especially when it is a close race. The goal is to target undecided voters and convince them of the candidate that best approaches their most important issues.[[File:Propaganda poster for Wikimedia licensing vote - vote yes for licensing sanity.svg|thumb|Propaganda poster for Wikimedia licensing vote - vote yes for licensing sanity]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Flaming Bob Marley''' is the name of a Jamaican Cocktail.

===Ingredients===
 
* Grenadine syrup
* Crème de menthe
* 151º proof rum

===Procedure===

#Divide a tall shot glass into thirds 
#Fill the lowest third with grenadine syrup, the middle third with creme de menthe, and float the 151 in the top third. 
#Wet a thin straw, light the 151 by passing a lighter over it. 
#Plunge the straw to the bottom of the glass into the grenadine syrup and suck. If done rapidly and correctly the straw will not melt, and you can observe flames travelling up the inside of it. Stop sucking when the flame is inside the straw. 
#Serve in a shot glass.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SourceDiffusion solves the diffusion equation for a scalar quantity, 
while SourceViscosity solves the diffusion equation for the velocity (a 
vector quantity obviously).  In the case of a spatially uniform viscosity the two are strictly 
equivalent since—in the case of an incompressible fluid—the vector 
diffusion equation for the velocity can be split in independent scalar 
diffusion equations for each of the Cartesian components of the velocities.  To sum up, using SourceViscosity is safe in all cases, regardless of whether the 
viscosity is uniform.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As omnivores [[Animal Care/Land hermit crab|land hermit crabs]] can eat foods of both plant and animal matter.  By purchasing from any number of online speciality stores even beginners can feed their crabs a lot of fresh or dried foods ([http://www.crabstreetjournal.com/articles/diet/goingnatural_beglist.html Going Natural Beginner's List]&amp;nbsp;).  Crabs eat more when not consistently fed the same thing.

Many experienced owners feed a totally natural diet, but this requires a lot of variety ([http://www.crabstreetjournal.com/articles/lisa/HCNutrition.html Hermit Crab Nutrition Table]). There are retail sites that buy in volume and repackage organic foods in small amounts for the appetites of hermit crabs. This reduces the expense and potential waste of buying lots of different type of foods.

Owners can also grow their own plants and sprouts organically.  People who purchase organic foods and who use sea salt (instead of table salt) can often feed the crabs table scraps.  For whose who care to cook for their hermit crabs, there are many [http://www.epicurean-hermit.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=40 recipes]  online.

There are lists available online of what &lt;u&gt;organic&lt;/u&gt; items can be fed at  (&amp;nbsp; [http://www.hermitcrabcuisine.com &quot;Hermit Crab Cuisine&quot;] ) and what items should not
be fed to hermit crabs.  Organic worm castings (poop) will be eagerly consumed. (The idea that dairy is not acceptable has been proven to be a myth.) 

The &quot;do not feed&quot; list contains natural insect repellents and pesticides, as well as toxic or &quot;won't eat&quot; items. The list includes things like bay leaves, cinnamon, dill, garlic, lemon, onion, rosemary, thyme, and table salt, so beware of feeding seasoned foods.

Unfortunately, picking a good commercial food can be difficult.  There are many [http://crabstreetjournal.com/xoops/modules/news/article.php?storyid=37], including ethoxyquin and copper sulfate.  Ethoxyquin is a preservative used on most fish that is not destined for human use.  Since pet food companies do not add ethoxyquin themselves, they do not have to list it on the label!!

Any pelleted items fed to hermit crabs should be crushed first.  Dry food can be left in the tank for 48 hours.  Fresh foods should be put in at night and removed the next morning to reduce the chances of attracting biting mites.  Putting foods in various areas of the tank (including some elevated areas) will give your pets some exercise.

Fresh foods can also be fed outside of the tank (not more than one hour).  Just put sand on the bottom of a clean, plastic tub (one not exposed to chemicals or cleansers), then add both the food and the messy crabs.  This is good for feeding broken, cooked chicken bones with some meat left. The crabs will love both the marrow and the meat. Pieces of raw or cooked fish can also be fed this way.

Each letter has a lower-case and an upper-case (or &quot;capital&quot;) form. In some cases (e.g. the letters S, X, and O), the upper-case form is simply a larger version of the lower-case. However, some letters have differing forms in upper- and lower-case, such as A, Q, and T.

Lower-case letters evolved from modified forms of the upper-case letters, which were used in ancient times.

== Vowels and Consonants ==

There are 5 vowel letters in English: a, e, i, o, u (&quot;y&quot; and &quot;w&quot; also act as vowels, and are used for orthographic reasons). This does not correlate with the number of vowel sounds, of which there are about 14, depending on dialect.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

There are 21 consonant letters: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

In many cases, the spelling of an English word only gives a rough indication of its pronunciation. For this reason, the English spelling system is notorious for being one of the hardest to learn of all the alphabetic scripts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The present simple tense is usually regular.  Yet, there are a few exceptions, particularly with verbs ending in 'y'.  Compared to most other Indo-European languages, English regular verbs have simple conjugation, because the first and second person forms are the same.

== Regular Verbs ==

Here is an example of the form of the present simple for regular verbs, using the verb &quot;to like&quot;:

* I '''like''' football.
* You '''like''' football.
* He/She/It '''likes''' football.
* We '''like''' football.
* They '''like''' football.

As you can see from the example above, the infinitive only changes for the 3rd person singular, where an '''s''' is added to the end of the word.

== Irregular Verbs ==

English has a large number of irregular verbs, most significantly the verb &quot;to be,&quot; which you are learning throughout this textbook.  Other verbs conjugate in different ways, including:

* Verbs like '''can''' and '''should''' do not change in any present conjugation.
* Verbs like '''try''' add '''ies''' instead of '''s.'''
* The verb '''have''' use a completely different form in the 3rd person singular, in this case '''has.'''

The following structure is a peg in the ground. It can be added to/deleted from and re-arranged, but please use the [[Wikijunior talk:Life/Structure plan|discussion page]] if you want to talk about major restructuring.

I think children should be presented with the material in a child-oriented, rather than a subject-oriented way, thus the major divisions, 'Life today', 'Life in the past', and 'Why are they different?' Following these in a top-down way, anticipating what questions may be in the mind of a bright, inquisitive child, is IMO, the best way to organise the material. My first stab at laying out the territory has not entirely followed this principle, so it is up for plenty of revision. --[[User:Barry Desborough|Barry Desborough]] 08:52, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Recipe for STM Tip Electrochemcial Etch of Tungsten Wire in KOH=

Before we begin, we apparently have to remind the users of the obvious:
Clean up after you have used the setup – after use, empty the reservoir of the used KOH and flush it well with deionized (DI) water. KOH is etching, so wipe off droplets from the table/equipment after you.

*Use a freshly cut wire -do not touch the wire roll with your fingers, since the grease will contaminate it for future users (some use the w-wire in UHV equipment where a greasy finger print can ruin quite a lot, so take care of it).
*Prepare a solution of 16.8g KOH pellets in 100ml deionized (DI) water or use the prepared solution in the plastic bottle if available.
*Fill the teflon cup well up with the solution.
*Clip the needle onto the holder and set the needle on positive and the solution on negative bias.
*Dip the needle about 0.5mm into the solution – the deeper you dip, the longer time it will take…
*Etch with about 10V and 2mA stop current. You can increase voltage if you think nothing happens to break through eventual oxide layers.
*Examine the tip in the microscope and etch again if necessary - sometimes just a quick dip can do wonders.

One reservoir of about 50mL KOH solution can efficiently etch about 3 tips, then it begins to take longer time. Stir the liquid when the etch rate drops to get fresh etchants into the reaction zone.

Tips get coated in oxide in some 10h time. They can be cleaned of oxide by flushing a bit of KOH solution over them, or in case of thick oxide by doing a quick electrochemcial etch again. A thin film of liquid remains on the tip after etching – clean in DI water and drying in hot air usually helps on this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Trauma may be getting mislabeled as genetics ===
This is basically my 2 cents worth on this subject.  I am not an expert, and I cite no references (though I wish I could).  I do write however as a long term sufferer of depression (8+ years). I was diagnosed as clinically depressed in 1998, but I believe that I had suffered for a long time before that.  It's been a long and rocky road, and I am only now beginning to come to terms with my illness. After a lot of introspection, and even more digging around for real help and information, I'd like to contribute the following:

There is a lot of speculation, and studies rarely tend to agree, but the one thing that I find the most puzzling is this insistence that genetics is a large factor in the prevalence of depression across generations.  Depression is a traumatic experience, and living with a depressed person can also lead to trauma in the sufferer's nearest family members.  I was recently told by a psychologist (name intentionally withheld) who deals a lot with war veterans that trauma can take several generations to leave a family. Given the upheaval of the two great wars, and the many large conflicts and cold war since then, it is not unreasonable to believe that trauma from these terrible events is played out in the form of flashbacks, violence, and depression within families, and sometimes even years after the traumatic events took place.

I speak from personal experience here, and I am most certainly not a scholarly expert on the subject, but I would like to share a small part of my life with you in order to make my case a little clearer.  I have an  8 year old son, who is normally a very happy and bright little boy, but who is able to display the most terrifying aspects of the depressive disorder.  If I took him to a doctor, I'd probably be told he has attention deficit disorder, or is clinically depressed.  The problem I have with this though is that I don't believe my child to be suffering from such maladies.  I know my son better than any doctor ever could in a series of 15 minute visits, and experiencing depression gives me (I believe) a greater insight into the state of my son's mental health in that regard.  So what is the problem?  I believe it is likely that my son is simply acting out as he sees his father do.  It's what he has learned from his role model, and so he shows violent tendencies, and blows small problems way out of proportion, mopes around the house, and basically doesn't know how to deal with his feelings of anger, guilt or sadness.  The sad reality is that I have been traumatised, and I have unwittingly visited my trauma on my son.  Left unchecked, it's likely he too will go through years of clinical depression, and is therefore something that I must learn to deal with, in order to avoid.  Interestingly enough, both of my parents suffered with depression at different times in their lives.  My father had an abusive father who had lived through two wars and the &quot;great depression&quot;, while my mother suffered hers as a result of politics and stress.  The thing is, I learned a lot of my behavior from both of my parents also, and looking back with an adults eyes at the child and adolescent that I was, I can see where my behavioral similarities have learned and developed.

&quot;Depression&quot; is a very generalised description of a range of symptoms that could have many causes, some of which might not necessarily be as a result of clinical depression.  It's a convenient label for an inconvenient disease, and while I have no doubt that genetic traits could potentially see depression occur over generations, I believe very strongly that this is less likely to be the case, whereas trauma is something that occurs all too regularly, and is very easily passed on if not dealt with properly. 

I believe that a major part of my recovery is to take ownership of the trauma that I have visited on others, and writing about this aspect of my illness has been of some help, and I hope you find the ideas interesting rather than simply speculative.  

Thank you.

== Overview ==

The subject of '''''flying''''' is taught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] to the first-years at Hogwarts.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Flying is done using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|brooms]]; we are led to believe that it is not possible for a wizard to fly without a broom or some other charmed device (e.g. a flying carpet, though those are currently not allowed in England) or animal (e.g. a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestral]]).

One of the rules at Hogwarts is that first-years aren't allowed to posess brooms. This rule was bent for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], though: in his first-ever flying lesson, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] sees that he is a natural flier. As a result, Harry was recruited to the Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] Team, as Seeker, and was given a Nimbus 2000.

Once his natural ability has been discovered, there is little that Madam Hooch can teach him; his flying lessons are taken over by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]], the captain of the Quidditch team, and Harry has no further lessons with Madam Hooch. We must assume that lessons continue for the other students, however.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# We are led to believe that flying is only possible with the use of an object (broom, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius']] flying motorcycle, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]]'s flying Ford Anglia), or with the assistance of a flying creature ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestral]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hippogriff|Hippogriff]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragon]]). How is it that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], and later [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], seem to be capable of unassisted flight in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]?

[[Image:CSCP_Logo.jpg|350px|right|UNEP/WI Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production]]
=== The CSCP ===
The Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP) provides scientific support to activities undertaken by UNEP and other organisations in the field of SCP. This support includes the development, testing, implementation and monitoring of concrete projects, especially in developing countries, which will enable these countries to leapfrog to sustainable consumption and production patterns using life cycle thinking and regional perspectives as guiding principles.

In this respect the Centre supports the integration of environmental, social and cultural concerns into decision making at the level of national governments, regional and local authorities, the private sector, and consumer groups.

The Centre works on the exchange of experiences with partners in both developing and developed countries, with support for capacity building and training approaches as an integral part of its programmes.

=== The Idea Factory: How it began ===
The CSCP Idea Factory is a regular meeting of the members of the CSCP team, where new ideas are brainstormed. One of these ideas was to create an interactive Book where experts and other interested people can contribute.

=== The Book: Short background information ===
The future book is intended to be for the interested reader. No technical background is necessary, but it might be helpful in some parts.

=== How you can contribute ===
If you are an expert on any of the subjects below or have a very keen interest, please&lt;br&gt;
feel free to contribute. You can do so by adding articles, article titles that might&lt;br&gt;
spark ideas or even just some ideas, like keywords or titles of interesting studies that&lt;br&gt;
you have read.

Basic overview of the scanning tunneling microscope tip-sample interaction.
When the tip is within atomic distance of the sample surface and a small bias voltage about a volt or so is applied, tunneling current can be measured.
Adjusting the height of the tip while scanning the tip over the surface with a fixed bias voltage to always maintain a constant tunnel current will map out the sample topography.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|Germany]]

One has to eat [[Cookbook:Spaetzle|Spätzle]] with the [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentils]].

Best procedure is to prepare the dough before you cook the lentils, and afterwards you cook the Spätzle.

This one is a slightly modified recipe, the traditional one has no tomato and honey.
But as on many &quot;national meals&quot; there is are different opinions.
The best is to try around until you got your own best taste for it.

The most important things for a traditional taste is the vinegar and the bay (laurel) leaves.

==Ingredients==

* 250 grams [[Cookbook:Lentil|brown lentils]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 2 pairs of [[Cookbook:Scalding|scalded]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]
* 1 large piece of [[Cookbook:Smoking|smoked]] [[Cookbook:Pork|pork belly]]
* 2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 litre of [[Cookbook:Water|water]] for the lentils
*: it's needed to make the sauce, so don't use more water.
* 40 g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 40 g [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ½ litre [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Wine vinegar|red wine vinegar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* about 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* one or more [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay (laurel) leaves]]

==Equipment==

* A medium sized pot
* A small pot
* A sieve

==Procedure==

===Lentils===
# Wash the lentils in sieve and cook them on small heat in one litre water for 40 to 50 minutes (there are already done lentils to buy, and dry lentils, etc. so best check instructions on the lentils package).
# 20 minutes before the end of that time frame add the diced carrot and onion plus the peeled raw potatoes, also the garlic, the sausages (full or in pieces), the bay (laurel) leaves and the pork belly.
# After those 20 minutes, put the pot on the side and keep it warm.

===Roux===

# Melt the butter in the little pot, add the flour and cook carefully until brown, keep stirring.
# Slowly add the half litre of water in small portions and let it boil up once.
# Add the tomato paste, the vinegar and honey, and spice with salt and pepper to your liking, pour the content into the pot with the lentils and mix well and keep it warm.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* Perhaps at first you think &quot;how can fit vinegar in this stew&quot; you will be surprised how good it fits, so don't be shy with it, or better place it on your table so everybody can do it as they like..
* Before eating, pick out the bay (laurel) leaves.
* About the warming up, etc., it's like with every stew, it is also great on the other day ;)

How do you like it?
I would be happy to have feedback in the discussion panel.
Also things to do better, etc.

''Greetings from Suabia!''

However do look around a little before you edit too much.  The recipe you created needed to be correctly named to be in the Cookbook section of Wikibooks.  Equally you added to the Black Forest Cake recipe a sentnece that was already lower down the page.

== Vandal reports? ==
Ooo shiny new page!  Do the vandal reports go here now?  Or from when?  Does the &quot;recent changes&quot; link to vandalism need doing. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:31, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== Usage? ==

While asking questions, should people start making all those requests here and is this meant to replace the other pages or should transclusions be done? --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 14:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:Maybe. Less pages to watch for admins might be a good thing :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:49, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

::So is that merger or transclusion then? Should the first merge history request be for all the other pages? Then its just a mater of turning the other pages into redirects. BTW not sure the name really helps people know what its intended usage is. How about &quot;Administrators' Help&quot;, &quot;Requests for Help&quot;, &quot;Request for Administrative Action&quot;, &quot;Request for Administrative Help&quot;, &quot;Staff Help&quot;, &quot;Request Staff Help&quot;, etc. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 15:09, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:::See [[w:WP:AN]]. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:11, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

::::So your trying to help Wikipedians too then? I was going to suggest &quot;Staff Helpdesk&quot; next as another name I just thought of to coincide with &quot;Staff lounge&quot;. Nothing stopping this page from existing as a helpful redirect for Wikipedians. &quot;Administrative noticeboard&quot; on Wikipedia looks more like &quot;Staff lounge&quot; here from a quick look. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 15:17, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:::::It could be &quot;staff desk&quot; &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 22:40, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

Definitely not :). The WP version of the staff lounge is [[w:WP:VP]]. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:42, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== Checkuser requests ==

As we now have a rather fuller complement of Checkusers could we work out a way to make sure that all who need to be checked are?  Understanding that Whitekinight would like to be notified of requests on his user talk page, I know Derbeth checks the Vandalism in Progress page BUT quite a few have been picked up and blocked by an admin and so don't get a mention on that page.  Personally I tend to check the block log first thing and work on that.  Would people like an acknowledgement that a check has been made?  And if so where?

Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:55, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
:I'd like to know when checks are being made since this system should be used somewhat sparingly. I am not sure where these checks could be listed though. Maybe at the admins' noticeboard? -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:17, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

::The issue I was looking to resolve here was how folk would &quot;request&quot; a checkuser dig and a way of ensuring that none got missed by accident.  On vandal ones I have done I have placed a message on the blocking admin's page acknowledging I have made the check.  If a block is the result, it and the reason, will be available for all to see.

::As to use of checkuser rights the log of enquiries is available across Wikis so all those with the rights can see what is being done.  There are really very few entries however equally it is clear that those with the rights will act on suspicion as well as requests.  I hope that it is quite clear that it would not be appropriate to divulge this information unless there was an issue that might be having an effect on us (such as sock puppetry).  Certainly if I found something as a result of such a check I would share it privately with other checkusers or admins/'crats if appropriate in the first instance to request views and advice. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Checkuser needs to be used quietly, privately, with considerable discretion, and above all rarely. We could come up with a public log of when it's done and why, but the wikimedia privacy policies wouldn't let us say who was checked and what we found. Would such a log be useful? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:22, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
::::All of the Checkusers should keep tabs on each other, but I think in some cases it might not be detrimental to note that a Checkuser could be used in certain investigations. The outcome, when sensitive, would of course be kept under wraps. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:18, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

:Just to clarify, it's not that I need a special invitation or anything (although the attention is nice). I tend not to read VIP if the last edit to that page was made by an administrator. My thinking here is that 1), I have better things to do then read everything that ever happens, and 2) my fellow administrators can be trusted to quickly and ruthlessly destroy vandalism wherever it is found. Also, all vandals don't need to be checkuser'd, just vandals that appear to be coming from the same source. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:24, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

== Oversight of a sort ==

Testing my suspicion and following a test by Az1568 it is quite possible to remove edits to a page from &quot;general&quot; visibility (they can still be seen and restored by an admin only).  To do so all you need do is delete the page and then selectively restore it leaving off the items not required.  Ok it is rather more work but for now until we establish a real need it would pass for some instances?  If you take a look at my user page history you (admins) will see 4 edits that have been &quot;left off&quot;. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:07, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

== Ordering of posts on AN ==

I just juggled all the unchronological posts and made them all chronological. I figure that, since the noticeboard is not used often (and when it is, in short spurts), and most of the posts of late are non-topical (or, at least, they were never put in their topical subcategory), it is best to keep it like this. If someone feels like reverting me, go ahead...I wouldn't care. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:59, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

== eh? ==

This page has a rather rediculous name now. Since I'm the &quot;original author&quot; of WB:AN, am I allowed to revert the name change? ;p --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:57, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

You can make a telescope for around $25 in materials. You can make one for $50 that will amaze your friends and family, and show you things you didn't know existed.  It can be done in a few weeks. However, telescope-making can get messy. You can break a piece you've slaved over. Then you walk around in the worst mood you have ever been in. But in the end you have a telescope that people will look at, and through, and say, &quot;You couldn't have made this.&quot; Yes, you did, and that is the best part of all.

Let's make a telescope.

== Thinking About Telescopes ==

People have been making telescopes for 400 years,
and it's no surprise they've built a vocabulary of specialized terms.
In this section we'll take a quick look at some of the most important,
and provide links to pages that explain them in more depth.
Follow those now, or come back and follow them later when you feel the need for more detail.

=== Refracting Telescopes ===

The first telescopes were ''refracting'' telescopes.
In a refracting telescope, light passes through two or more lenses.
The right combination of lens shapes brings the light from a small area
to focus on the retina of your eye, giving you a magnified image.

A basic problem with a refracting telescope is that different colors of light
are bent by different amounts.
The red light comes to a focus at a very slightly different point than the blue or green light does.
The result is a fringe of rainbow color around bright objects.
Camera designers tinker endlessly with lens materials and coatings to 
avoid this ''false color'' problem.

Small inexpensive refracting telescopes can often be found at surplus
and used merchandise stores very cheaply.
Amateurs can make refracting telescopes.
You need a magnifying lens of long focal length,
called the ''objective'' lens,
paired with one of short focal length (the ''eyepiece'').
A usable objective lens can be salvaged from
many types of equipment that use projection lenses and other optical components.

[[Image:Wikipedia-logo.png|20px| ]] [[w:Refracting Telescope|Refracting Telescope]] '''(english)'''

=== Reflecting Telescopes ===

The reflecting telescope is designed around mirrors, not lenses.
The light does not pass through a lens and is not refracted.
It is simply reflected.
Since there is no refraction, all colors of light are affected equally,
hence there is no problem of false color.

A reflecting telescope has its own problems.
Its mirrors must be shaped precisely, within a fraction of the wavelength
of light, in order to avoid distortion.
(Historically, the main mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope
was improperly curved, due to a failure of communications between
the designer and manufacturer. A space shuttle trip had to be made
to introduce a compensating lens in the system to clear up the image.)

It is not as hard to shape a perfect mirror as you might think.
Our first project, the Newtonian Reflector, requires mirrors,
and we will make them.  It is really very easy to do because
(as you will find), physics is on our side.

[[Image:Wikipedia-logo.png|20px| ]] [[w:Reflecting telescope|Reflecting telescope]] '''(english)'''


=== Catadioptric telescopes ===

Catadioptric telescopes are a sort of hybrid.  They use both lenses and mirrors to focus the light.

=== Technical Terms ===

We need a few technical terms.
The first two are ''focal point'' and ''focal length''.

[[Image:Telescope making focal length.png|center|400px|alt=focal length diagram|Focal length for a lens or a mirror]]

The focal length of a lens, or of a curved mirror, 
is the distance at which it brings incoming light to a focal point, or simply ''focus''.
The curvature of the lens or mirror surface determines the focal length.
The less the curvature, the longer the focal length.

The greater the focal length, the greater the effective ''magnification'' of the image.
As a general rule, the greater the focal length, the less the impact
of imperfections in the curvature. The less the focal length, the more
critical it is to have a perfect curve.

== Project 1: The Newtonian Reflector ==

The Newtonian Reflector Telescope is an extremely simple and efficient design.
It consists of two mirrors in a tube. That's all!

[[Image:Telescope making newtonian.png|center|500px|alt=newtonian reflector diagram|The arrangement of mirrors and the path of light in a Newtonian reflector]]

The larger, curved mirror directs incoming light to a focus.
The smaller, angled mirror shunts the focused light out the side of the tube,
where you can place your eye to see the image.  In the Newtonian reflector, the smaller mirror is flat, but in a related design, the Cassegrain, it is convex.
Read the Wikipedia article on the Newtonian Reflector for its history.

[[Image:Wikipedia-logo.png|20px| ]] [[w:Newtonian Telescope|Newtonian Telescope]] '''(english)'''

After we consider how you will use your telescope, we will get deeply into how
we choose the exact shapes and sizes of these simple pieces.
Then we'll build it!

=== How Will You Use Your Telescope? === 

How will you actually use your telescope?  Most folks, me included, spent a lot of time dreaming about making the telescope without giving serious thought to how we might use it. I talked about looking at stars and planets&amp;mdash;but I also talked about looking at birds and retreating snow fields. Only when I looked through the telescope did I discover some problems. One is, the basic Newtonian telescope makes everything look upside down! Looking at the stars?  This is not an issue.  Looking at birds or scenery?  We have a problem. Fortunately you can buy an inverting eyepiece that will turn things right side up. A second issue with the Newtonian telescope is that it is by design quite powerful. This means you might be looking at a bird's feather detail, not the bird. Third,  the telescope is much larger than a pair of binoculars and needs to be supported so you can aim it and hold it steady. I don't want you to stress over this, but you need to consider, what will you do with the telescope?

=== Telescope Design ===

The telescope design covers everything from the optics (in our case the two mirrors), the brackets that hold those optics and keep them aligned, and the  tube assembly that contains it all. Design also includes the supporting framework that holds the tube and lets you swivel and point it. That piece is called the telescope ''mount''.

So let's say you think that you mainly want to look at planets and stars in the sky. Longer focal length telescopes give higher magnification. That is just how it works: the longer the focal length, the more magnified the image at your eye.  Bigger mirrors will gather more light, but two telescopes with different sized mirrors will give the same size image at the focal point, if they have the same focal length (although, since more light is being put into the same size image with a larger mirror, the image in a telescope with a larger mirror will be brighter). Mirrors with a long focal length are somewhat easier to make and more forgiving of error. However, the longer the focal length, the longer the telescope, making it more difficult to move around and to store.

Shorter focal-length telescopes give less magnification, but a wider field of view. The image is a bit smaller but that is rarely an issue when looking through the eyepiece.  The mirrors require a bit more work, a different technique, but they are as easy to make as the long ones. A shorter telescope is easier to move, easier to store, easier to set up for use.

There is no right answer here.  The telescope you make should be one you are comfortable with and will use.  I have made a lot of telescopes in the last few years.  My first--I called it the Long Dog--had a truss design that took about five minutes and 10 bolts to set up. The truss poles were six feet long. It was heavy and long and you had had to stand on a ladder to reach the eyepiece, but it gave images that would take your breath away.  I got one of my favorite comments while using that telescope.  I showed a friend the planet Saturn.  It was a perfect night, calm sky, dark, Saturn was high.  He looked at the planet and said, &quot;That is so amazing it doesn't look real.&quot;  That is what we call resolution.

Regardless of the length and size of telescope you choose to make, you will find the information to build it here. I am going to do two mirrors and several mounting ideas for this, the first project of the book.  I will grind and polish a shorter focal length mirror and a longer focal length mirror.  Whatever you decide on I will cover it here and you will be successful with your first telescope.

=== The parts of the Telescope ===

Time to get into the details of design. The following will have some basic math and some pictures to help.

==== Radius of Curvature ====

Having considered the physical size of the telescope and the use to which I want to put it, I can now begin to consider the optics.
The focal length depends on the choices made while thinking about the telescope.
The focal length is set by the shape of the curve in the front of the main mirror.
We make that curve by grinding the mirror.
The amount of grinding and the depth of the curve are both directly affected by the choices made while thinking about the telescope.

It is the front surface of the mirror that forms the image, so it is the front surface that gets all of our attention.
The back of the mirror may get quite beat up during this process.
That is OK, as long as we don't crack it or put big chips in it.

The curve in the front of a telescope mirror is called the Radius of Curvature, abbreviated ''ROC'', or sometimes just ''R''.
The front of the mirror is a smooth bowl-shaped depression.
Imagine a ball, and if you have one handy, look at it while you read this.
The ball has some radius, the distance from the center of the ball
(an imaginary point inside where you can't see it, but it is there)
to the inner surface of the ball.
That is the ROC. It defines the ball's size, and the curve of the surface.

Imagine that the ball is reflective inside.
Imagine that we place a source of light
(a fancy way of saying put a light bulb or a flash light or something that emits light)
at the center of the ball.
All of the light would reflect back to the light source, at the center.
However, if we move the light source away from the center,
the point of reflection, or focal point, will also move away from the center in the opposite direction.
When the source of light gets really far away from the center of the ball, at infinity,
the focal point ends up being about half way between the center of the ball and the surface of the ball.
(How far away is &quot;infinity&quot;?  Well, figure at least 200 times the ROC.)

Now imagine that we cut off a small slice of the ball, or press the surface of the ball into some soft material, clay or moist dirt.
Either way, we have a shallow, smooth, bowl-shaped depression.
It would be curved just like the front surface of a telescope mirror.  

[[Image:Geometry of the Mirror.png]]

The surface of the mirror has a uniform curvature that determines its focal length.
The mirror is usually circular; it is a circular patch cut from that imaginary ball.
It can be any size; ours will be a few inches across.
(For comparison, the mirror of the Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii? 8.2 ''meters'', 27 feet.)
The radius of the mirror, one-half its diameter, is denoted as ''r''.

==== The Primary Mirror ====

The depth of the bowl-shaped curve that is ground into the front of the mirror is called the ''sagitta''.

[[File:Mirror Basics Small.png|alt=diagram of a curved mirror showing the depth of the curve at the center is the sagitta|center]]

There is a math formula to figure out how deep to make the sagitta to achieve a specific focal length.

{| align=center cellspacing=10 style=text-align:left; width=50%
|-
| &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{r^2}{2 \times ROC}&lt;/math&gt;
| 
|-
|}

The formula relates the ROC and ''r'', which we know to be the radius of the mirror, to ''S'', the sagitta.
The formula reads, multiply the radius of the mirror times itself,
then divide it by two times the Radius of Curvature.
Huh? Well, we can measure the diameter of the mirror with a ruler or tape measure and divide it in half to get the radius of the mirror.
If it is eight inches across, the radius is half of that or four inches. But how much is the ROC?

Well, remember how the focal point moves as the light source moves away from the center of the ball.
When the light source is at infinity, or a long way away,
the focal point is halfway between the center of the ball and the surface of the ball.
So the focal length is one half the Radius of Curvature, one half the ROC.

This is when we have to get specific about the telescope:
what focal length did you want?
Well, how long of a telescope did you want? 
Lets say you wanted a four-foot telescope.
The ROC is twice that length, or eight feet.
(If you have made a telescope before, you are fuming right now,
because you know the length of the telescope has little to do with the focal length of the mirror.
I'll clear it up before I'm done.)

I asked, why am I figuring out the ROC when it is just another way of saying two times the focal length?
Why not just use the focal length in the Sagitta formula? Two times the ROC is equal to four times the focal length, so why not use this?

{| align=center cellspacing=10 style=text-align:left; width=50%
|-
| &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{r^2}{4 \times f}&lt;/math&gt;
| 
|-
|}

Well, you can. For our purposes as amateurs we can use either and it will be good enough.

So!  let's figure out a Sagitta for an eight inch mirror with a focal length of forty eight inches.

{| align=center cellspacing=10 style=text-align:left; width=50%
|-
| Sagitta calculation for a mirror eight inches in diameter and 48-inch focal length
|-
| &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{r^2}{4 \times f} = \frac{4^2}{4 \times 48} = \frac{16}{192} = 0.08333&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Not much, is it?  0.08333 inches, (and those threes go on forever). It is about the thickness of a (U.S.) penny.
A ream of paper is pretty close to 2 inches thick.
There are 500 sheets in a ream.
250 sheets times 0.08333 is about 21 sheets.

How accurate do you have to be?  How close to a four foot telescope do you want?
The focal length of the mirror will determine, to some extent, the length of the telescope tube,
and for quick consideration you can assume the focal length of the mirror and the telescope tube are the same.
''But'' note that In practice the telescope tube will be as much as 25% longer than the actual focal length.
If a five-foot telescope sounds too big, you can re-do the formula for a 3-foot focal length, or any other value you want.

We have spent several paragraphs on the primary mirror and I have only shared the basics.  Many good books and web pages document the making of the primary mirror.  Look at the links at the end of the book.  Now we need to consider the second half of the optics, the secondary mirror.

==== The Secondary Mirror ====

In the diagram above (and the wikipedia page on Newtonian Telescopes)
we see that the telescope gathers and focuses the light,
bouncing it back up the tube. Then the optical path is turned 90 degrees and the focus and eyepiece are on the side of the tube. This is accomplished with a flat mirror set at a 45 degree angle in the tube. (It is possible in smaller telescopes to use a type of prism, but a mirror is simpler for use to make and works as well.)

* [[Image:Wikipedia-logo.png|20px| ]] [[w:Amici_roof_prism|Roof Prism]] '''(english)'''

How big this ''secondary mirror'' should be, its shape, and where it should sit relative to the primary,
are functions of the basic measurements of the telescope.
In the previous section we used an 8 inch mirror with a 48 inch focal length
as an example for our calculations. I will continue to use that example in this section.

{| style=&quot;border:1px solid silver;width:90%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot;

|-
  | style='width:33%;padding-left:6px;' |Secondary mirrors are generally oval in shape. They are referred to by the minor axis. A 1-inch secondary mirror that is one inch wide by about 2 inches long with an oval shape. You can use a rectangular mirror of the same general dimensions and it will work fine. If you hold such a mirror and rotate it on its minor axis so it is at 45 degrees to your line of sight, it will foreshorten and look round or square depending on the shape of the mirror.
  |style='width:66%;text-align:left;'| [[Image:SecondarynMount.png|right|alt='diagram of secondary mirror mount in relation to the eyepiece, and discussion of how it is elliptical with the minor-axis diameter as its nominal size|]]
|}

==== Sizing the Tube ====

Before we can calculate the size and location of the secondary,
we need to think about the telescope tube that supports the mirrors.
How long should it be? How big in diameter? How far in will the primary mount?

{| style=&quot;border:1px solid silver;width:90%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot;
|-
  |style='width:33%;text-align:left;'|[[Image:View Down Tube.png|alt=view down the tube showing the primary and secondary mirrors centered]] 
  | style='width:66%;padding-right:6px;' |If we were to size the tube at just the diameter of the primary mirror, it would be difficult to mount the mirror in the tube. Also, a part of the surface of the mirror would be wasted. The outer edge of the mirror would be vignetted by the tube wall, and the image would suffer from reflection and diffraction, a bending and scattering of the light by the tube wall. This would add a lot of unfocused light around the image and reduce resolution. Adding space between the mirror and the tube wall lessens this affect.
|}

The tube needs to be bigger than the primary mirror; by how much?
A safe number is one inch clearance around the mirror.
This works out to a tube that is two inches bigger in diameter than the primary mirror.
For the 8 inch primary that is our example mirror, the tube would be 10 inches in diameter.

Tube length is determined by the focal length of the primary mirror,
plus the space at the end for the primary mirror and
the ''mirror cell''&amp;mdash;that is, the framework that supports the mirror
and holds it perpendicular to the axis of the tube.

The typical primary mirror and cell form a stack about 3 to 4 inches in height.
Add that to the focal length and you would have a tube that is long enough
(remember, part of the focal length is turned sideways by the secondary mirror).
A little extra length, say 3 or 4 more inches, gives a shield that works to block stray local light.
Our example mirror has a focal length of 48 inches.
Add 4 more for the mirror and cell,
and 4 more for blocking light, and we have a tube 56 inches in length,
and at least 10 inches in diameter.

* [[Image:Wikipedia-logo.png|20px| ]] [[w:Vignetting|Vignetting]] '''(english)'''

==== Sizing the Secondary ====

So, how big shall we make  the secondary mirror?
Before we can answer we need to consider one more key dimension, the ''focal offset''.


{| style=&quot;border:1px solid silver;width:90%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot;
|-
  | style='width:33%;padding-left:6px;'|The offset is the distance from the middle of the secondary mirror, essentially the middle of the tube, to the focus of the image. Figure it as the radius of the tube, (half the tube diameter), plus the height of the focuser fully racked out. I use three inches for that number since I do not buy focusers. So the offset for our example telescope is 5 inches plus 3 inches or 8 inches.
 |style='width:66%;text-align:right;'|[[Image:Mirror Offset.png|alt=diagram showing the focal offset as the distance from the center of the secondary to the end of the focus tube]]
|}

A formula for figuring the size of the secondary is as follows.

{| align=center cellspacing=10 style=text-align:left; width=50%
|-
| &lt;math&gt;d = \frac{Os \times D}{f}&lt;/math&gt;
| 
|-
|}

In this formula, 

* ''Os'' is the focal offset, 
* ''D'' is the Diameter of the primary mirror
* ''f'' is focal length of the primary mirror
* ''d'' is the minor axis diameter of the secondary mirror

We multiply the diameter of the primary mirror by the focal offset and divide by the focal length of the primary mirror.
This gives us a minimum minor axis.
A second rule of thumb is,
the secondary should be no bigger than 20 percent of the primary mirror diameter.
Given an 8-inch primary, that is 1.6 inches.
Purists haggle over these numbers forever.
My opinion and experience are, a secondary that is a bit too big is preferable to one that is a bit too small.

Lets look at that formula in operation.  I used these values:  

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{Os \times D}{fl} = \frac{8 \times 8}{48} = \frac{64}{48} = 1.333&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The formula yields a size of 1.33 inches.
This is a minimum size.  You could increase it by 25% and have a better secondary fit.
1.33 x 1.25 = 1.66 inches&amp;mdash;which just happens to be at the 20% mark.
Pretty cool, huh?

That's it! That is how, beginning with the diameter and focal length
of the primary mirror, we decide on the tube diameter and length,
and the size of the secondary mirror.

The formulas are important enough that I have included them here on a graphic that will make a 3 x 5 card.  Print it out!

|-
| f = focal length of the primary mirror
 |-
|}

These formulas and the considerations that lead to them
will guide your second telescope and every telescope you make after that first one.
But next you need to teach your hands how to grind and polish a mirror, and that is best learned on simple inexpensive stuff.

== Making the Optics ==


=== Mirror Materials ===

What do we use to make a mirror?
Strictly speaking, all we need in a telescope mirror is a hard, polishable material.
We can shape almost any hard, polishable substance with a simple mechanical process to get the optical curve that we need.

In the very earliest days of telescope making the material of choice was Speculum Metal.
This was an alloy of  Copper, Tin and Arsenic that was hard and nearly white.
Ordinary glass is hard and can be polished, but it does not reflect light well;
since it is transparent, most of the light that falls on it, passes through.
But somewhere along the way someone came up with a process to ''coat'' glass
with a reflective material, and the modern period of mirror making began.
We polish a hunk of glass to the correct curve, coat it with reflective material, and have our mirror.
(But if you have a piece of metal that you think will polish out, I say try it.  It was done before; you can do it now.)

==== Glass Objects ====

Glass was originally basic soda-lime glass, like what we would call window glass or plate glass today.
Softer and easier to work than the metal, it could be polished out perfectly.
However, glass expands and contracts with changes of temperature.
The change in size as a telescope adapts to chilly night-time air makes
for a nasty transition period before you can view the stars.
The glass will move enough to mar the ''figure'' of the mirror&amp;mdash;its ability to direct all of the light to one point&amp;mdash;and you are basically stuck until the mirror equalizes with the environment.
This can take an hour on small mirrors.

Many different blends of glass have been tried in the search for glass that would not distort in this way.
Pyrex is harder and does not expand as much as soda-lime glass does.
Fused Silica, and other exotic processes yield a glass- like material that is harder and will yield a mirror that hardly changes at all.
But you can make a mirror out of any material that will take and hold the shape of the mirror's curve,
and many materials have been used.
You can make a mirror out of various rocks: Cryptocrystalline Silica will work.
I have a mirror made out a rock called Chert. It worked fine.
Volcanic glass or Obsidian has been used.
The point is, if you can grind and polish it, you can make a mirror out of it.

For the first telescope mirror I am going to use something common and inexpensive: the ubiquitous Pyrex pie dish.
Now, if you happen to have a piece of glass or something that you want to work with, use it.
If you find a more traditional piece of glass while shopping for your pie dish, don't feel obligated to go with a pie dish.
Use what you can get that is within your budget.
Any piece of glass will work: drink coasters; those big glass disks they put under decorative candles; glass serving platters;
a big glass ash-tray.
They are all glass, they are all round, they will all yield a mirror.
The color of the glass does not matter.
The glass can be any color, even rainbow.
We will coat the working surface with an opaque reflector when we are done, so who cares!

==== Avoid Tempered Glass ====

There is one type of glass we must avoid: ''tempered'' glass.
Tempered glass, often used in automobile windows, glass shower doors, and other places,
is put under stress when it is made.
Because of this built-in stress, when tempered glass breaks,
it shatters in many small pieces.
It is likely to shatter suddenly when its outer surface is scratched or abraded&amp;mdash;for
example, when a would-be telescope builder starts to grind on it!

There is an easy test for tempered glass using polarized sunglasses.
Polarizing &quot;shades&quot; are cheaply available, or can be borrowed.
While wearing them, hold the suspect piece of glass up to the light and rotate it.
Does it show a pattern of dark and light spots? 
These spots show the internal stress of tempering, waiting to shatter.

Unfortunately our preferred mirror source, the heat-proof baking dish,
is nowadays sometimes made of a tempered material.
If the dish is well-worn and has visible surface scratches or abrasions,
it is likely not tempered (or it would have shattered already).
If it is new and shiny, test it with polarizing glasses.

Now prowl the glass aisle of the local thrift store with this caution in mind and three criteria:
Roundish, a smooth curve to the bottom, or flat and thick enough.
If the bottom has a curve already the glass can be thinner than if you have to grind the curve into it.

==== The Scavenger's Sagitta ====

How much curve?
Let's say you are looking at a pie dish.
The outside bottom, which is what we will work with, should have a pretty smoothly concave curve.
Hold it upside down with the concave bottom up against the front edge of a straight shelf.
The gap formed by the glass and the shelf is our sagitta! Or the beginning of it.
There should not be any big bumps or dips in the curved surface of the glass when compared to the straight edge of the shelf.
However, don't worry about any embossed words or logos.
They grind right off.

[[Image:SagittaonShelfEdge.PNG|center]]

How deep is that curve?  A U.S. dime is 1.3mm thick, a penny is about 1.5mm, and a nickel is almost 2mm.
(Yes, the U.S. Mint uses metric dimensions for its coins.)
Hold the bottom of the dish up against the shelf edge or any straight edge.
Can you slide a nickel through the gap between the bottom curve and the straight edge?
If not, then a penny? Or if so, two dimes?
You should be able to come to a good estimate of the depth at the deepest part of the curve.
Let’s say a penny is a loose fit but a nickel won't quite go.
It's fair to say the curve is 1.9mm deep.

Now measure the diameter of the bottom of the plate. 
A Pyrex pie plate sold as a nominal &quot;ten-inch&quot; plate (it will probably say 25cm on the bottom) is almost exactly 8 inches across the bottom.
One sold as a nominal &quot;nine-inch&quot; dish is about 7 inches across the bottom.
That will be the mirror diameter.
You have two parts of the saggitta formula, what is the focal length of that pie pan bottom?

{| align=center cellspacing=10 style=text-align:left; 
|-
| &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{r^2}{4f}&lt;/math&gt; which rearranges to give &lt;math&gt;4f = \frac{r^2}{S}&lt;/math&gt; which gives &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{r^2}{4S}&lt;/math&gt;
| 
|-
|}

Suppose our saggita is about 1.9mm.
The diameter of the flat dish-bottom/mirror is about 8 inches, or
(here we quickly refer to the metric-conversion tool built into most computers) 203mm.
Half that is the mirror radius, ''r''.
Half of 203 is 101.5; and we can plug these values into the formula:

{| align=center cellspacing=10 style=text-align:left; width=50%
|-
| &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{101.5^2}{4 \bullet 1.9}&lt;/math&gt;
| 
|-
|}

101.5 x 101.5 = 10,302.25.
4 x 1.9 is 7.6; 10,302.25/7.6 = 1,355.6
Our focal length is 1.355 meters, or (again we refer to our metric converter) about 53 inches.

There are a lot of  &quot;abouts&quot; in the above calculation because we have been casual about measuring the depth of the curve.
It is more than one penny but not a nickel, or not two pennies. 
The coins might be worn.
There may be a hump in the middle.
On and on the guessing goes, but really, it isn't worth sweating over.
Most glass pie dishes have a smooth regular curve on the bottom and will yield a mirror 7 or 8 inches in diameter,
with a focal length between 36 and 48 inches.
But right now we are getting our mirror material and we should stay on track.

Maybe you see a big old ashtray that is about six inches across and has a generally smooth curve on the bottom.
Testing with coins and a straight-edge you find that a penny will just slide between the shelf edge and the glass.
Sagitta? 1.5mm.
Diameter is about 6 inches so radius is about 3 inches, or 76mm.
So ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 5,776, divided by (4 x 1.5 = 6) is 962mm.

So that ash tray will yield a mirror that is about 6 inches in diameter with a focal length of about 38 inches.

Just to be sure I knew what I was talking about I spent a few hours
wandering around in various thrift stores, doing the things I talked about here.
Yes, people will look at you strangely.
Well, remember, Einstein was once considered a weird old man too.

I found five odd bits of glass that I bought for and average of $1.99 each.
Two glass platters cost me $2.99 each, but they will yield nine and one half-inch mirrors.

I got three pie dishes, two glass platters,
and one white glass plate with an 8-inch bottom having a 1/8th inch deep curve.
What is the focal length of that white plate?

I also found a 7-inch glass disk just a tad shy of one inch thick.
I have no idea what it was for.
It looks like some kind of fancy trivet or maybe a candle base.
It is flat, so I will have to grind the curve in before I smooth it out.
That is OK, it is plenty thick enough to take a curve.

While you are out shopping buy at least one extra pie plate, we need it to make the ''tool''&amp;mdash;the surface that we grind against.
Go for cheap here, we are going to break it up into pieces so the cheaper the better.
Now go find your mirror.

=== Other Parts You Need ===

There are other parts to the telescope, and you should be looking for those parts while you look for your primary mirror.
You will need a secondary mirror, as described above.
You will need a mount to hold the primary and the secondary mirror.
You need a tube for the scope; a focuser assembly; an eyepiece;
and finally, a mount for the telescope so you can point it where you want it.
When you begin to put the telescope to serious use there will be other things
(like a ''finder'' for aiming, or a telescope cover) that are handy to have,
but the parts listed above are essential.
To actually grind the mirror you will need a tool and some grit, as well as some polish.

==== Finding a Secondary ====

The secondary mirror is usually an oval shape, but may be rectangular.
More important than the shape of the secondary is the flatness of its surface.

Both of our mirrors are ''first-surface'' mirrors; that is, they reflect light from the top surface.
The typical mirror in which you admire your pretty face is is not a first-surface mirror.
Its reflective layer is applied to the back of the sheet of glass,
and reflected light passes twice through the thickness of the glass.
This is practical in a mirror for a bathroom or a cosmetic kit, because the delicate
reflecting coating is protected by the glass.
But in a telescope we cannot tolerate light bouncing back and forth through glass.

The secondary mirror must be a first-surface mirror that is optically flat, and that is very flat indeed.
You can polish a secondary mirror to be flat and I will cover how to do that later on,
but there are some sources of glass and mirrors that may answer the need without all the effort of making one.
There are lots of places where you might scavenge a first-surface mirror.
Some old Polaroid cameras have a first-surface mirror in them,
and can be found for pennies on the dollar at thrift shops.
Old photocopy machines have very flat first-surface mirrors in them,
as do overhead projectors, some slide projectors and movie projectors.
Even if you cannot find the mirror in an old photocopy machine,
the flat glass on the top&amp;mdash;or the flat glass on the top of
a discarded flat-bed scanner&amp;mdash;is a good source for material to grind your own secondary mirror.

==== The Great Parts Scavenger Hunt ====

John Dobson always recommended the eyepieces from old binoculars for the eyepiece of a scope.
(Incidentally, inside that old binocular there are at least four prisms,
all of which are optically good and may be big enough to act as your secondary mirror.
Sometimes you can find just the body of an old binocular and the prisms will still be in there.)

Learn to share! Team up with a friend who also wants to make a telescope and go halves on some of these parts.  
You might also check local swap meets.
See if there is a astronomy group in your area.
If you can befriend an old amateur telescope maker, he or she will have lots of this stuff laying around.
You get involved in this hobby, and the stuff just appears.
In a year or two you have to shovel out a load or you drown in the stuff.

There are sources on the internet for old optical parts.
I have listed a couple at the end of the book,
but searching for used, scrap, or surplus optical parts is an adventure,
and can yield a lot of good usable stuff, cheap.
The best thing to do is just keep your eyes open and your needs list at hand.

Lastly, get to know the owner of your local glass shop.
Cut-off bits of thicker window glass can be ground flat and used for a secondary mirror.
You can start with a simple rectangular mirror now and upgrade to a better-shaped secondary later
when you find one.
In a way it is kind of like your first bicycle or car or whatever.
You get it, and get it going, and make it better over time.

We will make the mounts for the mirrors as well as the focuser assembly  from scrap and scratch.
Keep an eye out for popsicle sticks, tinkertoys, big roundish plastic or wood things like bucket or barrel lids.
We use small springs, maybe an inch or so long, to isolate the main mirror.
Motorcycle clutch springs are great and are usually thrown away when they are replaced
(ask at your local motorcycle dealer).
Glue, tape, and cardboard: watch for cardboard of all sorts from cereal boxes to refrigerator boxes.
White plastic buckets such as restaurants get bulk food in, or contractors use for paint and mortar.
One or two of those are enough.
Toilet paper tubes, paper-towel tubes, the big tubes used to deliver carpeting or vinyl flooring.
Christmas wrapping-paper roll tubes.
Plastic plumbing pipes for sink drains: these are usually 1.5 inches or 1.25 inches inside diameter.
The 1.25 inch ones are better but either will work as an eyepiece tube.
Old plastic vacuum cleaner pipes.
You can skip ahead to the chapters on tube design and focuser design to get some idea of
how these parts will be used; then keep an eye open for them.
Much of this is considered trash or recycling.
To recycle it into a telescope is, I think, the highest purpose.

==== About Grit ====

Grit is a material that is harder than the glass from which the mirror is made.
It is used to grind the surface of the mirror to shape it and make it optically smooth.
Think of the grit on sandpaper; that is what we are after.
(But sandpaper itself is not a good source of grit for our use.)
You can use fine sand or black sand but you will use a lot.
The harder and more irregular the grit the less you will use and the less time you will spend grinding.

Lapidary suppliers are a source of grit and polish.
Check your local telephone book.
Some industrial-supply houses have sand blasting grit, and that can be used.
I have purchased or salvaged worn out and broken grinding wheels and crushed them up to make grit to grind with.
You want loose grit, as it cuts by rolling around between the surfaces of the mirror and the tool.
Old-timers have used iron filings and washed sand.  Under the microscope the coarse grits look like little sharp round rocks. The oxide types of grit are rusts from various metals. They look like little plates and cut by shearing.

If you search the internet you will find suppliers for grit and polish.
I have listed a couple of sources below.
You will need some 120,
some 220 (I get this as a blend of 120/220),
some 300 to 400 grit,
some aluminum oxide or micron grit and some cerium oxide for polish.
The 120 and 220 are for coarse grinding to remove irregularities form the pie plate bottom.
The 300 - 400 and aluminum oxide are to smooth it out for polishing.
And the cerium oxide is for polishing.
You will need a pound or better of the coarse and half a pound of each of the finer grades.
8 oz of the cerium oxide should be enough.

=== Making the Tool ===

To make the mirror for a telescope we grind an optically perfect surface onto the material chosen to make the mirror.  Simple, huh?
It actually is pretty simple to do.
The physics of the interaction between the mirror and the grinding tool assures us
that one will develop a hole while the other develops a hump.
Lets look at that process.

==== The Grinding Process ====

Take two flat (or nearly-flat) objects of the same size.
Place one on top of the other, with abrasive grit between them.
Now press down and grind the upper against the lower.
The surface that is on top will begin to hollow out or develop a bowl shape.
The surface on the bottom will wear at the edge and develop a high center.
It does this because of the ''stroke'', the ''stroke length'',
and the pressure we apply with our hands.
The longer the stroke the deeper the hole.
Shorter strokes flatten the curve.

We will get into this a bit more later on,
but for now I want you notice that when you grind the mirror&amp;mdash;the upper piece that becomes concave&amp;mdash;you are also grinding the tool, the lower piece.
The action of the grind shapes both,
and this is exactly what we want to have happen.
As the grind progresses mirror and tool become a perfect match.
This interaction gives you several indications of how the grind is going.
The sound of the grind,
the feel of the interaction between mirror and tool under your hand,
the bubble pattern that develops between the two surfaces,
are all indicators and you will learn to monitor them as you grind.

The tool will become the base for the polishing lap, the final stage of grinding.
How well you shape the tool will affect how easy or hard it is to create the lap.

==== Base and Grinding Surface ====

Tradition is to get two disks of glass the same diameter and grind.
The top one becomes the mirror, the bottom one becomes the tool.
That doesn't work with pie dishes: a pie dish makes a good mirror but not a good tool.
Fortunately the tool does not have to be an optical surface;
it just needs to be a tool.
Its surface must be durable enough to survive the grind,
but must be soft enough to accept shaping by the grind.
A tool is easy to make and that is what I recommend for the first mirror.  

The simplest way to make a tool is to cast one out of some material.
Plaster is cheap and will work to make a tool.
You must be sure to seal it against water,
as the water will soften the plaster and cause it to fail.
Concrete is more durable and as easy to work as plaster;
so is tile grout mix.
Ceramic clay can be shaped and fired and used for a tool.
You can use wood for the tool if you can match the curve of the glass pretty close.

The reason that all of these various materials will work is because you use them
only to form the base of the tool.
When the base is ready, we glue a grinding surface to the base.
The grinding surface is what gets shaped, and this too can be made of many things.

Probably the easiest material to use for the grinding surface is broken glass.
Ceramic tiles can be used, as can washers, pennies, flattened marbles, decorative stones.
Each will respond to the grind, each will grind in a particular way.
Any of them are a valid choice.

My favorite tool is cast plaster or concrete, with broken glass glued on to form the grinding surface.
That is the one I am going to discuss in the greatest detail but it is not the only way to make a tool.

Your finished tool should match the curve of the pie plate pretty closely
and should allow you to attach a grinding surface.
It should be roughly the same size as the pie plate bottom,
but if it is a bit smaller that is not an issue.
If it is bigger than the mirror, it will make a flatter curve and increase the focal length.
if it is substantially smaller, say half the diameter, it will work but will require you to be very vigilant while grinding.

Grinding, as you will see, is a wet process.
If the tool absorbs water, that can interfere with the final stage when we adhere a coat of pitch to it.
That is why I use glue and glass.
The glue between the tool base and the grinding surface provides a barrier that prevents moisture
from getting to the pitch adhesion zone and the glass does not absorb water.

BUT! you do not have to make a tool.
A ring is a section of any sphere larger that the ring.
You can prove this to yourself by putting a ring against a larger sphere.
The open end of a can, the mouth of a jar, the end of a pipe, these are all rings.
Get a ring and hold it against a ball, a light bulb, the inside of the pie plate.
You will find that the ring sits easily against the sphere.
The reason I bring this up is that you can use a ring for your tool,
at least in the coarser stages.
So you could do a lot of the initial grinding with an old soup can, and that is a very valid thing to do.
You will still need a larger tool for  later but to get started you could use a ring.

==== Preparations ====

So! if you chose a pie plate to use for the mirror and if you decide to make a tool right now,
get two and break one up for glass for the tool.
Please! Use sense and do this in a safe way!
Do not just grab a hammer and hit the plate, scattering glass around the shop (and perhaps into your eye). 
Wrap the sacrificial dish in a sturdy paper bag  and
put it in the bottom of a container or box.
'''''Put on eye protection and gloves'''''.
Strike the wrapped plate with a heavy object.
Wearing gloves, carefully open the bag.
Pick out and set aside flat pieces of roughly 1-inch size (2cm and up).
Irregular shapes are fine.
If there are larger or angled pieces, wrap them up and hit them again.
Finally, sweep the working area thoroughly and dispose of all the small slivers,
crumbs, and unusable bits in a safe way so they cannot injure anyone else.

==== Casting the Base ====

You can cast a tool base using concrete, plaster, grout mix, or any hard, castable medium.
I make a casting form using 2-inch tape to form a dam around the bottom of the inverted pie plate.

You want a tool base that is at least one inch thick.
Place the pie plate on a hard level surface, bottom up,
and wrap tape around the base to make the form.
Spread a release material&amp;mdash;cooking oil works well&amp;mdash;on the glass and the inside of the tape.
You want a good coat  on all surfaces but not a flood.

Now mix up the casting material and pour it into the mold created by the tape ring on the pie plate.
Let the casting harden and then peel off the tape.
You should be able to separate the casting from the pie plate with a bit of pressure.
If it does not want to come apart, tap the side of the casting with a light mallet of some kind,
a short piece of wood works well,
all the way around the perimeter and push on the casting while bracing the pie place against something.
If you got a good coating of oil on the glass the casting will pop off.

The casting will have a raised edge due to the curve of the surface on the pie plate where the side joins the bottom.
Youl need to remove that raised edge.
You can grind it off with a wood rasp or just rub it against a curb or the sidewalk.
If your casting material is too hard to grind you can chip it off with a hammer,
but you need to get that raised edge off, leaving a flat or bevelled edge.

Now finish and seal the top surface of the tool where you will attach the grinding surface
with a thin layer of epoxy glue.

==== The Grinding Surface ====

You need a tool base, cast or shaped,
carved or whatever and some glue to attach the grinding surface onto the base.
I like 5 minute or 15 minute epoxy glue.
The cost is reasonable and it will glue just about anything to anything.

Prepare your grinding surface material.
If you are using glass pieces make sure they are all in one place and ready to be glued on.
If you are using washers or pennies, flattened marbles, or chunks of ceramic tile,
make sure you have enough to cover the tool. 
The grinding material should all be the same thickness,
no mixing of obvious thick and thin pieces!

If you are using a ring to grind you are done.  Skip down to the grinding section in making the mirror.

The tool base is the same basic shape as your mirror and should be a match for the tool.
If you made a cast tool base it is already a good fit to the mirror.
If not, you can take the flat material you are going to use for a tool base,
the disk of wood or the bottom of a pan,
or even that big round candle base,
and make it fit a bit closer.

Get a piece of plastic sheeting (heavy plastic wrap will work, as will plastic bags)
and cut a piece that will cover the tool base with some overhang.
Remember! the tool base should be about the same diameter as the pie plate bottom.
Get a tube of epoxy glue and squeeze it all out into the middle of the base.
Mix it well and then cover it with the plastic sheeting.
Now take the pie plate and press it down onto the plastic-covered glob of glue.
This will cause the glue to be flattened and squeezed out over the surface of the base.
Rock and slide the pie plate around on the plastic to spread the glue under it so
that it covers the surface of the base and takes on the curve of the pie plate.
I squoosh it around until the base is covered and then I center the pie plate
and press down pretty hard to make the hump shape.
Then pick the pie plate straight up.

Leave the plastic in place and let the glue harden.
Once the glue has hardened you can peel off the plastic and
you will have a hump on the tool that matches the pie plate curve pretty close.

Next, mix up some more epoxy, enough to spread a thin layer over the working face of your tool.
Into the glue set the pieces of the grinding surface.
You can have spaces between the pieces;
just cover the tool as densely as you can,
and make sure it is all well glued down.
Place the pieces so there are no high edges sticking up.

The tool is ready. Let's grind!

=== Making the Primary Mirror ===

==== The Grind ====

Everyone talks about grinding mirrors, but very few do it.
Grinding takes patience, dedication and a desire for perfection.
I have all three but I have never made a perfect mirror.
Some people have.
Mel Bartels has made several perfect mirrors,
as has Jerry Oltion of TrackBall fame.
Don't let &quot;perfect&quot; scare you, &quot;average&quot; works well.

When you start with a pie plate,
the hardest part of the grinding process, the basic curve, is already done.
(That saggitta that I have hammered on all the way to this point.)
All you need to do is smooth the glass and make the curve regular.
Take the pie plate and aim its bottom at a bright light and refect that light onto a surface.
For example, take it outdoors on a sunny day and reflect the sun onto a wall.
Move the dish toward and away from the wall and see if you can tell where it is most focussed;
it should be at about the focal length you computed earlier.
You will probably see a somewhat focussed, but scattered, amorphous blob of light.
That is because even though the surface is curved,
it is irregular and covered with high and low zones.
You will grind the high zones down till they equal the low zones,
and then polish the glass.
It is really very easy to do, physics is on our side.
When we are done the surface will be optically smooth.

Grinding can be done with the tool on top, (TOT),
or the mirror on top, (MOT).
The position of the mirror and the length of the stroke will change the resulting curve of the glass.
Long strokes deepen the curve, short strokes flatten the curve.
MOT is more apt to deepen the curve, while TOT tends to flatten the curve.
These are general statements about the interaction of the mirror and the tool,
but the interaction is there and you should be aware of it.
Long strokes deepen;
short strokes flatten.

A maintenance stroke, one that doesn't really change the curve but just works the glass,
is a 1/3rd diameter, center over center stroke.
Center over center means just that:
the center of the tool passes over the center of the mirror, or fairly close to it.
The 1/3rd part means a stroke with a total length of 1/3rd the diameter of the mirror.
If you were to measure that stroke you would measure it at the center.
In practice we guage the stroke by how far we overhang the edge of the bottom piece, tool or mirror.
Since the total stroke should be 1/3rd the diameter of the blank, (the pie plate),
you overhang by half that at each end of the stroke.
Say that our pie plate is about 7 and 3/8ths inches across on the bottom.
One-third that diameter is about 2 and 1/2 inches,
so you will overhang on each end of the stroke by 1 and 1/4 inches.
Push away from you, and the piece on top should overhang by 1 and 1/4 inches when you stop.
Pull back towards youself till you have that same overhang, and stop.
That is one stroke.

In practice the strokes vary greatly, maybe as little as an inch of overhang,
maybe as much as two inches.
Don't sweat it.
That irregularity will produce a very good surface, maybe a perfect one.
Just go for an average of an inch and a quarter and grind.
&quot;Less talk, more work,&quot; as John Dobson would say.

==== The Grinding Zone ====

[[Image:Grinding_Zone.PNG|center|500px|alt=basic grinding board|A basic grinding board setup]]

The basic grinding zone is a surface to put the mirror and tool on,
some towels for cushion and cleanup,
water and grit.

If you are working indoors you should have a bucket of water
to rinse the mirror and tool in.
If you are outside, you can spray them off with a hose.
John Dobson likes to work on a board placed over two buckets.
He can sit on one end and grind on the other.
I like the top of the washing machine because it is the right height for me,
and it is heavy enough that it won't move when I grind.
Some folks use a bench or table for the surface.
The main concern is that the work surface be durable, easy to clean and should not move or shift when you grind on top of it.

It should also be comfortable, as the work of grinding is taxing enough with out adding body contortions to it.
When I use the washing machine top I have a board that sits on top of the machine,
and the work is on top of that board.
A board is a good thing in that it allows me to pick up the whole mess and move it to storage when I am not grinding.
I also put two stops on the board to keep the mirror or tool from moving around (as shown in the diagram).

==== Grinding Begins ====

Prepare your tool, some medium-coarse grit (120 is good) and some water.
Since we are going to maul the surface with tool and grit,
you can start with the pie plate on the bottom and the tool on top.
This will use the grit efficiently and there is plenty of grinding ahead to correct errors.
Splash a little water into the curve of the pie plate, and add a good pinch of grit,
enough to make a little hump about an inch in diameter and half an inch high.
You can put your grit into a shaker of some sort
so you can shake it on like salt,
or keep it in a jar and dip it out with a spoon.

Put the tool on top; push away; pull back.
There is a nice soft gravelly sound and you have done one stroke!

You are going to work your way around the circumference of the mirror making strokes.
You should rotate the tool a bit too.
The classic instruction is to take a step to the left and rotate the tool to the right after each stroke.

As you work the two surfaces together, the gravelly sound will diminish.
When the noise is very soft you have finished one ''wet''.
A ''wet'' runs from the first stroke to the next charge of fresh grit.
Push the tool away and lift it off of the mirror in one movement.
Add a bit of water and some more grit;
put the tool down gently; and grind some more.

After three or four wets, rinse the tool and the mirror with water.
Then put them back on the board, TOT, and start grinding again.

The grit wears down as it cuts the glass.
When it is fresh, the grit is dark gray, almost black, and it sparkles.
When it is used up it is very pale, almost white, and looks like mud.
The color change is due to the introduction of glass dust into the water/grit mix.
If there is a coating of mud on the glass, the grit won't cut well, and you need to rinse. 

==== The Coarse Grind ====

[[Image:Grinding_Effects.PNG|center|400px|alt=basic grinding example|An example of how the grind spreads]]

As you cut away the high spots, zones of ground glass spread across the surface.
This is a good thing; it shows where the high and low spots are.
It also gives us a ready made grinding gauge to check our progress.
Initially the grind will go slow and your tool will be rough to push,
catching and jerking as you do your strokes.
This is because the tool and glass of the pie plate do not match well.
As you grind the two surfaces together they will wear and the strokes will become smoother, more consistent.

As you grind the clear glass will give way to frosted glass.
That frosted surface is smooth and soon enough you will polish it.
In all the pie plates I have done there are always two final little clear spots, opposite each other,
that seem to take forever.
First one will disappear, then the other one will go away and you will have a perfectly smooth surface.
The reason it takes so long is you are removing glass from the whole surface to get down to the bottom of those two zones.
As deep as it looks, it is a very small percentage of the overall thickness of the glass bottom.

==== The Medium Grind ====

When the last clear spot is about the size of a dime, about 1/2 inch in diameter,
I switch to the medium grit.
For me that is 400 or 500 grit.
I grind with that grit until the last clear spot is gone.
Now I'm ready for the fine grind.

Keep your strokes full diameter; resist the urge to scrub one spot.
That will make a hole that will take a lot more work to get rid of.
You do not need to press down hard,
just a light pressure or, if the tool is heavy enough, just use the weight of the tool will do.
Push it back and forth with nice long strokes, 1/3rd center over center.
Rotate the tool, and rotate the pie plate the opposite direction, or walk around it so you are on a different diameter.

One stroke a second is plenty fast enough,
one every two seconds is better.
We all have an inborn rhythm and if yours is too fast then time yourself.
I really get to moving sometimes, and to slow myself down I will chant:
&quot;''One'' one thousand&quot; as I push away; &quot;''Two'' one thousand&quot; as I pull towards myself.

There is no need to be precise in your movements, just consistent.
The randomness of your strokes and constant rotation will create a perfect optical surface.

Just to give you an idea of where you are and what you are doing:
at the end of your medium grind, if you have been consistent, the two surfaces will match to within one ten-thousandth of an inch.
That means they will be a perfect pair to within 0.0001 of an inch.
Good stuff, but by the time you polish it out you will be working to within a millionth of an inch,
and in ''figuring'' (final optical correction) you will be moving fractions of a wavelength of light!

&quot;Grinding is caveman work. Work hard, eat well sleep well,&quot; says John Dobson.

==== The Fine Grind ====

The fine grind is more of the same,
but we use a different agent.
We will switch to Aluminum Oxide.
This looks like flour or powdered sugar, but it is a very hard, very fine abrasive.
If you cannot find Aluminum Oxide, Tripoli will work but it cuts slower.
Aluminum Oxide comes in several grades but for our purposes 25 micron or 12 micron is what we need.
If you use 25 micron, extend your wets, make them longer, and use plenty of water.
Add a table spoon or two every few minutes.
If you use 12 micron it will wear out quicker, so you will change it more often.

Rinse both the tool and the pie plate between each wet.
The aluminum oxide will make a nice froth at the edge of the tool.
The stroke will be very smooth, almost silent.
Stay slow, resist the urge to speed up.
Don't press down hard on the tool or the pie plate, use gentle pressure.
Harder pressure will gain nothing and may cause later problems.

If you are using a full size tool you can work MOT every other wet.
If you are using a ring, stay with TOT but you need to start thinking about a full size tool
on which you can build the polishing lap.

You grind with the Aluminum Oxide until the surface looks smooth and has a fine matte finish.
You should be able to read a newspaper through the glass, not only the headlines but the regular print.
Take the pie plate out into the sun or use a very bright light and
examine the ground surface.
Look at it from the edge, rotate it and look again.
If you have a small magnifying glass, look at the surface with that.

What you are looking for is sparkles.
If a big bright sparkle of light shows up in the matte surface you should grind more.
The sparkles are tiny pits.
You can grind them out but you cannot polish them out.
Grind as long as you need to in order to remove the sparkles.

A wet of fine grinding may last several minutes,
maybe as much as ten minutes, and include maybe a couple of hundred strokes.
It is hard to say how long the fine grind will last,
as it depends on you and your technique, but I would expect to use at least an hour, maybe two or three.
When the mirror surface is uniform and free of sparkles, we can polish.

===  Polishing ===

The mirror is polished using a different tool: a _lap_. A lap is a tool covered with a layer of deformable, pliable material. Some telescope makers claim that it is pliable because as you polish the mirror the surface changes are very fine and the lap changes accordingly through pressure. Others say this is not true, rather that a lap is covered with a soft material to trap the grit and shave the glass through pressure. A third group says the polishing occurs not due to shaving the glass but through melting the glass through pressure. One book will say pitch is the only stuff  for the lap surface; another will say asphalt; another claims paper works. Some say soft cork, beeswax, or paraffin wax.

Well, the lap is really not that complex. Lets talk a bit about the polishing process and then I will tell you how to make a lap.

==== Polishing: Contact, Pressure, and Drag ====

Polishing is the last step in preparing the mirror surface. The surface is rendered optically smooth and is shaped to bring all the light to one point of focus. The action that takes place between the lap and the glass is a rubbing action. Up to this point we have been moving the glass over the tool with a grit between them. The grit tumbled along between the two surfaces, chipping off little bits of glass as it rolled along. Now we want the grit to stay in one place and just scrape the high points off. To do this we have to trap the grit and hold it in contact with the glass. If everything is in balance there is a constant drag between the two surfaces when we make our polishing strokes and that is what we want.

A common word found in the various arguments about laps is _pressure_. A second word seen is _contact_. Pressure helps to bring the polish up. Good contact polishes the surface uniformly. Pressure and contact together produce the sensation of _drag_, which is an indicator of the polishing taking place. So the material of which the lap is made should be able to handle pressure and keep good contact. Any material that can do this will make a usable lap. Some material, like pitch or wax, is more forgiving than harder materials, but that does not mean they are the only materials. Asphalt will work but you have to use a different approach to the polishing. Paper will work, as will rubber or soft, smooth, fine-grained cork.

One last thing, is the final shape of the mirror. The curve that best focuses the light of a telescope mirror is the parabola. This curve is a bit flatter than the sphere. Right now, if you have been consistent in your grinding, the shape of the mirror surface is spherical, more or less. There are two ways to change that into the parabolic shape. You can polish the middle of the glass a bit deeper and then blend the two curves, or you can flatten the existing curve a bit by polishing the edges a bit more. A rigid unmoving lap will polish the edges first and the center last. A softer, formable material will usually polish the middle first and the edges last. So the lap material will affect how you finish you mirror as it will affect how the polish is worked across the surface of the glass.

==== The Lap Tool ====

If you have been using a full-size tool, you continue to use that tool as a base for the lap. You will be covering its surface with lap material. Because it has been ground to a close fit with the mirror, you will be able to use any lap material including paper.

If you have been using a ring to grind the mirror, it is time to set that tool aside. You will have to make a tool backer the full diameter of the mirror to support the lap. This can be a flat disk of plywood, or you could cast a tool (as we discussed under [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Telescope_Making#Making_the_Tool|Making the Tool]]). Because this tool has not been ground into a perfect fit to the mirror, you will not be able to use a paper lap. You will have to use a pliable material such as pitch.

==== Lap Materials ====

===== Pitch =====

Pitch is the first choice for a soft lap. You can harvest it yourself if you have conifer trees: go into the forest and pick globs of pitch off the trees. Or search for &quot;pine rosin for sale&quot; online.

To clean natural pitch, you melt it and strain it. To melt pitch, place it in a metal container in a water bath. Put a pan of cool water onto a heat source. Put something in the bottom to hold the melting container up off of the pan bottom: a metal trivet, or even a handful of clean gravel. Now stand the pitch container in the pan of warming water and let the heat of the water melt the lap material. Start another container of water heating up. As the level in your water bath falls, top it up with the hot water from the second container. A temperature of 100ºC is ample to melt all kinds of pitch. However it can take a while to melt the material, maybe an hour, so be patient and watch the material. When the pitch is runny, put it through the strainer. (The strainer that you use will never be usable again, so think disposable.)

The pitch should be hard when it cools, but not too hard. The hardness of the pitch depends on the proportion of volatile materials in it. To test the pitch, press on the surface of the cooled pitch with your thumbnail. If it takes longer than a minute to leave an impression, or if you can't dent it, the pitch is too hard. Warm it back up and thoroughly mix in a teaspoon of turpentine. Let the pitch cool and test again. Repeat as needed.

If the pitch dents easily and immediately, it needs to be harder. Bring it again to the temperature of boiling water and stir for a few minutes. You should be able to smell the volatile chemicals coming off the pitch. Cool it again and test it; it should be harder. Repeat as needed. A good pitch will take about 30 to 40 seconds to dent when you press into the surface with your thumb nail.

Pitch is sticky and adheres to surfaces and clothing. To clean it off skin, use baby oil and warm water. To clean it from surfaces use turpentine or nail-polish remover.

===== Other Soft Materials =====

If you do not have pitch, beeswax will work very well. Paraffin wax will work but will require greater attention to contact. I would not use sealing wax or crayons; the coloring in them will scratch the mirror. I mentioned asphalt earlier but I have never used it so I cannot advise you on its use. There may be some web resources on using asphalt for the lap. The different materials respond differently to heat but they do not need to be bubbly, runny hot. They only need to stick to the tool backer and be soft enough to shape with pressure.

==== Pouring the Lap ====

To make the lap you will need either your full sized tool or another backer to support the material. You will need glue and paper, a pot, and your pitch or wax or asphalt. You will need 2 pans to hold water so you can melt the lap material. You will need a stick to stir with and one to press in some lap channels. (The wooden stirring sticks sold at paint stores will do nicely.)

Take your tool backer and make sure the surface is clean and dry. If you are using your grinding tool, wash it, dry it well and dust it off with a stiff brush. Take a strip of paper, or a piece of tape, and wrap it around the top perimeter of the tool backer to form a dam. This so you can pour the lap material onto the tool and it will not run off of the edge. The dam should be about 1-2 inch or 12mm high. If you used paper for the dam secure the end with a bit of tape or something sticky. A bit of egg white will work, or some liquid glue. Make sure the strip is tight around the tool.

Heat the lap material as described above. When it gets gooey and pourable (but not runny) you are ready to pour the lap. You can stir the lap material and check the consistency with a clean stick. If you are making the lap on a flat backer, pour a bit of the softened material onto the center of the backer and let it firm up. It should not cover the backer, just the middle. This will give you a bit more thickness in the middle where you need it.

While you are waiting for the lap material to soften get your mirror ready. It plays a significant role in making the lap. Have it nearby and put one drop of dish washing detergent or a teaspoon of soapy water in the middle of the mirror. To this add a pinch of polishing grit, Cerium Oxide or Tin Oxide or Tripoli, whatever you decided to use (See [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Telescope_Making#About_Grit|About Grit]]. Now use your fingers and spread this watery paste all over the mirror surface. Add more water or polish as necessary. You should have a slighly muddy slurry all over the surface of the mirror.

When the lap material is ready, pour it onto the tool backer. Pour onto the middle and let it run to edge. The paper dam will stop it and the material will begin to fill the surface of the tool. When you are near the top of the paper dam stop pouring and let the material settle. Now wait and test. Smear the polishing slurry around on the mirror surface with your fingers and then touch the surface of the lap. You will leave finger prints in the material. You want the material to be stiff enough that finger prints form but remain and not fill in. If they fill in, wait, smear the polish around on the mirror and test again. The reason you keep smearing the polish around is that it puts a coat of polish and water on your fingers so the pitch or wax doesn't stick to them. And it keeps the mirror ready for the next step.

==== Shaping the Soft Lap ====

Once the lap remains dented when you test with your finger prints remove the paper dam. Do it quickly and it will come off in one piece, like pulling off an adhesive bandage. Now put the mirror on top of the lap and just smear it around. Push it all over the lap. You are shaping the top of the lap to match the curve of the glass. Be quick and then lift the mirror off. The whole shaping step should only take about 30 seconds at most.

Take a stick and press it into the lap to form shallow channels. Hold it by the ends and push down into the lap material. Start at the middle and make 3 or 5 channels across the lap, one in the middle and one or two on each side of the middle one. Now turn the lap about 90 degrees and make some cross channels. The lap should now have a grid, a checker board, look. Take the mirror and press it onto the lap and smear it around. If the mirror looks dry add more water and polish and press the lap. Work consistently but don't get into a frenzy; you have time. Try to keep the channels open with the stick and press and rub the mirror across the surface of the lap to form it.

When the lap is firm but warm, put a good coating of polish and water and soap on the mirror and set it on top of the lap, centered on the lap. Pour the pie pan full of water and just let it sit there. The weight of the water in the mirror will shape the lap to a perfect match. This is a trick we will use to keep the lap in trim as we polish, press then polish.

If the lap is hard but you didn't get a good shape, if there remain obvious low spots, warm the lap again. Put the partly-formed lap and tool into a large container and pour in warm water to cover the lap. Let it sit for a few minutes and test the surface with your thumbnail. When it dents easily pull the lap out and shape it with the mirror. Repeat as necessary. Always have a good slurry of polish and water on the mirror before you put it on the lap.

==== The Paper Lap ====

Soft pourable material would use the process described above. But what if you want to use paper? Paper requires a tool base that has a perfect match to the mirror. If you used a full size tool to grind the mirror, it has that match. This process is used for a dry polish.

Take a piece of heavy paper and cut a circle out of it that is as big as the tool. You can use a large paper bag or heavy printer paper. Newspaper is too thin and flimsy. Spread a thin layer of glue, egg white works well here as does wheat paste, over the tool and press the paper on top. Smooth it out from the middle, pressing all the bubbles out the edge. Make sure it is glued from edge to edge. When the glue has dried, rough up the surface of the paper a little bit with a stiff brush or very fine sand paper. Then using your fingers spread an even coat of dry polish all over the paper surface.

Smooth cork will work the same way but it should be very thin. Rubber will work but it is hard to get a good bond and the polish will not always stick to the rubber.

Time to polish!

==== Final Fine Grind ====

We are shifting techniques. The stroke is the same but because we are using a powdery grit and a tool with a softer surface, the glass will be planed smooth, as opposed to the chipping tumbling action we have used up to this point. Because of this we need to press down a bit harder, put more pressure on the surfaces, to get a consistent action. I have mentioned drag a couple of times but now I want to explore this idea in a bit more detail.

When the two surfaces, the mirror and the tool, match very well the entire area of both surfaces is in good contact. Because they are not smooth there is a friction between them, and this friction causes drag as the two surfaces move past each other. The greater the pressure the stronger the drag. This translates to a smooth consistent resistance to pushing or pulling the mirror across the surface of the tool.

If you have poor contact, the mirror will skip and jump. Consistent drag will be absent. The other problem that can make drag inconsistent is that you do not put a consistent pressure on the mirror and the polishing action becomes irregular. Maybe you push down harder as you push away, so the glass under the heel of your hand will work more than the glass on the leading edge. This can round edges or dig out the middle. So drag is a constant tactile measure of the quality of the polishing action.

With a pliable lap, if the contact degrades you can press the two surfaces, cold press the lap, and regain your contact. Hard laps of paper etc. need to be stripped and replaced if you lose contact.

We have about an hour or two of fine grinding left to do before the polishing starts. We are going to work the mirror on top from now on. The glass of a pie plate is too thin to do this work mirror on the bottom. One good thing about having the mirror on top is we can fill the pie plate with weight and gain more consistent pressure as we work. In fact, you can just load the pie plate and move it back and forth, never pushing down on it, and get an excellant polish. If you are working with a pitch type of lap, fill the pie plate with water before your start your strokes. If you are working on a paper type lap that would absorb spilled water, place a bag of sand or some other granular weight into the pie plate.

The grit of choice for the fine grind is the Aluminum Oxide or Tin Oxide, both of which are referred to by size. For our purposes we will use 25 micron for the fine grind and save the Cerium Oxide for later. If you don't have a 25 micron grit, you can use the Cerium Oxide. The fine grind will take a while to work but it can be done.

For polishing we use Cerium Oxide. The particles of a polishing grit are planar, not lumpy. There are two schools of thought on using these planar grits, dry application versus slurry. In a dry application the pitch lap is wetted and the grit is sprinkled on dry and rubbed with your fingers until it has absorbed the water. Now the mirror surface is wetted and polishing strokes begin. In the slurry method a container is charged with water and grit and stirred to create a slurry. This slurry is spread on the mirror or the lap and polishing commences. I like the slurry technique myself: one step and I have water and gritr. A paper lap is charged dry and worked dry. Just sprinkle the grit on and spread it with your fingers, then start polishing.

Put the lap on the work surface and _charge it_, that is, put some grit on it. Lay the mirror on top and weight the mirror. A polishing stroke is slower than a grinding stroke. Count the cadence. Push away &quot;one-thousand-one.&quot; Pull back &quot;one-thousand-one.&quot; The movement away should take the whole 1001. The pull back should use the whole 1001. Remember to rotate the mirror slightly as you stroke. Push. Pull. One wet of polishing can take a full hour before the grit is worn out. How is the drag? It should feel consistent, smooth, resistive. If the glass is gliding, not dragging, you have too much grit or water or both on the lap. Speed up for a while till the drag increases; then slow down. Every now and then you should turn the lap a bit, this will prevent astigmatism in the mirror shape. Working on a lap is hard work and you will spend as much time polishing as you did grinding to the point you could polish.

When the drag begins to reduce, or you get tired, push the mirror away and lift it off the lap. This is easier if you are using paper as you can remove the weight before you lift off the mirror. With water you have to lift the whole thing and dump the water. Rinse the mirror and dry it and look at the surface. It should be markedly smoother, perhaps a bit shiny. Your goal in fine grinding at this point is to grind the surface smooth enough that you can read a news paper through the frosted glass. It takes about an hour of work to progress to the next grit size, so be prepared to put in at least an hour of final fine grinding before you switch to the polish.

==== The Polish ====

To switch to polishing you need to clean everything. If you are using a paper lap it is time to peel off the existing piece of paper and glue on a new piece. Remember to rough it up a bit before you charge it. Once you have charged it try some strokes, how is the drag? If it feels pretty good, load on the weight and start polishing. If not you may have to put a new paper on. Make sure you use the same kind of paper you used on the first lap. If you still lack contact try building up the lap a bit by rubbing some parafin wax on it. Then put some more polish on top of the wax. You should be able to get contact with some work using these two techniques. If not, you may have to make a pitch lap.

With a pitch lap, scrub it well with a soft brush under tepid water, more cool than hot. Make sure the channels are in good shape. Make a thick slurry of Cerium Oxide and water and smear this onto the lap and the mirror. Put the mirror onto the lap and fill it with warm water. Keep it on there for at least an hour, occasionally moving it around like you did when you made the lap. You are forcing contact and charging the lap all in one stroke. After an hour you can start to do polishing strokes. How is the drag? How does it feel? If the contact feels good go ahead and polish. If it is slipping, jerky, let it press some more.

There is really not much more I can tell you. Just polish. As you do the mirror surface will get shinier and the reflectivity will increase. When you think it is polished out, polish for another hour and then check with your magnifying glass. Use a harsh light at an oblique angle, that will make the hazy areas jump right out. You want no haze, period. No little glints, no fuzzy zones. The middle might be polished but the edge is probably still fuzzy. The mirror surface should be as clear and clean as the sides of the pie plate. You can polish out a pie plate in 8 hours or so, although your first one may take 20 hours. You are learning how to polish so you are really doing two things at once, polishing and learning to polish. You don't have to do it all at once. An hour a day over two weeks will polish that glass and give you breathing time in between. Slow and steady, count the cadence, polish!

===   Figuring the Mirror ===

_Figuring_ is that time in the process of grinding a mirror when you adjust the curve of the mirror so that all of the light it collects will come to a tight focus. At least that is the goal. The strokes used to figure the mirror are essentially the same strokes you have been using to polish the mirror. They are a little longer, the sweep side to side is a bit wider, but you will be rubbing the mirror over the tool with that same measured cadence that got you to this point.

The difference is that when you figure the mirror you monitor and measure your progress by looking at the surface and testing the focus and then determine what you will polish to correct the errors you have seen. That is why figuring is also called _correcting_ the mirror. Initially we will look for gross correction and gross errors. Once you have done those checks you will need to make a decision about how you will test and monitor the correction. That decision will determine your next steps and the equipment you will need to build or borrow. Lets do some testing.

Does the mirror come to a focus? Even as polished clear glass your mirror will reflect light. Polished glass will reflect around 5% of the light that strikes it. We can use this to test for focus and quality of focus. The simplest test is to hold the mirror under an overhead light and look at the reflection. Is it a spot? Is there detail associated with the reflection? Can you see the printing on the light bulb, in the reflection? The sun also works for this, as will the full moon; you just need a target to focus the reflection on. Another reflection test can be done with a portable light, like a flashlight or torch, in a dark hall. Place a flat surface of some type next to the light. You will use this for a target. Try to reflect the light onto the target. Once again look at the quality of the image. How much detail can you see?

A better test involves using the view of what is outside an open window or door while inside a darkened room. You will need to place the mirror on a steady support so that it reflects the view seen through the opening. You will stand between the mirror and the opening and look for the reflection. Try and put the mirror about eye level as it will make the image easier to find. With the mirror set up to reflect the light from the opening, position yourself closer to the opening than the mirror. Look into the mirror and search for the reflection. The mirror will begin to glow as you get to where the reflection is and then suddenly you will see the view outside the room reflected in the mirror. Stop for a moment and relax. Enjoy the view noting as much detail as you can. As you relax your vision the image will appear to be floating in space. Now for a twist on this test. If you have a simple lens like a magnifying glass you can move towards the floating image and examine it with the lens. How much detail can you see? This is a great test to use on a full moon. You can see the craters. In effect you are using your telescope!

Now to the analysis of what you saw. If the image is fuzzy, that is probably due to the lack of correction; but take the time to examine your polishing job. Is it really complete? If you reflected a round light such as the sun onto a target, but the image was oval, not round, that is  _astigmatism_. If the target was not in a direct line between the mirror and the sun, then it is probably _positional astigmatism. The bigger the angle between the source and the reflection the more astigmatism you will see in the reflection. However, if the image was formed in a pretty direct return line, the mirror itself is astigmatised and you need to drop back to fine grinding to straighten it out.

How about the dark room reflection? I do this test in a room where there is a tree outside the door. I find the floating image of tree leaves. When I look at the image with a little magnifier I can usually see the veins in the leaves if the mirror is pretty good. What did you see? Now put it all away and do the tests again later or even tomorrow. You are teaching yourself how to look at reflections and make some quality decisions. Let your eyes rest and think about what you saw. Write down your observations so you can refer to them later and see if anything changed. If you did the test during the day, do another test at night using distant lights, or the stars or the moon. Write down what you see and compare notes, then act. Test a lot and work a little, that is how to approach it.

If reflections that should be a little circle of light are always oval, then the mirror is astigmatised. This means there are two curves on the surface, not just one. This usually happens because you did not rotate the mirror enough while grinding, but it is also caused by flexing the glass, pushing down too hard. Go back to the 400/500 grit level and grind till the surface is frosted. Don't push so hard when you do grind; just use a little bit of pressure. I had this problem a lot when I first started to grind pie pans. Then I started to use a bit of water in the pie pan and then just pushed it back and forth under its own weight, and no more astigmatism. Do this regrind with the mirror on top and then work your way back to polished.

If the reflections looked pretty good, but were hairy or fuzzy, that could be poor correction, but it could also be a turned edge. If everything else looked good then we need to move to a more delicate test. If everything looks good, no fuzzyness, good detail, then we just need to see how good the surface looks.

====  Testing and Ronchi Testers  ====

There are a few ways to do a detail test on the mirror surface each involving their own technology. Of these there are two that can be done with little in the way of equipment and the results are very good. One is a star test; the other is the Ronchi test. Both have their strengths and their weaknesses. The Ronchi test will show an over-all surface condition. The star test proves correct figure. I do both, but you can do either or even some other test that you find on the internet. It comes down to the tools and materials you have and your environment. Here in the Pacific Northwest we have very few stars in the winter.

Either test will require some equipment be constructed. To do the star test you will need to build the rest of your telescope: the tube, the mount, the secondary mirror. You have to build these parts anyway, so this gives you a little more incentive. Build the scope and then test the mirror.

The Ronchi test requires a Ronchi tester but these are very easy to build. In fact you can build a simple ronchi tester into an eyepiece and test through the focuser of your telescope. This is called null testing. Mark VandeWettering has graciously allowed us to post his web page on Ronchi testing here in the book. It is a good primer on the test and I reccomend it. Either way you have reached the end of your mirror work for now. Put it away in a safe clean place and start building your tester.

=== Making the Secondary Mirror ===

== Assembling the Telescope ==

=== The Primary Mirror Cell ===

=== The Secondary Mirror Mount ===

The secondary mirror mount must hold the secondary mirror at the proper position
in the tube and in the optical train.
It must allow for minor adjustments of both of these positions,
and retain the final position without slipping.
The mount is actually made of two parts, a mirror mount and a tube position mount.
There are just a few considerations to think about ..

* Telescope tube size and shape,
* Secondary mirror size and weight,
* Material available,
* What you want to achieve.

The mirror must be held without tension so that the surface is not distorted,
which would impact the image.
Hard adhesive products shrink as they cure and squeeze the glass, which in turn distorts the surface.
Mechanical attachments, clips, rings, etc. must allow the mirror to &quot;float,&quot;
because the differing rates of expansion of the different materials can squeeze or bind the glass.
When you decide what mirror mount to use you should also consider how that mount
will be attached to the tube position part of the assembly,
and how it will be adjusted to get proper collimation of the optical train.

One of the oldest secondary mirror mounts is a simple mechanical mount.
A short piece of tubing, a bit bigger in its diameter than the minor axis of the secondary,
is shaped by cutting one end at a 45 degree angle.
Small L-shaped clips are made and screwed or glued to the outside of the tube to retain the mirror.
The mirror is placed in the tube and cotton balls are loosly packed in behind it to hold it against the clips.
The tube is then capped on the open end to hold the cotton balls in.

[[Image:Secondary_Mirror_Mount_Picture.png|center|frame|alt=end view and side view of a tube holder for a secondary mirror]]

The idea is that the mirror just floats in the tube, which takes all of the stress of mounting.
The mirror is given its  basic orientation, held at the proper angle,
by cutting the end of the tube at 45 degrees and holding the mirror against that plane with cotton balls.
The mirror and the tube have about the same cross sectional area in the light path so additional obstruction is minimal.

This is a very good mount although it can be a bit difficult to make if you are short on tools.
The tubing used can be plastic or metal or cardboard.
You want a tube that is a little oversized so it doesn't squeeze the mirror.
You could make one of these out of a toilet paper tube and it would function well.
The clips could be of thin wood, (popsicle sticks), glued on.
The 45 degree angle on the front end should be as accurate as you can get it
(find someone with a carpenter's mitre box and use that to cut the tube),
but final optical alignment is accomplished with the tube-position part of the mount.
An angle that is a bit off is not a big deal.
This mount is very good for the large secondary mirrors found in larger scopes.

Another type of  mount is made from a simple piece of wood or plastic or even metal.
Take a dowel, or even a square or rectangular piece of material,
that has ends smaller than the secondary mirror.
Cut one end at a 45 degree angle.
Now you can glue the mirror to the 45 degree face and you are done.
Remember that hard adhesives will squeeze the glass as they cure, so use a non-hardening adhesive.
Silicon rubber, also called room temperature vulcanizing rubber, RTV for short,
will hold the mirror but will not squeeze it as it cures.
It also resists temperature changes, so expansion and contraction are not a factor.
It is a spongy material and will buffer the mirror from shocks and changes in the mount.
You should use three small blobs to form the bond,
not one big smooshed-out blob in the middle.
Use some toothpicks or small wood skewers to space the mirror away from the mounting
surface, so that the glass and the mount are not in direct contact, but are held together by 
three blobs of soft adhesive.

Another possible adhesive for this mount is double-sided foam tape.
Get the thickest core you can get.
I use this stuff everywhere on the telescope to mount all sorts of things,
so a roll is a handy thing to have.

You must make sure the cut end of the mount is very smooth.
Sand it off very smooth, and seal it with a layer of nail polish or epoxy.
Now just cut a single piece of the double-sided foam tape,
put it in the middle of the mirror-back, and stick it on the cut face of the mount.
The foam core provides the same sort of mechanical and thermal buffering
that we got with air and rubber and it is much easier to use.  

The danger in using an adhesive-based mount lies in not getting the mirror glued on squarely.
The mirror must have its minor axis perpendicular to the eyepiece for the minimum amount light obstruction.
The simplest way to make sure it is properly lined up on the mount is to make some index marks on the mirror
and the mount prior to gluing.

[[Image:Index_Lines.png|center|frame|alt=shows index lines drawn on the major and minor axes of the mirror back being matched to center lines on a square wood mount to ensure centered mounting.]]

Get a sharp pencil and a ruler.
Lay the secondary mirror face down on a piece of paper.
Lay the ruler edge along the major axis.
Get as close as you can but don't lose sleep over it.
Draw the diameter line for the major axis of the mirror on the back of the mirror.
Now measure the major axis and divide it in half.
Make a mark at the center of the major axis line and use the ruler to draw the diameter line for minor axis through that mark,
as in the drawing above.
Get as close as you can and try to make the intersection of the lines at the middle of the mirror perpendicular to each other.

Now take the piece of material you are using for a mount and draw a straight line one each side of the wood,
as close to the middle of the side as you can.
When you glue or tape the secondary to the mount,
line up the lines on the mirror with the lines on the mount and you will be close enough.

These simple adhesive mounts will work well for smaller mirrors,
the kinds of mirrors we will be using to make a pie pan telescope.
Larger mirrors require a better mount and some form of mechanical mount would be best for those mirrors.
There is a hybrid of these two forms that can be used for big mirrors. 

[[Image:Hybrid_Mount.png|frame|center|alt=diagram of a mirror mount using an oval piece of wood to support the mirror]]

Make an oval that matches the shape of your secondary mirror.
Glue and screw that oval to the mount face, or weld it on if you are using metal.
The oval should be made of good solid material.
You should line it up using index lines, just as you lined up the secondary in the above procedure.
Now glue your secondary mirror to the oval using several small blobs of rubber or several pieces of tape.
The mirror is well attached to the oval by the adhesive,
and the oval is mechanically attached to the mount assembly.
You could add a couple of small clips to the oval to help support the secondary mirror.
Remember, the mount should not pinch or squeeze the mirror.

=== The Tube Position Mount ===

Now that the secondary mirror mount has been made or chosen,
we need a way to place it in the telescope tube.
The secondary mirror should be mounted in the very middle of the tube to catch the focused image from the primary mirror and turn it towards the eyepiece and focuser.
This process is decided more by measuring than anything,
but there are some tricks we can use and there are many ways to position the secondary in the tube.

The first step is to measure the telescope tube diameter inside and outside.
You can do the math and size the mount accordingly, but I like to draw a full size diagram and work from that.
I take a piece of paper at least three or four inches bigger than the outside tube diameter.
Draw lines across the paper from corner to corner using a straight edge.
Where the lines intersect is the middle of the paper.
Now I use a compass to draw a circle as big as the inside diameter of the tube,
or a square if I am using a square tube.
Now I can play with various ideas for mounting the secondary mirror in the tube.
I can get real measurements and understand what I am going to be working on.
Lets talk about some mounts.

The simplest tube mount is a single arm that supports the secondary mirror mount at the right place in the tube.
The arm is usually attached to the tube near the focuser hole, or on the opposite side.
This avoids one source of distortion from gravity.
In use, the focuser will be on top of the tube;
if the mount was on the side, it could flex downward from gravity and make it hard to collimate the telescope.  

[[Image:Single_Arm_Mount.png|center|frame|alt=diagram showing the position of a tube position mount relative to the focuser in a round and a square tube]]

Single arms are quick and elegant but they have a fatal flaw: they vibrate.
That one arm with the weight of the secondary mirror at its end is a pendulum.
Bumping the tube will make it vibrate for a while.
If you use a thicker material and one that dampens movement, for instance a soft wood, you can minimize the vibration,
but it will always be there.
My early telescope, &quot;The Long Dog,&quot; had a single arm secondary mirror mount.
It could be irritating but I did a lot of viewing with that telescope and I never swapped it out for something else.

Attaching the single arm to the secondary mirror mount can also be a challenge.
If you use a piece of threaded metal rod,
you could bore a hole through the mount and one through the tube wall.
Then you could attach and center the secondary with nuts and washers.
That is what I used as a single arm on &quot;The Long Dog,&quot;
and it gave me an infinite adjustment to center the secondary in the tube.
Final collimation was accomplished by bending the threaded rod to position the secondary mirror.

If you want to glue the arm on you need to be sure the mirror is in exactly the right place
and that will stay there while the glue dries.

A variation of the single arm is a design using thin parallel strips, closely mounted and flexed together to form the single arm.
This is basically a triangular truss and cancels all vibration.
Collimation is achieved by moving the secondary mount on the truss.
The friction of the material holds the alignment, or you can glue it up and fix the position pemanently.
See the drawing below for details.

[[Image:Parallel_Arm_Secondary_Mount.png|center|frame|alt=eh]]

You can make this assembly out of popsicle sticks,
clothes pins, or just thin scraps of wood.
It could also be made from stiff plastic.
This is the mount I use in my pie pan telescopes.  It is also in my rock scope.  

Really the only consideration is that the material used be flexible enough to not break
when it is bent through the secondary mirror mount.
You should cut out the slot on the mirror mount prior to mounting the mirror on it.
The slot should only be as wide as three or four pieces of the strip material you are using.
There is no need to go wider at the top than 3/4 of an inch.
A shorter set of arms would be better served by an even narrower top end, say 1/2 inch or so.
The best thing to do is hold the assembly in your fingers and squeeze the ends of the strips to see how much tension there is and adjust the separation accordingly.
You want enough friction to hold the secondary in place under its own weight.

Three-arm mounts are an old and reliable standard.
The arms are cut to the length necessary to hold the secondary in the middle of the tube.
They are then mounted equidistant around the secondary mirror mount so that by their very length they center the mirror in the telescope tube.
John Dobson has used the three-arm design forever it seems.
Once he has the assembly put together he puts it in the telescope tube, collimates the scope, and then glues it in place.
He recommends, and I agree, that the arms should not be round or square,
but flat and thin, with the thin edge placed towards the tube opening.
This gives a better strength to the tube mount.  

[[Image:Equalateral_Three_Arm.png|center|frame|alt=diagram of one form of a three-arm mount showing the three arms projecting from the faces of a secondary mirror mount in the form of a triangular prism.]]

You can make this mount quite easily in wood.
Make the mirror mount out of a piece of wood cut to the shape of an equilateral triangle.
(Think of a long prism.)
Now cut the 45-degree end for the mirror to mount on.
Make the three arms and glue and screw or nail them to the end opposite where the mirror will attach.
Make sure they are perpendicular to the mirror mount.
I cut the arms over-long, then size them for length by centering the assembly on my full-scale drawing and marking the arms there.
Once it is assembled and the glue has dried, attach the secondary mirror and put the assembly in the telescope tube.

John Dobson does this mount using a dowel.
He cuts a groove in the side of the dowel at 120-degree intervals and then glues each arm into place in its groove.

A variation on the three-arm mount is a T-mount having a single arm that goes all the way across the telescope tube,
and a second short arm that runs from the mirror mount to the wall of the tube.
These are a great design as they are simple to do.
They combine well with a square mirror mount.

[[Image:3_arm_T.png|center|frame|alt=diagram of a T-mount in the telescope tube with a cross-arm that contacts the top face of a square mirror-mount and a shorter vertical arm perpendicular to the mirror-mount lower face.]]

You can add another arm and do a four arm mount.
These are very stable and work well in round or square tubes.
The more arms you use, the more complex the mounting becomes,
and the more obstructions there are in the light path.
But it all comes down to the same batch of considerations:

* Telescope tube size and shape,
* Secondary mirror size and weight,
* Material available,
* What you want to achieve.

Make a decision based on these considerations.
Make a complete mirror mount first, including arms,
and then attach the secondary mirror.
Finally, mount the assembly in the telescope tube.

The relation between torsional spring constant and lateral spring constant is in doubt.

=Methods in AFM=

[[Image:OverviewOfAFMmethods.jpg|Thumb|300px|
A brief sketch of some of the many different methods used in AFM]]

A wealth of techniques are used in AFM to measure the topography and investigate the surface forces on the nanoscale:

For imaging sample topography:
*Contact mode, where the tip is in contact with the substrate. Gives high resolution but can damage fragile surfaces.
*Tapping / intermittent contact mode (ICM), where the tip is oscillating and taps the surface. 
*Non-contact mode (NCM), where the tip is oscillating and not touching the sample.

For measuring surface properties (and imaging them):
*Lateral force microscopy (LFM), when the tip is scanned sideways it will tilt and this can be measured by the photodetector. This method is used to measure friction forces on the nanoscale.
*Force Modulation Microscopy. Rapidly moving the tip up and down while pressing it into the sample makes it possible to measure the hardness of the surface and characterize it mechanically.
*Electrical force microscopy. If there are varying amount of charges present on the surface, the cantilever will deflect as it is attracted and repelled. kelvin probe microscopy will normally be more sensitive than measuring s static deflection.
**Kelvin probe microscopy. By applying an oscillating voltage to an oscillating cantilever in non-contact mode and measuring the charge induced oscillations, a map can be made of the surface charge distribution.
**Dual scan method - an other kelvin probe method described below.
*Magnetic Force Microscopy. If the cantilever has been magnetized it will deflect depending on the magnetization of the sample.
*Force-spectroscopy or force-distance curves. Moving the cantilever up and down to make contact and press into the sample, one can measure the force as function of distance.
*Nanoindentation. When pressing the cantilever hard into a sample it can leave an imprint  and in the force distance curve while doing indentation can tell about the yield stress, elastic plastic deformation dynamics.
*Liquid sample AFM. By immersing the cantilever in a liquid one can also image wet samples. It can be difficult to achieve good laser alignment the first time.
*Electrochemical AFM. 
*Scanning gate AFM
*Nanolithography
**Dip-pen lithography

=Cantilever Mechanics=

Cantilever has width w, thickness t, length L and the tip height from the cantilever middle to to the tip is h.

[[Image:AFM_cantilever_geometry.jpg|thumb|300px|

]]

When the cantilever is bent by a point force in the z-direction &lt;math&gt;F_{N}&lt;/math&gt; at the tip will deflect distance z(x) from the unloaded position along the x-axis as &lt;ref&gt;Senturia `Micromechanics'&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;z(x)=\frac{1}{2}\frac{F_{N}L}{EI}\left(  x^{2}-\frac{1}{3L}x^{3}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

with cantilever length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, Youngs modulus &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and moment of inertia &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

The tip deflection is

&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{z}=z\left(  L\right)  =\frac{1}{3}\frac{F_{N}}{EI}L^{3}
&lt;/math&gt;

giving a spring constant &lt;math&gt;k_{N}&lt;/math&gt; from

&lt;math&gt;F_{N}=k_{N}\Delta_{z}&lt;/math&gt;

so 

&lt;math&gt;k_{N}=3\frac{EI}{L^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

The angle of the cantilever in the x-z plane at the tip &lt;math&gt;\theta_{x}&lt;/math&gt;, which is what gives the laser beam deflection will be

&lt;math&gt;\theta_{N}=z^{\prime}\left(L\right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;z^{\prime}\left(  x\right) =\frac{1}{2}\frac{FL}{EI}\left(  2x-\frac{1}{L}x^{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;z^{\prime}\left(  L\right)    =\frac{1}{2}\frac{F}{EI}L^{2}=\frac{3}{2}\frac{z\left(  L\right)  }{L}
&lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Beam and Hinged Beam Bending.jpg|thumb|200px|The difference between a hinged and fixed beam's angle of deflection and the cantilever tip. The fixed beam will give a larger deflection signal]]

giving the relation

&lt;math&gt;\theta_{N}=\frac{3}{2}\frac{\Delta_{z}}{L}
&lt;/math&gt;

between the tip deflection distance and tip deflection angle. This is a  factor 3/2 bigger than the result we would expect if the beam was stiff and hinged at the base, showing us that we get a bigger deflection of the laser beam when the beam is bending than when its straight.

]]

==The AFM detector signal==

The cantilever can bend in several ways, which is detected by the quadrant
photo detector that most AFMs are equipped with. Normal topography signal is given by 'normal' deflection of the cantilever tip in the x-z direction, &lt;math&gt;\theta_{xz}=\theta_{N,}&lt;/math&gt; and detected by the left-right (or A-B) detector coupling quadrants as &lt;math&gt;V_{LR}=V_{1}+V_{3}-V_{2}-V_{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

Lateral forces applied to the tip will bend the cantilever in the x-y and x-z plane too. Lateral deflection cannot be detected by the quadrant detector since it doesn't change laser beam deflection, and   deflection is also rather small, as we shall see. Lateral forces also twist the cantilever tip producing torsional deflection in the y-z direction, &lt;math&gt;\theta_{yz} =\theta_{tor},&lt;/math&gt; which in turn produces the lateral force signal from the top-bottom detector measuring &lt;math&gt;V_{LR}=V_{1}+V_{2}-V_{3}-V_{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

For deflection in the z-direction, 'normal' spring constant relating the force and deflection &lt;math&gt;F_{N}=k_{N}\Delta_{z}&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;k_{N}=\frac{1}{4}Y\frac{wt^{3}}{L^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

Expressed in the angle of deflection, &lt;math&gt;\theta_{N}=\frac{3}{2}\frac{\Delta_{z}}{L},&lt;/math&gt; there is an angular spring constant

&lt;math&gt;F_{N}=c_{N}\theta_{N}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;c_{N}=\frac{2}{3}k_{N}L&lt;/math&gt;.

AFM cantilever and the forces acting between the tip and the sample.

=Contact, Tapping, and Non-contact Mode=

If an oscillator experiences an attractive force pulling it away from it rest position, the resonance frequency will drop (at snap-in it will be zero). A repulsive force squeezing it will increase the resonance frequency.

[[Image:AFM contact ICM and NCM.jpg|thumb|300px|The repulsive and attractive force regimes as the AFM tip approaches the sample. ]]

If an AFM tip is moved to contact with a sample, the resonance frequency is first decreasing slightly due to attractive forces and then increasing due to the repulsive forces. Eventually the repulsive force become so high we cannot oscillate it and we have achieved contact.

Contact mode: Because the tip is in contact, the forces are considerably higher than in non-contact mode and fragile samples as well as the tip can easily be damaged. The close contact on the other hand makes the resolution good and scan speeds can be high.

The varying resonance frequency is the cantilever moves between the attractive end repulsive regions of the force distance curve can be used to measure the cantilever position and to keep it in the attractive or repulsive part of the force distance curve.

[[Image:AFM tapping and non-contact frequencies.jpg|thumb|300px|The tip oscillation frequency for tapping and non-contact mode AFM are to either side of the tip resonance frequency. The green signal is the oscillation amplitude while the yellow is the phase]]
Non-contact mode: If we oscillate the cantilever at a higher frequency than its free resonance and use the feedback loop to maintain a oscillation amplitude setpoint slightly lower than that of the free oscillation, it will move the tip down until the attractive forces lower the resonance frequency and makes the oscillation amplitude drop to the setpoint level. 

Tapping mode: if we oscillate the cantilever at a lower frequency that its free oscillation, moving it towards the sample will first make it oscillate at a lower frequency which will make the stage move closer to try and raise the oscillation amplitude, and at eventually as it reaches repulsive forces will settle where resonance frequency cannot increase more without giving too high an amplitude.

==Contact Mode==

==Tapping Mode==
Tapping-mode (also called intermittent contact mode) is the most widely used operating mode in which the cantilever tip can experience both attractive and repulsive forces intermittently. In this mode, the cantilever is oscillated at or near its free resonant frequency. Hence, the force sensitivity of the measurement is increased by the quality factor of the cantilever. In tapping-mode operation, the amplitude of the cantilever vibration is used in feedback  circuitry, i.e., the oscillation amplitude is kept constant during imaging. Therefore it is also referred as amplitude modulation AFM (AM-AFM). The primary advantage of tapping mode is that the lateral forces between the tip and the sample can be eliminated, which greatly improves the image resolution. Tapping mode experiments are done generally in air or liquid. Amplitude modulation is not suitable for vacuum environment since the Q-factor of the cantilever is very high (up to 105) and this means a very slow feedback response.

==Non-contact Mode==

=Lateral Force Microscopy=

If the sample is scanned sideways in the 
y direction, the frictional forces will apply a torque on the cantilever, bending it sideways and this can be used to measure the frictional forces. The lateral force gives both a lateral and torsional deflection of the tip. Only the torsional can be detected in the photodetector.

For sideways/lateral bending, the lateral spring constant is corresponding to the normal spring constant but with width and thickness interchanged

&lt;math&gt;k_{lat}   =\frac{1}{4}Y\frac{tw^{3}}{L^{3}}
 =k_{N}\frac{w^{2}}{t^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and a similiar eq's for angular deflection as above. With thickness typically much smaller than the width for AFM\ cantilevers, the lateral spring constant is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than &lt;math&gt;k_{N}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a sideways, lateral force &lt;math&gt;F_{lat}&lt;/math&gt; on the cantilever we will have a sideways deflection determined by

&lt;math&gt;F_{lat}=k_{lat}\Delta_{y-lat}&lt;/math&gt;

If the lateral force is applied to the AFM tip, &lt;math&gt;F_{lat}&lt;/math&gt;, it will give a lateral deflection but also apply a torque &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; twisting the beam 

&lt;math&gt;\tau=hF_{tor}&lt;/math&gt;

Twisting an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_{tor}&lt;/math&gt; gives a torional tip deflection of &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{y-tor}=\theta_{tor}h.&lt;/math&gt;

The relation for the torsional spring constant is (please check this equation)

&lt;math&gt;F_{tor}=k_{tor}\Delta_{y-tor}&lt;/math&gt;

with

&lt;math&gt;k_{tor}   =G\frac{wt^{3}}{3h^{2}L}
 =\frac{Ywt^{3}}{8h^{2}L}
 =k_{N}\frac{1}{2}\left(  \frac{L}{h}\right)  ^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and then

&lt;math&gt;\tau=h^{2}k_{tor}\theta_{tor}=\frac{1}{2}k_{N}L^{2}\theta_{tor}=\frac{1}{2}k_{N}\frac{L^{2}\Delta_{y-tor}}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

From above we have

&lt;math&gt;\frac{k_{lat}}{k_{tor}}=2\left(  \frac{wh}{tL}\right)  ^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The factor &lt;math&gt;2\left(  \frac{wh}{tL}\right)  ^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is typically &lt;math&gt;2\left(\frac{20\ast10}{2\ast100}\right)  ^{2}=2.0&lt;/math&gt; - so about 1 but larger or smaller depending on whether its a contact or non-contact cantilever.

== Friction Loop Scan==
[[Image:AFM_LFM_signal_scan.jpg|thumb|300px|
Typical signal from a scan with the AFM in lateral force mode - a friction loop scan. At the turning points the tip sticks to the surface and the signal has a linear slope with the detector sensitivity. When the lateral tip-sample force exceeds the static friction force between the sample and substrate, the tip will start to slide with the dynamic friction force and s steady signal.]]

For optimal torsional sensitivity - but the following is not
always correct since it depends highly on the contact forces you need etc: For high torsional sensitivity, &lt;math&gt;wh&gt;&gt;tL&lt;/math&gt;. Since we are in contact mode AFM, L must be large and t thin for a low &lt;math&gt;k_{N}&lt;/math&gt;. So better torsional sensitivity means wider cantilevers and definitely large tip heights.

==Coupled Lateral and Torsional deflection in the cantilever==

But how much will a cantilever bend laterally and how much will it twist when applied a lateral force at the tip? An applied lateral force will move two degrees of freedom with a Hookes law behaviour - the torsion and lateral motion. The applied force &lt;math&gt;F_{tor}&lt;/math&gt; is also an applied &lt;math&gt;F_{lat.}&lt;/math&gt;

The effective spring constant for pushing the tip in the y direction is then 

&lt;math&gt;F_{tor}=k_{eff}\Delta_{y}
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{y}=\Delta_{y,lat}+\Delta_{y,tor}&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;math&gt;
k_{eff}   =\frac{1}{\frac{1}{k_{lat}}+\frac{1}{k_{tor}}} =\frac{k_{lat}}{1+\frac{k_{lat}}{k_{tor}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the deflection made in the torsional spring &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{y,tor}&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{y,tor}=\frac{\Delta_{y}}{1+\frac{k_{tor}}{k_{lat}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and this approaches &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{y}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;k_{tor}&lt;k_{lat,}&lt;/math&gt;so the cantilever is more prone to tilting than lateral deflection. The lateral deflection can be found from

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta_{y,lat}k_{lat}   =\Delta_{y,tor}k_{tor} \Delta_{y,lat}   =\frac{k_{tor}}{k_{lat}}\Delta_{y,tor}
&lt;/math&gt;

The torsional deflection angle is then

&lt;math&gt;
\theta_{tor}   =\frac{\Delta_{y,tor}}{h} =\frac{k_{lat}}{k_{lat}+k_{tor}}\frac{F_{tor}}{hk_{eff}} =\frac{k_{lat}}{k_{lat}+k_{tor}}\frac{1+\frac{k_{lat}}{k_{tor}}}{k_{lat} }\frac{F_{tor}}{h} =\frac{1}{h}\frac{F_{tor}}{k_{tor}}
&lt;/math&gt;

as anticipated from the assumption that the torsional and lateral springs are coupled in series. So when a constant force is applied, the detector signal is a measurement of the force.

Question: during a friction loop scan, the tip is fixed by static friction on the surface and its a constant deflection, both torsional and lateral deflection must be included to find the actual deflected distance of the tip before its pulled free from to slide the surface and the lateral deflection could influence the beginning of the friction loop curve?

=Measuring the cantilever dimensions=

The vibration frequency of the fundamental mode of the cantilever is an easily measurable quantity in the AFM and can be used to evaluate a cantilever is within specifications. Its given by

&lt;math&gt;f[Hz]=\frac{t\beta_{i}^{2}}{4\pi L^{2}}\sqrt{\frac{Y}{3\rho}}
=\frac{\left(  1\ast10^{-6}\right)  \left(  1.875\right)  ^{2}}{4\pi\left(
100\ast10^{-6}\right)  ^{2}}\sqrt{\frac{\left(  160\ast10^{9}\right)  }
{3\ast2330}}=1.\,338\,5\times10^{5}&lt;/math&gt;

Easily measurable quantities in AFM: length L, resonance freq f, tip length
&lt;math&gt;l_{tip},&lt;/math&gt;width &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;,

Not so easy: thickness t, cross section (often there are inclined sidewalls), force konst &lt;math&gt;k_{norm},&lt;/math&gt; tip length from middle of the cantilever since we dont know the thickness.

=Noise Sources in AFM=

==Thermal noise==

&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}=\frac{1}{2}k_{B}T
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left\langle x\right\rangle _{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{k_{B}T}{k_{spring}}}
&lt;/math&gt;


for a 1 N/m cantilever this amounts to &lt;math&gt;\left\langle x\right\rangle _{rms}=\sqrt{k_{B}300}=0.6.&lt;/math&gt;Å. So a 1 Å noise level requires &lt;math&gt;\frac{k_{B}300}{10^{-20}}=0.4&lt;/math&gt; N/m which is not a very low spring constant for a contact mode cantilever.

So thermal noise can become a problem in some AFM cantilevers at room temperature!!

=Electrical Force Microscopy=

The Kelvin Probe Microscopy Method and Dual Scan Method can be used to map out the electrical fields on surfaces with an AFM.

== Kelvin Probe Microscopy Method ==

[[Image:Kfmoutlet.jpg|thumb|300px|The principle of Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM). The lock-in amplifier generates a signal on the tip and the electrostatic tip-surface interaction is readout by the laser and the lock-in amplifier adjusts accordingly.]]

In the Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM) method a voltage is applied between the AFM tip and the surface. Both a DC and AC voltage is applied to the tip so the total potential difference &lt;math&gt;V_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; between the tip and surface is:

&lt;math&gt;V_{tot}= -V_S + V_{DCt} + V_{ACt}\cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_S = V_S(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is the local surface potential, &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the tip, &lt;math&gt;V_{DCt}&lt;/math&gt; is the DC signal on the tip, &lt;math&gt;V_{ACt}&lt;/math&gt; is the amplitude of the AC signal, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the AC signal.

The frequency of the AC signal is much lower than the resonance frequency of the cantilever (a factor of 10) so the two signals can be separated by a lock-in amplifier. Via the electrostatic forces the setup measures the surface potential. If one assumes that the electrostatic force (&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) between the tip and surface is given by &lt;ref&gt;Veeco, &quot;Electrostatic Force Microscopy for AutoProbe CP Research Operating Instructions&quot;, 2001 (Manual)&lt;/ref&gt;
:

&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{\frac{\partial C}{\partial z} \cdot V_{tot}^2}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the capacitance and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the tip and the surface.

If a parallel plate capacitor is assumed

&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{A_c \epsilon_0}{z}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;A_c&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the tip. The derivative of capacitance is

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}=-\frac{A_c \epsilon_0}{z^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining the force (&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;V_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; yields:

&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}}{2}\cdot \Big(-V_S + V_{DCt} + V_{ACt}\cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t)\Big)^2=&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}}{2}\cdot \Big((V_{DCt}-V_S)^2+V_{ACt}^2 \cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t)^2 +2 \cdot (V_{DCt}-V_S) \cdot V_{ACt} \cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t)\Big).&lt;/math&gt;

Using Pythagorean identities

&lt;math&gt;\big[\cos(x)^2+\sin(x)^2=1\big]&lt;/math&gt;

and de Moivre's formula

&lt;math&gt;\big[(\cos(x)+i \cdot \sin(x))^n = \cos(n\cdot x)+i \cdot \sin(n\cdot x)\big],&lt;/math&gt; 

We find

&lt;math&gt;V_{ACt}^2 \cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t)^2 = V_{ACt}^2 \cdot \ \big(1-\cos(\omega \cdot t)^2\big)=&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \cdot V_{ACt}^2 \cdot \big(2-2\cdot \cos(\omega \cdot t)^2 \big) =&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \cdot V_{ACt}^2-\frac{1}{2} \cdot V_{ACt}^2 \cdot \cos(2 \cdot \omega \cdot t).&lt;/math&gt;

This inserted in the equation for the force (&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) gives &lt;ref&gt;V. Vincenzo, and M Palma, and P. Samorí; Advanced Materials 18, 145-164 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;F=\Big(\frac{\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}}{2}\cdot \big((V_{DCt}-V_S)^2+ \frac{1}{2} \cdot V_{ACt}^2\big) + \big(2 \cdot (V_{DCt}-V_S) \cdot V_{ACt}\big) \cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t)-&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{2} \cdot V_{ACt}^2) \cdot \cos(2 \cdot \omega \cdot t)\Big)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F = k_{1}+k_{2}\cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t)+k_{3}\cdot \cos(2\cdot \omega \cdot t),&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;k_1 = \frac{\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}}{2}\cdot \big((V_{DCt}-V_S)^2+ \frac{1}{2} \cdot V_{ACt}^2 \big)&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;k_2 = (2 \cdot (V_{DCt}-V_S) \cdot V_{ACt})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k_3 = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot V_{ACt}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is set by an external oscillator and can therefore be locked by the lock-in amplifier. The signal detected by the lock-in amplifier (the &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; part) is minimized by constant varying &lt;math&gt;V_{DCt}&lt;/math&gt;. When this signal approaches zero, this corresponds to &lt;math&gt;V_{DCt}=V_S&lt;/math&gt; i.e. mapping &lt;math&gt;V_{DCt}&lt;/math&gt; vs. the sample surface &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;V_S(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.


== Dual Scan Method ==

[[Image:DSoutlet.jpg|thumb|300px|The principle of the Dual Scan (DS) method where first a topography line scan is made, then the tip is lifted a distance d and another line scan is made with the source drain voltage turned on.]]

In the Dual Scan (DS, or sometimes called lift-mode method) one first makes a line scan with no potential on either the AFM tip or the sample in either tapping or non-contact mode. Next, the AFM tip is raised several tens of nanometers (30-70 nm) above the surface. A new line scan is made at this height, but this time with a potential on the sample also in non-contact mode. This is repeated over the desired scan area until the whole area has been scanned. For imaging 
the surface potential, the phase of the cantilever vibration is mapped out. The principle is shown in the figure where d is the distance between the tip and the surface in the second scan. The phase shift is dependent on the force (&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) acting on the tip &lt;ref&gt;T. S. Jespersen and J. Nygård; Nano Letters 5(9), 1838-1841 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
:

&lt;math&gt;\phi = \tan^{-1}(\frac{k}{Q \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial z}})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the quality factor of the cantilever, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; the spring constant, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; the distance between the tip and the surface.

For small phase shifts the phase can be written as

&lt;math&gt;\phi \approx \frac{Q \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial z}}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of the force can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial F}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial z^2} \cdot V_{s}^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_s&lt;/math&gt; is the surface potential and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the capacitance between the tip and the surface &lt;ref&gt;T. S. Jespersen and J. Nygård; Nano Letters 5(9), 1838-1841 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
. The second derivative of the capacitance is

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial z^2}=\frac{2A_c \epsilon _0}{z^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining equations for the phase and the derivative of the force yields the phase dependence of the phase shift 

&lt;math&gt;\phi \approx \frac{Q \cdot \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial z^2} \cdot V_{s}^2}{k\cdot 2}.&lt;/math&gt;

To find the surface potential, one must estimate the other parts of equation for the phase. The spring constant (&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;) can be determined if the dimensions (a regular cantilever) and material of the cantilever are known:

&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{E \cdot w \cdot h^3}{4\cdot L^3},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the Young modulus, &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the width of the cantilever, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; the height, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length. The quality factor (&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;) of the cantilever can be found by measuring the shape of resonance peak. The second derivative of the capacitance can be estimated by assuming that the tip of the AFM is a plate with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; so the derivative of the capacitance is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial z^2} = \frac{2 \cdot \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot \epsilon _0}{z^3},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon _0&lt;/math&gt; is the vacuum permittivity. This way of estimating the other parts of the equation for the phase is quite accurate according to &lt;ref&gt;T. S. Jespersen and J. Nygård; Nano Letters 5(9), 1838-1841 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;. One can also estimate the values by
measuring them at a surface with a known potential and at different known heights and then one simply calculate backwards for that particular AFM tip.

==Discussion==
Both the DS and KPM methods have their strengths and weaknesses. The DS method is easier to operate, since it has fewer interlinked parameters, needing to be adjusted. The KPM method is faster, as it does not require two scans (an image with the DS method with a resolution of 512 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 512 pixels and a scan rate of &lt;math&gt;0.8&lt;/math&gt; Hz takes about half an hour). The DS method will normally obtain much better lateral resolution in the potential image compared to the KPM method. This is due to the fact that the signal depends on the
second derivative of the capacitance, which in turn depends on the distance in &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r^3}&lt;/math&gt; compared to the KPM method where the dependence is only &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;. This rapidly reduces the problem of the tip sidewall interaction. On the other hand, the KPM method has better sensitivity because it operates much closer to the surface.

'''Xlib''' is an [[Guide to X11|X Window System]] protocol client library written in the [[C programming language]]. It contains functions for interacting with an X server. These functions allow programmers to write programs without knowing the details of the protocol. Few applications use Xlib directly; rather, they employ other libraries that use Xlib functions to provide widget toolkits:

[[Image:X-client-libraries.svg|frame|Xlib and other libraries using it]]

* [[../Intrinsics/]] (Xt)
* [[../Xaw|Athena widget set]] (Xaw)
* [[../Motif/]]
* [[../GTK+/]]
* [[../Qt/]] (X11 version)
* [[../fpGUI/]] (Free Pascal GUI Toolkit)

Xlib appeared around 1985, and is currently used in GUIs for many Unix-like operating systems.

The [[../XCB/]] library is an attempt to replace Xlib.

=== Data types ===

The main types of data in Xlib are the &lt;code&gt;Display&lt;/code&gt; structure and the types of the identifiers.

Informally, a display is a physical or virtual device where graphical operations are done. The &lt;code&gt;Display&lt;/code&gt; structure of the Xlib library contains information about the display, but more importantly it contains information relative to the channel between the client and the server. For example, in a Unix-like operating system, the &lt;code&gt;Display&lt;/code&gt; structure contains the file handle of the socket of this channel (this can be retrieved using the &lt;code&gt;ConnectionNumber&lt;/code&gt; macro.) Most Xlib functions have a &lt;code&gt;Display&lt;/code&gt; structure as an argument because they either operate on the channel or are relative to a specific channel. In particular, all Xlib functions that interact with the server need this structure for accessing the channel. Some other functions need this structure, even if they operate locally, because they operate on data relative to a specific channel. Operations of this kind include for example operations on the event queue, which is described below.

Windows, colormaps, etc. are managed by the server, which means that the data about their actual implementation is all stored in the server. The client operates on these objects by using their ''identifiers''. The client cannot directly operate on an object, but can only request the server to perform the operation specifying the identifier of the object.

The types &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Pixmap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Font&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Colormap&lt;/code&gt;, etc. are all identifiers, which are 32-bit integers (just as in the X11 protocol itself). A client &amp;ldquo;creates&amp;rdquo; a window by requesting that the server create a window. This is done via a call to an Xlib function that returns an identifier for the window, that is, a number. This identifier can then be used by the client for requesting other operations on the same window to the server.

The identifiers are unique to the server. Most of them can be used by different applications to refer to the same objects. For example, two applications connecting with the same server use the same identifier to refer to the same window. These two applications use two different channels, and therefore have two different &lt;tt&gt;Display&lt;/tt&gt; structures; however, when they request operations on the same identifier, these operations will be done on the same object.

=== Protocol and events ===

The Xlib functions that send requests to the server usually do not send these requests immediately but store them in a buffer, called the ''output buffer''.  The term ''output'' in this case refers to the output from the client that is directed to the server: the output buffer can contain all kinds of requests to the server, not only those having a visible effect on the screen. The output buffer is guaranteed to be flushed (i.e., all requests done so far are sent to the server) after a call to the functions &lt;code&gt;XSync&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;XFlush&lt;/code&gt;, after a call to a function that returns a value from the server (these functions block until the answer is received), and in some other conditions. &lt;!-- e.g. operations on the queue when they block; maybe other ones --&gt;

Xlib stores the received events in a queue. The client application can inspect and retrieve events from the queue. While the X server sends events asynchronously, applications using the Xlib library are required to explicitly call Xlib functions for accessing the events in the queue. Some of these functions may block; in this case, they also flush the output buffer.

Errors are instead received and treated asynchronously: the application can provide an error handler that will be called whenever an error message from the server is received.

The content of a window is not guaranteed to be preserved if the window of one of its parts are made not visible. In this case, the application is sent an &lt;code&gt;Expose&lt;/code&gt; event when the window of one part of it is made visible again. The application is then supposed to draw the window content again.

=== Functions ===

The functions in the Xlib library can be grouped in:

# operations on the connection (&lt;code&gt;XOpenDisplay&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XCloseDisplay&lt;/code&gt;, ...);
# requests to the server, including requests for operations (&lt;code&gt;XCreateWindow&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XCreateGC&lt;/code&gt;,...) and requests for information (&lt;code&gt;XGetWindowProperty&lt;/code&gt;, ...); and
# operations that are local to the client: operations on the event queue (&lt;code&gt;XNextEvent&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XPeekEvent&lt;/code&gt;, ...) and other operations on local data (&lt;code&gt;XLookupKeysym&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XParseGeometry&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XSetRegion&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XCreateImage&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XSaveContext&lt;/code&gt;, ...)

=== Example ===

The following program creates a window with a little black square in it.

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
 /*
   Simple Xlib application drawing a box in a window.
   To Compile: gcc -O2 -Wall -o test test.c -L /usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lm
 */

 #include&lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;
 #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include&lt;stdlib.h&gt; // prevents error for exit on line 18 when compiling with gcc
 int main() {
   Display *d;
   int s;
   Window w;
   XEvent e;

                        /* open connection with the server */
   d=XOpenDisplay(NULL);
   if(d==NULL) {
     printf(&quot;Cannot open display\n&quot;);
     exit(1);
   }
   s=DefaultScreen(d);

                        /* create window */
   w=XCreateSimpleWindow(d, RootWindow(d, s), 10, 10, 100, 100, 1,
                         BlackPixel(d, s), WhitePixel(d, s));

   // Process Window Close Event through event handler so XNextEvent does Not fail
        Atom delWindow = XInternAtom( d, &quot;WM_DELETE_WINDOW&quot;, 0 );
        XSetWMProtocols(d , w, &amp;delWindow, 1);

                        /* select kind of events we are interested in */
   XSelectInput(d, w, ExposureMask | KeyPressMask);

                        /* map (show) the window */
   XMapWindow(d, w);

                        /* event loop */
   while(1) {
     XNextEvent(d, &amp;e);
                        /* draw or redraw the window */
     if(e.type==Expose) {
       XFillRectangle(d, w, DefaultGC(d, s), 20, 20, 10, 10);
     }
                        /* exit on key press */
     if(e.type==KeyPress)
       break;

     // Handle Windows Close Event
     if(e.type==ClientMessage)
        break;
   }

                        /* destroy our window */
   XDestroyWindow(d, w);

                        /* close connection to server */
   XCloseDisplay(d);

   return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The client creates a connection with the server by calling &lt;code&gt;XOpenDisplay&lt;/code&gt;. It then requests the creation of a window with &lt;code&gt;XCreateSimpleWindow&lt;/code&gt;. A separate call to &lt;code&gt;XMapWindow&lt;/code&gt; is necessary for mapping the window, that is, for making it visible on the screen.

The square is drawn by calling &lt;code&gt;XFillRectangle&lt;/code&gt;. This operation can only be performed after the window is created. However, performing it once may not be enough. Indeed, the content of the window is not always guaranteed to be preserved. For example, if the window is covered and then uncovered again, its content might require that it be drawn again. The program is informed that the window or a part of it has to be drawn by the reception of an &lt;code&gt;Expose&lt;/code&gt; event.

The drawing of the window content is therefore made inside the loop handling the events. Before entering this loop, the events the application is interested in are selected, in this case with &lt;code&gt;XSelectInput&lt;/code&gt;. The event loop waits for an incoming event: if this event is a key press, the application exits; if it is an expose event, the window content is drawn. The function &lt;code&gt;XNextEvent&lt;/code&gt; blocks and flushes the output buffer if there is no event in the queue.

=== Going Further ===

[http://www.x.org/docs/X11/xlib.pdf manual of the Xlib]

=== Other libraries ===

Xlib does not provide support for buttons, menus, scrollbar, etc. Such widgets are provided by other libraries, which in turn use Xlib. There are two kinds of such libraries:

* libraries built atop of the [[../Xt|Intrinsics]] library (Xt), which provides support for widgets but does not provide any particular widget; specific widgets are provided by widget set libraries that use Xt, such as [[../Xaw/]] and [[../Motif/]];
* libraries that provide widget sets using Xlib directly, without the Xt library, such as [[../GTK+/]], [[../Qt/]] (X11 version), and [[../FLTK/]] (X11 version).

Applications using any of these widget libraries typically specify the content of the window before entering the main loop and do not need to explicitly handle &lt;code&gt;Expose&lt;/code&gt; events and redraw the window content.

The [[../XCB/]] library is an alternative to Xlib. Its two main aims are: reduction in library size and direct access to the X11 protocol. A modification of Xlib has been produced to use XCB as a low-level layer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The '''GIMP Toolkit''' (abbreviated as '''GTK+''') is a free and open source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces that was initially created in 1997 for the [[The GIMP|GIMP]], a raster graphics editor, by Spencer Kimball, Peter Mattis, and Josh MacDonald &amp;mdash; all of whom were members of eXperimental Computing Facility (XCF) at Berkeley University. GTK+ is licensed under the LGPL.

Unlike many other widget toolkits, GTK+ isn't based on Xt. The advantage of this is that it allows GTK+ to be available on other systems and to be much more flexible. GTK+ allows the end-user to configure the look of the toolkit, down to offering a number of different display ''engines''. Engines exist which emulate the look of other popular toolkits or platforms, like Windows 95, Motif, Qt or NextStep. The disadvantage is that it doesn't have access to the X resource database, which is the traditional way for customizing X11 applications.

GTK+ 2 includes improved text rendering using Pango, a new theme engine, improved accessibility using Accessibility Toolkit, complete transition to Unicode using UTF-8 strings and a more flexible API. However, GTK+ 2 lacks compatibility with GTK+ 1, and programmers must port applications to it. Starting with version 2.8 GTK+ relies on the Cairo library for rendering of vector graphics.

=== Programming languages ===

GTK+ uses the [[C programming language]], although its designers use an object-oriented paradigm. The GNOME platform bindings provide for C++ (gtkmm), Perl, Ruby, Java and Python (PyGTK) bindings; others have written bindings for many other programming languages (including Ada, D, Haskell, Lua, Pascal, PHP, Pike and all .NET programming languages).

=== Environments that use GTK+ ===

[[Image:gimp2-2.png|right|thumb|300px|Screenshot of the GIMP 2.2 on a typical system]]

* The GNOME environment uses GTK+ as a base, which means that programs written for GNOME use GTK+ as their toolkit. 
* Xfce also uses it as its base, though its apps typically do not depend on as many programs. (This is the difference between something being branded as a &quot;GNOME program&quot; and as a &quot;GTK+ program&quot;.) 
* The GPE Palmtop Environment, Maemo (Nokia's Internet-tablet framework), and Access Linux Platform (a new Palm OS-compatible Personal digital PDA platform) also use GTK+ as a base. 

Those desktop environments are not required to run GTK+ programs, though.  If the libraries the program requires are installed, a GTK+ program can run on top of other X11-based environments such as KDE or an X11-plus-window manager environment; this includes MacOS X if X11.app is installed. GTK+ can also run under Microsoft Windows. Some of the more unusual ports include DirectFB and ncurses.

(this discussion was copied from my talk page) - [[User:Motor|Motor]] ([[User talk:Motor|talk)]] 09:54:20, 2005-08-12 (UTC)

Why did you reverse my edit to [[GIMP Toolkit]] ?
The information that it's architecturally unfit for garbage-collected language is true, important and relevant to in the section about support for programming languages. [[User:Taw|Taw]] 02:17, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
: Because with the edit (and edit summary) you were trying to make a case, and not writing a encyclopedia article (and yes, I read the link you included). As I said in my edit summary, wikipedia isn't for grinding axes, nor is it a surrogate for mailing list technical disputes. Also, considering the link you provided, I'm pretty sure it counts as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_original_research original research] - [[User:Motor|Motor]] ([[User talk:Motor|talk)]] 04:46:00, 2005-08-11 (UTC)

::I'm not trying to make any case, I'm merely documenting the facts, and they're not disputed by anyone. 

:::According to your own link, they do seem to be disputed -- if not the fact that you can provoke a memory leak (which is hardly unique), then certainly the severity of the problem. Not to mention, this isn't a highly technical article (nor is it developer documentation, or a language bindings howto). 

::I and Ruby/GNOME2 developers found a problem that requires a change to Gtk architecture to fix correctly. 

:::I'm not disputing that you have a technical issue with GTK while writing Ruby bindings (who doesn't), nor am I interested in defending GTK developers, merely stating that Wikipedia is not the place to complain about specific &quot;bugs&quot;. Does the official GTK documentation acknowledge the problem, if so, perhaps you could quote that?

::One of the Gtk developers that answered agreed that the problem exists, but he's clear they're not going to fix it. So nobody's disputing the facts. The problem (cooperation across GC boundaries) is not unusual, it should be documented in general in any  decent reference on GC,

:::Your edit was not documenting the issue. It was complaing about it. Your post to the mailing list documents the issue, and that's where it belongs. If you think it hasn't had due attention, then repost it. In fact, you might find it useful to include a link to your edited version of the article. You can find a link to it via the page history (sorry if you already know this, I'm just covering bases).

:: and in the Gtk case it seems it has been already discussed, even as early as 1998, wrt Guile bindings. If you cared to read [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]], you'd see quite clearly that this has nothing to do with my edit. [[User:Taw|Taw]] 08:29, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

::: I've read it... it is original research. You think you've found a big technical problem with GTK. Reading the link it's clear that he does not agree with you about the severity of the problem, in fact he says quite clearly that &quot;they&quot; designed around it. None of this is relevant -- you are quoting your own research on a mailing list as a source. As I said, the mailing list is the place for this. - [[User:Motor|Motor]] ([[User talk:Motor|talk)]] 09:03:52, 2005-08-12 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

'''Motif''' (often capitalized as '''MOTIF''') is a graphical widget toolkit for building graphical user interfaces under the [[Guide to X11|X Window System]] on Unix and other POSIX-compliant systems. It emerged in the 1980s as UNIX workstations were on the rise, as a competitor to the OpenLook GUI.

It is also an industry standard by the name IEEE 1295 (in which case it would be better referred to as the '''Motif API''' in order to avoid ambiguity). It was and still is used as the basic building blocks for the Common Desktop Environment. As of version 2.1 Motif supports Unicode which has made it widely used in several multilingual environments.

Motif is distinguished by its use of square, chiseled, three dimensional effects for the various user interface elements &amp;mdash; menus, buttons, sliders, text boxes, and the like.  This was in vogue, however, as Microsoft Windows 3.x had added a 3D effect and Motif on Unix was increasingly seen as a competitor to Microsoft on Intel personal computers.

Some argue that it is practically obsolete when compared to [[../GTK+/]] or [[../Qt/]]: Sun Microsystems, a major Motif user, has announced that they will switch over to GTK+ (and GNOME). However, Motif is still the choice for many mission critical systems, especially in the aerospace industry.

Motif was created by the Open Software Foundation (and was sometimes even called OSF/Motif) but is nowadays owned by The Open Group.

There are a few implementations of the Motif API. Motif the toolkit is the first. There is also Open Motif which is a release of the &quot;original&quot; Motif under more liberal licensing terms. Finally, the LessTif project has been working hard to implement the API under the LGPL license.

=== Open Motif ===

'''Open Motif''' (or, unofficially, OpenMotif) is a source code release of the Motif computer programming toolkit by The Open Group, the current owners of Motif.

Open Motif has the same functionality and source code as Motif, but is offered under a license which allows royalty free distribution of Open Motif if the platform upon which it is used is Open Source. This is in contrast to Motif, whose use and distribution requires the payment of royalties.

The license of Open Motif, in other words, allows developers to replace Motif (which many applications still depend on) with Open Motif and avoid the payment of royalties, if the platform the application runs on is Open Source. This includes popular platforms such as Linux and the various variants of BSD.

Open Motif was released to make it easier for users of open source platforms to use applications that require the Motif toolkit to run (thus creating a greater market for vendors of Motif applications).

The initial release of Open Motif was version 2.1.30 in May 2000. The current release that most Linux distributions ship is Open Motif 2.2.3. Open Motif 2.3 is currently in beta test and is available for download at the Open Motif project page.

=== LessTif ===

'''LessTif''' is a reimplementation or clone of the Motif computer programming toolkit. LessTif is developed by the Hungry Programmers. It aims to be a compatible free software replacement for Motif.

As opposed to Motif, which is distributed under a proprietary software license that can require the payment of royalties, LessTif is distributed under the LGPL, a less restrictive but free software license, which makes LessTif more attractive to many developers, distributors and users. The license of Motif was the main motivation for the development of LessTif.

LessTif aims for full source and binary compatibility with Motif. While this has not yet been achieved, many Motif applications run with LessTif and/or can be compiled with it.

After the release of Open Motif there is now a second alternative to replace Motif for open source applications. Still, since Open Motif is not itself Open Source software, the development of LessTif continues.

== Overview ==

'''''Dennis Creevey''''', brother of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey]], is a perpetually-excited Gryffindor who entered Hogwarts in Harry's fourth year.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Dennis Creevey, first seen wearing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s immense moleskin coat, is Sorted into Gryffindor. On reaching the House table, he tells Colin that he had fallen into the lake and was saved by the giant squid.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] becomes the second Hogwarts Champion, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] starts distributing buttons that alternate between saying &quot;Support [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], the Real Hogwarts Champion&quot;, and &quot;Potter Stinks&quot;. As Harry heads out for an appointment with Hagrid, he sees the Creeveys, Colin and Dennis, working with one of these badges, trying to charm it to say something different. On his return, he sees that they have not been successful; all that they have managed is to make the badge say &quot;Potter Really Stinks&quot;.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Both Dennis and Colin Creevey are members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]. While we don't hear much of them, it seems that Dennis is managing to master some of the more advanced charms, possibly with Colin's help, despite being only second-year.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Dennis and Colin are seen trying to figure out how they can stay at Hogwarts and assist in the defence before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]], but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] sends them both away.

      <comment>/* Question re Cc Violation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Today I laid out the 'bones' of the book on Telescope Making.  My focus for the book is to impart the basic techniques to build a Newtonian reflector.  I have a target audience in mind of people who might like to try this hobby but are frightened by the complexity and the cost.  Throughout the book I will be documenting my building of a scope using scrounged parts and commonly available materials.  The primary mirror is a Pyrex pie pan, used to make pies, and purchased for 99 cents at a second hand store.

A possible shelving for the book could be in Do It Yourself, or maybe in the Wikijunior section.  I do plan on focusing the writing towards young adults, maybe between the Cub Scout range and the teen looking for a science project.

I would like to invite anyone with experience, maybe some pictures of a project, to contribute.

I think a question section could be good too, so invite those also.

I got the basics of the Refracting Telescope page typed in.  I am thinking at the end of the reflecting project I should do a section on making and repairing refracting telescopes.  Many folks may be interested in buying that cheap Tasco at Goodwill for $10 and fiddling with it.

I have a heading on the second page of, &quot;Contents&quot;.  I don't know if that will stand or not.  I am leaving it right now so that I can keep track of the book sequence; add or remove as is necessary.

I am still up in the air on final format.  One long sequence OR! a nested web page design.  I see arguments and discussions for both.

--[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] 18:22, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

Bit more done.  I got down to Optical design.  I need to find out some stuff from someone.  How to do the links properly.  Importing and embedding images.

--[[User:69.59.200.230|69.59.200.230]] 21:01, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

I am working on some of the illustrations and diagrams I want to use for the book.  Much of the text for the section on Optics, located in the design section, hinge on these illustrations.  Hence, slow going right now.  I should be able to finish the optics section in a doay or two.  Long weekend ahead.

Lord what a task.  I am still not even sure it is right.  I got the basics of the optics page up, pics and all.  I need to find out how to list the scope werks as the author.

--[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] 21:18, 11 November 2006 (UTC)


Finished the section on the design of the optics.  On to the hands on section.  I will need to get materials and keep an accurate cost list.
--[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] 05:11, 16 November 2006 (UTC)


Adding    { { PD-self } }   to a page will insert the open license.  Remove the spaces after you paste it narnal!

--[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] 00:05, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

After 4 months of grinding and messing with glass I am finally ready to write the next chapter or so.  Posted today, I have tried to stay within the editing constraints setup by the admin.

--[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] 21:10, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

Added some links to the page, did some editing of the verbage.  Tried to gather my thoughts.  I believe I will do the tube and focuser pages next, then come back to the optics.

--[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] 01:31, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

Some interest from the world at last. An editor wants to take a crack at making the book more readable. I will post some of the other chapters and see if we can't put this tome to bed. Mirror grinding next ..

[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] ([[User talk:Vorblesnak|talk]]) 06:26, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

Dave C has taken up the challenge of editing. I hope to move our discussions here so that anyone can share and learn form the experience. First edits went into the page. What follows is an email from Dave and my reply ..

&gt; Today I went over the intro of the book. It's still mostly yours and I
&gt; hope it still &quot;sounds like you.&quot; I felt the need of defining the basic
&gt; term focal length, which you used without defining, and had to cobble
&gt; up a couple of diagrams to add to your &quot;sagitta&quot; diagram.

We need to discuss audience and process. I wrote the book for 10 to 12 year olds and I wrote it as an introductory text. It really leaves a great
deal unsaid. It is a hands on text. But as you have noticed there are some things that need to be expanded on. I thought about that and decided
in the spirit of the web I would link to other pages that brought the detail focus to those loose ends. At the end of each section is a little
piece called ... Links to new terms and topics for this page:  This is the repository for those detail pages.  I have been using Wikipedia for
many of those links but other sources exist.

I see what you are saying about loose ends and undefined terms but I am not sure I want those in the text. I see the text as a hands on, wind in
your hair, flying along scope making treatise. If you need more detail the links are there, follow them. If you just want to make a scope do
what the book says and you will.  The first image actually covers the elements of mirror design, including focal length, but I like the color
in your images. I think the text could be reworked with hyperlinks so the links to &quot;bird scopes&quot; is in the text and at the end in the new terms.

I also think the style may be too loose, to much verbiage. Trying to strike a balance between verbose and laconic I think I come across as trite, too 
folksy. I want to hold their interest but not scare them off with the physics.

What do you think?

We should take this to discussion on the book's web page.

Toledo, OR 97391

&gt; Thanks,

&gt; Dave C.

OK, I cut the paragraph on f-number as interesting but irrelevant, and I made the diagrams uniform size and centered. 

(I would like to put a frame around them but I can't find a combination of diagram keywords that both sets the size at 400px and puts the frame. Any use of the |frame| keyword seems to ignore the |400px| keyword and goes to full width. I don't want to downsize and re-upload the images either... but I digress.)

Now, I get &amp; sympathize with wanting a &quot;hands on, wind in your hair, flying along treatise&quot; but you have to realize, you aren't going to be there to back it up. Maybe if you were giving a hands-on scope class you could get by with a few xerox sheets plus your own dynamic teaching style :-)  But this is the internet, you gotta picture some kid in Bangladesh or Sasketchawan trying to follow it. What is not in the book, will not be available. Yeah we want to do links, but I think every technical term you use, needs to be defined at least informally. 

When I asked about the &quot;bird&quot; versus &quot;planet&quot; versus &quot;galaxy&quot; scope I was thinking you were getting ready to explain how well-lit targets (birds, mountains) can get by with a smaller mirror but need a shorter focal length (your point about seeing feather detail only), while dimmer targets (galaxies) need a bigger mirror and a longer F, with planets and the moon in between. But I guess that also would &quot;interesting but irrelevant&quot;??? Given that you are going for a pie dish mirror, mirror size is pre-set. But focal length is still open to choice.

I'm thinking of moving your reflecting-sphere discussion up to this more theoretical section ahead of &quot;Thinking About Your Telescope&quot; -- comment?
[[User:fernly|fernly]]|[[User:fernly|Talk]] 16:38, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

Scratch that -- dumb idea. [[User:fernly|fernly]]|[[User:fernly|Talk]] 16:51, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

Too many &quot;mounts&quot; -- mount the mirrors in a mirror mounting but the scope is held by a scope mount... I'm going to try to reduce the number of use of mount/mounting to avoid ambiguity. Are you OK with speaking of a &quot;bracket&quot; to hold the mirror(s) and confine &quot;mount&quot; to the frame that holds the tube? [[User:fernly|fernly]]|[[User:fernly|Talk]] 17:03, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

Also I would like to use &quot;magnification&quot; instead of &quot;bigger image&quot; even tho it is a longer word. Reason is, &quot;bigger&quot; confuses me! To me, a &quot;bigger&quot; image is a WIDER field of view (you see more, more==bigger). But a long-focal-length image actually shows you a SMALLER piece of the sky (the bird feather detail again). But it would be just as confusing to say it's &quot;smaller&quot; hence, more magnified. Or think of another word... [[User:fernly|fernly]]|[[User:fernly|Talk]] 17:09, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

David, can you explain this sentence to me? &quot;The [short focal length] image is a bit smaller but that is rarely an issue when looking through the eyepiece.&quot; It seems to raise a problem and leave it hanging. Can I delete it? [[User:fernly|fernly]]|[[User:fernly|Talk]] 17:25, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

In the Sagitta calculation, you first had &quot;say you want a three foot telescope&quot; but later you actually work out a 48-inch focal length, so I am changing the first example to 4 feet. [[User:fernly|fernly]]|[[User:fernly|Talk]] 18:31, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

Finally (for today) I'm looking ahead and seeing a lot of dense prose in the &quot;making&quot; section, with no images. We Need Photos!!! Surely you've taken some pictures of mirror making? I don't want only to rely on external links. If you don't already have suitable pics, I hope you can arrange to make some soon. Run a class  or recruit a single kid and do it and take pics???

Fernly said .. &quot;Yeah we want to do links, but I think every technical term you use, needs to be defined at least informally.&quot; 

When you are right, you are right. I agree completely. But looking at other countries, do they even have pie plates? We should probably think about that and explore possible substitutes. Further down you make the point ..

&quot;Given that you are going for a pie dish mirror, mirror size is pre-set. But focal length is still open to choice.&quot; This bears on a couple of points in the book. I was going to have them use the existing curve with no modification. Adjusting focal length was not going to be part of the process. However, if they are using the bottom of a jug or some other short focus curve then we need to examine adjusting the focal length.

Mirrors are held in cells. The cells are mounted in tubes using brackets. The telescope tube is mounted in a bearing assembly that allows it to be moved and pointed. There is just alot of mounting in telescope making! That does not mean we cannot tinker with the lexicon. Thesaurus time .. MOUNT .. affix, frame .. Synonyms: emplace, exhibit, fit, install, place, position, prepare, produce, put in place, put on, set up, show, stage hmmmmmmmm

Mirrors are held in cells. The cells are put in place in a telescope tube or truss assembly and held in position with brackets. The entire telescope tube is put on a mount that allows it to be easily pointed in any direction.   How about that, work with that.

To me, a &quot;bigger&quot; image is a WIDER field of view (you see more, more==bigger). But a long-focal-length image actually shows you a SMALLER piece of the sky (the bird feather detail again). But it would be just as confusing to say it's &quot;smaller&quot; hence, more magnified. Or think of another word...&quot;

If I understand where you are in the book we are talking optics. The main difference between two mirrors of the same diameter but different focal lengths is the physical size of the image. It isn't magnification. The Airy Disk, the actual focused image, is larger and deeper on a long focal length than it is on a short focal length. A longer focal length means you have more data to work with so you can magnify the image a bit more, you could be a bit sloppy on your figuring and not affect the image. Conversely you must figure a short fl mirror very precisely because it will affect the image. Of course there is more to it than that but your larger field of view is the apparent field of view. The true angular field of view may not be that different between the two scopes. The apparent field of view is set by the eyepiece. So should we talk about that in the book? Airy's equations aren't that complex. Or maybe just use this  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disk

It is not really about magnification but your sentence does read smoother. And beginners do use the two terms interchangeably. I'd let it stand. If the book catches on there may be discussions about it but it is nice clean copy and I like it.

I posted the section on grinding. It is un-checked, un-edited but it is rewritten. I need to find the piece on polishing and figuring rewrite it and post it. I will do that in the next day or so. Both pieces need some illustrations and those I cannot find. I may have to redo them. Bear with me, I'll get them there.

[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] ([[User talk:Vorblesnak|talk]]) 05:32, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

I really wish you had not embedded so much text in your images. First off, Da Rules say there should be an alt= in every image to explain it and that's too much text to copy into the alt=. But also, text in a .png can't be edited or moved around. So, would you consider re-doing those diagrams to remove the text from them? Or I can do it. The words that apply directly to the image then go into the image caption, and the rest gets integrated into the preceding and following paragraph.

I have pulled this link out of the section I just edited, as the word is not referenced there. I'll put it back in after wherever it actually shows up, if it does.

Further on photos -- I don't know if you ever thought about using them, but they would be '''really, really''' useful. Worth &gt;&gt;1000 words to explain what a &quot;tool&quot; is, how grinding is done. Just get somebody, preferably someone of an age to be in the target audience, out to your garage actually doing this, and take a digital camera and shoot a bunch of pics.  Cheers, [[User:fernly|fernly]]|[[User:fernly|Talk]] 19:46, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

Photos do not print well, line drawing do, hence my predilection for line drawings. Sorry the images irritate, I try to make them stand on their own. I take it from your last posting the labels with arrows would be allowed but not the explanatory text. I will remove it.

Oh yeah, callouts with arrows, excellent.

As to photos: color pics may be a problem, if somebody just looks at a wiki page and clicks the print button on the browser. But wikibooks supports &quot;printer-friendly&quot; editions (see the Chess book on the home page) which is actually PDF. We can make color pics look great in a PDF, we have it incorporate the 300dpi version, not some little 512-pixel-wide, 72dpi thumbnail in the online version. That aside, I have more than once used photoshop to take a color pic and make it into a higher-contrast b&amp;w so that the key features stand out, even printed newspaper-style. That's the middle ground between photos and diagrams. Neither you nor me are illustrators who can make a nice drawing showing hands doing grinding. Maybe your network includes a technical illustrator? If not, pictures. [[User:fernly|fernly]]|[[User:fernly|Talk]] 21:24, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

Vignetting is found in the text associated with the drawing on sizing the tube.

Aha! that's why I couldn't find it with a '''search''' (another reason not to put text in a png!). 

I've made some significant changes in the &quot;Mirror Materials&quot; section. First off I found the US Mint page on coin dimensions, and they are metric, so I had to recast the whole sagitta-depth thing in millimeters. Also the pyrex dish I got from our kitchen is a nominal 10-inch, its bottom is exactly 8-inch. So I think the reader is about equally likely to find a nominal 9-inch (7-inch bottom) or 10-inch (8-inch bottom) so I wrote to accomodate that possibility.

When I &quot;ran the numbers&quot; as directed on my dish I got a 56-inch focal length, based on its measured depth (just short of a nickel, or 1.9mm)

However, now when I hold my dish at a shallow angle to the light I can see the bottom is not a smooth curve. It's more like this:

   --\____...____/--

There's a steepish curve in the outer 1-inch and then a shallower, almost flat curve across the bottom. The &quot;...&quot; is the raised lettering. So chances are by the time the curve is smooth, it will be deeper than 1.9mm hence a shorter F than 56 inches. Comment?

[[User:fernly|fernly]]|[[User:fernly|Talk]] 21:24, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

OK, keep in mind the section was written as a general guideline to help folks find materials. The coins may be in mm sizes but I took a pair of calipers to a hand full of change. The idea was to give them some basic tools to use to make decisions. You may have a couple of coins in your pocket and they can be used in this way to approximately guess at the sagitta. 

Yes, you will see some irregularities in the pressed shape of the plate bottom. And if you remember I cautioned against using a plate with a big hump in the middle. Look for one with a more homogeneous curve. But those flaws are why on a regular pie plate you end up with about a 7.5 inch mirror, +/- a 1/4 inch or so. As the grind progresses the area inside the foot, that raised rim, is what gets worked. Right there you lose 1/4 to 1/2 inch of diameter. And as you scrub the writing out and remove the casting artifacts from the glass the curve is deepened. It also depends on the tool used. A cast tool of close diameter will yield a deeper curve. An over sized tool will flatten the curve. A ring will act more like a same diameter.

Keep the verbiage casual and simple. You get too deep into splitting hairs about coin size and you will confuse them or scare them off.

[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] ([[User talk:Vorblesnak|talk]]) 17:01, 5 September 2009 (UTC)

So I cleaned up the three images in the area of secondary mirror sizing. I remembered I had added the text to the images because I wanted the text adjacent to the image, to the right or the left of the image, and could not get the XML to do that. There must be a command for that. The appropriate text is now above or below the image. Hope fully you know how to get the text where I would like it.

[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] ([[User talk:Vorblesnak|talk]]) 18:02, 5 September 2009 (UTC)

OK I used two-cell tables to put the text beside the 3 images. I'm not totally happy with how it looks but it isn't bad. Oh, and shall we do the ROC drawing earlier same way? Thanks for making that change, and thanks for the pictures you sent. [[User:fernly|fernly]]|[[User:fernly|Talk]] 19:35, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

&quot;We cannot use tempered glass as it shatters when ground&quot; ''aghhhh!'' We '''must''' tell people a reliable way to identify such glass! Otherwise it would be like saying &quot;go pick mushrooms to eat, and oh by the way don't pick any death caps...&quot; Is the rather cryptic sentence about polarized glasses the method of identifying tempered glass?

I sense an experience has occurred.  Care to share?

No, you cannot use tempered glass .. yes the cryptic sentence about polarized sun glasses does refer to that. Polarized sunglasses will reveal a dark areas or zones or spots in tempered glass, or glass with strain entrained in the glass. Get a pair and go look at the side windows of your car. You will see a pattern of dark spots in the glass. That is strain, that is bad. Don't grind that.

The classic method of identifying tempered glass is to use two polarizing lenses, one one each side of the glass. Light shines through the back lens, through the glass and is viewed through the front lens. Tempering is revealed as the front lens is rotated. It shows up as a series of dark zones.

Now the interesting thing is, pie plates use to be fine annealed pyrex, hence my choice to push those for mirror blanks. However I have discovered pyrex is now just a marketing term and the bakeware is probably not made by Corning and is probably not true pyrex, though it may be a hardened borosilicate. So the caveat about tempered glass should be at the start of the finding your mirror section not buried in the other parts section. I originally felt safe about pie plates, now I am not certain. Old scratched up pie plates are very probably pyrex and can be handled without concern.  New stuff?? Lokk for strain.

Here is a link to a good page on strain ...   http://www.public.asu.edu/~aomdw/GSI/Glass_Strain.html

[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] ([[User talk:Vorblesnak|talk]]) 01:33, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

I moved the tempered-glass discussion up in the glass-finding section and gave it a heading. I think the experience of seeing spots in a car window thru polaroid shades is common enough it should be understandable.

I edited the tool-making section. I moved some things around for more logical order; you had the grinding surface preceding the casting/shaping of the base, and I thought making the base should come first. I added some more cautions on breaking up a pie plate for glass (I could just see some enthusiastic 12-year-old with a hammer and no eye protection..)

The paragraph about your friend with the bubbling pitch lap seems a bit of a digression, consider deleting it or saving it for some later section (&quot;troubleshooting&quot;?). Also I didn't understand the remark in it, the cure for a wet tool was to soak it? Seemed counter-intuitive...

I installed one of your pictures. When I look at them closely they were not really in sharp focus. I sharpened the one as much as I could in photoshop, but if you should happen to be standing around the shop with a digicam in your hand you might have another go at it. Also, I didn't have much info for the caption. What's the casting material of the one on the right and the big one in the back? Plaster? What's that big one for, it looks like 15-inch or bigger, wow. 21:35, 8 September 2009 (UTC)


Good work on the tempered glass and the warning about breaking up the pie plate ..

&quot;The paragraph about your friend with the bubbling pitch lap seems a bit ...&quot;  Not enough development of the argument for it to make sense. The classic cast tool was called a tile tool. The original idea was to lay tiles on the glass and cast dental plaster for the body of the tool. The dental plaster wraps around the tiles and binds them. The problem with these tools is they are thirsty. They absorb water from the grinding wet and dry out the process, at least until you slake their thirst. The common fix is to soak the tool before using it. This works fine if you are grinding, a very wet process. However all that stored moisture causes the pitch to fall off when you cast the lap on the tool for polishing. Some folks combat this by using a different backer for the pitch lap.  I said screw that. I cast the backer and then glue glass on for a grinding surface. No water absorbtion and the pitch sticks to a fully dry tool.

re: the pictures. I am not a photographer, but I know one and I am on his schedule. The picture was to show finished laps, one under construction and materials. The casting material is rapid setting grout. IT is ready to use in one hour. You can cast the backer from anything that will pour and harden, I don't like plaster. Dental plaster is OK. Concrete works fine, The big tool is for the mirror that is under it. A 22 inch 7 segment tessellated blank. That is a proof for a 2 meter project this winter.

[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] ([[User talk:Vorblesnak|talk]]) 02:53, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

OK I have edited all the available text to my satisfaction at least. I am going to be travelling for a few weeks but will check in periodically when I have a good wi-fi connection and some time to kill. Meantime you can be writing! Filling in the sections that currently have a heading only.

I would like to say how much I am enjoying this book as I read it closely. It is chock-full of solid practical advice, as you intend. I think when it is filled out it will be an impressive resource and will inspire lots of telescope making.

THINGS TO THINK HARD ABOUT:

One, what really to do with links. There is not a consistent method of placing links. Take John Dobson. I stuck in a link to his Wikipedia page at the end of the first section where you quote him. But he's quoted several other places. The reader might remember there was a link but would have a hard time finding it. So I repeated it along with links to Bartels and Oiton whom you refer to, after the intro to grinding.

On the one hand, my instinct is to do inline links, just make a hyperlink out of anything like Dobson, or the U.S. Mint -- as you would do in a web page. But that apparently is not the wikibooks style. OR-- put all the links in one single =Links= topic at the end, and liberally use &quot;(see Links)&quot; throughout the text. Right now there are little blobs of links at the ends of topics which is kind of the worst of both worlds.

TWO, the outline! Now that all the headings are ==wiki-style== they show up in the TOC, which is rather impressively long. No doubt the book should be split into chapters but I'm not sure we are ready. The problem that keeps bugging me, tho I have no solution yet, is that logically speaking, almost everything is a sub-topic of &quot;Project 1: The Newtonian Reflector.&quot; Only the last main topic, &quot;The Telescope Mount,&quot; is really generic to almost any kind of amateur scope. Much of the mirror-making part is also generic, I suppose. But all the secondary-mounting part is Newtonian.

I guess the main issue here is, do you intend to write a &quot;Project 2: The some-other-kind-of-scope&quot;?  (and BTW, I put in a vote here for a Schiefspiegler if you do) Because if so, then you need to think about how to pull out the mirror-making text that would be generic. Then we can have an intro, a generic chapter on mirror-making, a generic chapter on scope mounts, and a specific chapter on each &quot;Project&quot;.

THREE, missing, even as empty headings: (1) how to grind a flat mirror (2) how to silver a mirror. Insert those headings where you think they should go.

Cheers,

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

'''Qt''' is a cross-platform application development framework, widely used for the development of graphical user interface programs, and, since the release of Qt 4, also used for developing non-GUI programs such as console tools and servers. Qt is most notably used in KDE, Qtopia and OPIE. It is produced by the Norwegian company Trolltech, formerly Quasar Technologies and was later bought by Nokia. Trolltech insiders pronounce Qt as &quot;cute&quot;.

[[Image:Qt-designer-v4.2.1.png|thumb|The Qt designer used for GUI designing]]

Qt uses standard C++, but extends the language by providing an additional pre-processor that converts Qt's extensions into pure C++.
Qt can also be used by programmers using other languages; bindings exist for Python (PyQt), Ruby, PHP, C, Perl, Pascal, and Java (Jambi). It runs on all major platforms, and has extensive internationalization support. Non-GUI features include SQL database access, XML parsing, thread management, and a unified cross-platform API for file handling.

=== Varieties ===

Qt is released by Trolltech on the following ''platforms'':

* '''Qt/X11''' &amp;mdash; Qt for X Window System
* '''Qt/Mac''' &amp;mdash; Qt for Apple MacOS X
* '''Qt/Windows''' &amp;mdash; Qt for Microsoft Windows
* '''Qt/Embedded''' &amp;mdash; Qt for embedded platforms (PDA, Smartphone, ...)
* '''Qt/Jambi''' &amp;mdash; Qt for Java platform Development.

There are four ''editions'' of Qt available on each of these platforms, namely:

* '''Qt Console''' &amp;mdash; edition for ''non-GUI'' development. 
* '''Qt Desktop Light''' &amp;mdash; entry level GUI edition, stripped of network and database support.
* '''Qt Desktop ''' &amp;mdash; complete edition.
* '''Qt Open Source Edition''' &amp;mdash; complete edition for open source developers.

The first three editions are released under a commercial license which permits closed source development; while the Open Source edition is available under the GPL license, and the LGPL (starting with version 4.5) and additionally under the [[w:Q Public License|Q Public License]] (QPL) for the Qt/X11 version.

In case of the X11 platform, the QPL allows the final application to be licensed under various open source licenses, such as the LGPL or the Artistic license. For the Windows and Mac OS X platforms, the GPL is the only Open Source license available so the applications developed with it must be GPL as well. 

All editions support a wide range of compilers, including the GCC C++ compiler. Official support for the Visual Studio suite is, however, restricted to the  commercial Qt/Windows edition. The [http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtwin/ Q../Free] project has released several patches which add support for Microsoft Visual Studio and Borland C++ Builder to the open-source version of Qt/Windows.

=== Current ===

Trolltech released Qt 4 on June 28, 2005 and introduced five new technologies in the framework:

* '''''Tulip''''' A set of template container classes.
* '''''Interview''''' A model/view architecture for item views.
* '''''Arthur''''' A 2D painting framework.
* '''''Scribe''''' A Unicode text renderer with a public API for performing low-level text layout.
* '''''MainWindow''''' A modern action-based main window, toolbar, menu, and docking architecture.

Qt 4 is dual-licensed under GPL and proprietary licenses on all supported platforms including Windows (while Qt/Windows 3.3 is only released under a proprietary license).

Qt 4.1, released on December 19, 2005, introduced integrated SVG Tiny support, a PDF backend to Qt's printing system, and a few other features.

Qt 4.2, released on October 4, 2006, introduced native CSS support for widget styling, as well as the QGraphicsView framework for efficient rendering of thousands of 2D objects onscreen, to replace Qt 3.x's QCanvas class.

=== History ===

Haavard Nord and Eirik Chambe-Eng (the original developers of Qt and the CEO and President of Trolltech respectively) began development of &quot;Qt&quot; in 1991, three years before the company was incorporated as Quasar Technologies, then changed the name to Troll Tech, and then to Trolltech.

The toolkit was called Qt because the letter Q looked beautiful in Haavard's Emacs font, and T was inspired by Xt, the X toolkit.

Controversy erupted around 1998 when it became clear that KDE was going to become one of the leading desktop environments for GNU/Linux. As KDE was based on Qt, many people in the open source and free software movements were worried that an essential piece of one of their major operating systems would be proprietary. 

This gave rise to two efforts: the Harmony toolkit which sought to duplicate the Qt Toolkit under a free software license and the GNOME desktop that was meant to supplant KDE entirely. The GNOME Desktop uses the GTK+ toolkit which was written for the GIMP, and mainly uses the C programming language.

Until version 1.45, source code for Qt was released under the FreeQt license &amp;mdash; which was viewed as not compliant to the open source principle by the Open Source Initiative and Free Software Foundation because while the source was available it did not allow the redistribution of modified versions. With the release of version 2.0 of the toolkit, the license was changed to the  QPL, a free software license but one regarded by the Free Software Foundation as incompatible with the GPL. Compromises were sought between KDE and Trolltech wherein Qt would not be able to fall under a more restrictive license than the QPL, even if Trolltech was bought out or went bankrupt. This led to the creation of the KDE Free Qt foundation, which guarantees that Qt would fall under a BSD license should no open source version of Qt be released during 12 months.

The first versions of Qt had only two flavors: Qt/X11 for Unix and Qt/Windows for the Windows platform. The Windows platform was only available under the commercial license. In the end of 2001, Trolltech released Qt 3.0 which added support for the Mac OS X platform. The Mac OS X support was available only in the commercial license, until June 2003, where Trolltech released the version 3.2 with Mac OS X support available under the GPL license.

In 2002 members of the KDE on Cygwin project began porting the GPL licensed Qt/X11 code base to Windows. This was in response to Trolltech's refusal to license Qt/Windows under the GPL on the grounds that Windows was not an open-source platform. The project achieved reasonable success although it never reached production quality. Qt/Windows 4 was released under the GPL by Trolltech in June 2005. Qt4 now supports the same set of platforms in the Open Source editions as in the commercial edition.

=== Design ===

The innovation of Qt when it was first released relied on a few key concepts.

==== Complete abstraction of the GUI ====

Qt uses its own paint engine and controls. This makes the work of porting to other platforms easier because very few classes in Qt depended really on the target platform. Qt used to emulate the native look of its intended platforms, which occasionally led to slight discrepancies where that emulation wasn't perfect. This, however, no longer applies because the latest versions of Qt use the native styles API of the different platforms to draw the Qt controls.

==== Meta Object Compiler ====

Known as the ''moc'', this is a tool that one must run on the sources of a Qt program prior to compiling it. The tool will generate &quot;Meta
Information&quot; about the classes used in the program. This meta information is used by Qt to provide programming features not available in C++:
introspection and the signals and slots|signal/slot system.

The use of an additional tool has been criticised by part of the C++ community, stating that Qt programming is making a mockery of C++. In particular, the choice of an implementation based on macros has been criticized for its absence of type safety. Some people confused the macros with new C++ keywords, and criticized the pollution of the namespace. This is viewed by Trolltech as a necessary trade-off to provide introspection and dynamically generated slots or signals. Further, when Qt 1.x was released, consistency between compiler template implementations could not be relied upon.

The use of ''moc'' allows for a very flexible signal/slot messaging system, so that multiple signals can connect to multiple slots, to other signals, or to slots on different threads, in a &quot;callback safe&quot; manner.

==Examples==
* [http://mndynamics.com/indexp.html Mandel] is an interactive, multiplatform and multilingual  program  by Wolf Jung for drawing the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets, and for illustrating and researching their mathematical properties. It's graphical user interface is based on Qt. It is available on Linux, Unix, Windows, and Mac. The source code is available under the GNU General Public License.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is possible to use the JavaPlaybackManager to load test your WO apps, but you will likely be frustrated by bugs and lack of features.  A much more robust and feature-full utility is Apache Jakarta's [http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/ JMeter]

WebObjects, being less well-known, is not fully supported out-of-the-box, so we will need a bit of help with:
* URL-stored session IDs
* instance IDs

Happily, these two critical pieces of information can be retrieved in a single step by adding a Regular Expression Extractor to the first HTTP Request node that hits your application.  Use a regular expression like this:

  /cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp.woa/([-0-9]+)/wo/([^/]+)

And a template like this:

  $1$$2$

Set Match No. to 1 and Default Value to &quot;&quot; (blank).  Then, set the Reference Name to whatever name you want to use, for example, &quot;sessionid&quot;.  The instance number will then be available to future test steps as ${sessionid_g1} and the session ID as ${sessionid_g2}.  Your second HTTP Request, for example, might have a URL of:

  /cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyApp.woa/${sessionid_g1}/wo/${sessionid_g2}/0.0.13.3

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

Warning: The possession and use of cannabis is forbidden in many countries. '''Please read the wikibooks [[Wikibooks:Risk disclaimer|risk disclaimer]] before attempting to follow this recipe.'''


== Ingredients ==

* 300[[Cookbook:Gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] chips 
* 180[[Cookbook:Liter|ml]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] 
* 250g self-raising [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] 
* 60g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] 
* a [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]  
* 5ml [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] 
* 4g [[Cookbook:Cannabis|cannabis]]
* grated [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]

== Procedure ==

In order to properly extract the THC from the cannabis, it is necessary to melt the butter and add finely chopped greens.  Cook slowly at a low temperature for a long time.  Depending on preference, one can strain the remaining organic matter out with cheese cloth or something similar.  Then simply mix your green butter in brownie batter with special batter and Voila! magic brownies.  Cook in an oven at 360 &amp;deg;F/180 &amp;deg;C for about 20-25 minutes.  This recipe should make about 9 medium-sized magic brownies.

== Different Methods ==

For a different style, why not try using brown cane sugar instead of normal sugar?  Also, melt some chocolate, mix with a little sugar, vanilla and lemon with a little more weed, drizzle on the freshly cooked brownies for a little added flavour and high.  This creates a nicer tasting brownie with more of a kick.

You can also try adding a few crushed up biscuits before cooking for a more varied taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Relative clauses are used to expand sentences and provide extra information.

* I live with my mother.
* I live with my mother, who's very strict.

The second sentence is a relative clause.  It uses a relative pronoun (who) to provide extra information about the object of the sentence (mother).  In English you have a choice of relative pronouns to use.  The following section lists the most common relative pronouns.

== Who (or that) ==

Who is used to refer to people.

== Which (or that) ==

Which is used to refer to object (including animals).

== Where ==

Where is used to refer to places.

== Whose ==

Who is used with people when you are referring to an object which is owned / possessed by that person.

== When ==

When is used to refer to times and occasions.

      <comment>/* Plural Formation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally, making plurals (more than 1 of something) is very easy in English.

== Plural Formation ==

For almost all nouns we form the plural by adding '''s'''.

* I have an apple
* I have 5 apple'''s.'''

For nouns which end with the letter '''y''' we form the plural by removing the '''y''' and adding '''ies'''.

* I have a fly
* I have 5 fl'''ies.'''

For nouns which end with the letter '''s''' (dress), '''ch''' (beach), '''x''' (box), '''sh''' (bush) or '''z''' (quiz), we form the plural by adding '''es'''.

* I have a bus.
* I have 5 bus'''es.'''

There are also a small number of nouns which are very irregular.  The first word in the following list is the singular form and the second word is the plural form:

* child - children
* man - men
* woman - women
* foot - feet
* tooth - teeth
* goose - geese
* mouse - mice
* fish - fish
* sheep - sheep
* deer - deer

As you can see, with some words there is no change to form the plural. The plural form and the singular form are exactly the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Not needed/too complicated ==

Bose-Einstein Condensates are far to advanced and complicated to be easily explained in a children's book. If we explain this we should explain Super-solids and super-liquids, which would turn this book more about physics and states of matter rather than about elements.
[[User:N1person|N1person]] 00:17, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

== Not convinced, yet. ==

I disagree, I'm not totally convinced. You could quite possibly be right, but The original author included B-E condensates as one of the five states of matter. So I created and extrapolated it. Perhaps you could contribute to the project and rectify it? Cheers --[[User:Read-write-services|Read-write-services]] 04:16, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

== Too complicated, too esoteric ==

I think that for 8-12 year olds, this is more than a bit too advanced. I see no reason to include this, because it would be very difficult for children to relate to.

== Not appropriate for this age level ==

The reading level and concept load of this is too high for this age level. Suggest dropping it from this book.

* I agree. 

* Perhaps just mentioning that there are other states of matter and talking about how they differ from the &quot;big 4&quot; states in an article called something like &quot;other states of matter&quot; might be a good idea. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:55, 6 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Spiders in the United States are generally harmless, with several exceptions. The most notable  are the black widow and brown recluse spiders. Their bites are serious but rarely fatal.

Bites by non-poisonous spiders should be treated the same as insect bites.  Bites by poisonous spiders should be treated as follows:
# Place ice over the bite to reduce pain. 
# Hospitalize victims who are under 16 or over 65 for observation. 
# Be prepared to give antivenin in severe cases.

Carefully  straighten  the  injured  limb.  Immobilize the fracture by placing a padded board under  the  injured  limb.  The  board  should  be  at least 4 inches wide and should reach from the but- tock  to  the  heel.  Place  extra  padding  under  the knee and just above the heel, as shown in the illustration.  Use  strips  of  bandage  to  fasten  the  leg  to the board in four places: (1) just below the knee; (2) just above the knee; (3) at the ankle; and (4) at  the  thigh.  DO  NOT  COVER  THE  KNEE ITSELF. Swelling is likely to occur very rapidly, and  any  bandage  or  tie  fastened  over  the  knee would quickly become too tight. Treat the victim for  shock  and  evacuate  as  soon  as  possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__

== Generation of the tone==
Just like why rockers would want an electrical guitar and Marshall amps, the reason why most people want to play play through the amplifier is the tonal quality. Using the same analogy, people would be searching all over the place for said tone: wanting a certain microphone, with a certain amp, and when they found out it still sounded different from the idol that they like, they are trying to figure out ways to customize it in order to achieve that sound...

Let's wait for a second there. What is &quot;that sound&quot;?

Surprisingly, the composition of a sound come mainly from a player themselves; in fact, according to some players, it's 95.5% of his sound. A player is the one that decided which notes to play (intonation), when to play such note (timing), and any other techniques such as vibrato and tremolo. Amplification and effect units may change the notes, but it just change whatever notes you play. If you already sound bad, the effect units and amplifier will only make it even worse!

Obviously, a badly tuned instrument is going to sound bad. However, even if you have a fine tuned instrument, if you are coughing and hacking into the harmonica, you are gonna sound bad, while a poorly tuned instrument can be temporary rescued with sufficient knowledge (though player should still get it in tuned ASAP!)

Well, that would be it for acoustic playing; however, for those that want to play it loudly, or simply want the tone, that will note be enough. 

===Do you actually need amplifier?===
But before you go on, you have to ask yourself: do you actually need that certain setup — Bullet mic and Fender Blues Junior, for example. Obviously, if you are playing live, or practicing for playing live, you will need a microphone and some kind of amplification. However, that doesn't mean you have to get a certain microphone with certain amplifier — if at all! With research, it is found out that Little Walter, who is the basis of the typical &quot;Chicago Blues sound&quot; (and what many harmonicist want to copy), didn't really care what amplifier he used or even what microphone he used... since the main purpose is ''' to be able to play loud'''. At one gig, he may have used a JT-30 hooked into a P.A. amplifier. At another, he may have used a custom made (meaning you cannot buy it no matter what). During an interview, Walter also stated that he liked one &quot;just as good as a P.A. system&quot;. Also, there is no evidence that Little Walter used any effect units (which was not even available during Walter's time), and he himself said he didn't know how those effects got onto his records. As for the microphones? During tours, he ended up playing and singing with whatever was available in the venue. Though while he did use the JT-30 bullet microphone (or a biscuit microphone, which has the same element), at one time he brought his own microphone, he used a Shure 777-x, a small, marker-sized microphone. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Little Walter biography  | url = http://www.littlewalter.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So what this all basically sums up to is that to simply play live, '''you simply play loud.''' Anything that can amplify the sound loudly over the room is basically good enough to play live. Stating you need bullet mic and Blues Junior is like saying you must dress up in some certain ways to perform (Okay, maybe metal, but we are talking about Little Walter's sound, not Black Sabbath). What makes Little Walter one of the best is the fact that he could create music, by himself — not whatever equipment he have.

As for recording, you do not need a good effect unit or amplifier, either, especially if you are using your computer. Many modern computer audio workstations, including Audacity, have numerous effects to produce the sound you want. For recording, it would be far better to ground the equipment and use a mic that can capture clean sounds.

On the other hand, if you truly want to deliver a certain sound that is to be your hallmark (e.g.: Metal Harmonica), read on.

== Microphone ==
Based on the above analysis, the microphone would be the most important aspect, next to the tone and then instrument. Afterall, a P.A. amplifier is supposed to be very clean, thus any distortion would be likely from the microphone.

===Type of Microphones===
There are three ways to sort the type of microphones: the capturing element, impedance, and by design.

====Element classifications====
*'''dynamic'''
*'''capacitor'''
*'''ribbon'''

====Impedance====
Okay, there are just two kinds: high impedance, and low impedance.

====Shape classification====
*'''Standard''' and '''pen'''
*'''Bullet''' The standard harmonica microphone, it can easily double as a vocal microphone.
*'''Ball'''
*'''mini/lapel''' While they may have different shapes, they are all basically really small, no larger than a finger joint. Due to the smaller nature, its element isn't as good, and thus will provide lots of distortion, which could be good or bad depend on situations.
*'''Coverall clip-on''' For chromatic harmonica, coverall would be the best choice, since your hands do not need to support the microphone, while its cup-shape that covers the entire opening is able to capture all the sounds. Unfortunately, due to the decline needs of chromatic in North America, it's hard to find an overall microphone. However, over at Taiwan, they have manufactured a coverall design that clips over any 16-holes chromatics. Keep in mind that due to this, it can only be used by harmonica in most case.

===How to hold the microphone ===
Obviously, for coverall, you just need to clip onto the harmonica, and that's that.

For mini/lapel microphones, all you have to do is to slip the head between two fingers, and hold them there. Some will actually have ergonomic holders, such as the Harmonica Honker[http://www.harmonicahonker.com], but otherwise the principle is the same for all of them.

For standard, pen, bullet, and ball, you need to hold that big thingamajig, and then cup it. Place two fingers around the mic to create an air pocket.

== Amplifier ==
Although it is a simple matter to walk into the first music shop you see and pick out a guitar amplifier (&quot;amp&quot;) at random, you will probably be unsatisfied with the results of this method. If you take a couple of mintues to figure out what you are shopping for, you will be able to make a purchase that you will enjoy for years to come.&lt;br&gt;

=== Size and Wattage ===
Determine the size of the amp you will need. Amps are rated by wattage rather than physical size (although high-wattage amps do tend to be physically larger). By wattage, there are essentially three main categories of guitar amplifiers (combos, heads, and rack-mounted amplifiers), with several subcategories:
==== Combo Amps ====
'''Combo''' (combination) amps combine the amplifier electronics with one or more speakers in a one-piece package. They are the alternative to &quot;heads,&quot; which contain only the electronics, and are attached to separate speaker packages (known as &quot;cabinets&quot; or &quot;cabs&quot;). Because it is a one-piece unit, the combo design is generally preferred for smaller, lower-wattage amps. The following are the most common varieties of combo amp:

[[Image:Marshall_ms2_amp.jpg|frame|''Marshall MS-2 - a tiny micro amp with real Marshall tone'']]  
* '''Micro/Headphone amps''': 1-10 watts. These are tiny, ultra-portable amps which are useful for practice on the go (or when others are trying to sleep), and is usually best for using with a headphone. They don't pack enough volume to be used in most &quot;jam&quot; situations (where you must be heard above other musicians). As a rule, their sound quality tends to be poor (when compared to larger amps). The Marshall MS-2 is an example of a super-portable (1 watt) micro amp which has received good reviews. 

[[Image:fender_blues_jr.jpg|frame|''Fender Blues Junior - a popular practice amp'']]
* '''Practice amps''': 10-30 watts. Practice amps are also suited for the bedroom/living room environment, although the loudest of them may be used for small gigs (performances), especially if a microphone is used to run them through the venue's PA system. As with micro amps, practice amps tend to compare unfavorably to larger units in terms of sound quality, although as they approach the 30 watt level, a few models offer increasingly competitive sound. As a general rule, the best practice amps have at least a 10 inch speaker. This is the smallest speaker size which is generally considered a &quot;real speaker.&quot; If you don't have a 10 inch (or larger) speaker, don't try to use the amp outside the bedroom. The embarrassment you save will be your own. These usually cost around 60 to 150 dollars. For most beginners, a 15 watt amp will be more than enough for your bedroom and small gigs. 

* '''&quot;Busking&quot; amps''': In essence, they are practice amps that have a battery attached. Naturally, that means they are gonna be more expensive. 15 watts on average, but Pignose Hog 30 can go to 30 watts.  They will usually provide 6 to 10 hours in one charge. Also, make sure they can take AC power in too when needed. Do note that they are actually quite weak, especially considering that any automobile's noise easily drowns it out. On the other hand, rock and metal music is not exactly busking music, either — soft and light music that add to the atmosphere (usually a park or something) is usually preferred, and thus, the watt amounts is usually enough.

[[Image:1x12combo.jpg|frame|''Crate 1x12 combo amp'']]
* '''Full-size 1x12 combos''': With 50 or more watts of power and one 12 inch speaker, the 1x12 amp offers the smallest package which is considered suitable as a stand-alone amplifier for small gigs. In better models, sound quality begins to approach levels acceptable to professional musicians. Quality is always important, but perhaps even more so in the case of the 1x12 combo - with a good one, you'll prove the doubters wrong, but with one of the many duds, you won't be taken seriously. The 1x12 is not a big amp, and if you want to bring it to a serious audition or gig without enduring a storm of eye-rolling and chuckling, it had better stand out from the crowd. These cost about 180 to 450 dollars.

[[Image:2x12combo.jpg|frame|''Crate 2x12 combo amp'']] 
* '''2x12 combos''' are similar to 1x12 combos, but they add a second 12 inch speaker. The 2x12 design is considerably heavier and bulkier than the 1x12, but it is still a favorite choice of working musicians for performances at small to medium-sized venues. The addition of a second speaker allows for certain stereo effects, and two speakers simply move more air than one (allowing more &quot;presence&quot; in your sound). The 2x12 amp is  small enough to be used in the living room, light enough to be lugged around by someone without major back problems, and yet formidable enough to be taken seriously at rehearsals, auditions, and even on stage. If you have to buy a single amp for practice, rehearsals, and club gigs, a 2x12 is a good choice. You'll occasionally slip and set the volume knob a bit too high (annihilating your unfortunate neighbors), and you'll be tempted to gripe about lugging 50-80 pounds worth of amp all over the place, but it will all be worthwhile when you avoid being &quot;The Guy Who Showed Up to the Audition or Gig With a Practice Amp.&quot; That guy usually becomes an &quot;inside story&quot; for the band to tell other musicians when everybody needs a laugh. These cost about 180 to 450 dollars.

There are other types of combos, but these are the mainstays. Having discussed them, we are ready to move on to heads and stacks.

==== Heads, Cabinets, and Stacks ====
A '''head''' is an amplifier without speakers. A '''cabinet''' (&quot;cab&quot;) is a stand-alone speaker enclosure, which can be connected to a head. A '''stack''' is a head and a set of cabinets connected together, ready for use. Stacks are generally preferred for gigs rather than practice, although there's no rule against having an enormous stack in your living room - if your family allows it. Fair warning: in most cases, they won't. Stacks are physically bulky, very heavy, and devastatingly '''LOUD.''' These are the tools of musicians who either play arenas and stadiums on a regular basis - or at least dream of doing so. 

When purchasing the two, make sure of the ohmage of the cabinet match with the power rating for the head at that ohmage. Make sure the cabs RMS rating is about the same as the head's power output at the ohmage of the cab. A head can be solid-state or tube, the latter being less durable, but sounds better and is more expensive. A good solid-state head costs 200 to 600 dollars and a good tube head costs 500 to 1400 dollars. A cab in a half stack should be a 1x15, a 2x12, a 4x10 or a 6x10. These typically range from 250 to 650 dollars.

[[Image:Amp_head.jpg|frame|''Soldano head - a high-end amplifier'']]
[[Image:Half_stack.jpg|frame|''Marshall half stack - a perennial favorite'']]
*'''Heads''' are all roughly the same size physically, but they come in a variety of wattages. &quot;Small&quot; heads pack 50-100 watts. Full-power heads are generally 100 watts or more. There are also super heads, boasting a tinnitus-inducing 200-400 watts of power. For performances at small to medium-size venues, a small head is more than enough. The smaller heads are often connected to a single 4x12 cabinet (which contains four 12 inch speakers, as the name suggests). This type of setup is known as a &quot;half stack,&quot; and it is a favorite of working musicians. The half stack offers plenty of volume, the presence of four speakers, and the &quot;credibility&quot; associated with stacks.

[[Image:Full_stack.jpg|frame|''Full Marshall Stack - the tower of power (half stack in foreground)'']]
*The '''full stack''' is the dream of many a guitarist. This is usually a 100 watt head connected to two 4x12 cabinets, although other wattages are sometimes employed. The cabinets are stacked vertically (one on top of the other), giving the setup its distinctive name. A full stack is as tall as a grown man, making for quite an impressive sight. The sound is equally impressive. If you set one of these up in your living room and play it to its full capabilities, you will be evicted from the neighborhood (unless you are an isolated hermit). A full stack can handle all but the very largest of venues. Guitarists who are truly sadistic (in a sonic sense), such as some heavy metal players, may run one of the 200-400 watt super heads through a full stack. With any full stack (and especially the &quot;hot rod&quot; setups), you will require ear protection to play at higher volumes without sustaining potentially serious ear damage. 

Stacks are great for playing big venues (and for impressing your friends), but if you aren't a working or touring musician, they can be &quot;overkill&quot; for most situations. Lugging around full-size 4x12 speaker cabinets is hard work, fit only for &quot;roadies&quot; who are getting paid to do it. Showing up to an audition with a full stack and a hand truck to set it up can be almost as bad as showing up with a practice amp. If you lug in a stack, you'd better have the skills to justify it, or (once again), you'll become another &quot;inside story&quot; for the band to chuckle about after rehearsal - &quot;The Newbie Guy Who Brought a Full Stack to the Audition.&quot;

In anycase, for harmonica players, anything that is bigger than combo is overkill.

==== Rack-Mounted Products ====
Many musicians use &quot;racks,&quot; usually a reinforced metal box with removable panels on the front and back.  The front side of the rack, when open, has two verticale rows of threaded screw holes on the sides.  Rack sizes  have been standardized for years -- they are made to fit ALL rack-moutable units, including recording gear, PA amplifiers, vocal processors, chromatic tuners, DJ gear, etc. in addition to guitar amps.  Rack-mounted products have a sturdy metal face plate strong enough to support the entire product; they are a standard width, a standard maximum depth, and are usually much shorter than they are tall or deep.  The face plate is wider than the rest of the unit and has screw holes on each corner, spaced to line up with the screw holes on the front of any rack.  To attach gear to the rack, lay your rack on its backside, place the unit in the rack so that the unit dangles down into the rack, its entire weight supported by the face plate, line it up with the screw holes, and fasten it at each corner with properly-sized screws.  The smallest rack products are the shortest, covering only two screw holes -- these are said to take up &quot;one rack space.&quot;  A larger product that covers up four screw holes on your rack takes up &quot;two rack spaces,&quot; and so on.  To figure out how many spaces a rack has, count the screw holes on one side and divide it by two.

A rack-mounted guitar amplifier rig is similar to heads in that they have separate amplifier components that are plugged into external speaker cabinets.  But nearly all rack-mounted amplifiers are broken down into two further categories -- the '''pre-amp''' and the '''power amp'''.  Both heads and combos have these separate components as well -- racks merely separate them out into two units.  Most major amplifier manufacturers, including Marshall, Carvin, Mesa-Boogie, and Peavey make rack-mountable amp rigs.

*'''The Pre-Amp''' shapes the signal entering your amplifier into a tone.  In its basic form, a pre-amp defines the levels of treble, bass, and middle in your tone.  However, functions such as gain, presence, and contour have become standard features of modern guitar amplifiers, and rack-mountable pre-amps usually have many more functions indeed -- they are essentially effects processors.  Footpedal multi-effects processors are also pre-amps.  Plug your guitar into the pre-amp.  Most rack pre-amps only take up one rack space.

*'''The Power Amp''' is connected to the pre-amp by a speaker cable.  It takes the signal the pre-amp shaped and gives it volume.  Like heads, power amps are available in different sizes, from a minimum of 50 watts to monster 200-400W power amps.  100W or larger power amps will take up two rack spaces.  The power amp plugs into the speaker cab like on a head.  However, as many power amps as you want can be connected in a daisy chain or to different pre-amp outputs to boost the power of the signal, as well as possibly blend the tonal influences of two different power amps. 

'''Disadvantages of Rack Rigs.'''  As you can probably tell, racks are frequently very complicated rigs.  A novice guitarrist may find them perplexing.  They are also heavier and bulkier than heads -- and add onto that the bulk and heft of the rack itself.  Since you need to buy multiple products and accessories, the price for a new rack rig can be (but isn't always) higher than that of a head.

'''Advantages of Rack Rigs.'''  On the other hand, using a rack allows you to mix and match products by different manufacturers and find a tone that is distinctly &quot;yours,&quot; not the boutique design concept of some engineer at Marshall or Fender.  And if you have a reasonably good mind for engineering or basic spatial sequencing (i.e. lining things up in order), even complicated digital pre-amps can be surprisingly user-friendly, providing a more easy-to-understand interface than a row of inscrutable knobs on the front of a head or combo.  If you are already a DJ, vocalist, or recording artist, or want to become any one of these, many valuable products are available that can be mounted right on the same rack with your amplifier.  

Also, big racks frequently have caster wheels, making them very easy to roll around, and having a rack can also simplify pre-gig or -practise setup.  Instead of having to plug in all your components from scratch, your components can already be plugged in and ready to go as soon as you wheel your rack onto the stage or into the studio and remove the front and back panels.  A rack-mountable power conditioner (essentially a rack-mounted power strip with surge protection) can be invaluable to this end as most rack units are independently powered -- simply plug all your products into the conditioner, then whenever you arrive at a gig or practice, plug in the one master power cable from the conditioner, plug in your speaker cab and guitar, switch everything on, and you're ready to rock.  If you have pedals, microphones, etc., you can usually fit them into the rack as well, making it your all-purpose, highly-portable gig box (provided that it's on wheels).

Finally, racks are uncommon, and will attract attention.  People will be impressed if you wheel a rack rig into rehearsal or performance, but beware -- they will expect you to be a seasoned guitarrist, or at least be able to effectively USE your rack.  Don't bring your rack anywhere unless you know how to get those pre-amps and processors to do exactly what you want them to do.  Such professionals asU2's The Edge and Nirvana's Kurt Cobain have favored rack rigs.

'''MIDI.'''  Many rack-mounted pre-amps are digital and use MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) technology.  This allows pre-amp settings to be saved in the pre-amp's digital memory to be recalled again later at the push of a button.  These buttons can be on the faceplate of the unit, but MIDI pedalboards can be utilized to access those pre-set channels by stepping on footpedal buttons, to prevent a guitarrist from having to go to his rack and search out the right setting in the dark between each song.

=== Selecting the Right Sound ===
In order to get the most from a guitar amplifier, you need to understand how different types of amps suit different styles of music. For the most part, amps are not &quot;one size fits all.&quot; Although there are all sorts of amps, they can be classified in two broad categories - &quot;vintage&quot; and &quot;high gain.&quot;

==== Tone Wars ====
[[Image:Fender_twin_amp.jpg|frame|''Fender Twin Reverb - a quintessential vintage amp'']]
'''Vintage''' amps produce (or reproduce) the classic sounds of early amplifiers. For the jazz, blues, or blues-rock guitarist, the vintage sound is still widely considered the best tone available. Vintage amps can be actual antiques, or they can be modern amps that replicate the sound of antique amps. The sound of Fender, Vox, Marshall, and similar amplifiers from the 50's, 60's and early 70's is the foundation of the vintage tone. When you think &quot;vintage,&quot; you think Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Deep Purple, etc. These are the sounds that started it all.

[[Image:High_gain.jpg|frame|''Randall Warhead - a contemporary &quot;gain monster&quot;'']]
'''High-gain''' amps produce a sound with greater distortion than that of vintage amps. Although there is some debate about the evolution of high-gain amps, many believe that a large part of their history is owed to Eddie Van Halen, who took apart his vintage-style Marshall head and played around with the electronics, allowing him to get far more gain (the source of the classic rock/metal distortion sound). With his landmark &quot;Eruption&quot; solo in 1977, Van Halen introduced the roaring, face-melting sound of super high gain to the guitar community. At around the same time, the emergence of heavy metal bands added another dimension to the high-gain phenomena. For hard rock and heavy metal music from the early 80's and beyond, vintage amps are overshadowed by their modern high-gain counterparts.

If you want to play jazz, blues, blues-rock (in the style of Led Zeppelin) or very early heavy metal (in the style of Black Sabbath), a vintage amp may be your best choice. If you want to play hard rock, 80's metal, and &quot;shred&quot; guitar (in the style of the countless 80's &quot;guitar heroes&quot;), you will probably want to go with a high-gain model. Note that many newer amps can provide both high-gain and vintage sounds, although some purists feel that the only vintage amps worth playing are the actual antique amplifiers themselves. &quot;Amp modeling&quot; technnology (which allows one amp to simulate the sound of many different amps) is a relatively recent development which has both fans and critics. If you don't plan to specialize exclusively in vintage-style music, a modeling amp can be very useful, although if you're a purist, nothing beats walking in with a real Fender Twin Reverb, an ancient Marshall &quot;Plexi&quot; head, or something similar. 
==== Tube vs Solid State ====

[[Image:vacuumTube.jpg|thumb|150px|''A vacuum tube - the heart of great amp tone'']]
In the vintage days, all amplifiers used vacuum tubes to accomplish the actual amplification. Nowadays, many amps use transistors instead, sparking a long-standing debate about which is better. The consensus is that for almost all types of music, the sound of tubes is noticeably superior. However, tubes have several drawbacks:

*Tubes can be expensive, depending the tubes used. Expect to replace them after 4 or more years of use, depending on their quality and how loud/often they are used.

*Tubes are somewhat unreliable. They can and do go out at random times, crippling the amp. This can be alleviated by using good quality tubes.

*Tubes (and the associated design factors) add considerable weight to the amplifier. Back problems caused by skinny guitar players lugging around big 2x12 tube combos are an insurance company's nightmare. 

*Tube amps are, generally speaking, more pricey than solid-state amps. You will almost certainly pay more for this ancient technology than you will pay for modern solid-state (transistor) electronics. There are tube amps, however, like the Fender Blues Jr., that go for roughly $300; the Fender Hot Rod Deluxe (which is an extremely loud, 40 Watt, 1x12 amp), goes for about $550-$600. A Vox AC-30 2x12&quot; reissue, on the other hand, will set you back no less than $1200; and a Marshall head + half stack can be well over $2000. 

If you can afford a tube amp, you should strongly consider buying one. In almost all cases, the sound is noticeably better. One possible exception to this is for heavy metal players. Many metal guitarists find that the harsher sound of transistors suits their style of music. Given the reliability, weight, and price advantages of solid-state amps, even the professional-level heavy metal guitarist may not require a tube amp. Pantera's Darrell Abbott used solid-state amps, as do many other notable heavy metal musicians.

Your amp will have two different kinds of tubes -- pre-amp tubes and power-amp tubes (a few combos and heads mix and match between tube and solid-state pre-amps and power amps).  Many modern guitarrists have forgotten that the original rock 'n' roll &quot;crunch&quot; or distortion was created when guitarrists like Pete Townsend turned their amps' volume up to 7 or 8, causing the power tubes to overdrive.  A pre-amp perameter called &quot;Gain&quot; has been added to most amps to simulate that overdriven distortion.  But unless you're into the tinny thrash-metal sound, no artificial gain setting can compare to the sweet, distorted tone of overdriven power tubes turned up to 7.  The problem is, most guitarrists, especially new ones, go whole hog for a 100W amp, which cannot be turned up to 7 or 8 in a small club without blowing the doors off.  They turn their amps down to four or five, turn the gain up to ten, and never know what they are missing that they could get froma 50W amp turned to 7 with the gain down to 5. Angus Young of AC/DC plays live with both a 100W tube head turned up to 6 for his rhythm parts, and a 50W tube head cranked up to 10 for comparable volume but extra overdrive that he switched to for his solos.

==Amp Modeler, Effect Unit, Modeling Amp==
However, there is one more way to go loud while getting that particular tone, and that is to use a Amp Modeler: using embeded electronics, these modelers provide a very good approximation of a tube amp, and if you are going to hook up to a P.A. system most of the time, these may provide a much better alternative, as they are usually cheaper: The Behringer V-Amp 2, for example, is less than $100 dollars.

There are two kinds: one is an analog modeller, which is commonly used in modeling amp (Amplifier that actually tries its best to emulate a certain tone instead of just amping it), and digital computer modeling, such as Line6's POD 2.0. The benefit of using amp modeler is that it allows you to  use such effects even in recording, as well as a more easy to maintain equipment — true tube, afterall, is a nightmare to maintain.

What amp modelers and effect units does not do, however, is provide the volume; for those, you will need to hook it up to a powerful amplifier, or a loud P.A. system.

Another solution is to use modeling amp with onboard effects, which is basically a combination of a very clean power amplifier with the tone modeling unit producing all the tone. Some may consider this as the Swiss-army knife of amplifier. The best of these amps can reproduce the sound of many other units with passable accuracy, and you have instant access to those cool effects that make even crappy guitarists sound good - delay, chorus, flanger, reverb, etc. With enough effects, your little old grandmother can sound like a rock star. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but if guys like me can sound good, you can too. 

== Tips ==
* When shopping for an amp, price should not be your only consideration. Some lower-priced amps offer admirable sound, while you may find some costly amps unsuitable for your needs. To judge quality, read user reviews on various guitar websites. However, be aware that many equipment vendors publish only good reviews (to ensure product sales). Do your research and make an informed decision. 
* If you purchase a tube amp, try not to abuse it physically. In general, transistor (solid-state) units are designed to take loads of punishment, but tube amps are much more delicate. If your brand new (very expensive) Soldano tube head falls down a flight of stairs, you are probably in deep trouble - while the same thing happening to a solid-state combo will probably result in nothing more than a momentary panic and some laughs (after the fact). In short, do not kick, hurl, slam, pummel, or viciously bludgeon a tube amp - and try to discourage others from doing so. If you're wondering why such a warning is necessary, you probably haven't spent much time with rock musicians.
* Unless you are playing heavy metal, it is generally better to buy a smaller amp with good tone than it is to buy a big loud amp that sounds cheesy.  You will never regret having a nice tone, but you will always regret bad tone.  If you play with a band, you will likely find that you never need that much volume anyway unless you are playing an arena, and if you are reading this I don't see any arenas in your near future.  Buy a small tube amp with a nice sound.  Some music stores will try to sell loud amps with loads of effects to beginners.  Don't fall for that.  Don't fall for all of the &quot;cool&quot; effects; effects get old after a while.  Use your ears and pick an amp whose tone you absolutely love, and don't part with your money until you find that amp.
*For most beginners, a 15 watt amp will be more than enough for your bedroom and small gigs. 

== Warnings ==
* Buying a large combo or (especially) a stack for the purpose of wailing in your living room at all hours can lead to divorce at the minimum, and may even results in a court order for &quot;disrupting the peace&quot;. So can spending $2000 on an amplifier without telling the wife (because you know she's going to say no). As a general rule, guitar equipment is to be treated as if family members had a restraining order against it. It doesn't matter if people pay good money to have you assault their eardrums with your frenzied solos every weekend, nobody at home is going to want to hear it (Not even the Osbornes). Whatever type of amp you buy, headphones are a must for home practice. Similarly, if you plan to install an enormous Marshall stack in your garage for rehearsals, make sure it's a detached garage. The Mrs. doesn't want to have Black Sabbath's &quot;War Pigs&quot; rattling windows and knocking pictures off the walls while she is entertaining her Saturday bridge club.

The  figure-eight  bandage  is used  for dressings  of  the  ankle,  as  well  as  for  supporting a sprain.   While keeping the foot at a right angle, start a 3-inch bandage around the instep for several turns to anchor it.   Carry the bandage upward over the instep and around behind the ankle, forward, and again across the instep and down under the arch, thus completing one   figure-eight. Continue   the   figure-eight   turns, overlapping  one-third  to  one-half  the  width  of  the bandage and with an occasional turn around the ankle, until the compress is secured or until adequate support is obtained.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Head wounds must be treated with particular care, since there is always the possibility of brain damage.  The general treatment for head wounds is  the  same  as  that  for  other  fresh  wounds. However,  certain  special  precautions  must  be observed  if  you  are  giving  first  aid  to  a  person who has suffered a head wound.

#'''NEVER GIVE ANY MEDICINE.'''
#Keep the victim lying flat, with the head at the level of the body.  Do not raise the feet if the face is flushed.  If the victim is having trouble breathing, you may raise the head  slightly. 
#If the wound is at the back of the head, turn the victim on his or her side. 
#Watch closely for vomiting and position the head to avoid getting vomit or saliva into the lungs. 
#Do not use direct pressure to control bleeding if the skull is depressed or obviously fractured.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Preface==
===What does the book aim?===
The aim of this book is to provide readers with significant knowledge about the concept of strategy sphering around processes or the day-to-day operations a company undergoes to provide its clients with a product or service, be it a profit generating or a non-profit generating organization. With case studies and analysis of current business trends, the book provides the reader with an activity-based approach to management and related trends.

The content of this book tends to:
* Be inspired by business studies oriented graduate school level coursework and books. References are provided where necessary.
* Be practical and contains issue dealt with in original scenarios. It contains examples of actual operations in various companies and researches by students at various universities.
* Deal with the more broader subject of Functional and Manufacturing strategy at times to illustrate the boundary within which Operations strategy resides.

===Whom is this book meant for?===
This book is currently undergoing development and at this phase serves no good a purpose. But, at the turn of its completion, the book promises to be helpful for business school students at any level. This book is set at a slightly higher level for most undergraduate students. Though, as more books come into the WikiBooks portal, recommended prerequisites will be linked to this page.

==What is operations strategy?==
===Introduction===
To look at what operations strategy is, we would break the word into the two separate forming words: ''operations'' and ''strategy''. Both these words act as antitheses to the other, ''see [[#References|Slack and Lewis(2002)]]''. Where '''operations''' deals with the functions and procedures involved in the day-to-day processes of manufacturing goods and products, '''strategy''' deals with the direction and scope of an organisation over a long period of time on how they deliver to their clients. It turns out that the name itself holds information about the broad subject that tends to bind together routine process management, i.e., ''operations managements'' with a foresight of things forming up way ahead in the future.

In this chapter, we will focus on providing the reader with a proper definition of operations strategy and the difference between operations strategy and operations management. Furthermore, we will also shed light on how the market tends to stear the strategic focus of operations. At the end of this chapter, the user would have significant knowledge of:
* What operations strategy is?
* What the difference between operations strategy and operations management is?
* How markets govern the strategic focus of operations?
* How operations strategy helps a market mature and evolve?

===Topics we'd be covering===

* [[../What is operations strategy?/Operations strategy and operations management|Difference between operations strategy and operations management]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Operations strategy==
Companies and organisations making products and delivering, be it for profit or not for profit rely on a handful of processes to get their products manufactured properly and delivered on time. Each of the process acts as an operation for the company. To the company this is essential. That is why managers find operations management more apealing. We begin this section by looking at what operations actually are.
Operations strategy is to provide an overall direction that serves the framework for carrying out all the organization’s functions. 
===Understanding operations===
Have you ever imagined a car without a gear or the steering wheel? Whilst, what remains of an utmost importance to you is to ''drive'' the locomotive from one location to another for whatever purpose you wish, but can only be made possible with each and every part of the car working together and attached.

Organisations behave in the same manner. The company has an ultimate goal of delivering goods to a client, but the processes of designing, manufacturing, analysing and then finally being delivered are the driving forces for the company's success. All these chunks of works '''processes''' that collectively define a bigger purpose, the '''operations''' for that particular organisation. The more effective these processes or operations would be, the more productive and profitable the business would be.

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color:rgb(227,230,251); padding: 8px;&quot;&gt; '''Note:''' ''Goods'', the ultimate by-product of a company, can be a ''product'' or a ''service''. Take for instance, a car manufacturing company. For it, all operations would lead to the development and enhancement of a car, a product, something physical. But, to a therapist, the service he/she provides to their clients is the much needed result or required output.&lt;/div&gt;

===A formal definition===
According to [[#References|Slack and Lewis]], operations strategy holds the following definition:
{{cquote|'''Operations strategy''' is the total pattern of decisions which shape the long-term capabilities of any type of operations and their contribution to the overall strategy, through the reconciliation of market requirements with operations resources.}}Operations strategy is the tool that helps to define the methods of producing goods or a service offered to the customer

In this section that follows, we'd be performing a surgery of the given definition in order to know what operations strategy actually means.

      <text xml:space="preserve">: ''This module is '''far from finished'''. Improvements are welcome.''

'''Lists''' in common lisp are built up from pairs called ''[[w:en:Cons|cons]] cells''.  Each cell has two parts, historically named [[w:en:CAR and CDR|'''car''']] (for the first part) and [[w:en:CAR and CDR|'''cdr''']] (for the remainder).

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;(car . cdr)&lt;/source&gt;

Lists are implemented with cons cells by having the cdr of the first cell point to another cons cell.

The empty list is also known as nil, it's written representation is either the literal &lt;nowiki&gt;nil&lt;/nowiki&gt; or the empty list: &lt;nowiki&gt;()&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

You can create a list by using cons to construct a new cons cell with a left and right hand part:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (cons 'a '())                     ⇒ (A)
  (cons 'a '(b))                    ⇒ (A B)
  (cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c nil))) ⇒ (A B C)
&lt;/source&gt;

Keep in mind that it is possible to create a cons cell which is not a list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (cons 'a 'b) ⇒ (A . B)
&lt;/source&gt;

This is called a dotted list. To be a proper list, the final cdr in the chain of cons cells must point to the empty list (nil). You can also create a list with the function '''list''':

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (list 'a 'b 'c)   ⇒ (A B C)
&lt;/source&gt;

which is equivalent to:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c '()))) ⇒ (A B C)
  (cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c nil))) ⇒ (A B C)
  (cons 'a '(b c))                  ⇒ (A B C)
  '(a b c)                          ⇒ (A B C)
&lt;/source&gt;

You can access the members of a list with the functions '''car''' (or '''first''') and '''cdr''' (or '''rest'''):

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (setf list '(a b c))
  (car list)    ⇒ a
  (first list)  ⇒ a

  (cdr list)    ⇒ (b c)
  (rest list)   ⇒ (b c)
&lt;/source&gt;

Common Lisp also defines the functions '''second''', '''third''' and '''fourth''' (on up to '''tenth''').  Note that '''second''' is not the same as '''cdr''' or '''rest'''.  '''cdr''' and '''rest''' both return the remaining list after the first element, while '''second''' returns the second item in the list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (rest list)   ⇒ (b c)
  (second list) ⇒ b
  (third list)  ⇒ c
  (fourth list) ⇒ nil
&lt;/source&gt;

Lists are sequences, so functions that operate on sequences also operate on lists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (subseq list 0 1)  ⇒ (a)
  (subseq list 0 2)  ⇒ (a b)
&lt;/source&gt;

The function '''nth''' also allows you to retrieve selected items from a list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (nth 0 list)  ⇒ a
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the first item in a list is the 0th.
Common Lisp also has several forms (functions and macros) for operating on the contents of lists.  '''mapcar''' can be used to process each element of a list one at a time to build up a new list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (defun add2 (n)
    (+ 2 n))
  (mapcar #'add2 '(1 2 3))  ⇒ (3 4 5)
&lt;/source&gt;

In that example, we were mapping over a single list so we used a unary function (a function of one argument). The &lt;tt&gt;#'&lt;/tt&gt; is a special way to pass a function as an argument into a function. We will talk more about it in the next chapter. It is also possible to map over more than one list - the function must then take the same number of arguments as there are lists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (mapcar #'+ '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6)) ⇒ (5 7 9)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{documentation subpage}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
This template is used to cite sources in Wikibooks. It is specifically for books. When citing an article in a compilation or anthology, {{tl|cite journal}} or {{tl|cite encyclopedia}} work better. __NOTOC__

==Usage==
All field names '''must''' be in lowercase.

Copy a blank version to use. Remember to use the &quot;|&quot; (pipe) character between each field. Please delete any unused fields to avoid clutter in the edit window.

No templates or magic words are necessary when using an [[w:ISBN|ISBN]], [[w:OCLC|OCLC]] number, or [[w:Digital object identifier|DOI]] as an identifier.  Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field in these instances, simply use the appropriate field.  For instance, type &lt;code&gt;isbn=&lt;/code&gt; followed by the number instead of &lt;code&gt;id=ISBN&lt;/code&gt;.  Templates are available for other identification number types to be used in the ID field ({{tl|ISSN}}, {{tl|LCCN}}, {{tl|LCC}}, etc.) if these aren't available.  See also the complete [[#Description of fields|description of fields]].

==Fields==
===Wikilinks===
Except where specifically prohibited in the field descriptions below, most fields can be wikilinked (e.g. &lt;code&gt;title = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[book article|book title]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), but should generally only be linked to an existing Wikipedia article. Wikilinked fields must escape the characters &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&gt;[]{}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; rather than including them directly.

===Description of fields===
====Syntax (for the technical-minded)====
Nested fields rely on their parent fields:
*''parent''
*OR: ''parent2'' &amp;mdash; may be used instead  of ''parent''
**''child'' &amp;mdash; may be used with ''parent'' (and is ignored if ''parent'' is not used)
**OR: ''child2'' &amp;mdash; may be used instead of ''child'' (and is ignored if ''parent2'' is not used)

====Description====
*'''last''': Surname of author. Don't wikilink (use ''authorlink'' instead).
**'''first''': First name(s) of author, including title(s) (e.g. ''Firstname Middlename'' or ''Firstname M.'' or ''Dr. Firstname M., Snr.''). Don't wikilink (use ''authorlink'' instead).
***The 'last' and 'first' fields are not ideally suited to authors whose surname is usually written first (e.g. as in Chinese).  Use the same format as the source uses to handle these cases.
**{{AuthorMask doc}} See [[#Examples|Examples]] for typical usage.
**'''authorlink''': Title of Wikipedia article about author (not the author's personal website). Article should already exist. Must not be wikilinked itself. Do not use this on its own, but along with ''author'' or ''first'' and ''last''.
**'''coauthors''': Full name of additional author or authors, separated by &quot;, &quot; (e.g. ''Joe Bloggs, John F. Kennedy, H. R. Dent'').
***Whether the surname of the co-authors goes first or last is dependent on the citation style (see the [[#Citation_styles|citation style]] section below) preferred.
*OR: '''author''': Full name of author, preferably surname first. (deprecated) Don't wikilink (use ''authorlink'' instead).
*OR: for multiple authors, use the fields '''first1''', '''last1''', ...,&lt;b&gt;first''n'', last''n''&lt;/b&gt; to 'correctly' record all the information about the book (the first nine authors are printed, then ''et al.'' is appended if even more authors were specified). Don't wikilink as there are corresponding '''authorlink1''', ..., '''authorlink9''' fields as well. This usage is preferred to the use of '''coauthors'''.
*'''editor''': Name of editor/editors. Do not Wikilink any values in the editor field but use ''editor-link'' instead. The template automatically adds &quot;ed.&quot; after the editor's name unless the ''chapter'' parameter is used in which case the template adds &quot;in&quot; before the editor's name which appears after the chapter and before the title. This implies that the author is responsible only for part of the book (including the cited chapter) and the editor responsible for the whole book. If, however, the author(s) and editor(s) are responsible for the whole book, then the ''editor'' field or its alternates described below should not be used if the ''chapter'' field is being used. Instead, the editor(s) should be included in an ''author'' field with possibly &quot;(ed.)&quot; after the surname(s). Alternatively, the ''editor'' field may be used if the chapter detail is included in the ''title'' field instead of using the ''chapter'' field.
*OR: alternatively '''editor-first''' and '''editor-last''' can be used in the same way as ''first'' and ''last''.
*OR: for multiple editors up to four in number, use the fields '''editor1-first''', '''editor1-last''', ...,&lt;b&gt;editor''n''-first, editor''n''-last&lt;/b&gt; to 'correctly' record all the information about the book in the same way as ''first''n and ''last''n.
**'''editor-link''' or '''editor1-link'''...&lt;b&gt;editor''n''-link&lt;/b&gt; is used in the same way as ''authorlink'' or ''authorlink''n.
*'''others''': To record other contributors to the work, such as &quot;illustrated by Smith&quot; or &quot;trans. Smith&quot;. 
*'''title''': Title of book. This is the only required parameter. Do not use italics.
**'''trans_title''': If the book cited is in a foreign language, an English translation of the title can be given here. The template will display this in square brackets after the ''title'' field and it will point to the ''url'' link, if used. Use of ''language'' parameter is recommended if this parameter is used.
*'''url''': URL of an online location where text of the book can be found. Cannot be used if you wikilinked ''title''. If applicable, should point to the specific page(s) referenced.  Do not use this field to link to any commercial booksellers (such as Amazon.com).  The ISBN link is a much better alternative which allows readers access to the books in their own countries or through their own choice of source, including Amazon, Google Books, thousands of libraries, and more.
**'''format''': Format, e.g. PDF. HTML implied if not specified.
**'''accessdate''': Full date when url was accessed. Should be used when ''url'' field is used. Should be in the same format as other dates in citations in the same article. Must not be wikilinked.
*'''type''': If the publication is a thesis or dissertation, the type can be specified here. For example, &lt;code&gt;type=PhD thesis&lt;/code&gt; produces &quot;(PhD thesis)&quot; immediately after the title.
*'''edition''': When the book has more than one edition. ''e.g.:'' &quot;2nd.&quot;, &quot;Revised&quot; etc.. Note that the template automatically displays &quot; ed.&quot; after this field, so &lt;code&gt;edition=2nd&lt;/code&gt; produces &quot;2nd ed.&quot;.
*'''series''': When the book is part of a series of publications
*'''volume''': For one book published in several volumes. However, this template displays the text in this field in bold type after the ''title'' and ''series'' parameters. An alternative is to include the volume information in the ''title'' field after the main title (see example below). (NB: there is a separate {{tl|Cite encyclopedia}} template).
*'''date''': Full date of publication edition being referenced, in the same format as other dates in citations in the same article. Must not be wikilinked.
*OR:  '''year''': Year of publication edition being referenced
**'''month''': Name of the month of publication. If you also have the day, use ''date'' instead. Must not be wikilinked.
**'''origyear''': Original publication year, for display alongside the date or year.  For clarity, please supply specifics, for instance &lt;code&gt;origyear=First published 1859&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;origyear=Composed 1904&lt;/code&gt;. This parameter only displays if a there is a value for ''year'' or ''date''.
*'''publisher''': Publisher should not include corporate designation such as &quot;Ltd&quot; or &quot;Inc&quot;.
**'''location''': Geographical place of publication.
*'''language''': The language the book is written in, if it is not English. The template automatically puts parentheses around the text and adds &quot;in&quot; before the language name. 
*'''isbn''': [[w:International Standard Book Number|International Standard Book Number]] such as ''1-111-22222-9''.  Note that {{para|isbn}}, like all field names, must be in lowercase. The field must not be wikilinked as the template automatically creates a link. The template is insensitive to formatting so an ISBN number without dashes (&quot;-&quot;) may be used (e.g. {{para|isbn|1111222229}}). Please use the 13-digit ISBN where possible; this can normally be found beneath the barcode as a number beginning 978 or 979. For books with the older SBN system (9 digits), use this field but prefix the number with a zero; thus ''SBN 902888 45 5'' should be entered as {{para|isbn|0 902888 45 5}}.
*'''oclc''': [[w:Online Computer Library Center|Online Computer Library Center]] ID number, such as ''3185581''. The field must not be wikilinked as the template automatically creates a link.
*'''doi''': A [[w:digital object identifier|digital object identifier]] such as ''&lt;nowiki&gt;10.1016/j.coi.2004.08.001&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. The field must not be wikilinked as the template automatically creates a link.
*'''bibcode''': A nineteen character [[w:Bibcode|Bibcode]] identifier. The field must not be wikilinked as the template automatically creates a link.
*'''id''': A [[w:unique identifier|unique identifier]], used if none of the above are applicable.  In this case, you need to specify the kind of identifier you are using, preferably with a template like {{tl|ASIN}} or {{tl|ISSN}}.  (Use one of the more specialized parameters if possible; they are linked automatically.  In other words, don't use {{para|id|ISBN 1-111-22222-9}} anymore; use {{para|isbn|1-111-22222-9}}. If the book has a SBN but not an ISBN, see {{para|isbn}}.)
*'''pages''' or '''page''': These parameters are for listing the pages relevant to the citation, ''not'' the total number of pages in the book. &quot;&lt;code&gt;|pages= 5–7&lt;/code&gt;&quot; produces &quot;pp. 5–7&quot;, while &quot;&lt;code&gt;|page= 5&lt;/code&gt;&quot; produces &quot;p. 5&quot;. The &quot;pp.&quot; notation indicating multiple pages, and &quot;p.&quot; notation indicating a single page, ''are placed automatically'' when you choose between the plural (''pages'') or singular (''page'') form of the parameter. 
**'''nopp''': using &quot;page&quot; or &quot;pages&quot;, automatically places the p. or pp. notations. If this is inappropriate—for instance, if &lt;code&gt;page=Front cover&lt;/code&gt;, placing any value after &lt;code&gt;nopp&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;nopp=y&lt;/code&gt; will hide the p. or pp. notation.
*'''chapter''' (= '''contribution'''): The chapter of the book, written in full. Punctuation other than quotes should be included in the value passed to the parameter, e.g. {{para|chapter|Chapter 12: Meet Dick and Jane.}} produces &quot;Chapter 12: Meet Dick and Jane.&quot; ahead of ''title''.
**'''trans_chapter''': Acts in the same way as ''trans_title''. The field will be displayed in square brackets within the quotation marks which embrace the ''chapter'' field. Use of ''language'' parameter is recommended if this parameter is used.   
**'''chapterurl''': URL of an individual chapter of online book. Should be at the same site as ''url'', if any.
*'''quote''': Relevant quote from the book.
*'''ref''': ID for anchor. By default, no anchor is generated. The ordinary nonempty value {{para|ref|&lt;var&gt;ID&lt;/var&gt;}} generates an anchor with the given &lt;code&gt;&lt;var&gt;ID&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;; such a linkable reference can be made the target of wikilinks to full references, especially useful in short citations like shortened notes and parenthetical referencing. The special value {{para|ref|harv}} generates an anchor suitable for the {{tl|harv}} template; see ''[[Template:Citation/doc#Anchors for Harvard referencing templates|anchors for Harvard referencing templates]]''. See &quot;Wikilinks to full references&quot; in [[#Examples|Examples]] below for using the ''ref'' field in citation templates in conjunction with short &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; citations.
*'''laysummary''': Link to a non-technical summary (or review) of the book
**'''laydate''': Date of summary
*'''separator''': The separator to use in lists of authors, editors, ''etc''.  Defaults to &quot;.&quot;, but &quot;,&quot; may be useful also.
*'''postscript''': The closing punctuation for the citation.  Defaults to &quot;.&quot;, but &quot;&quot; may be useful also.
*'''lastauthoramp''': The separator to use between the last two names in lists of authors.  Defaults to &quot;&quot;, but &quot;&amp;amp;&quot; may be useful as well.

:As mentioned, the bibliographical data of the cited source can be “tagged” by an identifier: this enables the system to “find” the target of the wikilinks. This “tagging” with an identifier can be done by enclosing between &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;cite id=…&gt;…&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, but this tool can be superfluous if the bibliographical data are provided with a citation template: the &lt;tt&gt;ref&lt;/tt&gt; field of the chosen citation template must be set to the same name.

:Attention must be paid: not all other citation templates support this. In such cases, the service can be achieved also by enclosing the concerned bibliographical item inside &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;cite id=…&gt;…&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags: also this way, it can feature as a target of Wikilinks to full references.

==Note==
Note the extra full-stop when the last author ends with an initial, and there is no date:
*{{cite book | last = Invisible | first = M. | title = Mysterious book }}
We don't know of a practical solution to this &amp;mdash; unless there is a way to test the characters of a field?

==Part A: Description==

In this section, we will learn how to count to one hundred. As you will see, a mixture of numbers from old Kapampangan and words originating from Spanish are used. This is because, for a very long time in Pampanga, anything that involved complex transactions was handled in Spanish, rather than in Kapampangan.

==Part B: Application==

{|
|style=&quot;width:150px&quot;|'''métung'''       || ''one''

||'''aduang pulu'''        || ''twenty''
|-

|-
||'''apat a pulu'''        ''' || ''forty''

== Is it a book? ==

Herbythyme stated &quot;Not sure - this is solely a collection of external links on Aspies, maybe useful but should it be in Wikibooks?&quot;

For me it seems to be a book, since my thoughts of what a book is, is a page with various sorts of information which also expresses personal belief or ideas.

Since it says &quot;Aspies Book/Resources&quot;. It could be left as a book containing just resources, for the current moment, and later be expanded in greater descriptions regarding the links. [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 11:42, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

:Well, as a book it's no good, actually. But as a chapter of a book it's fine :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:56, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

== [[Template:WoW]] ==

IPs and new user accounts created this [[Template:WoW]], and started creating annoying seven-byte user pages containing &lt;code&gt;&amp;#123;WoW}}&lt;/code&gt; for some of our recent vandals. Most of the Wikipedia links on this template are nonfunctional.

It might be okay to have a page with a ''list'' of vandals, but I think that this memorial to sockpuppets is unnecessary... though I am not sure whether this is the vandal promoting itself. I suggest that we delete all &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#123;WoW}}&lt;/code&gt;&quot; pages and either delete the template, or change the template to a box &quot;do not use this template!&quot;. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:58, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

''Update:'' Apparently the template is a copy of [[Wikipedia:Template:WoW]], and they use it over 1500 user pages. I am quite surprised that any wiki would have such a large array of vandal sockpuppets, and can understand better why we have such a template. Do we want to keep this template? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:27, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

:Keep the template but also give it a full protect - it's the kind of thing that's prone to attract vandalism and it's fully protected on Wikipedia too. It might also be a good idea to report the accounts [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_term_abuse/Willy_on_Wheels here] (under the &quot;Inter-Wiki Appearances&quot; section).

::I was very tempted to delete this on sight. It seems to serve no useful purpose (most of those listed are blocked indefinitely anyway). Do we really want a tribute page to WoW (other than the move log, which is already tainted by page-move vandalism)? IMHO, not unless we want to glorify that type of vandalism, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 05:41, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

:::I was thinking sort of the same thing, about this being more of a tribute to a vandal than anything else.  The comments about this user eventually getting tired of doing this, however, I don't see happening in this situation.  This has been a persistant attack against many Wikimedia projects, and potentially even projects outside of Wikimedia arenas as well.  It has been suspected that he was one of the reasons why the Los Angeles Times shut down their reader &quot;letters to the editor&quot; wiki, because he came in and overwhelmed the nascient group of administrators who didn't know how to handle an idiot like this.  I suppose that is something to brag about, and he is trying to do the same elsewhere.  The point I'm making... I would support deleting this template, however, as well as all such markups on the pages of vandals.  Keep them red-shirt users if possible.  A formal template would be needed for other kinds of problem users such as the John Siegenthaler situation or somebody who has gone into repeated editing wars and needed to be banned for reasons outside of pure vandalism.  Otherwise, treat these accounts as the anon user they really should be compared to.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

=Scanning Near-field optical microscopy (SNOM)=
The Abbe diffraction limit of optical microscopy can be circumvented if an evanescent wave is used instead of a travelling wave. The SNOM can be compared to a stethoscope
&lt;ref&gt;Optical Stethoscopy - Image Recording With Resolution Lambda/20, Pohl Dw,
Denk W, Lanz M, Applied Physics Letters , Vol. 44 (7): 651-653 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;:
A doctor can locate your heart with a precision of a few cm, despite the fact that the sound of a beating heart he is listening to has a wavelength of the order 100 m. Apparently he has a resolving power of λ/1000 which is far better than what's dictated by the Abbe diffration limit. A similar setup can be made with light waves: If the light is forced through a sub-wavelength sized aperture, the emitted field will be evanescent and decay exponentially on a length scale usually shorter than the wavelength. With this technique a resolution of 12nm has been shown back in 1991

SNOM has the anbility to make high resolution in all directions (x,y, and z) and can be adapted to fit onto the same laser systems/spectrometers that other microscopes also use

Images by SNOM are made by scanning the probe over the sample like an LSCM, AFM or STM. The SNOM is a very versatile tool used by both physicists and biologists for many purposes, but the probe only interacts with the sample in close viscinity of the aperture, and hence the sample-probe distance becomes a concern for the fragile samples and probes

One widespread distance control method is the shear force technique, invented in the 1992&lt;ref&gt;Near-field scanning optical microscopy, Dunn RC, Chemical Reviews, vol. 99 (10):
2891 OCT 1999&lt;/ref&gt;,
where the SNOM probe is set in vibrations with an amplitude up to a few nm and the motion is detected and used in a feedback loop that senses the minute shear forces that occur when the probe tip is a few nm above the sample surface. Numerous shear force setups have been descibed in the litterature. Both optical and non-optical methods are used to detect the vibrations. Groups using non-optical methods claim the optical methods are sources of stray light that will seriously affect the measurements

=Electron Beam Induced Deposition (EBID or EBD)=

==EBID Background==
It was apparent with the first electron microscopes in the 50's, that the presence of an electron beam slowly coated the sample with a carbonaceous substance &lt;ref&gt;C. W. Oatley. The early history of the scanning electron microscope. Journal of Applied
Physics, 53(2):R1—R13, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Even earlier, it was observed that electron radiation decomposed organic vapors present in the vacuum chamber, such as oil vapors unavoidable in diffusion pumped vacuum systems or outgassing from the sample itself &lt;ref&gt;R. Lariviere Stewart. Insulating films formed under electron and ion bombardment. Phys. Rev., 45:488-490, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Hren. Barriers to AEM: contamination and etching. In: Introduction to Analytical Electron Microscopy. Plenum, New York, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;.

When the background gas is decomposed by irradiation through various ionization and dissociation processes, the gas turns partly into volatile compounds re-emitted into the chamber and partly into solid amorphous carbon. The material properties range from diamond-like-carbon (DLC) to polymers depending on the exact deposition conditions &lt;ref&gt;Shuji Kiyohara, Hideaki Takamatsu, and Katsumi Mori. Microfabrication of diamond films by localized electron beam chemical vapour deposition. Semiconductor Science and Technology, 17(10):1096—1100, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The reactions taking place during EBD are not well characterized. Both ionization and dissociation are expected to contribute &lt;ref name=&quot;nataliaphd&quot;&gt;Natalia Silvis-Cividjian. Electron Beam Induced Nanometer Scale Deposition. PhD thesis, Technical University in Delft, Faculty of applied Physics, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;. The cross-section for both dissociation and ionization are peaked at low electron energies (&lt;50 eV), indicating that secondary electrons are likely to be the main cause of deposition rather than the primary electrons (PE).

By focusing the PE beam in a fixed spot, a thin needle-shaped deposit will grow up towards the electron beam. The tip width can be considerably wider than the PE beam diameter and typically of the order 100 nm. The width is determined by the scattering of the PE in the tip structure which in turn also creates SE escaping through the tip apex and sidewalls causing a wider deposit &lt;ref name=&quot;nataliaphd&quot;/&gt;.

With many potential applications in micro- and nanotechnology, the EBD technique has received increasing attention since the 80's as a method for creating submicron structures. Comparing EBD to electron beam lithography (EBL), the EBD process must be considered &quot;slow&quot; while EBL is &quot;fast&quot; since the required irradiation dose is many orders of magnitude smaller for EBL.

The use of EBD in commercial production of nanostructures is today limited to &quot;supertips&quot; for AFM cantilevers with extreme aspect ratios that cannot readily be achieved by other methods &lt;ref&gt;M. Wendel, H. Lorenz, and J.P. Kotthaus. Sharpened electron beam deposited tips for high resolution atomic force microscope lithography and imaging. Applied Physics Letters, 67(25):3732—4, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;.

For research purposes, where high throughput is not a requirement, the technique appears convenient in several applications. Apart from depositing structures, it has also been used to solder nanocomponents. Both single and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (SWNT and MWNT) have been soldered to AFM cantilevers for stress-strain measurements &lt;ref&gt;Min-Feng Yu, Bradley S. Files, Sivaram Arepalli, and Rodney S. Ruoff. Tensile loading of ropes of single wall carbon nanotubes and their mechanical properties. Physical Review Letters, 84(24):5552—5555, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Min-Feng Yu, O. Lourie, M.J. Dyer, K. Moloni, T.F. Kelly, and R.S. Ruoff. Strength and breaking mechanism of multiwalled carbon nanotubes under tensile load. Science, 287(5453):637—40, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and to micromechanical actuators for electrical and mechanical tests &lt;ref name=&quot;molhavent&quot;&gt;Constructing, connecting and soldering nanostructures by environmental electron beam deposition, Nanotechnology 15 1047–1053 (2004), K Mølhave, D N Madsen, S Dohn and P Bøggild.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;molhavenl&quot;&gt; K.

Nano Letters, 3:1499—1503, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metal deposition by EBID==

A large fraction of the EBD publications have been focussing on the use of metal containing precursor gasses. Koops et al. &lt;ref&gt;H.W.P. Koops, R. Weiel, D.P. Kern, and T.H. Baum. High-resolution electron-beam induced deposition. Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B (Microelectronics Processing and Phenomena), 6(1):477—81, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and Matsui et al. &lt;ref&gt;S. Matsui and K. Mori. In situ observation on electron beam induced chemical vapor deposition by Auger electron spectroscopy. Applied Physics Letters, 51(9):646—8, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered the extensive use of metal containing source gasses to make deposits with high metal contents. They also began scanning the beam in patterns to make three-dimensional structures. Complex three-dimensional structures can be made by EBD with both carbonaceous and metal-containing EBD. Another intriguing possibility is to use EBD to make catalyst particles for subsequent growth of nanowires and tubes &lt;ref&gt;Y.M. Lau, P.C. Chee, J.T.L. Thong, and V. Ng. Properties and applications of cobalt-based material produced by electron-beam-induced deposition. Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces and Films, 20(4):1295—1302, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Compared to the planar and resist-based EBL, the EBD method is slow and difficult to scale to large productions, but on the other hand offers the possibility to create elaborate three-dimensional structures, which cannot readily be made by EBL. The EBD method appears to be a versatile tool capable of constructing nanodevies, contacting nanostructrues to create composite electronic nanostructures, and soldering nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes to microelectrodes.

For electronic applications one would like to achieve as high a conductivity as possible of the deposited material. Metal-containing EBD materials usually contain metallic nanocrystals in an amorphous carbon matrix with a conductance considerably lower than that of the pure metal. The metal content and conductivity of the EBD material can be increased to approach that of bulk metals by several methods:

1: Heating the substrate has been shown to increase the metal content of the deposit. Koops et al. &lt;ref&gt;H.W.P. Koops, C. Schoessler, A. Kaya, and M. Weber. Conductive dots, wires, and supertips for field electron emitters produced by electron-beam induced deposition on samples having increased temperature. Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B, 14(6):4105—4109, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; have observed an increase from 40 wt. % at room temperature to 80 wt.% at 100°C. Others, for example Botman et al. &lt;ref&gt;Botman A, Mulders JJL, Weemaes R and Mentink S. Purification of platinum and gold structures after electron-beam-induced deposition. Nanotechnology, 17:3779-3785, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown the link between deposit composition and conductivity as a function of post-treatment in heated gases.

2: Using a carbon free precursor gas, such as &lt;math&gt;PF_{3}AuCl&lt;/math&gt;, Hoffman et al. &lt;ref&gt;P. Hoffmann, I. Utke, F. Cicoira, B. Dwir, K. Leifer, E. Kapon, and P. Doppelt. Focused electron beam induced deposition of gold and rhodium. Materials Development for Direct Write Technologies. Symposium (Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings Vol.624), pages 171—7, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; made gold deposits with a resistivity of 22 µΩcm which is only 10 times the bulk value of Gold.

3: Introducing an additional gas such as water vapor while using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM)&lt;ref&gt;A. Folch, J. Servat, J. Esteve, J. Tejada, and M. Seco. High-vacuum versus environmental electron beam deposition. Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B, 14(4):2609—14, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;. It is even possible to create desposits with a solid gold core under controlled  deposition conditions  &lt;ref name=&quot;molhavenl&quot;/&gt;.

=A Simple Model of EBD=

To accurately model the EBD process, one has to resort to Monte Carlo simulations that can incorporate the different scattering effects taking place during the process. Extensive work has been done on models for the deposition of amorphous carbon tips &lt;ref name=&quot;nataliaphd&quot;/&gt;. Generally there is very little available knowledge on:

*The radiation induced chemistry of the metal containing precursor gas. A wealth of reactions are possible, but limited data is available for the conditions and substances used for EBD.

*The chemical content of the produced amorphous carbon in the deposit.

*The current density in the electron beam is rarely well characterized.

Not knowing the chemical details of the deposition process, the exact product of the deposition, or the electron beam, a simple analytical model will also provide insight to the essential parameters. A simple model is reviewed below to provide an understanding of the basic requirements and limitations for the EBD process.

==The Rate Equation Model==

Electron beam deposition of planar layers on surfaces can be reasonably described by a simple rate equation model &lt;ref&gt;V. Scheuer, H. Koops, and T. Tschudi. Electron beam decomposition of carbonyls on silicon. Microelectronic Engineering, 5(1-4):423—30, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The model shows the fundamental limitations for growth rate and its dependence on beam current and precursor gas flow. The model calculations and most experiments in this thesis, are based on the precursor gas dimethyl gold acetylacetonate, here abbreviated to DGAA. The vapor pressure of the precursor gas determines the flux of precursor molecules to the surface. The flux rate of molecules F [m²s¹] of an ideal gas at rest is

&lt;div id=&quot;eq EBD gas flux rate&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{P}{\sqrt{2\pi mk_{B}T}}&lt;/math&gt; 

with pressure P, atomic weight m, Boltzmans constant &lt;math&gt;k_{B}&lt;/math&gt; and temperature T. For DGAA which has a vapor pressure of 1.3 Pa at 25 °C, this gives a flux rate &lt;math&gt;F=10^{18} cm^{2}s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross-sections for electron beam induced ionization and dissociation of the precursor gas to form the deposits are generally not known. Cross-sections are usually of the order Å² and peak at low energies, corresponding the low energy of the secondary electrons which are probably the main cause of the deposition.

[[Image:EBIDsketch.jpg|thumb|300px|Sketch of the EBID process]]

The adsorption of molecules on the target surface and highest density of SE near the surface make it reasonable to assume that the deposition rate dN_{dep}/dt depends on the surface density of adsorbed precursor molecules N_{pre}, the beam current density J, and the effective cross section s_0 as

&lt;div id=&quot;eq EBD dep surface rate&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN_{dep}}{dt}=N_{pre}\sigma_0 \frac{J}{q_{e}}&lt;/math&gt;

The surface density &lt;math&gt;N_{pre}&lt;/math&gt; of the adsorbed precursor molecules in Eq. [[#eq EBD dep surface rate]] is the source for the deposited material and depends on both the deposition, ad- and desorption processes as sketched in the figure.

With maximum surface density &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. one monolayer, since generally more than one monolayer cannot be expected unless the target is cooled compared to the source, to give condensation of the source gas. Then adsorption probability a and lifetime t (s), a rate equation can be written for the precursor surface density as &lt;ref&gt;V. Scheuer, H. Koops, and T. Tschudi. Electron beam decomposition of carbonyls on silicon. Microelectronic Engineering, 5(1-4):423—30, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN_{dep}}{dt} = aF(1-(N_{pre}/N_0))-\sigma_0 JN_{pre}/t-N_{pre}/q_{e}&lt;/math&gt;

The steady state adsorbate density, &lt;math&gt;N_{pre}&lt;/math&gt;, is then

:&lt;math&gt;N_{pre}=\frac{aF}{aF/N_0+1/\tau+\sigma_0J/q_{e}}&lt;/math&gt;

If each deposition event on average results in a cubic unit cell of deposited material with volume V, the vertical growth rate R [nm/s] is

:&lt;math&gt;R  = N_{pre}V\sigma_0J/q_{e}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= V\frac{aF}{q_{e}\frac{\tau aF/N_0+1}{\sigma_0Jt}+1}&lt;/math&gt;

The dependence on precursor flux falls into two cases:

*&lt;math&gt;\tau aF&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; when a monolayer is always present and increasing the flux rate F has little effect on the growth rate R, since the surface is saturated

*&lt;math&gt;\tau aF&lt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; when less than a monolayer is present, and increasing F will increase the growth rate R.

Increasing the electron beam current will in this model always increase the deposition rate. The rate increases relatively linearly with the electron flux, until it begins to saturate when the source gas flux becomes the limiting factor for the growth rate.

Scheuer et al. &lt;ref&gt;V. Scheuer, H. Koops, and T. Tschudi. Electron beam decomposition of carbonyls on silicon. Microelectronic Engineering, 5(1-4):423—30, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; have measured the EBD deposition cross section of &lt;math&gt;Ru_{3}(CO)_12&lt;/math&gt; to be of the order &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; =0.2 Å² and &lt;math&gt;\tau=1&lt;/math&gt; s. Using these values, a rough estimate of the growth rate can be calculated. For the estimate, we assume a monolayer is present &lt;math&gt;(\tau aF=N_0)&lt;/math&gt;; a sticking efficiency of a=100%; the vapor pressure flux of DGAA; an electron beam diameter of 20 nm; a total beam current of 0.2 nA; and finally that the unit cell volume V for deposition is that of gold. With this set of values, the deposition rate becomes R= 100 nm/s.

The used values make &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0 J/q_{e}&gt;&gt;\tau aF/N_0&lt;/math&gt; so the deposition is not limited by the electron beam current but by the gas flux which would have to be 10 times higher to reach saturation. The beam radius will have to be increased to r= 0.5 µm to reach the electron flux limited region and this radius is much larger than the observed resolution in most experiments. Its is important to secure as high as possible flux of precursor gas in the experiments, since this is the main limiting factor in the model whereas the focus of the electron beam is expected to be less important due to the high current density.

==Limitations to the model==

The rate model is suited for describing deposition of planar layers, but for the case of deposition of tip structures in a real system, several other effects influence the deposition rate:

Scattering of primary electrons in the deposited structure. BSE and SE are emitted through the sidewalls and apex of the structure in a non-uniform way, and the PE/BSE scattering make SE generation take place in a larger region than the PE beam radius, which considerably limits the minimal radius for tip structures. 

The figure above illustrate these effects. Simulations are needed to make proper estimates of the influence of scattering, but qualitatively it should cause a lower vertical growth rate as less electrons must be expected to emerge through the upper surface of the structure.

The PE beam is not uniform as considered in the model. In an ESEM, a Gaussian distribution of the PE beam can be expected, and the scattering of the electron beam in the environmental gas creates an low current density &quot;electron skirt&quot; around the PE beam. This should be considered both for the possible contamination in the larger region irradiated with low current density, but also for reducing the current in the primary beam and thus the growth rate.

It was assumed that the source supply precursor gas with the vapor pressure gas flux rate. The rate could be considerably lower if the source material does not have enough surface area to sustain the gas flow or the distance to the source is too large. The fact that many organometallic compounds decompose in contact with water in the case of EEBD could also reduce the source gas flow.

Not all irradiation induced events will result in deposition of material. Substantial amounts of material could be volatile or negatively ionized and carried away, especially in an the ESEM environment. Electron attachment is also taking place in the ESEM and is known to influence the detection of secondary electrons &lt;ref&gt;G.D. Danilatos. Equations of charge distribution in the environmental scanning electron microscope (esem). Scanning Microscopy, 4(4):799—823, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;. This could reduce the supply of precursor gas and hence the deposition rate.

Surface diffusion of the precursor gas will influence the supply rate. When depositing in only a small area, surface diffusion of adsorbed molecules from the surrounding area can considerably increase the supply of precursor molecules. This is usually the explanation given why many EBD experiments observe that the tip deposition is faster in the beginning; for then to decrease to a steady state growth rate, when a tip structure is formed which limits the supply by surface diffusion. This could increase the rate at the very beginning of the deposition.

The predicted vertical growth rate from the model must be an upper estimate on the achievable rate, since most unaccounted effects will work to reduce the steady state growth rate.

==Summary==

Little data is available on the precursor gasses for EBD. A simple rate equation model gives an estimated deposition vertical growth rate of 100 nm/s for the typical precursor gasses. This estimated growth rate is expected to be an upper limit. Especially the flow rate of precursor gas should be as high as possible in the experiment since this is the limiting factor for the deposition rate.

=Environmental Electron Beam Deposition (EEBD)=

[[Image:EEBDsetup.jpg|thumb|300px|The experimental setup for environmental electron beam deposition (EEBD) with a precursor gas supply either mounted on the sample stage or via an external gas feed system.]]

The ESEM makes it possible to use various gasses in the sample chamber of the microscope since there are narrow apertures between the sample chamber and the gun column, and a region in between that is connected to a differential pumping system. Pressures up to about 10 Torr are normally possible in the sample chamber.

The standard Everly-Thornhart SE detector would not work under such conditions since it would create a discharge in the low pressure gas. Instead a &quot;gaseous secondary electron detector (GSD)&quot; is used, as shown in the figure below. The GSD measures the current of a weak cascade discharge in the gas, which is seeded by the emission of electrons from the sample.

[[Image:EEBD core-shell structure.jpg|thumb|400px|TEM images illustrating how the morphology of EEBD tips using DGAA as precursor depends on the deposition conditions. (a) Apart from water vapor, all other tested environmental gasses (N2; O2/Ar; H2/He) have resulted in tips containing gold particles embedded in an amorphous carbon containing matrix. (b) When using water vapor as environmental gas, a dense gold core becomes increasingly pronounced as the vapor pressure and beam current is increased. (c) A contamination layer almost void of gold can be deposited on the tip by scanning the beam while imaging. So-called proximity contamination can also occur if depositions are done later within a range of a few μm from the tip. The contamination layer is thicker on the side facing later depositions. (d) Electron irradiation in SEM or TEM causes the contaminated tips to bend irreversibly towards the side with the thickest contamination layer. The tips were deposited from left to right and thus bent towards the last deposition. More information in &lt;ref name=&quot;molhavenl&quot;/&gt; and &lt;ref name=&quot;molhavent&quot;/&gt;.]]

In the ESEM one can work with, for instance, water vapour or argon as the environmental gas, and is is possible to have liquid samples in the chamber if the sample stage is cooled sufficiently to condense water.

Without precursor gas present in the chamber, the EBD deposition rate is normally  negligible in the high vacuum mode as well as in the gas mode of the ESEM.

In environmental electron beam deposition (EEBD), the deposited tips have a shell structure and consist of different material layers each characterized by a certain range of gold/carbon content ratio. Above a certain threshold of water vapor pressure and a certain threshold of electron beam current, the deposited tips contain a solid polycrystalline gold core &lt;ref name=&quot;molhavenl&quot;/&gt;.

= An Introduction to The Sumerian Verb Chain =

The verb in Sumerian can look a little daunting at first. Sumerian is an ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination agglutinating]'' language, which means that instead of using lots of small separate words, we use lots of small affixed particles to affect meaning. We've already seen this before, in the plural marker '''.ene''', the possessive suffixes, and case markers. So we're already familiar with suffixes in general.

Now, the verb uses prefixes as well as suffixes to make well-formed words. An example we've seen before is:

# '''mu.na.(n.)du.Ø'''

As an introduction to the verb form in Sumerian, let's take a closer look at this chain of affixes attached to the base, '''du''', meaning &quot;to build&quot;.

Incidentally, whenever you're reading Sumerian, you're likely to encounter parts of words in parentheses, or sometimes even whole words. This generally means that in the original source material, we actually don't see the form given, but we put it in there in the transliteration for convenience. 

=== Marking the Patient of a verb ===

First, the single suffixed particle is the '''.Ø'''. This just signifies that we had a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergativity Patient] which was 3rd person singular. Other persons and numbers have different suffixes, but this one happens to be the null suffix.

=== Marking the Agent of a verb ===

Now let's look at the ''pre''fixes from closest-in to farthest-out. The '''(n.)''' is there to let us know that our [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergativity agent] was 3rd person singular (again, other persons and numbers have different prefixes).

=== Marking the Dative case ===

Next, '''na.''' is basically a reference -- it tells us that somewhere else in the sentence we had a noun phrase that was in the dative case. This is typical in Sumerian -- for many of the cases, we will &quot;resume&quot; the presence of a phrase in that case with a prefix to the verb chain. More on this later.

=== Marking the Ventive case ===

Finally, we have the '''mu.''' at the very front. At present, scholars seem to feel that this is the &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventive Ventive]&quot; prefix. Others still prefer to call it a &quot;Conjugation Prefix&quot;, and not commit to an interpretation. We just don't know!

== The big picture ==

Whew! Now that we've looked at each affix, we notice something. Namely, to analyze a verb form, we just need to break it up into its prefixes and suffixes, then examine each of those in turn. Each one will give us a little more information about the verb or the sentence. A truer use of analysis has never been made.

This practice of breaking down a verb into its component pieces is extremely important in Sumerian. The verb chains can get almost ridiculously complex, with 8 or 9 affixes attached to a stem. Needless to say, this is an important area of study, and we still have much to learn about the interactions of all the particles.

We are now ready to look at some of these pieces in more detail.

= The Sumerian Verb =

Let's take a look now at each piece of the Sumerian verb chain.

== The Verb Stem ==

In Sumerian, verbs usually come in simple one syllable chunks, typically in ''CVC'' (consonant-vowel-consonant, e.g. '''dug''') or ''CV'' (e.g. our friend '''du''' from above).

=== Reduplication ===

This simple structure for verbs leads to a couple of interesting ideas. First, an idea employed by the Sumerian language itself, is that we can make simple modifications to verbs to alter their meaning. With a short verb like '''dug''', we might simply double it (called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduplication reduplication]) to read '''dug.dug'''. In this case, it alters the verb from what is called the '''ĥamtu''' form to the '''maru''' form. We'll discuss what these are a little later, but the important thing to note here is that restricting ourselves to relatively simple forms allow this type of alteration fairly naturally. (Contrast the reduplication of some English verbs, like &quot;reduplicate&quot; for example -- it's hard to imagine people saying &quot;reduplicatereduplicate&quot; in any context!)

=== Homophones and the possibility of Tonality ===

Second, these almost sparse verb forms lead very often to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone homophones] -- two verbs that are written the same way, but mean different things. There simply aren't enough simple verb forms to handle the wide variety of verbs needed in even simple writings. Now, there are a few other languages where word forms are typically very compact, one syllable or so. In these languages, take many Chinese dialects for example, speakers typically use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonal_language tone] to differentiate meaning. The Chinese word &quot;ma&quot; spoken with a high pitch, for example, means &quot;mother&quot;, while when spoken with a falling-then-rising tone means &quot;horse&quot;. Imagine the insults that might arise if tonality were not present to disambiguate these meanings (among others)!

So, some scholars have hypothesized that Sumerian was, in fact, a tonal language. While there are many good indicators for this, principally in the large number of homophones (particularly in fairly common verbs), there simply isn't enough evidence to support the idea yet. Particularly, one would expect that the Akkadian scribes, who later gave us so many interesting and useful translation tables between their language and Sumerian, would have noticed and somehow commented on this phenomenon. Also, the Sumerian writing system, one might imagine, would have developed a way to capture tonality in the script, as has happened in most other tonal scripts.

In any case, it is seldom necessary for us to worry about this. Most readings are clear from context or from similarity to other inscriptions. The important thing about the simple phonological structure of the Sumerian verb is that it makes it easy to recognize simple modifications of that very form.

== The Personal Affixes ==

Whenever there is an agent or patient in a sentence, Sumerian puts a particle inside the verb chain to cross-reference the noun phrase in question. Although there are some other possibilities for placement, for now let's just assume that the agent cross-reference goes just before the verbal root, and the patient cross-reference goes after. We'll see these in more detail in the next lesson.

== The Dimensional Prefixes ==

Just like the particles for cross-referencing agent and patient, Sumerian also likes to cross-reference all the other noun-phrases in a sentence. So any noun phrases in your sentence that are marked in the dative case will show up in the verb chain with a dative particle cross-reference, and a comitative noun phrase will have a comitative cross-reference particle. Again, we'll see a real example of this in the next lesson to make things more concrete. For now, just remember that Sumerian likes to tack things onto the verb chain that match up with the noun phrases in the sentence.

== The Conjugation Prefixes ==

== The Modal Prefixes ==

In our simple verb in (1) above, there was room, believe it or not, for one more prefix. These are called the Modal Prefixes, and they convey the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood mood] of the sentence. In linguistics, mood has a special meaning -- you might be familiar with the English moods of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicative_mood Indicative] (&quot;The ziggurat burned&quot;) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood Imperative] (&quot;Burn the ziggurat!&quot;). Both of these moods, plus others, occur regularly in Sumerian. As in English, the indicative mood is used quite heavily in normal writing. This mood is marked by having ''no prefix'' at all in the Modal Prefix spot (the head of the verb chain). Other moods are marked by explicit prefixes here.

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+ Modal Prefixes
! Prefix !! Mood
|-
| '''nu.'''
| Negative
|-
| '''bara.
| Vetitive, Negative Affirmative
|-
| '''na.'''
| Prohibitive, Affirmative
|-
| '''ga.'''
| Cohortative
|-
| '''ha.'''
| Precative, Affirmative
|-
| '''sa.'''
| ''&lt;see below&gt;''
|-
| '''u.'''
| Prospective
|-
| '''iri.'''
| ''&lt;see below&gt;''
|-
| '''nus.'''
| ''&lt;see below&gt;''
|-
| ''&lt;none&gt;''
| Indicative
|}

Now, it's not important to know all these right now. The list is here to show you what kinds of options are available to the Sumerian scribe. We'll cover many of these later in more detail.

I replaced some of your images you created for [[Telescope Making]]. I am tagging to be deleted. Then can, however, be restored. If you would rather them be restored, you may certainly ask at [[WB:VFU]]. If you have any questions, please ask me at my [[User talk:Iamunknown|talk page]]. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)


I saw that.  I put the images in there to make the overall text a smoother  read, at least for me.

== I'd Like To Help ==

Hi, I'd like to contribute to your telescope WikiBook. I'm very curious about your pie pan mirror idea and I'm thinking about trying it for myself. Maybe this would be a good opportunity to create some high quality images for the book. I'm a photographer and I've had my photographs in a number of magazines usually how-to or illustrative so I think I could do a good job of generating this content. I can also create vector graphics and illustrations where drawings are better than photographs. I have built both refractors and reflectors so I could help with the writing too. Feel free to contacting me at my full name at gmail or through my talk page here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Very good explanations, but this algorithm supposes that you know the number and the categories/values you will find in your database for each column.  What if you do not know?

My records are as follows: product, date, sales.  And I can of course have several sales for the same product on the same day, but this is not the main point.   I need a table looking like this:


&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5

      <text xml:space="preserve">Besides glass tanks the only good, commercially-available hermit crab home is the Exo Terra Terrarium.  A full setup can be seen at the site of this UK owner. The front doors give easy access to the crabs and make the units easy to clean. However, there are some reservations:  expense,  humidity control, substrate depth, and the background piece. 
:* The units come with a mesh lid, so you need to cover part of the mesh or provide a glass lid to retain humidity.  Also, the glass doors do not seal to each other (but do lock securely).
:* The crabs may destroy the background piece.
 
The smallest unit appropriate for hermit crabs (12&quot;W x 12&quot;D x 18&quot;H) is built for 4&quot; of substrate.  (Larger units allow more.)  The limitation comes from the height of the door and the design of the ventilation system (keeps front doors free of moisture), but the units are strong enough to hold more substrate (according to the manufacturer).  For instance, the unit mentioned above is strong enough for 6&quot; of sand. The sand could simply be banked with only 4&quot; at the front &lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt; the unit can be modified for 6&quot; of sand by adding additional pieces of glass.  

Aquarium sealant can be used to install a large piece of glass (approximately 12&quot;W x 6&quot;H) vertically across the unit 3&quot; from the front.  Then two glass pools can be put into the 3&quot; front strip (with the middle of the strip available for other use).
:*Two smaller glass pieces (4&quot;H x 3&quot;W) can be installed vertically 4&quot; from the sides.  -or-
:*Two, small, removable glass pools (approximately 3&quot;W x 4&quot;L x 4&quot;H) can be constructed to slip tightly into the strip.
There are a multitude of ways to help the crabs climb into the pools.  Wood and rocks in the pools, plus a sponge in the fresh water, would give the crabs ways to climb out. To put bubblers in the pools, put small tubing holes in the large glass piece before installing it.

Of course, the sand could simply be banked around the removable glass pools, but that would make them more difficult to empty and, more importantly, one would loose an opportunity to encourage the crabs to climb and exercise.  

If permanent installation of the large glass piece is not desired, it could be braced between the removable glass pools and the sand behind it.  Additional pieces of glass (3&quot;W x 4&quot;H and/or 3&quot;W x 6&quot;H) would be needed to stabilize the setup, so that the glass pools could be removed and emptied without the large glass piece moving.

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]}}

== Overview ==

Rather than a spell, '''''Priori Incantatem''''' is an effect that occurs when two wands that have magical cores deriving from the same source are used against each other. One or the other of the wands is forced to regurgitate the last spells that it was used to cast. The effect is very similar to the spell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prior Incantato|Prior Incantato]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This effect is seen near the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] during the graveyard battle between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]. Both Harry's and Voldemort's wands are powered by tail feathers given by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]]. When they simultaneously cast spells at each other, this effect appears. A fiery stream joins the two wands, forming a golden light that envelops Harry and Voldemort; there are fire beads on the stream between the two wands, which Harry thrusts backwards into Voldemort's wand, forcing it to disgorge its past few spells. The spirit &quot;echoes&quot; of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], the muggle [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]], and Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|father]], who were the last people murdered using Voldemort's wand, appear as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|ghostly simulacra]] of their living selves.

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

We learn much later that this also has the effect of transferring some of the powers of one wand into the other. In this case, Harry, being the stronger wizard for reasons that are discussed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel#Greater Picture|elsewhere]], manages to force Voldemort's wand to disgorge its most recent spells, and in the process gains some of the power of Voldemort's wand.

== Overview ==

The '''''Prior Incantato''''' charm is used to reveal the last spell cast by a wand. Once the spell cast has been determined, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deletrius|Deletrius]] charm can be used to end the display. The effects are similar to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]] wand effect, but not entirely related.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House Elf]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]] is found Stunned, holding a wand, shortly after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] is cast. The Prior Incantato charm is used to determine that it was, in fact, the wand that was found with Winky that was used to cast the Dark Mark.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s wand is captured at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] assumes that, by means of the Prior Incantato charm, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] there will be able to determine that Hermione had tried to repair Harry's wand, and had failed. Remote as this possibility may be, Harry decides that he must proceed as if [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] is aware that his wand has been destroyed.

[[File:Argon.gif|thumb|Argon's symbol on the Periodic Table]]
{{clear}}
==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
Argon has no smell.  It is a colorless gas. It has no taste. It, being inert, is non-toxic.

==How was it discovered?==
Argon was discovered by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay in 1894. It was isolated by examination of the residue obtained by removing nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water from clean air. In fact, air contains slightly less than 1% argon, making it the third most abundant gas in air, behind nitrogen and oxygen. The atmosphere of Mars contains less than 2% argon. It was recognized by the characteristic lines in the red end of the spectrum.

==Where did its name come from?==
The name Argon comes from argos, the Greek word for lazy or inactive.  It got this name, because it doesn't react easily with other elements.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
*Argon is heavier than air.
*Argon is the third most abundant gas in air.
*Argon forms [[w:Argon fluorohydride|only one compound]].

&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Argon is found in the air and is a byproduct of the production of oxygen and nitrogen. Argon makes up .93% of the Earth's atmosphere.

==What are its uses?==
[[Image:Argon.jpg|thumb|Canisters containing Argon gas for use in putting out fire without damaging server equipment]]
[[Image:ArTube.jpg|thumb|left|Argon can be used to make light signs]]
Argon can be used to put out fires without damaging electronics.  Argon is used in welding arcs and growing semiconductor crystals.  Argon is also used in some light signs.  Light signs containing argon emit a deep blue light.

==Is it dangerous?==
Argon is usually not dangerous; it can be inhaled safely as long as there is also oxygen.

      <comment>CPR if non-breathing</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A heart attack is when blood supply to part of the heart is interrupted causing heart tissue to die.  Symptoms of a heart attack include severe chest pain, looking pale, sweating, and feeling sick.  A heart attack is a medical emergency, and it is a leading cause of death for both men and women.

First aid includes the following:
* Seek emergency medical assistance immediately.
* Help the patient to rest in a position which minimizes breathing difficulties. A half-sitting position with knees bent is often recommended.
* Give access to more oxygen, e.g. by opening the window and widening the collar for easier breathing; but keep the patient warm, e.g. by a blanket or a jacket
* Give aspirin, if the patient is not allergic to aspirin. Aspirin inhibits formation of further blood clots.
** Non-coated or soluble preparations are preferred. These should be chewed or dissolved, respectively, to facilitate quicker absorption.  If the patient cannot swallow,  the aspirin can be placed under the tongue.
** U.S. guidelines recommend a dose of 160 – 325 mg.
** Australian guidelines recommend a dose of 150 – 300 mg.
* If it has been prescribed for the patient, give nitroglycerin tablets under the tongue.
* Monitor pulse, breathing, level of consciousness and, if possible, the blood pressure of the patient continually.
* Administer CPR if the victim is unconscious and non-breathing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Okay, so, I just made the frosting for this cake. What I found out:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use unsweetened baker's chocolate, the frosting will be unbelievably sour. I ended up adding 1/2 cup sugar to it, and it's still a bit on the astringent side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't want to refrigerate the whole cake, so I halved the boiling water in the frosting. It seems to have worked reasonably well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a tablespoon of cinnamon gave the frosting a somewhat more interesting taste; I would have added some vanilla extract, but I think there was enough in the cake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Should any of these notes be added to the main page?


Dark chocolate is not baker's chocolate. I like my chocolate very dark, so I used ones with 70% cocao...but depending on your tastes, you may want to get a slightly sweeter bar of dark chocolate. Secondly, as an alternative to making a very liquid frosting and letting it cool, you can also use double cream instead of single cream. (Although i've never seen double cream in the US, which is why i never thought of trying it). Using double cream creates something that is VERY frosting-like in texture.

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;In Linnaeus' time, people already talked about species. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;A species is sort of plant or animal all of the same type, like 'horses' or like 'goldfish'. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;People also already talked about groups of animals that were similar - 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;like {horses and donkeys and zebras}, or like {carp and goldfish}. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;They called a group a '''genus'''. Lots of groups aren't called 'genuses', but '''genera'''. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;They didn't have any system for grouping genera together. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;It was rather like having books grouped into {''books on trains''}, 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;but no group for {''Transport''} or for {''Non-fiction''} or for {''Children's Books''}.


&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Linnaeus started with '''species''' and grouped them into '''genera'''. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;He then grouped genera into '''orders'''. Orders were grouped into '''classes''' 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;and classes were grouped into '''kingdoms'''.

Hi. I'm Ferretinator. I'm from Scotland, and haven't been a Wikibooker very long. I first joined Wikipedia earlier this year, where I wrote two articles on Baker's Cyst and Pattelar Tendon Rupture. I find Wikibooks to be a more fulfilling experience for two reasons:

*My work is more likely to be appreciated, even if people don't know I wrote it.

But more importantly

*Wikibooks is more colaborative than Wikipedia, so I feel as if I'm part of a great team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Welcome to the Theatre!=

The theatre is a great place. Sit and watch as high-calibre actors perform live in front of you, with no cuts, restarts or interruptions. If you're seated in the right position, you may be able to catch a glimpse at some of the more obvious backstage mechanics that operate the props, the backdrops and so forth.

Acting is a great skill. The ability to make people imagine that you are someone else is something only a few possess. In the film ''Alien Autopsy'', the main characters were played by ''Anthony MacPartlan'' and ''Declan Donnoley''. They are known in the UK as two very successful TV show presenters and best friends, so when I saw the film, I imagined I wouldn't think of them as the roles they were portraying, but just as 'Ant and Dec'. But I was wrong. They managed to pull off their characters superbly, and I didn't think of them as two TV presenters. And that's acting.

This book is aimed to help you learn some acting techniques, but be under no illusion that this will improve your acting significantly. Acting is a practical task. Reading about a practical activity doesn't make you a master at it. Go out, join a theatre group and act for real. Then you'll realise what acting is.

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
Antimony is a brittle, bluish silver-white [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Elements#Metalloids|metalloid]].
It has no smell. It also has no odor at all.

==How was it discovered?==
Antimony was known to the ancients.  The discoverer and the date when it was discovered are both unknown.  During the early 1700s, French chemist Nicolas Lemery was the first person to perform a scientific study of antimony and its compounds. His findings were published in 1707.

==Where did its name come from?==
The name &quot;antimony&quot; comes the combination of two Greek words: anti (meaning against) and monos (meaning solitude). When combined, the two words mean &quot;not alone&quot;.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Antimony, in the form of stibnite, was used by the ancient Egyptians as black eyeshadow.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Antimony can be found free in nature, it is usually derived from the ores stibnite (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and valentinite (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  A small amount of the earth's crust, 0.000002%, is made up of antimony.

==What are its uses?==
Antimony is used for hardening lead.  Antimony is also used in the production of plastics and chemicals.  Alloys of antimony are used to make products such as: batteries, low-friction metals, type metal and cable sheathing.  Compounds of antimony are used to make flame-proofing materials, paints, ceramic materials, glass and pottery.

==Is it dangerous?==
Antimony is extremely dangerous. It was once used to kill parasites and is deadly in many of its compounds.

Nickel is a silvery white metal.

==How was it discovered?==
Nickel was discovered in 1751 in Stockholm, Sweden by a Swedish scientist named Axel Fredric Cronstedt.

==Where did its name come from?==
Nickel was named after a mischievous German sprite, Nickel, after miners blamed him for being unable to extract any copper from what they thought was copper ore, but which actually contained nickel.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* US nickel coins are only 25% nickel; the other 75% is copper.
* Some hooks have a layer of nickel so that they oxidize in a slower rate.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Nickel is very common in the Earth's crust.

==What are its uses?==
[[Image:1945-P-Jefferson-War-Nickel-Reverse.JPG|thumb|left|Nickel is used to make nickels.  This one is from World War Two]]
Nickel is found in many coins including, of course, nickels.

==Is it dangerous?==
Nickel can cause allergic reactions from skin contact.  This is sometimes a problem with earrings for pierced ears, but many earrings are now made without nickel for this reason.

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
[[File:PhosphComby.jpg|thumb|left|White phosphorus, red phosphorus, purple phosphorus, and black phosphorus]]
Phosphorus is white, red, or black in color.  When phosphorus is combined with certain other elements, it glows in the dark.  Phosphorus can smell like garlic.  It is not usually found free in nature.

==How was it discovered?==
Phosphorus was discovered by Hennig Brand in 1669 through experiments that involved boiling down and distilling the residue from urine.

==Where did its name come from?==
The name &quot;phosphorus&quot; comes from the combination of the Greek words &quot;''phos''&quot; (light) and &quot;''phoros''&quot; (bearer).

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
*Plants need a small amount of phosphorus to live.
*One type of phosphorus can be changed into another by increasing the temperature or the pressure.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Elemental phosphorus comes in four forms: white phosphorus, red phosphorus, purple phosphorus, and black phosphorus.  White phosphorus is very reactive and will spontaneously combust (burst into flames) when exposed to warm air.  Therefore it is usually stored under water.  The other forms are relatively nonreactive.
One compound of phosphorus, calcium phosphate (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is a major component of bones.  Another, ATP, is used by cells to produce energy.

==What are its uses?==
Phosporus is used in fertilizers and detergents. Phosphoric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is used to make soft drinks. Some phosphorus compounds are used to make light bulbs and television sets.
Drinking water with phosphorus or taking phosphorus pills became fashionable and was thought to increase brain activity and make you smarter in the mid-1800s when phosphorus was discovered in the brain.
In an ironic twist, phosphorus was used by the Allies in World War II to make their bombs glow bright during nighttime raids over Germany, the country of its initial discovery almost 300 years earlier.
Phosphorus is also used to make nerve gas and inside glow sticks.

==Is it dangerous?==
White phosphorus is very toxic and is very damaging to human tissues, especially bones and cartilage.
White phosphorus will spontaneously combust (burn) if exposed to air warmer than 35 degrees Celsius.  Red, purple, and black phosphorus are relatively safe to handle.

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
[[Image:PotassiumFeldsparUSGOV.jpg|thumb|left|Potassium feldspar]]
Potassium is metallic and silvery white. It is soft, waxy and can easily be cut with a knife.

==How was it discovered?==
It was discovered in 1807 when Sir Humphrey Davy extracted it from potassium hydroxide (or caustic potash, KOH,) a compound used in cooking.

==Where did its name come from?==
The name &quot;potassium&quot; comes from the Dutch word Potasch. Potassium was discovered in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy. 

Potassium's chemical symbol, K, comes from the Arabic word القلية (al-qalya), meaning plant-ashes, formed into the Latin word &quot;''kalium''&quot;, most likely because it is an [[w:Alkali_metal|alkali metal]].

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''

Potassium is important for your nerves and muscles.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Potassium makes up nearly 3% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element on the planet.  Potassium is rarely found free in nature as it is a very reactive element.  Instead, potassium is usually found in minerals such as sylvite, carnallite, langbeinite, and polyhalite.  These minerals are usually found in ancient lake and sea beds.  Another important source of potassium, caustic potash, is mined in Germany as well as New Mexico, California and Utah in the United States.

==What are its uses?==
Plants need potassium to grow. Potassium can be found it most soils, usually in the form of potassium chloride (KCl) or potassium nitrate (KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  In addition, potassium chloride is a salt substitute and aids in the production of other chemicals.  Potassium nitrate, also known as saltpeter or niter, is also used to make the heads of matches and pyrotechnics (it is the major component of gunpowder.)  Potassium hydroxide (KOH) can be found in soaps, detergents and drain cleaners.  Potassium carbonate (KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), or pearl ash, is a byproduct of ammonia that can be found in certain types of soap and glass. Potassium is also found in bananas.

==Is it dangerous?==
Pure potassium, as a metal, will light on fire if it touches water.  However, potassium is a required mineral in the body as an ion &amp;mdash; an electric atom.  One of its uses inside the body is in the nerves.  Nerves, and neurons in the brain, carry electricity; the potassium ion, along with the sodium ion, are important to this.

Potassium hydroxide and its solutions should never be touched in any way, as they are '''''EXTREMELY POISONOUS AND CORROSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'''''.

[[File:S-TableImage.svg|thumb|left|500px|Shows the position of Sulfur on the periodic chart.]]
[[File:Sulfur.gif|thumb|Sulfur's symbol on the Periodic Table]]
{{clear}}
Sulfur is a common non metallic element with the chemical symbol S and atomic number 16. 
[[File:Sulphur_crystal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A sulfur crystal is bright yellow.]]

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
It is bright yellow and forms large crystals.  In its native (pure) form it is both odorless and tasteless, but many substances containing sulfur have a distinct odor.  The scent of rotten eggs, burnt matches, and skunks are all caused by sulfurous compounds.

==How was it discovered?==
Sulfur was discovered early in human history.  References in the Bible associated the element with the devil and hell.  The Bible refers to it as brimstone.

==Where did its name come from?==
The word ''sulfur'' has old roots.  It comes from the ancient Latin word for sulfur, ''sulpur'', which later changed to ''sulphur'', perhaps under the influence of the Arabic word for yellow, ''sufra''; and the ancient Latin name came from the word ''Sulvere'' in Sanskrit!

==Where is it found?==
[[File:Sulfur-burning-at-day.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Sulfur melts to a bloodred liquid and burns with a faint blue flame which you can see if you look very closely.]]
In nature, it can be found as the pure element or combined with other elements as different minerals. Sulfur can be found in areas where there are volcanoes. It is also found in meteorites and hot springs. Sulfur is mined from the ground and can be found throughout the world. A compound of sulfur (hydrogen sulfide or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, in which sulfur is combined with [[Wikijunior:The Elements/Hydrogen|hydrogen]]) is also a common component of oil and natural gas, especially now that most sulfur-free oil and gas has been used up. A large amount of the element is made from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S by oil refineries.
[[Image:AlbertaSulfurAtVancouverBC.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Sulfur ready to be loaded on ships.]]
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Sulfur burns with a blue flame.
* The name sulfur is also sometimes spelled sulphur.
* Sulfur boils at 832°F and melts at 239°F.
* Although solid sulfur is bright yellow, molten sulfur is blood red.
&lt;/div&gt;

==What are its uses?==
Sulfur is used to make matches and gunpowder.  It is also used to make fertilizers to help plants grow, and to make sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is used to keep dried fruit from discoloring.  It is an essential element for life.

==Is it dangerous?==
When mixed together with other elements, like hydrogen or oxygen, it can cause lung scarring and breathing problems. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid that can cause burns on unprotected skin. Hydrogen sulfide, called &quot;stinkdamp&quot; by miners due to its offensive smell, is a very dangerous gas. Sulfur is an important part of gunpowder. Gunpowder is explosive and is very dangerous if handled incorrectly.

{{clear}}
==What does it look, feel, taste or smell like?==
[[Image:ZincMetalUSGOV.jpg|thumb]]
Zinc is a hard solid that is bluish in color.

==How was it discovered?==
Zinc was known to the ancients, but it wasn't until 1746 that zinc was isolated by Andreas Marggraf. Marggraf showed people that zinc could be isolated by reducing calamine with charcoal. 

Centuries before the metallic form of zinc was discovered, zinc ores were used for making brass and zinc compounds. An alloy containing 87% zinc has been found in prehistoric ruins in Transylvania. Zinc ores were used for healing wounds and sore eyes. It is estimated that during the rule of Augustus (20 BC to 14 AD), the Romans were the first people to make brass. In the 13th century explorer Marco Polo was cited as describing the production of zinc oxide in Persia. India recognized zinc as a new metal by 1374; at the time, it was the eight metal known to man. Zinc oxide had been produced in Zawar, India from the 12th to 16th centuries. This zinc was produced by reducing calamine using organic substances like wool.

==Where did its name come from?==
The name zinc comes from &quot;zinn&quot;, the German word for tin.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* A human body contains around 2.3g Zinc.
* Another interesting fact.
* Yet another interesting fact.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
[[Image:Foodstuff-containing-Zinc.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Foods and spices that contain the essential mineral zinc]]
Zinc is hard to find, because it is very reactive in its pure form, and makes up less than 1% of the earth's crust.  It's found mostly in compounds like the mineral Zinc Sulfide, also known as sphalerite or zincblende.

==What are its uses?==
Zinc has many common and not-so-common uses:
Zinc is used in many coins. Zinc is used to make brass and bronze. It is also used in metal coating and rust protection, called galvanization.
It is also used in the batteries that power everything from flashlights to radio-controlled toys.  This type of battery was invented by the French chemist George Leclanche more than 100 years ago.
Zinc oxide is a common sunscreen because it can block harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays that damage skin.  This same compound is also used to make white paints and to make photocopies.
Zinc sulfide, another zinc compound, is used in electronic devices as a phosphor (pronounced &quot;''fos-four''&quot;).  Phosphor gives off light when  struck by electrons.  Zinc sulfide has been used on the inside of computer and television screens to produce images from your favorite TV show to computer games.

==Is it dangerous?==
No, it is not dangerous, unless you drop a large enough chunk of it on your head.
Zinc is necessary for the human body and helps boost your immune system.
Zinc oxide can also be used as a sunblock to protect your skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet light.

==Other details about ZINC==
Zinc has a boiling point of 907 degree Celsius and melting point of 419.53 degree Celsius.

      <text xml:space="preserve">During the 19th century, magazines were the predominant national medium. (Newspapers were the local medium.)

Magazines are a kind of periodical (along with newspapers), meaning they are published regularly. Common schedules include weekly, biweekly (every other week), monthly, bimonthly (every other month), quarterly, or even annually. The typical magazine is published on paper, usually with a heavier, thicker paper as the cover, although paper quality varies significantly.They are usually bound with either glue or staples. There are some magazines that are only published online, and other experiments happen, such as magazines on CD, or podcasts. 

Magazines are distributed in several ways. Magazine issues can be sold individually on the newsstand, including grocery stores. They can also be sold as a subscription where several issues will be delivered by mail for a set fee. Other methods include targeted mailings to particular places, or &quot;dropping&quot; issues in high-traffic places like stores, salons, and doctor's offices.

From an advertising perspective, magazines allow messages to be highly targeted - magazines range from a specialized art publication that may reach 2,000 people to a mass publication that could reach 2-3 million people (People, Time Magazines). Magazines also offer a variety of audiences that may be highly targeted to men (Esquire) or women (Vogue), to luxury (Elite Traveler) to the everyday (Woman's Day). Magazine editorial can range from general (Newsweek) to highly specific (Cat Fancy) which offers lots of options for both consumers and advertisers. Categories include General Interest, Celebrity, Epicurean (food), Lifestyle, Service (advice), Fashion/Beauty, Shelter (home), Art, Music, Entertainment, Regional/Local/City, Business, Newsweekly, Newspaper Supplement, Health, Literary, Alternative/Independent, Travel, and Enthusiast (hobbies). Many of these can be categorized further as men's, women's or teen titles. Some target certain ethnic groups, language groups, or lifestyles.

Trade publications are often expensive for the consumer, but they are highly specific to particular industries, for example, long-haul trucking, steel manufacturing, bar owners, or organic farmers all have magazines dedicated to them.

Magazines are good for advertisers, because they typically cater to a narrow demographic. Since it is easy to discern the audience of most magazines, it makes it easy for advertisers to &quot;target&quot; their ads. Generally, magazine readers are professionals in management, and have higher incomes compared to other media audiences. People pay more attention to magazine advertisements than advertising in any other medium, such as TV, radio, or digital.

The policy of &quot;church and state&quot; is self-regulated by the publishing industry. It means that advertisers should not be allowed to influence the editorial or articles of the magazine and vice versa. Publishers may choose to reject an advertisement or require the page to carry the words &quot;advertisement&quot; or &quot;promotion&quot; if it looks too much like an article.

The magazine publishing industry is mostly self-regulated. Most advertisers voluntarily restrict their messaging about tobacco, alcohol, and increasingly unhealthy food.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Merging GTK+ Book ==

Merging the GTK+ book into this book would allow people to contribute to one effort rather then dividing the community as well as allows readers to learn GTK+ along with other aspects of X Windows Programming. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 17:33, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

: Excellent idea. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:18, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

:Bad idea. Remember that GTK is cross-platform. It does not have to run under X. - Anonymous 16:05, 18 May 2007 (UTC)

: Please don't do this.  You don't need to know anything about X to program using Gtk, and you don't need to know anything about Gtk to program X Windows. --[[User:Tony Sidaway|Tony Sidaway]] 23:04, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

: Another vote for not doing this. As already pointed out Gtk and X programming are not related. If you still think they are consider, why we should not merge this with Qt programming, or FLTK programming or someother toolkit programming. --[[User: Balbir Thomas|Balbir Thomas]] 15:12, 21 January 2008 (UTC)

While GTK+ is cross-platform and doesn't need to run under X, GTK+ is most commonly used under X, was originally made for use with X, and still relies on X concepts that need to be understood to write programs that use GTK+. Most of the topics covered in this book will be dealing with libraries and toolkits which happen to be cross-platform, because there more frequently used. Other toolkits or libraries, like Xlib or XCB, are less frequently used directly. This book will be covering GTK+ and Qt, along with other toolkits, regardless of whether or not the merger happens, as most programmers today use them to create programs for X. So why not keep things simple and easy, by letting any contributions to be concentrated in a single work, rather then having work and effort split among different books? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:35, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

: I'd take it the other way round: merge the X Window Programming relevant chapters to existing books, the [[Guide to X11]] for instance. Looking at the X Window Programming content, I've noticed that most of the chapters (beyond XLib and XCB) present only general information, that is, they haven't developed into real book chapters yet. Moreover, the four last topics (SDL, OpenGL, Qt and GTK+) are not part of the X Window system: SDL, GTK+ and Qt use some X Window libraries when built on X11, but they're cross-platform toolkits and use different libraries on other systems; OpenGL is in no way bound to X Window. As a consequence, I'd move the XLib and XCB chapters to the [[Guide to X11]] book, and the Motif information to Wikipedia (Motif is the only toolkit that depends only on X, so it could stay in an X book, but as a framework it can have its own book). Move the other chapters either to Wikipedia or the existing independant books ([[OpenGL]], [[Gtk]], [[Qt]]). I'd add that most of the GTK+ or Qt programmers have never learnt about the X Window concepts, there's no need to learn X to use frameworks built on top of it. Though Qt and Gtk+ were historically based on X libraries, they're now real cross-platform toolkits (especially Qt); many application authors probably choose one of them with that cross-platform idea in mind, whichever the system they choose (or are used to) for main developments. No work will be duplicated when splitting the X Window Programming book because there's no direct relationship between any of them (excepted beetween the first two ones). Moreover, once you've choosed a framework, you don't need to learn (or even know) about the other ones. Some of them allow making direct calls to the X libraries (in which case you'll refer the the X specific book), but they're primarily meant as X abstraction frameworks. --[[User:Romainbehar]]

:: I disagree with splitting this book up. [[Guide to X11]] is for installing and using X11, not for programming under X11. Most of the general information in this book is based on already existing Wikipedia articles. [[Gtk]] hasn't had much development yet either, which is why I suggested a merger with this book, while not suggesting any other mergers. While GTK+ or Qt programmers may never touch X, this book isn't for those type of programmers. This book is for programmers wanting to write programs or games that run under X11, whether only one toolkit or library is being used or a mix of toolkits/libraries are going to be used together. This book is intended to be useful in introductory classes that introduce all these libraries, and useful in advance classes in which students are expected to learn how to make window managers, new interface elements, and use libraries/toolkits together. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:43, 15 March 2008 (UTC)

::: I agree. The two have different scope. [[Gtk]] and [[X Window Programming/GTK+]], however, share a scope and should be merged. Whether that's under this book or the other (used as a reference here) doesn't really matter. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:48, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

== Splash pages ==

Would anyone object to moving the upper half of the main page to /Cover and merge the /Contents with the lower half (the introduction)? I've done this with abandoned books as per the splash page discussion on [[WB:MOS]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:08, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

: There is already a short table of contents listed on the main page that lists each major section of the book. The intent is for /Contents to be a more complete table of contents. The order in which each major section is read should more or less not matter, while chapters in each major section should be read in the order presented. I think this is similar to how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] is organized. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:14, 7 February 2009 (UTC)

== Unix programming ==

Hi. In polish wikibooks is a small page about [[:pl:Programowanie w systemie UNIX|Unix programming]]. Can it be treated as a polish version of this book ? --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adam majewski|contribs]]) 20:10, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

: X Window has many implementations and is available for other systems besides UNIX. I think English Wikibooks may not have a [[Unix Programming]] book yet. Unix Programming is a broader topic in some ways, and in other ways might cover things which may not be compatible across the systems in which X Window is implemented. A person should hopefully be able to write graphic programs using any number of graphic libraries and X Window, whether they are in a UNIX environment or not. How about starting a Unix Programming book instead? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:47, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

== Xview ==

What about old [http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/xview/ Xview] library ? --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adam majewski|contribs]]) 07:08, 27 February 2011 (UTC)

: I am open to the idea of covering other libraries too. Are their people using Xview to develop programs? I think a criteria for inclusion should be that their be an active community of developers using it. The link you provided mentions some problems that have been known since 1993, suggesting there might be no incentive for people to develop programs using Xview any more. Maybe some kind of migration guide could be useful for people that come across programs still using Xview? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:29, 28 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

Hello.  I'm new to Wikibooks, having just come over from Wikipedia a week ago.  You and I seem to be the only people actively working on B3D:N2P.  If you're interested, I'd like to bounce some ideas off you.  Let me know if there's anything I can help you with.

:Like you, I'm working forward through the book.
:In the short term, I plan to:
:*Create a template for formatting menu-navigation paths.
:*Rename some poorly-named modules, starting with [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Tutorial Syntax]].
:*Reduce the amount of material readers must slog through before creating their first scene:
:**Trim unnecessary and/or redundant material.
:**Move completist (i.e., reference) material to the appendices.
:**Defer material leading up to the first scene that isn't useful till later.
:**Hide long digressions that are of interest only to a minority of readers.
:Over the long term, I plan to:
:*Update tutorials so they agree with the behavior of 2.49b.
:*Provide an overview and motivation for each module, section, and unit.
:*Ensure that the module sequence in the navbars agrees with that in the Table of Contents. 
:*Standardize terminology and formatting, making use of templates that already exist.
:*Create new templates to encourage consistent formatting.
:*Flesh out and promote the Glossary.
:I'm all for fixing mistakes.
:I also support adding explanations, provided they help readers accomplish what they want to do and aren't redundant.
:So far, we don't seem to be working at cross-purposes.  While I've been revamping Unit 1, you've been working on Unit 2.  However, I may catch up to you soon.  Collaborating would probably make us more effective.

Not sure it's a good idea to ''revamp'' on your first reading, especially if you still consider yourself a n00b, but it's good to see contributions.

Is there a way to see (your) recent changes for the whole wikibook, without watching each and every page I mean?  I'll get a better overview of your work that way.

== OpenGL and GLSL Programming ==

Hi Beuc, thanks for setting the links. I edited them a bit to clarify them (in my opinion ;). In particular, note that the parts of the GLSL programming book I'm writing so far (GLSL in Unity and Blender) are using OpenGL instead of OpenGL ES (well, OK, except for Unity for iOS and Android, but I'm actually using it on Windows); however, the general parts present the OpenGL ES 2.0 pipeline because that includes more of the OpenGL pipeline than what Unity and Blender exposes to the user; thus, currently it is not necessary to explain the full OpenGL pipeline. In the future (i.e. when the GLSL Programming book would include anything beyond the OpenGL ES 2.0 pipeline, e.g. geometry shaders), another page about the OpenGL pipeline would be necessary. That's why the current page about the pipeline refers to the OpenGL ES 2.0 pipeline. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 09:13, 11 August 2011 (UTC)

:Thinking about it, would it make sense to move the Modern OpenGL section of the OpenGL Programming book to the OpenGL+GLUT part of the GLSL programming book? Just a suggestion. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 15:47, 11 August 2011 (UTC)
::Hi, thanks for contacting me. I aim at writing portable OpenGL with main targets GNU/Linux and Android NDK, so most likely with C++ and OpenGL ES 2.0 too (I currently use Glut but I may use EGL or another wrapper). The tutorials I'm contributing will probably touch areas outside of GLSL (e.g. quadtrees or openal), but I now see that the GLSL book has a broader scope than I first though. So I could move the tutorials to the GLSL book with due links from the OpenGL one, yes.  How do we proceed?[[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 18:23, 11 August 2011 (UTC)

:::It's totally up to you where you want to put your tutorials. I probably won't find the time to work on any tutorials related to what you describe. (Right now I want to focus on Unity and Blender; later maybe WebGL and GameKit.) I think tutorials using portable GLUT on GNU/Linux and/or Android NDK would fit very well into the GLSL Programming book. On the other hand, your tutorials are probably difficult to integrate into an OpenGL book that covers the now deprecated features. Imagine yourself as a reader of the OpenGL programming book in its current form: you start learning about immediate mode, manipulation of the model-view matrix stack and the projection matrix stack, configuration of lighting, display lists, etc. and then - in your section about modern OpenGL - you are told to forget all of this because all of these features are deprecated since OpenGL 3.2. As a reader, I would be very frustrated: why did I just read all this stuff if it is irrelevant? Thus, the current structure does not work very well in my opinion. However, you could also replace most of the OpenGL Programming book by your tutorials and move the now deprecated parts into an appendix. Actually, I think that would be the best solution to keep the OpenGL Programming book up-to-date. However, it would require more effort than just adding the tutorials in a separate section. Well, it's really up to you; I was just wondering what the best solution for potential readers might be. In any case, there is no hurry. 
:::I haven't looked into the Android NDK; I was under the impression that it uses EGL, but maybe GLUT is available, too. My approach of writing platform-specific tutorials is mainly motivated by my frustrating experience with teaching OpenGL 2.x with GLUT and OpenGL ES 2.0 with the PowerVR SDK at the same time. It's just too complicated from a learner's point of view (at least the way I taught it :). Thus, I would recommend that you shouldn't try to cover the use of OpenGL with GLUT and OpenGL ES with EGL in any single tutorial but rather have separate tutorials that might share a lot of the content. (Of course, feel free to ignore my advise. :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 19:24, 11 August 2011 (UTC)

The product rule

The product of two differentiable funcations f and g is itself differentiable.  Moreover, the derivative of fg is the first function times the derivative of the 2nd plus the 2nd fuction times the derivative of the 1st

y' of y = u x v        u &amp; v representing different fuctions like --&gt; (x-3)(x+7)

y' = uv' + u'v

Example 1: Find y' of &lt;math&gt;y=(2x-7)(7x^2+8)&lt;/math&gt;

     remember: y' = uv' + u'v

               &lt;math&gt;y' = (2x-7)[(7*2)x] + (2)(7x^2+8)&lt;/math&gt; product rule
               &lt;math&gt;   = (2x-7)(14x) + 2(7x^2+8) &lt;/math&gt; simplify
               &lt;math&gt;   = 42x^2-98x+16 &lt;/math&gt;

The quotient rule

Similar to product rule,

y' of y = u / v        u &amp; v representing different fuctions like --&gt; (x-3)(x+7)

y' = (u'v - uv') / v^2

Example 1: Find y' of &lt;math&gt;y=(3x)(2x^2)&lt;/math&gt;

               &lt;math&gt;y' = [(3)(2x^2) - (3x)(4x)] / (2x^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt; quotient rule
               &lt;math&gt;   = (6x^2-12x^2) / (4x^4) &lt;/math&gt; simplify
               &lt;math&gt;   = (-6x^2) / (4x^4)
                        = (-3)/(2x^2)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

'''XCB''' ('''X C Binding''') is a [[C programming language|C]] language binding for the [[Guide to X11|X Window System]]. It aims to replace [[../XLib/]]. The project was started in 2001 by Bart Massey.

'''Xlib/XCB''' provides application binary interface compatibility with both Xlib and XCB, providing an incremental porting path.

=== Aims of XCB ===

The main aims of XCB are:

*reduction in library size and complexity;
*direct access to the X11 protocol.

Secondary aims include making the C interface asynchronous, facilitating better multithreading and making extensions easier to implement (via XML protocol descriptions).

The core and extension protocol descriptions are in XML, with the C bindings created via XSLT. A tertiary aim is to repurpose these protocol descriptions for the creation of protocol documentation, further language bindings, and server-side stubs.

Massey has worked to prove XCB formally correct, using Z notation. (Xlib has long been known to contain errors.)

=== Example ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

/* Simple XCB application drawing a box in a window */

#include &lt;xcb/xcb.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  xcb_connection_t *c;
  xcb_screen_t *s;
  xcb_window_t w;
  xcb_gcontext_t g;
  xcb_generic_event_t *e;
  uint32_t mask;
  uint32_t values[2];
  int done;
  xcb_rectangle_t r = { 20, 20, 60, 60 };

  /* open connection with the server */

  c = xcb_connect (NULL, NULL);

  if (!c)
    {
      printf (&quot;Cannot open display\n&quot;);
      exit (1);
    }

  s = xcb_setup_roots_iterator (xcb_get_setup (c)).data;

  /* create window */

  mask = XCB_CW_BACK_PIXEL | XCB_CW_EVENT_MASK;
  values[0] = s-&gt;white_pixel;
  values[1] = XCB_EVENT_MASK_EXPOSURE | XCB_EVENT_MASK_KEY_PRESS;

  w = xcb_generate_id (c);
  xcb_create_window (c, XCB_COPY_FROM_PARENT, w, s-&gt;root,
                     10, 10, 100, 100, 1,
                     XCB_WINDOW_CLASS_INPUT_OUTPUT,
                     s-&gt;root_visual,
                     mask, values);

  /* create black graphics context */

  mask = XCB_GC_FOREGROUND | XCB_GC_GRAPHICS_EXPOSURES;
  values[0] = s-&gt;black_pixel;
  values[1] = 0;

  g = xcb_generate_id (c);
  xcb_create_gc (c, g, w, mask, values);

  /* map (show) the window */

  xcb_map_window (c, w);

  xcb_flush (c);

  /* event loop */
  done = 0;
  while (!done &amp;&amp; (e = xcb_wait_for_event (c)))
    {
      switch (e-&gt;response_type)
        {
        /* (re)draw the window */
        case XCB_EXPOSE:
          printf (&quot;EXPOSE\n&quot;);
          xcb_poly_fill_rectangle (c, w, g, 1, &amp;r);
          xcb_flush (c);
          break;

        /* exit on keypress */
        case XCB_KEY_PRESS:
          done = 1;
          break;
        }
      free (e);
    }

    /* close connection to server */

    xcb_disconnect (c);

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Old Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Simple XCB application drawing a box in a window */

 /* note that this is old code, modern XCB has dropped
  * CamelCase, eg XCBConnection -&gt; xcb_connection_t
  */
 
 #include &lt;X11/XCB/xcb.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 
 int main()
 {
   XCBConnection   *c;
   XCBSCREEN       *s;
   XCBDRAWABLE      w;
   XCBGCONTEXT      g;
   XCBGenericEvent *e;
   CARD32           mask;
   CARD32           values[2];
   int              done = 0;
   XCBRECTANGLE     r = { 20, 20, 60, 60 };
 
                        /* open connection with the server */
   c = XCBConnect(NULL,NULL);
   if (c == NULL) {
     printf(&quot;Cannot open display\n&quot;);
     exit(1);
   }
                        /* get the first screen */
   s = XCBSetupRootsIter( XCBGetSetup(c) ).data;
 
                        /* create black graphics context */
   g = XCBGCONTEXTNew(c);
   w.window = s-&gt;root;
   mask = XCBGCForeground | XCBGCGraphicsExposures;
   values[0] = s-&gt;black_pixel;
   values[1] = 0;
   XCBCreateGC(c, g, w, mask, values);
 
                        /* create window */
   w.window = XCBWINDOWNew(c);
   mask = XCBCWBackPixel | XCBCWEventMask;
   values[0] = s-&gt;white_pixel;
   values[1] = XCBEventMaskExposure | XCBEventMaskKeyPress;
   XCBCreateWindow(c, s-&gt;root_depth, w.window, s-&gt;root,
                   10, 10, 100, 100, 1,
                   XCBWindowClassInputOutput, s-&gt;root_visual,
                   mask, values);
 
                        /* map (show) the window */
   XCBMapWindow(c, w.window);
   
   XCBFlush(c);
 
                        /* event loop */
   while (!done &amp;&amp; (e = XCBWaitForEvent(c))) {
     switch (e-&gt;response_type &amp; ~0x80) {
     case XCBExpose:    /* draw or redraw the window */
       XCBPolyFillRectangle(c, w, g,  1, &amp;r);
       XCBFlush(c);
       break;
     case XCBKeyPress:  /* exit on key press */
       done = 1;
       break;
     }
     free(e);
   }
                        /* close connection to server */
   XCBDisconnect(c);
 
   return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

XCB has a comparable, but slightly lower-level API than [[../XLib | XLib]], as can be seen with these examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

[[Image:SDL_Layers.svg|thumb|Abstraction layers of several SDL platforms]]
'''Simple DirectMedia Layer''' ('''SDL''') is a cross-platform multimedia library written in C that creates an abstraction over various platforms' graphics, sound, and input APIs, allowing a developer to write a computer game or other multimedia application once and run it on many operating systems including GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and MacOS X. It manages video, events, digital audio, CD-ROM, sound, threads, shared object loading, networking and timers.

=== History ===

Sam Lantinga created the library, first releasing it in early 1998, while working for Loki Software. He got the idea while porting a Windows application to Macintosh. He then used SDL to port Doom to BeOS. Several other free libraries appeared to work with SDL, such as SMPEG and OpenAL.

The SDL library has bindings with almost every programming language there is, from the popular ([[C++]], [[Perl]], [[Python Programming|Python]] (through pygame), Pascal etc.) to the less known (such as Euphoria or Pliant). This and the fact that it is open-source and licensed under the LGPL make SDL a common choice for a lot of multimedia applications.

SDL itself is very simple; it merely acts as a thin, cross-platform wrapper, providing support for 2D pixel operations, sound, file access, event handling, timing, threading, and more.  [[X Window Programming/OpenGL|OpenGL]] is often used with SDL to provide fast 3D rendering.  It is often thought of as a cross-platform DirectX, although it lacks some of its more advanced functionality. SDL instead has a huge number of third party extensions that make it easy to do more advanced functions. 

The library is divided into several ''subsystems'', namely the Video (handles both surface functions and OpenGL), Audio, CD-ROM, Joystick and Timer subsystems. Besides this basic, low-level support, there also are a few SDL-dependent libraries that provide some additional functionality. These include SDL_image (provides an easy way to load today's most common image formats), SDL_mixer (complex audio functions, mainly for sound mixing), SDL_net (networking support), SDL_ttf (TrueType Font rendering support), SDL_gfx (some additional graphical functions, such as image resizing and rotating) and SDL_rtf (simple Rich Text Format rendering).

=== Example C Code ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Headers
#include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

// Main function
int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
    // Initialize SDL
    if( SDL_Init( SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING ) == -1 )
        return 1;

    // Delay 2 seconds
    SDL_Delay( 2000 );

    // Quit SDL
    SDL_Quit();

    // Return
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A very basic SDL program. It loads SDL subsystems, pauses for 2 seconds, closes SDL, then exits the program.

Here is more advanced example : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
  #include &lt;SDL.h&gt;
  	
  #define DIM 400.0
  	
  int main() {
       SDL_Surface *screen = SDL_SetVideoMode(DIM, DIM, 0, 0);
       SDL_Surface *surface = SDL_CreateRGBSurface(SDL_SWSURFACE, DIM, DIM, 24, 0xFF, 0xFF00, 0xFF0000, 0);
  		
       double fact = 2;
       double cx = -0.74364500005891;
       double cy = 0.13182700000109;
  		
       while (fact &gt; 1e-18) {
            double xa = cx - fact;
            double ya = cy - fact;
            int y;
  			
            for (y = 0; y &lt; DIM; y++) {
                 Uint8 *pixline = surface-&gt;pixels + y*surface-&gt;pitch;
                 double y0 = ya + y/DIM*2*fact;
                 int x;
                 for (x = 0; x &lt; DIM; x++) {
                      double x0 = xa + x/DIM*2*fact;
                      double xn = 0, yn = 0, tmpxn;
                      int i;
                      for (i = 0; i&lt;512; i++) {
                           tmpxn = xn*xn - yn*yn + x0;
                           yn = 2*xn*yn + y0;
                           xn = tmpxn;
                           if (xn*xn + yn*yn &gt; 4)
                                break;  // approximate infinity
                      }
                      if (i == 512) {
                           // in Mandelbrot set
                           pixline[x*3] = pixline[x*3+1] = pixline[x*3+2] = 0;
                      } else {
                           // not in Mandelbrot set; use escape iteration value to set color (grades of blue then white)
                           pixline[x*3] = pixline[x*3+1] = i &lt; 256 ? 0 : i - 256;
                           pixline[x*3+2] = i &lt; 256 ? i : 255;
                      }
                 }
            }
  			
            SDL_BlitSurface(surface, NULL, screen, NULL);
            SDL_Flip(screen);
            fact /= 2;
       }
  		
       SDL_Quit();
       return(0);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

That is easily compiled and ran under Linux with &quot;gcc `sdl-config --cflags --libs` -O3 mandelbrot.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out&quot;, on Windows it's the same, but you have to use MinGW to compile it.

=== Extensions ===

* SMPEG - SDL MPEG Player Library
* Guichan and ParaGUI - Widget Sets
* GGI - a free cross-platform graphics interface

{{Wikipedia|OpenGL}}

'''OpenGL''' ('''Open''' '''G'''raphics '''L'''ibrary) is a standard specification defining a cross-language cross-platform API for writing applications that produce 3D computer graphics (and 2D computer graphics as well). The interface consists of over 250 different function calls which can be used to draw complex three-dimensional scenes from simple primitives. OpenGL was developed by Silicon Graphics and is popular in the video games industry, where it competes with Direct3D on Microsoft Windows platforms. OpenGL is widely used in computer-aided design, virtual reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, flight simulation, and video game development.

=== Specification ===

At its most basic level, OpenGL is a specification, meaning it is simply a document that describes a set of functions and the precise behaviors that they must perform. From this specification, hardware vendors create implementations &amp;mdash; libraries of functions created to match the functions stated in the OpenGL specification, making use of hardware acceleration where possible. Hardware vendors have to meet specific tests to be able to qualify their implementation as an OpenGL implementation.

Efficient vendor-supplied implementations of OpenGL (making use of graphics acceleration hardware to a greater or lesser extent) exist for Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, many Unix platforms, Wii and PlayStation 3. Various software implementations exist, bringing OpenGL to a variety of platforms that do not have vendor support. Notably, the open source library Mesa is a fully software-based graphics API which is code-compatible with OpenGL. However to avoid licensing costs associated with formally calling itself an OpenGL implementation, it claims merely to be a &quot;very similar&quot; API.

The OpenGL specification is currently overseen by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board (ARB), which was formed in 1992. The ARB consists of a set of companies with a vested interest in creating a consistent and widely available API. Voting members of the ARB as of April 2006 include 3D hardware manufacturers Silicon Graphics, 3Dlabs, ATI Technologies, NVIDIA and Intel, and computer manufacturers IBM, Apple Computer, Dell, and Sun Microsystems. Microsoft, one of the founding members, left in March 2003. Aside from these corporations, each year many other companies are invited to be part of the OpenGL ARB for one-year terms. With so many companies involved with such a diverse set of interests, OpenGL has become very much a general-purpose API with a wide range of capabilities.

According to current plans, control of OpenGL will pass to the Khronos Group by the end of 2006. This is being done in order to improve the marketing of OpenGL, and to remove barriers between the development of OpenGL and OpenGL ES.&lt;ref&gt;{{

Kurt Akeley and Mark Segal authored the original OpenGL specification. Chris Frazier edited version 1.1. Jon Leech edited versions 1.2 through the present version 2.0.

=== Design ===

OpenGL serves two main purposes:
* To hide the complexities of interfacing with different 3D accelerators, by presenting the programmer with a single, uniform API.
* To hide the differing capabilities of hardware platforms, by requiring that all implementations support the full OpenGL feature set (using software emulation if necessary).

OpenGL's basic operation is to accept primitives such as points, lines and polygons, and convert them into pixels. This is done by a graphics pipeline known as the OpenGL state machine. Most OpenGL commands either issue primitives to the graphics pipeline, or configure how the pipeline processes these primitives. Prior to the introduction of OpenGL 2.0, each stage of the pipeline performed a fixed function and was configurable only within tight limits but in OpenGL 2.0 several stages are fully programmable using GLSL.

OpenGL is a low-level, procedural API, requiring the programmer to dictate the exact steps required to render a scene. This contrasts with descriptive (aka scene graph or retained mode) APIs, where a programmer only needs to describe a scene and can let the library manage the details of rendering it. OpenGL's low-level design requires programmers to have a good knowledge of the graphics pipeline, but also gives a certain amount of freedom to implement novel rendering algorithms.

OpenGL has historically been influential on the development of 3D accelerators, promoting a base level of functionality that is now common in consumer-level hardware:

* Rasterised points, lines and polygons as basic primitives
* A transform and lighting pipeline
* Z-buffering
* Texture mapping
* Alpha blending

Many modern 3D accelerators provide functionality far above this baseline, but these new features are generally enhancements of this basic pipeline rather than radical reinventions of it.

=== Example ===

We first clear the color buffer, in order to start with a blank canvas:
 glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT );

We now set the modelview matrix, which controls the position of the camera relative to the primitives we render. We move it backwards 3 units along the Z axis, which leaves it pointing towards the origin:
 glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW );       /* Subsequent matrix commands will affect the modelview matrix */
 glLoadIdentity();                   /* Initialize the modelview to identity */
 glTranslatef( 0, 0, -3 );           /* Translate the modelview 3 units along the Z axis */

The projection matrix governs the perspective effect applied to primitives, and is controlled in a similar way to the modelview matrix:
 glMatrixMode( GL_PROJECTION );      /* Subsequent matrix commands will affect the projection matrix */
 glLoadIdentity();                   /* Initialize the projection matrix to identity */
 glFrustum( -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1000 ); /* Apply a perspective-projection matrix */

Finally, we issue a polygon - a green square oriented in the XY plane:
 glBegin( GL_POLYGON );              /* Begin issuing a polygon */
 glColor3f( 0, 1, 0 );               /* Set the current color to green */
 glVertex3f( -1, -1, 0 );            /* Issue a vertex */
 glVertex3f( -1, 1, 0 );             /* Issue a vertex */
 glVertex3f( 1, 1, 0 );              /* Issue a vertex */
 glVertex3f( 1, -1, 0 );             /* Issue a vertex */
 glEnd();                            /* Finish issuing the polygon */

=== Documentation ===

OpenGL's popularity is partially due to the excellence of its official documentation. The OpenGL ARB released a series of manuals along with the specification which have been updated to track changes in the API. These are almost universally known by the colors of their covers:

* The Red Book - The OpenGL Programmer's guide. ISBN 0-321-33573-2
*: A readable tutorial and reference book - this is a 'must have' book for OpenGL programmers.
* The Blue Book - The OpenGL Reference manual. ISBN 0-321-17383-X
*: Essentially a hard-copy printout of the [http://www.bigwebmaster.com/General/Howtos/Nvidia-OpenGL-Configuration/x89.html man] pages for OpenGL.
*: Includes a poster-sized fold-out diagram showing the structure of an idealized OpenGL implementation.
* The Green Book - Programming OpenGL for the X Window System. ISBN 0-201-48359-9
*: A book about X11 interfacing and GLUT.
* The Alpha Book (which actually has a white cover) - OpenGL Programming for Windows 95 and Windows NT. ISBN 0-201-40709-4
*: A book about interfacing OpenGL with Microsoft Windows.

Then, for OpenGL 2.0 and beyond:

* The Orange Book - The OpenGL Shading Language. ISBN 0-321-33489-2
*: A readable tutorial and reference book for GLSL.

=== Extensions ===

The OpenGL standard allows individual vendors to provide additional functionality through ''extensions'' as new technology is created. Extensions may introduce new functions and new constants, and may relax or remove restrictions on existing OpenGL functions. Each vendor has an alphabetic abbreviation that is used in naming their new functions and constants. For example, NVIDIA's abbreviation (''NV'') is used in defining their proprietary function &lt;code&gt;glCombinerParameterfvNV()&lt;/code&gt; and their constant &lt;code&gt;GL_NORMAL_MAP_NV&lt;/code&gt;. It may happen that more than one vendor agrees to implement the same extended functionality. In that case, the abbreviation ''EXT'' is used. It may further happen that the Architecture Review Board &quot;blesses&quot; the extension. It then becomes known as a ''standard extension'', and the abbreviation ''ARB'' is used. The first ARB extension was &lt;code&gt;GL_ARB_multitexture&lt;/code&gt;, introduced in version 1.2.1. Following the official extension promotion path, multitexturing is no longer an optionally implemented ARB extension, but has been a part of the OpenGL core API since version 1.3.

Before using an extension a program must first determine its availability, and then obtain pointers to any new functions the extension defines. The mechanism for doing this is platform-specific and libraries such as GLEW and GLEE exist to simplify the process.

Specifications for nearly all extensions can be found at the official extension registry [http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/].

=== Associated utility libraries ===

Several libraries are built on top of or beside OpenGL to provide features not available in OpenGL itself. Libraries such as GLU can always be found with OpenGL implementations, and others such as GLUT and [[../SDL/]] have grown over time and provide rudimentary cross platform windowing and mouse functionality and if unavailable can easily be downloaded and added to a development environment. Simple graphical user interface functionality can be found in libraries like GLUI or FLTK. Still others libraries like AUX are deprecated libraries that have been superseded by functionality commonly available in more popular libraries, but code still exists out there particularly in simple tutorials. Other libraries have been created to provide OpenGL application developers a simple means of managing OpenGL extensions and versioning, examples of these libraries include GLEW &quot;The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library&quot; and GLEE &quot;The OpenGL Easy Extension library&quot;.

In addition to the aforementioned simple libraries other higher level object oriented scene graph retained mode libraries exist such as PLIB, OpenSG, OpenSceneGraph, and OpenGL Performer, these are available as cross platform Open Source or proprietary programming interfaces written on top of OpenGL and systems libraries to enable the creation of real-time visual simulation applications.

Mesa 3D ([http://www.mesa3d.org]) is an Open Sourced implementation of OpenGL. It supports pure software rendering as well as providing hardware acceleration for several 3D graphics cards under Linux. As of February 2 2006 it implements the 1.5 standard, and provides some of its own extensions for some platforms.

=== Bindings ===

In order to emphasize its multi-language and multi-platform characteristics, various bindings and ports have been developed for OpenGL in many languages. Most notably, the Java 3D library can rely on OpenGL for its hardware acceleration. Direct bindings are also available like the [http://lwjgl.org/ Lightweight Java Game Library] which has a direct binding of OpenGL for Java and other game related components. Very recently, Sun has released beta versions of the JOGL system, which provides direct bindings to C OpenGL commands, unlike Java 3D which does not provide such low level support. The OpenGL official page [http://www.opengl.org/] lists various bindings for Java, Fortran 90, [[Perl]], Pike, [[Python Programming|Python]], [[Ada Programming|Ada]], [[w:Delphi programming language|Delphi]] and Visual Basic. Bindings are also available for [[C++ Programming|C++]] and [[w:C Sharp Programming|C#]], see [http://www.exocortex.org/3dengine/].

=== Higher level functionality ===

OpenGL was designed to be graphic output-only: it provides only rendering functions. The core API has no concept of windowing systems, audio, printing to the screen, keyboard/mouse or other input devices. While this seems restrictive at first, it allows the code that does the rendering to be completely independent of the operating system it is running on, allowing cross-platform development. However some integration with the native windowing system is required to allow clean interaction with the host system. This is performed through the following add-on APIs:

* GLX - X11 (including network transparency)
* WGL - Microsoft Windows

Additionally the GLUT and [[../SDL/]] libraries provide functionality for basic windowing using OpenGL, in a portable manner. MacOS X has three APIs to get OpenGL support: AGL for Carbon, NSOpenGL for Cocoa and CGL for lower-level access.

=== History ===

Today the digital generation of animated scenes in three dimensions is a regular fixture in everyday life. Scientists utilize computer graphics to analyze simulations of every possibility. Engineers and architects design virtual models using computer graphics. Movies employ computer graphics to create stunning special effects or entire animated films. And over the past few years, computer games have brought computer graphics technology to regular consumers, using graphics to bring their players into worlds that could never exist. 

Bringing digital graphics technology to such widespread use was not without its challenges. Fifteen years ago, developing software that could function with a wide range of graphics hardware and all of their different interfaces was time consuming. Each team of programmers developed interfaces separately, and there was consequently much duplicated code. This was hindering the growing industry of computer graphics. 

By the early 1990's SGI, a leader in 3D graphics, and its programming API, IrisGL, had become a defacto industry standard, over-shadowing  the open-standards-based PHIGS. The IrisGL programming interface (API) was elegant, easy-to-use, and, importantly, supported immediate-mode rendering. By contrast, PHIGS was clunky, hard to use, and was several generations behind IrisGL in function and capability, primarily due to  the dysfunctional PHIGS standardization process. None-the-less, competing vendors, including Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and IBM were able to bring to market credible 3D hardware, supported by proprietary extensions to PHIGS. By the early 90's, 3D graphics hardware technology was fairly well understood by a large number of competitors and was no longer a discriminating factor in computer systems purchases. Thus, rather than prolonging a contentious and dangerous fight between IrisGL and PHIGS, SGI sought to turn a defacto standard into a true open standard.

The IrisGL API itself wasn't suitable for opening (although it had been previously licensed to IBM and others), in part because it had accumulated cruft over the years. For example, it included a windowing, keyboard and mouse API, in part because it was developed before the [[Guide to X11|X11 Window System]] versus Sun's NeWS battle had resolved. Thus, the API to be opened needed to be cleaned up. In addition, IrisGL had a large software vendor (ISV) portfolio; the change to the OpenGL API would keep ISV's locked onto SGI (and IBM) hardware for a few years while market support for OpenGL matured.  Meanwhile, SGI would continue to try to maintain a vendor lock by pushing the higher-level and proprietary Iris Inventor and Iris Performer programming API's.

The result is known as '''OpenGL'''. OpenGL standardized access to hardware, and pushed the development responsibility of hardware interface programs, sometimes called device drivers, to hardware manufacturers and delegated windowing functions to the underlying operating system. With so many different kinds of graphic hardware, getting them all to speak the same language in this way had a remarkable impact by giving software developers a higher level platform for 3D-software development.

In 1992, SGI led the creation of the OpenGL architectural review board (OpenGL ARB), the group of companies that would maintain and expand the OpenGL specification for years to come. OpenGL evolved from (and is very similar in style to) SGI's earlier 3D interface, ''IrisGL''. One of the restrictions of IrisGL was that it only provided access to features supported by the underlying hardware. If the graphics hardware did not support a feature, then the application could not use it. OpenGL overcame this problem by providing support in software for features unsupported by hardware, allowing applications to use advanced graphics on relatively low-powered systems. 

In 1994 SGI played with the idea of releasing something called &quot;OpenGL++&quot; which included elements such as a scene-graph API (presumably based around their Performer technology). The specification was circulated among a few interested parties - but never turned into a product.

When Direct3D was released in 1995, Microsoft, SGI, and Hewlett-Packard initiated the Fahrenheit project, which was a joint effort with the goal of unifying the OpenGL and Direct3D interfaces - and again, adding a scene-graph API. It initially showed some promise of bringing order to the world of interactive 3D computer graphics APIs, but on account of financial constraints at SGI and general lack of industry support it was abandoned. The engineers involved at SGI held a beach party in celebration - complete with bonfires on which they burned piles of Fahrenheit documentation.

=== OpenGL 2.0 ===

OpenGL 2.0 was conceived by 3Dlabs to address concerns that OpenGL was stagnating and lacked a strong direction. 3Dlabs proposed a number of major additions to the standard, the most significant of which was GLSL (the Open'''GL''' '''S'''hading '''L'''anguage, also '''sl'''ang). This would enable the programmer to replace the OpenGL fixed-function vertex and fragment pipelines with shaders written in a [[C programming language|C]]-like language, massively expanding the range of graphical effects possible. GLSL was notable for making relatively few concessions to the limitations of the hardware then available; this hearkened back to the earlier tradition of OpenGL setting an ambitious, forward-looking target for 3D accelerators rather than merely tracking the state of currently available hardware. The final OpenGL 2.0 specification [http://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/version2.0/glspec20.pdf] includes support for GLSL, but omits many of the other features originally proposed which were deferred to later versions of OpenGL (although many are now available as extensions).

=== OpenGL 2.1 ===

OpenGL 2.1 was released on August 2, 2006 and is backward compatible with all prior OpenGL versions. OpenGL 2.1 incorporates the following functionality:

* OpenGL Shading Language revision 1.20
* Commands to specify and query non-square matrix uniforms for use with the OpenGL Shading Language
* Pixel buffer objects for efficient image transfers to and from buffer objects for commands such as &lt;tt&gt;glTexImage2D&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;glReadPixels&lt;/tt&gt;.
*: This functionality corresponds to the &lt;tt&gt;ARB_pixel_buffer_object&lt;/tt&gt; extension.
* sRGB texture formats.
*: This functionality corresponds to the &lt;tt&gt;EXT_texture_sRGB&lt;/tt&gt; extension.

=== OpenGL support libraries ===

*GLUT - The OpenGL utility toolkit.
*GLU - Some additional functions for OpenGL programs.
*GLEW - The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library.

==Market requirements and operations strategy==
[[Image:Market requirements and operations strategy.GIF|thumb|right|400px|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Figure:&lt;/font&gt; Throughout this section, we will look how market requirements help influence the operations' overall strategy]] From what we've studied in the previous sections, we have come to establish a fact that operations, of whatever kind, are influenced by two major factors, the resources for the operations and the market requirements.

Authors like [[#References|Slack]] call the market perspective on the operation strategy as '' 'outside-in' '' where the outside influence tends to tailor the overall strategy of the operations from within.

'''If one is tempted to tailor needs in the operations to match a certain market's requirements, they need to study the market first in order to match the company's marketing efforts. Such decisiveness is called ''market segmentation''.'''

'''Cranksets''' comprise the chainrings and cranks, and sometimes the [[../Bottom Bracket|bottom bracket]]; never the [[../Pedal|pedals]].

There are three main categories of cranksets, depending on how the chainrings are connected to the cranks.  Firstly, the cheapest cranksets are made in one piece, with the chainrings ''welded'' to the cranks.  More expensive and higher-quality ones are bolted on with either four or five bolts.

==Notes to be incorporated in this page==
* Some very expensive cranksets are one piece.
* What to look for when buying cranks and/or chainrings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Keys==

Learn to recognise the key that any given piece of music begins in. This starting key is called the tonic key, and can be found easily by looking at the key signature, and checking for the possible raised seventh note (leading note) which shows if the key is minor. This may require you to learn the &quot;three semitones down&quot; rule for finding the relative minor key, or the circle of 5ths. If you play an instrument you will find that you can learn key signatures pretty quickly by practicing recognition on each piece of music that you play.

Also learn to recognise if the piece has modulated into a diferent key - this can be seen by accidentals that make the notes of a different scale. Be careful here that the piece isn't simply chromatic, or that it hasn't become modal.

== Modes ==

Learn to recognise when a piece of music becomes modal - 'sounds like medieval or church music' is probably the best description. There are different modes, although it's not necessary to be able to name the mode that the segment is in (it might help with points though)

[[File:Le Parkour - Saut de Précision.jpg|thumbnail|300px|A traceur executing a Precision Jump]]

A precision jump is essentially a jump from a one obstacle to another obstacle landing on your two feet. The word &quot;precision&quot; refers to the accuracy needed to land the jump, for example landing on a rail or bollard requires more precision than a large wall or rock.

The jump is usually performed from a stand-still position. Taking off with two legs and landing with two legs. Taking off from one leg (from a run up) is usually referred to as a &quot;running precision&quot;.

When landing (either from a two footed or running take off) it is important that you land on the balls of your feet with your feet together and furthermore &quot;stick&quot; the jump meaning you do not fall forwards or backwards off of the obstacle. the larger distance/smaller the object you are landing on, then the better you are progressing.

When landing a precision jump many people stress the importance of the &quot;90° rule&quot; with an argument that if you bend your legs too much and sink down low into a crouched position, your knees can't and will not tolerate the impact, resulting in joint problems.

The 90° rule is a myth as if you are not strong enough to bend your legs more than 90° then you shouldn't be attempting the jump at all. Everyone can squat but not everyone is strong enough to do so when landing from a height. If you feel uncomfortable with a deep squatting motion then do not attempt any drop or precision jump that will force you into this position.

Having a strong and full range of motion in your legs, is vital when training Parkour, if you cannot go past 90° when landing without discomfort or feeling strong, then physical conditioning is needed to increase your capacity to withstand impact in the full range of motion.

Start with small, low level jumps. From this starting point and with regular practice you should get stronger and get more confidence with jumping and landing. This is transferable to other aspects of Parkour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sort order of &quot;Cuisine of ...&quot; pages==
Currently all the pages in this category titled &quot;Cookbook:Cuisine of ...&quot; appear under their default sort order. So they all appear under 'C'. I think it would be a better idea if they were sorted by country / region (i.e. by using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Cuisines|Nepal]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and so on).&lt;br&gt; Thoughts? --[[User:David Edgar|David Edgar]] 16:50, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
:Hi David - you know my views on alpha cats already so off to have a look at this (&amp; earlier found some delightful DIY pages - all under D!) regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:08, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

:::I think you added &quot;|Albania&quot; to the &quot;wikipedia&quot; template tag.

{{shortcut|WB:DWV|WB:VAND}}

==For beginning vandal fighters==
;Here's how it works
:First you spot some vandalism, for example someone replacing the entire page with profanity, or adding a page with useless or offensive content.  So you revert the page to the last good version, or you mark the page as a [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion|candidate for speedy deletion]]. Congratulations, you have just successfully dealt with vandalism!

===How to revert===
{{main|Help:Editing#Reverting}}

===How to get a page deleted===
Pages which are solely vandalism (and don't have a non-vandalism version to revert to) can be [[WB:SPEEDY|speedily deleted]]. Click the ''edit'' tab at the top of the page, and add {{tlx|delete|vandalism page}} at the top. Add &quot;requesting speedy deletion&quot; to the [[m:Edit Summary|edit summary]], and hit save. Done! An administrator will come along and delete it shortly.

==For experienced vandal fighters==
#Revert their vandalism.
#Give them a warning on their talk page unless the vandalism is from an IP and over a few hours old.
#*If there's a warning already there, check when it was placed. It's only relevant if it's recent (maybe 1 or 2 weeks).
#*If they have a {{tlx|blocked}} template or a recent warning (and have vandalized since that warning), grab an admin at this point since they're a persistent vandal in need of a block.
#Otherwise, go to their [[Special:Contributions|contributions]] and look for other bad edits that haven't been reverted yet, and revert those.
#Check if they've stopped since the warning. If they have, great. If not, [[#Reporting vandalism in progress|notify an admin]].

===Finding vandalism===
If you're a dedicated vandal patroller, you can search for [[#Types of vandalism|vandalism]] in 3 ways:
#Put many pages on your watchlist and review them periodically for vandalism. This is especially useful if you watchlist pages which are regular targets of vandalism.
#Comb through [[Special:Recentchanges]] for vandalism. Often anonymous users are the worst vandals; you can hide logged-in users to narrow down your search. [[Special:Contributions/newbies|New users']] contribs often contain edit tests, mistakes and the like, which is not strictly vandalism, but still needs to be dealt with. [[WB:BITE|Don't bite the newbies!]]
#Join our countervandalism channel [irc://irc.freenode.net/cvn-wb-en #cvn-wb-en], where a bot filters all edits to Wikibooks, presenting you with only suspicious edits.

===Tools for vandalism patrol===
====Rollback====
{{main|Help:Editing#Rollback}}

Users who are vandal fighters can now gain access to the MediaWiki [[Help:Editing#Rollback|rollback]] function, previously reserved for [[WB:ADMIN|administrators]] only. To do so, make your request in the appropriate section of [[WB:RFP]]. The tool is likely to be given to active vandal fighters.

Rollback allows [[Special:ListUsers/sysop|administrators]] and users with the [[Special:ListUsers/reviewer|reviewer permission]] to quickly revert vandalism. The rollback tool will revert all edits by the same user, starting from the top revision.

====User Scripts====
There are also several scripts which make vandal patrol easier. These are available on the ''Gadgets'' tab of [[Special:Preferences]].
;Revert using [[w:WP:TW|Twinkle]]:This allows all users to revert using the Twinkle script. This script does not work in Internet Explorer. ([[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject User scripts/Scripts/Twinkle/doc#Configuration|Configuration]] goes in your [[Special:MyPage/skin.js|skin]])
;User Welcome Script:A script to semi-automagically {{tlx|welcome}} new users with no talk page, leave {{tlx|joinus}} for anons with no talk page, or warn any user with {{tlx|test}}.
;Modify rollback:After using rollback, this script automatically forwards you to the users's contributions page to look for other edits to revert. Be careful, since this means you won't see if there's an error message after clicking rollback.

== Reporting vandalism in progress ==
In cases of repeated or particularly malicious vandalism, take note of that person's IP address or username and report them to the [[Special:ListUsers/sysop|administrators]]. Start a new section at [[WB:AA|Administrative Assistance]], adding the person's IP address or username and a few [[m:Help:Diff|examples]] of vandalistic edits; sign it with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) to give the date and time, and hit save.

In cases of vandalism ''in progress'', you may also want to report in [[irc:wikibooks|#wikibooks]]. Don't wait to see if anyone's around; don't ask if you can report some vandalism - ''just tell us''. If nobody seems to notice, say &lt;code&gt;!admin@enbooks&lt;/code&gt; and try again. Please note that in emergency situations, we may already be dealing with the situation, and are simply too busy repairing the damage to respond.

If no response is evident after a few attempts to get attention over the course of several minutes and there is massive, ongoing vandalism, you should report this to the stewards in [[irc:wikimedia-stewards|#wikimedia-stewards]] by saying !steward in that channel. Stewards are permitted to take emergency action to stop vandals on any wiki.

=== Blocking vandals ===
[[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] have the ability, and the authorization, to block the IPs of ''persistent'' vandals. These blocks should be the shortest effective length.

If an ex-vandal evades an IP block by obtaining a new IP, and starts making genuine (non-vandalism) contributions to Wikibooks, then they will not be blocked or reverted simply because they used to be a vandal. We do not block vandals to punish them, but rather to preserve the integrity of Wikibooks. If an ex-vandal has reformed, then our aims are accomplished.

== Types of vandalism ==
;Blanking: Removing all or significant parts of pages (sometimes replacing the removed content with profanities) is a common vandal edit. However, significant content removals are usually ''not'' considered to be vandalism where the reason for the removal of the content is readily apparent by examination of the content itself, or where a non-frivolous explanation for the removal of apparently legitimate content is provided, linked to, or referenced in an edit summary. Due to the possibility of unexplained good-faith content removal, be cautious about treating anyone doing this like a vandal.

;Childish vandalism: Some vandals spread the textual equivalent of graffiti over pages. They're extremely easy to detect, and are generally reverted in less than a minute.

;Sneaky vandalism: Some vandals think they can outsmart contributors and add misinformation, change dates, or make other sensible-appearing substitutions and typos without anyone noticing, hiding vandalism e.g. by making two bad edits and only reverting one, or reverting legitimate edits to hinder the improvement process. Can often be detected by looking at other edits by the same user, but be careful to avoid confusing sneaky vandalism with genuine corrections to a page. 

;Attention-seeking vandalism: (a type of [[w:internet troll|internet troll]]). The opposite of ''sneaky vandalism'', they want attention, and will do anything to get it, they will write insults, use offensive usernames, replace pages with jokes etc. just to make ''you'' message them, and when you do that, they will find that an excuse to replace your user page with a story about your mother. So when you recognize this type of attack, try not to feed the troll by flaming him or her - just deal with it calmly and unemotionally - or leave it for someone else if it's making you too angry.

{{anchor|Spam}}
;[[m:External links policy|Spam]]: Adding external links to a module or user page for promotional purposes is disruptive, and is considered to be spam. Although the specific links may be allowed under some circumstances, repeatedly adding links will in most cases result in all of them being removed. It is the behaviour in placing the links rather than the content of the site that may cause concerns.
:Wikibooks is generally designed to not require excessive links to third-party websites, as the content is intended to be a permanent textbook reference.  While some links may be necessary (such as where to obtain software required for the book), most of the links in question are not likely to add to a completed textbook.  An alternative site for external links would be the [[w:Open Directory Project|Open Directory Project]], which serves as a directory of links to various websites.

;Link vandalism: Rewriting links within a page so that they appear the same, but point to something completely different or ridiculous (e.g. [[WB:SD|France]]). Redirecting pages to nonsense titles is also vandalism.

;Vandalbot (or spambot): A script or &quot;robot&quot; which creates nonsensical pages (like [[Wikibooks talk:Staff lounge/w/index.php/]]), adds external links, replaces page content, moves pages, or creates malicious usernames. Such attacks are rare, but administrator or [[m:CheckUser|CheckUser]] intervention is often required to stem the tide.

;Pagemove vandalism: Moving pages to offensive or nonsensical names. For example ''Willy on Wheels'' and his many imitators will move a page to PAGENAME on Wheels (&quot;Cookbook&quot; becomes &quot;Cookbook on Wheels&quot;). Generally such attacks are severe; get help from administrators ASAP.

;Copyright vandalism: Knowingly using copyrighted material on Wikibooks in ways which violate [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Wikibooks's copyright policies]] is vandalism. Because users may be unaware that the information is copyrighted, or of Wikibooks policies on how such material may and may not be used, such action ''only'' becomes vandalism if it continues after the copyrighted nature of the material and relevant policy restricting its use have been communicated to the user. Repeatedly uploading images with no source and/or license information after notification that such information is required may also constitute vandalism.

;Bad-faith vandalism: Bad-faith placing or removing of [[Wikibooks:Templates/Deletion|deletion]] and [[Wikibooks:Templates/Maintenance|maintenance]] and other related tags on pages that do not meet such criteria, have not been settled or in order to conceal or avert deletion. Such templates are an important way for people to show that there are problems with a page. Do not remove them from a page unless you are sure that all stated reasons for the dispute are settled. As a general rule, do not remove other people's tags twice during a 24 hour period. Do not place tags improperly, as in when there is no dispute, and the reason for placing the tag is because a suggested edit has failed to meet consensus. Instead, follow the [[Wikibooks:Decision making#Community consensus|decision making process]] and accept that some edits will not meet consensus. Please note that placing or removal of dispute tags does ''not'' count as simple vandalism and is often mistakenly done by new users who are unfamiliar with Wikibooks and such users should be given the benefit of the doubt and pointed to the proper page to discuss the issue.

;Talk page vandalism: Deleting or altering the comments of other users from Talk pages other than your own comments is generally considered vandalism, unless it is your user talk pages, you are removing personal attacks or are archiving an overly long Talk page to a separate page and then removing the text from the main Talk page, which is often considered legitimate. Adding comments to Talk page as if signed or written by someone else is also generally considered vandalism, however adding the proper signature to a comment that someone may have forgotten to include is not vandalism.

;Policy vandalism: Deleting or altering part of a Wikibooks policy or guideline with which the vandal disagrees, without any attempt to seek consensus or recognize an existing consensus. However, improving or clarifying policy wording in line with the clear existing consensus is not vandalism.

;Hidden vandalism: Any of the above in the form of hidden text not visible to the final rendering of the page but visible during editing.

=== Vandalism should not be confused with ===
Vandalism is vandalism: these things are not, though they are sometimes called vandalism. They are therefore treated differently:

;Newbie test: New users that discover the &quot;Edit this page&quot; button sometimes ''really'' want to know if they can edit any page, so they write something inside just to test it. This is not vandalism! On the contrary, these users should be warmly [[Template:welcome|greeted]], and given a reference to the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] where they can keep making their tests (oftentimes they will even revert their own changes).

;Extended newbie test: Some users (especially the young ones) want to check out if they can make an module look ''really'' stupid, or radically change it to become unreadable. They simply want to test the limits of the wiki, some of them will stop (at some point) when you revert their changes, and will feel embarrassed when you write them a message.

;Learning Wiki Markup: Some users require some time to learn the wiki-based markup, and will spend a little time experimenting with the different ways to make external links, internal links, and other special characters. Rather than condemning them as vandals, perhaps point them towards [[Help]] or [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]].

;NPOV violations: The [[WB:NPOV|neutral point of view]] is a difficult policy for many of us to understand, and even Wikibooks veterans occasionally accidentally introduce material which is non-ideal from an NPOV perspective. See [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute|NPOV dispute]]. Try to improve upon the edit rather than simply reverting it out-of-hand.

;Bold edits: Wikibookians often make sweeping changes to modules in order to improve them - most of us aim to [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold]] when updating modules. While having large chunks of text you wrote removed, moved to talk, or substantially rewritten can sometimes feel like vandalism, it is the wiki way.

;Mistakes: Sometimes, users will insert content into a module that is not necessarily accurate, in the belief that it is. By doing so in good faith, they are trying to contribute to Wikibooks and improve it. If you believe that there is [[Wikibooks:Accuracy dispute|inaccurate information]] in a module, ensure that it is, and/or discuss it with the user who has submitted it.

;Unintentional Nonsense: While nonsense can be a form of vandalism, sometimes honest editors may not have expressed themselves correctly (there may be an error in the grammar, particularly for Wikibookians who use English as a second language, or mistakes using wiki markup). This is a type of mistake. Sometimes connection errors unintentionally produce the appearance of nonsense. In either case, [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|Assume good faith]] and help the user along.

;New Patrollers: While page blanking can be a form of vandalism, sometimes new users may try to revert vandalism by blanking the page or taking other steps which may seem questionable. Instead of labelling a potential patroller a vandal, try to fix his or her mistake and point the person to this page so they may learn how to better combat vandalism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A branch statement, or conditional statement, is code that allows you to test whether statements are true or false and then execute some code based on these comparisons.

==The Branch Statements==
#If/Else/Endif
#If/ElseIf/Else/Endif
#Select Case/End Select

==The Branch Statements Explained==
=== &lt;code&gt;If...Else...EndIf&lt;/code&gt; Statement ===

Refer to these lines for the examples below:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    Dim iJunk1 as integer
    Dim iJunk2 as integer
    iJunk1 = 4
    iJunk2 = 7
&lt;/source&gt;

The actual format of the IF statement is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    IF...THEN...ELSE...ENDIF
&lt;/source&gt;

The IF statement ALWAYS tests the left condition or statement for a TRUE result:
    ie: is iJunk1 = 4 ........ TRUE
    ie: is iJunk1 = 5 ........ FALSE
    ie: is iJunk1 &gt; 7 ........ TRUE
    ie: is iJunk1 &lt; iJunk2 ... TRUE

If the condition or statement is true, the IF statement continues to process the top or next portion of the statement using the THEN operator. 

If the THEN operation is a single statement, it can be written on the same line as the test condition:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    IF iJunk1 = 4 THEN iJunk2 = 10
&lt;/source&gt;

If the THEN operation requires two or more statements you will find that the entire IF statement will be MUCH easier to read when written with each statement on its own line:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    IF iJunk1 = 4 THEN
       iJunk1 = iJunk1 + 3    'iJunk1 would then = 7
       iJunk2 = iJunk2 + 1    'iJunk2 would then = 8
    ENDIF
&lt;/source&gt;
As shown above, the IF statement does not require and can be used without the ELSE clause. 

When your IF statement needs to process both a True and a False condition the use of the ELSE clause is required:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    IF iJunk = 4 THEN 
       (execute the True code) 
    ELSE 
       (execute the False code) 
    ENDIF

   IF  NOT iJunk1 = 4 THEN          ' Be carefull of the use of the NOT clause
       (execute the True code)      'iJunk1 is NOT = 4
    ELSE 
       (execute the False code)     'iJunk1 is = 4
    ENDIF
&lt;/source&gt;

It is sometimes easier to read the condition or statement when you place it within paren's:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    IF  NOT (iJunk1 = 4) THEN ............
&lt;/source&gt; 

=== &lt;code&gt;If...ElseIf...Else...EndIf&lt;/code&gt; Statement ===

If/ElseIf statement is used to conditionally execute code based on more than one test condition or statement. If the condition provided in the If statement evaluates to true, the code in the block is executed.  Otherwise, execution would proceed to the ElseIf condition or statement, or on to the Else or EndIf statement.  

The ElseIf and Else clauses are not required parts of an If statement.

An example of the If/ElseIf/Else branch statement is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 'The following variable declarations are for the following example only. They are not needed in real life.
 Dim x As Integer
 Dim y As Integer
 
 If x = y Then
   'Whatever will happen if x = y
 ElseIf x &lt; y Then
   'Whatever will happen if x &lt; y
 Else
   'Whatever will happen if x isn't = to y and x isn't &lt; to y
 End If
&lt;/source&gt; 

=== &lt;code&gt;Select Case&lt;/code&gt; Statement ===

Either strings or numbers can be used for a Select Case statement.

Select Case statements are usually used to avoid long chains of If/ElseIf/.../ElseIf/Else statements.

An example of a Select 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim nCPU as Integer
 Select Case nCPU
     Case 0
         'No CPU!
     Case 1
         'Single CPU
     Case 2
         'Dual CPU machine
     Case 4
         'Quad CPU machine
     Case 3, 5 To 8
         '3, 5, 6, 7, 8 CPU's
     Case Else
         'Something more than 8
 End Select
&lt;/source&gt; 
=== Boolean Operators ===

Boolean operators in Visual Basic .NET now accommodate for short circuit boolean evaluation, most other languages always apply short circuit boolean evaluation by default (usually, this can be turned off with a compiler option), consider the following boolean statement:

  functionA() and functionB()

With this statement, when short-circuit boolean evaluation is used, the second function will only be called if the first function returns true, this is because if functionA returns false it becomes irrelevant to the outcome of the statement whether functionB returns true or not.

However, when no short-circuit boolean evaluation is used, both of the functions will be called irrespective of whether the first part of the statement returns true or false. 

Something to note with short-circuit boolean evaluation is that the order of the parameters can become important when it is used.

Due to previous versions of Visual Basic not having short circuit boolean evaluation, Microsoft has decided to preserve backward compatibility and add two new boolean logic identifiers which support short-circuit boolean evaluation, so in addition to the standard boolean operators:

  Not
  And
  Or
  Xor

There are also two new operators which function using short-circuit boolean evaluation, and they are:

  AndAlso
  OrElse

:Carbon has an electronegativity of 2.55 and Hydrogen 2.20, giving them a difference of 0.35, which is non-polar. I've updated the article to resolve this confusion. [[User:Subwindow|Subwindow]] ([[User talk:Subwindow|talk]])</text>

It's all well and good having a list of key quotes, but its nigh on essential to know whereabouts in the book the quotes take place otherwise, these quotes are pretty useless...

well if you wsnt to prepare a list of quotations and page references feel free...

It may also be more useful if Nora and Dora's quotes are in two seperate lists.</text>

I'm a simple enough middle-aged woman with 2 younger daughters and at least 1 adult son.  I have a college degree and I homeschool my girls.  I'm old enough to know I'm not always right, in fact I'm appalled at my ignorance in some areas.  However, I love to learn.  I came here to learn and didn't find what I wanted, therefore I'm contributing in the hopes of creating what needs to be here.

I don't care if anyone knows what I've contributed.  I think the whole wiki system is exactly why the internet exists in the first place.  Let's try to organize what's real and make it available to everyone.

My crisis is that we aren't allowed to use what's good on the web without copyright problems.  Why write it again when it's already been done elsewhere except it's the only way to get it into this library comprehensively.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pakistan''', officially the '''Islamic Republic of Pakistan''' (اسلامی جمہوریۂ پاکستان), is a country located in South Asia that overlaps with the Greater Middle East. It has a thousand-kilometre coastline along the Arabian Sea in the south and borders Afghanistan and Iran to the west, India to the east and the People's Republic of China in the far northeast. The Kashmir region is claimed by India and Pakistan. Both countries and China separately administer parts of the region with the Indian- and Pakistani-held areas defined by the Line of Control. The Pakistan&amp;ndash;China border is not recognized by India.

Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world and is the second most populous Muslim country. It was established as a modern state in 1947, as one of the two parts of the partitioned British India, but the region has a long history of settlement and civilisation including the Indus Valley Civilisation. The region was invaded by Persians, Greeks, Arabs, Turks, Mongols, Afghans, and was incorporated into the British Raj in the nineteenth century. Since independence, Pakistan has experienced times of significant military and economic growth, and periods of instability, with the secession of East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). Pakistan is a declared nuclear weapons state.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;''Pakistan''&quot; means &quot;Land of the Pure&quot; in Urdu and Persian. It was coined in 1933 by Choudhary Rahmat Ali, who published it in the pamphlet ''Now or Never'' as an acronym of the names of the &quot;Muslim homelands&quot; of western India &amp;mdash; '''P''' for Punjab, '''A''' for ''Afghania'' (the Afghan (Pashtun) areas in the Northwest Frontier Province), '''K''' for Kashmir, '''S''' for Sindh and '''tan''' for Balochistan. The '''i''' was later added to the name since in Urdu, the national language of Pakistan, &quot;istan&quot; refers to &quot;land of&quot; while &quot;pak&quot; means pure. Officially, the nation was founded as the ''Dominion of Pakistan'' in 1947, and was renamed as the ''Islamic Republic of Pakistan'' in 1957.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A couple years ago, I bought a distributor's license from Health and Wellness Company with a view to building  a retail website. It was wildly held that the internet was capable of putting the small retailer on equal footing with the larger online retailers. The products were top of the line vitamins, protein shakes, and skin care products. The company, which is well known in the industry, had an extensive packaging and distribution network that would alleviate two of the most time consuming and burdensom aspects of running an online business. All I had to do was build a retail site, get orders, and money would begin to flow into my business account while I was sleeping! Ok, so I was a little naive. Here are some of the pitfalls that I encountered whilst attempting to put this futile business venture together.

==Under Capitalization==
The first revelation in this endeavor was that quality web design costs money and my meager budget of a few thousand dollars would not buy much.Retailers like Dell computers have multi million dollar budgets for their websites.  Still, the catalogue could be done with Open Source software and a third party vendor ( i.e PayPal) to process payments would save a ton of money. I took it upon myself to study some basic HTML so that much of the tedious work on the catalogue could be done myself. The site was built at remarkably little cost about 4 thousand CDN $ but was completed far past the date that was stated for completion.We had agreed in the area of about 6 or 7 thousand at the beginning but the designer had struggled for months with complications with the Open Source software (he'd recommended) was willing to forfeit some of the cost because his tardiness and lack of experience. Questions about the software he posed on the forum sometimes took days to find answers for if they came at all. 

After completion the designer informed me that the &quot;bus loads&quot; of traffic he'd promised to drive to the site would cost any where between $1,500 to 3,000 dollars per month. Keywords with reasonably high ranking on Google and Yahoo search engines were not cheap. His fee for maintaining the site (doing updates and addressing technical issues) was $100 per month, plus another $30 for the server. 

After mulling this proposition over for a few days,I reasoned that the business of driving traffic to websites too, was new to the designer and that more money spent on this venture would be wasted. I logged onto the site and bought a hundred dollars of my own vitamins,(all I wanted by this time was one sale) called the designer and fired him.

==No Standards==
One of the first things I did when trying to decide on a reputable web design company was attend a seminar on internet retailing at the main branch of the public library. It was here that I was informed by an internet expert that there was no organization in the web design industry which measured the quality of work being done. The industry was new and choosing a reputable designer was hit and miss. One of the noteworthy items in my search for a reputable company was that only one of a dozen or so that I talked with actually had an office. All else were working out of their homes or on a part time basis. This first &quot;company&quot; I hired were a husband and wife team who were designing web sites away from their day jobs. They already had a number of web site clients but were taking on new clients regardless of already being overwhelmed  by the work load. After the initial payment was made time for my site soon disappeared. Furthermore the quality of work proved suspect and tardy. After less than a month I let them go.

After conducting several interviews with local designers the gentlemen I decided on was working with a high profile design company and doing web sites away from work. This too proved a mistake, although technically and professionally he was leaps and bounds better than the first couple, he failed to deliver on his promises in a timely manner and was also guilty of making claims as to his expertise on web design that were false.

== General Time Variant Solution ==

The state-space equations can be solved for time-variant systems, but the solution is significantly more complicated than the time-invariant case. Our time-variant state equation is given as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We can say that the general solution to time-variant state-equation is defined as:

{{eqn|Time-Variant General Solution}}
:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \phi(t, t_0)x(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^{t} \phi(t,\tau)B(\tau)u(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

{{Control Systems/Matrix Dim}}

The function &amp;phi; is called the '''state-transition matrix''', because it (like the matrix exponential from the time-invariant case) controls the change for states in the state equation. However, unlike the time-invariant case, we cannot define this as a simple exponential. In fact, &amp;phi; can't be defined in general, because it will actually be a different function for every system. However, the state-transition matrix does follow some basic properties that we can use to determine the state-transition matrix.

In a time-variant system, the general solution is obtained when the state-transition matrix is determined. For that reason, the first thing (and the most important thing) that we need to do here is find that matrix. We will discuss the solution to that matrix below. 

=== State Transition Matrix ===

{{SideBox|'''Note''':&lt;br&gt;The state transition matrix &amp;phi; is a matrix function of two variables (we will say ''t'' and &amp;tau;). Once the form of the matrix is solved, we will plug in the initial time, t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in place of the variable &amp;tau;. Because of the nature of this matrix, and the properties that it must satisfy, this matrix typically is composed of exponential or sinusoidal functions. The exact form of the state-transition matrix is dependant on the system itself, and the form of the system's differential equation. There is no single &quot;template solution&quot; for this matrix. }}

The state transition matrix &amp;phi; is not completely unknown, it must always satisfy the following relationships:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \phi(t, t_0)}{\partial t} = A(t)\phi(t, t_0)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\tau, \tau) = I&lt;/math&gt;

And &amp;phi; also must have the following properties:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|1.||&lt;math&gt;\phi(t_2, t_1)\phi(t_1, t_0) = \phi(t_2, t_0)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|2.||&lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(t, \tau) = \phi(\tau, t)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|3.||&lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(t, \tau)\phi(t, \tau) = I&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|4.||&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi(t_0, t_0)}{dt} = A(t)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

If the system is time-invariant, we can define &amp;phi; as:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t, t_0) = e^{A(t - t_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

The reader can verify that this solution for a time-invariant system satisfies all the properties listed above. However, in the time-variant case, there are many different functions that may satisfy these requirements, and the solution is dependant on the structure of the system. The state-transition matrix must be determined before analysis on the time-varying solution can continue. We will discuss some of the methods for determining this matrix below.

== Time-Variant, Zero Input ==

As the most basic case, we will consider the case of a system with zero input. If the system has no input, then the state equation is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = A(t)x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

And we are interested in the response of this system in the time interval T = (a, b). The first thing we want to do in this case is find a '''fundamental matrix''' of the above equation. The fundamental matrix is related 

=== Fundamental Matrix ===

{{SideBox|Here, ''x'' is an ''n'' &amp;times; 1 vector, and A is an ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' matrix.}}

Given the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = A(t)x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions to this equation form an ''n''-dimensional vector space in the interval T = (a, b). Any set of ''n'' linearly-independent solutions {x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} to the equation above is called a '''fundamental set''' of solutions. 

{{SideBox|Readers who have a background in [[Linear Algebra]] may recognize that the fundamental set is a '''basis set''' for the solution space. Any basis set that spans the entire solution space is a valid fundamental set.}}

A '''fundamental matrix FM''' is formed by creating a matrix out of the ''n'' fundamental vectors. We will denote the fundamental matrix with a script capital X:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; x_n\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The fundamental matrix will satisfy the state equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}'(t) = A(t)\mathcal{X}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Also, ''any matrix that solves this equation can be a fundamental matrix''  if and only if the determinant of the matrix is non-zero for all time ''t'' in the interval T. The determinant must be non-zero, because we are going to use the inverse of the fundamental matrix to solve for the state-transition matrix.

=== State Transition Matrix ===

Once we have the fundamental matrix of a system, we can use it to find the state transition matrix of the system:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t, t_0) = \mathcal{X}(t)\mathcal{X}^{-1}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of the fundamental matrix exists, because we specify in the definition above that it must have a non-zero determinant, and therefore must be non-singular. The reader should note that this is only one possible method for determining the state transition matrix, and we will discuss other methods below.

=== Example: 2-Dimensional System ===

{{TextBox|1=Given the following fundamental matrix, Find the state-transition matrix.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}e^{-t} &amp; \frac{1}{2} e^{t} \\ 0 &amp; e^{-t}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

the first task is to find the inverse of the fundamental matrix. Because the fundamental matrix is a 2 &amp;times; 2 matrix, the inverse can be given easily through a common formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^{-1}(t) = \frac{\begin{bmatrix}e^{-t} &amp; -\frac{1}{2}e^t \\ 0 &amp; e^{-t}\end{bmatrix}}{e^{-2t}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = \begin{bmatrix} {e}^{t}&amp;-\frac{1}{2}\,{e}^{3t}\\0&amp;{e}^{t}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The state-transition matrix is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t, t_0) = \mathcal{X}(t)\mathcal{X}^{-1}(t_0) = \begin{bmatrix}e^{-t} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} e^{t} \\ 0 &amp; e^{-t}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} {e}^{t_0}&amp;\frac{1}{2}\,{e}^{3t_0}\\0&amp;{e}^{t_0}\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t, t_0) = \begin{bmatrix} e^{-t + t_0} &amp; \frac{1}{2}(e^{t + t_0} - e^{-t + 3t_0}) \\ 0 &amp; e^{-t+t_0}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Other Methods ===

There are other methods for finding the state transition matrix besides having to find the fundamental matrix. 

;Method 1:If A(t) is triangular (upper or lower triangular), the state transition matrix can be determined by sequentially integrating the individual rows of the state equation.

;Method 2:If for every &amp;tau; and t, the state matrix commutes as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;A(t)\left[\int_{\tau}^{t}A(\zeta)d\zeta\right]=\left[\int_{\tau}^{t}A(\zeta)d\zeta\right]A(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:Then the state-transition matrix can be given as:
::&lt;math&gt;\phi(t, \tau) = e^{\int_\tau^tA(\zeta)d\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;
:The state transition matrix will commute as described above if any of the following conditions are true:
:#A is a constant matrix (time-invariant)
:#A is a diagonal matrix
:#If &lt;math&gt;A = \bar{A}f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant matrix, and f(t) is a single-valued function (not a matrix).
:If none of the above conditions are true, then you must use '''method 3'''.
;Method 3:If A(t) can be decomposed as the following sum:
::&lt;math&gt;A(t) = \sum_{i = 1}^n M_i f_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:Where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant matrix such that M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = M&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a single-valued function. If A(t) can be decomposed in this way, then the state-transition matrix can be given as:
::&lt;math&gt;\phi(t, \tau) = \prod_{i=1}^n e^{M_i \int_\tau^t f_i(\theta)d\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
It will be left as an exercise for the reader to prove that if A(t) is time-invariant, that the equation in '''method 2''' above will reduce to the state-transition matrix &lt;math&gt;e^{A(t-\tau)}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Example: Using Method 3 ===

{{TextBox|1=Use method 3, above, to compute the state-transition matrix for the system if the system matrix A is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}t &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; t\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We can decompose this matrix as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}t + \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Where f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = t, and f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = 1. Using the formula described above gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t, \tau) = e^{M_1\int_\tau^t \theta d\theta}e^{M_2 \int_\tau^t d\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving the two integrations gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t, \tau) = e^{\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}(t^2 - \tau^2) &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; (t^2-\tau^2)\end{bmatrix}}e^{\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; t-\tau \\ -t+\tau &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is a diagonal matrix, and the solution to that matrix function is all the individual elements of the matrix raised as an exponent of ''e''. The second term can be decomposed as:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; t-\tau \\ -t+\tau &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}} = e^{\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}(t-\tau)} = \begin{bmatrix}cos(t-\tau) &amp; sin(t-\tau)\\ -sin(t-\tau) &amp; cos(t-\tau)\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The final solution is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(t, \tau) = &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}e^{\frac{1}{2}(t^2-\tau^2)} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; e^{\frac{1}{2}(t^2-\tau^2)}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}cos(t-\tau) &amp; sin(t-\tau)\\ -sin(t-\tau) &amp; cos(t-\tau)\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \begin{bmatrix}e^{\frac{1}{2}(t^2-\tau^2)}cos(t-\tau) &amp; e^{\frac{1}{2}(t^2-\tau^2)}sin(t-\tau)\\ -e^{\frac{1}{2}(t^2-\tau^2)}sin(t-\tau) &amp; e^{\frac{1}{2}(t^2-\tau^2)}cos(t-\tau)\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Time-Variant, Non-zero Input ==

If the input to the system is not zero, it turns out that all the analysis that we performed above still holds. We can still construct the fundamental matrix, and we can still represent the system solution in terms of the state transition matrix &amp;phi;. 

We can show that the general solution to the state-space equations is actually the solution:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \phi(t, t_0)x(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^{t} \phi(t,\tau)B(\tau)u(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

This book attempts to introduce prospective students to the English language.  We hope to create a solid and well-done course to those who wish to learn how to speak, read, and write English.  The benefits of learning this language are manifold: English is spoken in more countries than any other language, and is considered the &quot;lingua franca,&quot; or international language of the world.  It is the primary or major secondary language in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, and many other countries, and is used by businesspeople, travelers, etc. across the world.

This book is intended for both non-native speakers learning English, and teachers trying to teach the English language.  While it does not talk about the aspects of teaching, it contains content that should be useful.

== Digital Systems ==

Digital systems, expressed previously as difference equations or Z-Transform transfer functions can also be used with the state-space representation. Also, all the same techniques for dealing with analog systems can be applied to digital systems, with only minor changes.

== Digital Systems ==

For digital systems, we can write similar equations, using discrete data sets:

:&lt;math&gt;x[k + 1] = Ax[k] + Bu[k]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y[k] = Cx[k] + Du[k]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Zero-Order Hold Derivation ===

If we have a continuous-time state equation:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We can derive the digital version of this equation that we discussed above. We take the Laplace transform of our equation:

:&lt;math&gt;X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}Bu(s) + (sI - A)^{-1}x(0)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, taking the inverse Laplace transform gives us our time-domain system, keeping in mind that the inverse Laplace transform of the ''(sI - A)'' term is our state-transition matrix, &amp;Phi;:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}(X(s)) = \Phi(t - t_0)x(0) + \int_{t_0}^t\Phi(t - \tau)Bu(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we apply a zero-order hold on our input, to make the system digital. Notice that we set our start time ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = kT'', because we are only interested in the behavior of our system during a single sample period:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = u(kT), kT \le t \le (k+1)T&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \Phi(t, kT)x(kT) + \int_{kT}^t \Phi(t, \tau)Bd\tau u(kT)&lt;/math&gt;

We were able to remove ''u(kT)'' from the integral because it did not rely on &amp;tau;. We now define a new function, &amp;Gamma;, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(t, t_0) = \int_{t_0}^t \Phi(t, \tau)Bd\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this new expression into our equation, and setting ''t = (k + 1)T'' gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;x((k + 1)T) = \Phi((k+1)T, kT)x(kT) + \Gamma((k+1)T, kT)u(kT)&lt;/math&gt;

Now &amp;Phi;(T) and &amp;Gamma;(T) are constant matrices, and we can give them new names. The ''d'' subscript denotes that they are digital versions of the coefficient matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;A_d = \Phi((k+1)T, kT)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B_d = \Gamma((k+1)T, kT)&lt;/math&gt;

We can use these values in our state equation, converting to our bracket notation instead:

:&lt;math&gt;x[k + 1] = A_dx[k] + B_du[k]&lt;/math&gt;

== Relating Continuous and Discrete Systems ==
{{Wikipedia|Discretization}}
Continuous and discrete systems that perform similarly can be related together through a set of relationships. It should come as no surprise that a discrete system and a continuous system will have different characteristics and different coefficient matrices. If we consider that a discrete system is the same as a continuous system, except that it is sampled with a sampling time T, then the relationships below will hold. The process of converting an analog system for use with digital hardware is called '''discretization'''. We've given a basic introduction to discretization already, but we will discuss it in more detail here. 

=== Discrete Coefficient Matrices ===

Of primary importance in discretization is the computation of the associated coefficient matrices from the continuous-time counterparts. If we have the continuous system ''(A, B, C, D)'', we can use the relationship ''t = kT'' to transform the state-space solution into a sampled system:

:&lt;math&gt;x(kT) = e^{AkT}x(0) + \int_0^{kT} e^{A(kT - \tau)}Bu(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x[k] = e^{AkT}x[0] + \int_0^{kT} e^{A(kT - \tau)}Bu(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Now, if we want to analyze the ''k+1'' term, we can solve the equation again:

:&lt;math&gt;x[k+1] = e^{A(k+1)T}x[0] + \int_0^{(k+1)T} e^{A((k+1)T - \tau)}Bu(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Separating out the variables, and breaking the integral into two parts gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;x[k+1] = e^{AT}e^{AkT}x[0] + \int_0^{kT}e^{AT}e^{A(kT - \tau)}Bu(\tau)d\tau + \int_{kT}^{(k+1)T} e^{A(kT + T - \tau)}Bu(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

If we substitute in a new variable ''&amp;beta; = (k + 1)T + &amp;tau;'', and if we see the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{AkT}x[0] = x[k]&lt;/math&gt;

We get our final result:

:&lt;math&gt;x[k+1] = e^{AT}x[k] + \left(\int_0^T e^{A\alpha}d\alpha\right)Bu[k]&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this equation to our regular solution gives us a set of relationships for converting the continuous-time system into a discrete-time system. Here, we will use &quot;d&quot; subscripts to denote the system matrices of a discrete system, and we will use a &quot;c&quot; subscript to denote the system matrices of a continuous system.

|-
|&lt;math&gt;D_d = D_c&lt;/math&gt;
|}

{{Matlab CMD|c2d}}

If the A&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; matrix is nonsingular, then we can find its inverse and instead define B&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt;B_d = A_c^{-1}(A_d - I)B_c&lt;/math&gt;

The differences in the discrete and continuous matrices are due to the fact that the underlying equations that describe our systems are different. Continuous-time systems are represented by linear differential equations, while the digital systems are described by difference equations. High order terms in a difference equation are delayed copies of the signals, while high order terms in the differential equations are derivatives of the analog signal. 

If we have a complicated analog system, and we would like to implement that system in a digital computer, we can use the above transformations to make our matrices conform to the new paradigm.

=== Notation ===

Because the coefficent matrices for the discrete systems are computed differently from the continuous-time coefficient matrices, and because the matrices technically represent different things, it is not uncommon in the literature to denote these matrices with different variables. For instance, the following variables are used in place of ''A'' and ''B'' frequently:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = A_d&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R = B_d&lt;/math&gt;

These substitutions would give us a system defined by the ordered quadruple ''(&amp;Omega;, R, C, D)'' for representing our equations.

As a matter of notational convenience, we will use the letters ''A'' and ''B'' to represent these matrices throughout the rest of this book.

== Converting Difference Equations ==

{{TextBox|1=
Now, let's say that we have a 3rd order difference equation, that describes a discrete-time system:

:&lt;math&gt;y[n+3] + a_2y[n + 2] + a_1y[n + 1] + a_0y[n] = u[n]&lt;/math&gt;

From here, we can define a set of discrete state variables x in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt;x_1[n] = y[n]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_2[n] = y[n + 1]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_3[n] = y[n + 2]&lt;/math&gt;

Which in turn gives us 3 first-order difference equations:

:&lt;math&gt;x_1[n + 1] = y[n + 1] = x_2[n]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_2[n + 1] = y[n + 2] = x_3[n]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_3[n + 1] = y[n + 3]&lt;/math&gt;

Again, we say that matrix x is a vertical vector of the 3 state variables we have defined, and we can write our state equation in the same form as if it were a continuous-time system:

:&lt;math&gt;x[n+1] = \begin{bmatrix}
              0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
              0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
              -a_0 &amp; -a_1 &amp; -a_2
            \end{bmatrix} x[n] +
            \begin{bmatrix}
              0 \\ 0 \\ 1
            \end{bmatrix} u[n]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = \begin{bmatrix}
                1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
              \end{bmatrix} x[n]&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Solving for x[n] ==

We can find a general time-invariant solution for the discrete time difference equations. Let us start working up a pattern. We know the discrete state equation:

:&lt;math&gt;x[n+1] = Ax[n] + Bu[n]&lt;/math&gt;

Starting from time ''n = 0'', we can start to create a pattern:

:&lt;math&gt;x[1] = Ax[0] + Bu[0]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x[2] = Ax[1] + Bu[1] = A^2x[0] + ABu[0] + Bu[1]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x[3] = Ax[2] + Bu[2] = A^3x[0] + A^2Bu[0] + ABu[1] + Bu[2]&lt;/math&gt;

With a little algebraic trickery, we can reduce this pattern to a single equation:

{{eqn|General State Equation Solution}}
:&lt;math&gt;x[n] = A^nx[n_0] + \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}A^{n-1-m}Bu[m]&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this result into the output equation gives us:

{{eqn|General Output Equation Solution}}
:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = CA^nx[n_0] + \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}CA^{n-1-m}Bu[m] + Du[n]&lt;/math&gt;

== Time Variant Solutions ==

If the system is time-variant, we have a general solution that is similar to the continuous-time case:

:&lt;math&gt;x[n] = \phi[n, n_0]x[n_0] + \sum_{m = n_0}^{n-1} \phi[n, m+1]B[m]u[m]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = C[n]\phi[n, n_0]x[n_0] + C[n]\sum_{m = n_0}^{n-1} \phi[n, m+1]B[m]u[m] + D[n]u[n]&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;phi;, the '''state transition matrix''', is defined in a similar manner to the state-transition matrix in the continuous case. However, some of the properties in the discrete time are different. For instance, the inverse of the state-transition matrix does not need to exist, and in many systems it does not exist.

=== State Transition Matrix ===

The discrete time state transition matrix is the unique solution of the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi[k+1, k_0] = A[k] \phi[k, k_0]&lt;/math&gt;

Where the following restriction must hold:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi[k_0, k_0] = I&lt;/math&gt;

From this definition, an obvious way to calculate this state transition matrix presents itself:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi[k, k_0] = A[k - 1]A[k-2]A[k-3]\cdots A[k_0]&lt;/math&gt;

Or,

:&lt;math&gt;\phi[k, k_0] = \prod_{m = 1}^{k-k_0}A[k-m]&lt;/math&gt;

== MATLAB Calculations ==

MATLAB is a computer program, and therefore calculates all systems using digital methods. The MATLAB function '''lsim''' is used to simulate a continuous system with a specified input. This function works by calling the '''c2d''', which converts a system ''(A, B, C, D)'' into the equivalent discrete system. Once the system model is discretized, the function passes control to the '''dlsim''' function, which is used to simulate discrete-time systems with the specified input.

Because of this, simulation programs like MATLAB are subjected to round-off errors associated with the discretization process.

== Routh-Hurwitz in Digital Systems ==

Because of the differences in the Z and S domains, the Routh-Hurwitz criteria can not be used directly with digital systems. This is because digital systems and continuous-time systems have different regions of stability. However, there are some methods that we can use to analyze the stability of digital systems. Our first option (and arguably not a very good option) is to convert the digital system into a continuous-time representation using the '''bilinear transform'''. The bilinear transform converts an equation in the Z domain into an equation in the W domain, that has properties similar to the S domain. Another possibility is to use '''Jury's Stability Test'''. Jury's test is a procedure similar to the RH test, except it has been modified to analyze digital systems in the Z domain directly.

=== Bilinear Transform ===

One common, but time-consuming, method of analyzing the stability of a digital system in the z-domain is to use the bilinear transform to convert the transfer function from the z-domain to the w-domain. The w-domain is similar to the s-domain in the following ways:

*Poles in the right-half plane are unstable
*Poles in the left-half plane are stable
*Poles on the imaginary axis are partially stable

The w-domain is warped with respect to the s domain, however, and except for the relative position of poles to the imaginary axis, they are not in the same places as they would be in the s-domain. 

Remember, however, that the Routh-Hurwitz criterion can tell us whether a pole is unstable or not, and nothing else. Therefore, it doesn't matter where exactly the pole is, so long as it is in the correct half-plane. Since we know that stable poles are in the left-half of the w-plane and the s-plane, and that unstable poles are on the right-hand side of both planes, we can use the Routh-Hurwitz test on functions in the w domain exactly like we can use it on functions in the s-domain.

=== Other Mappings ===

There are other methods for mapping an equation in the Z domain into an equation in the S domain, or a similar domain. We will discuss these different methods [[Control Systems/Z Transform Mappings|in the '''Appendix''']].

== Jury's Test ==

Jury's test is a test that is similar to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, except that it can be used to analyze the stability of an LTI digital system in the Z domain. To use Jury's test to determine if a digital system is stable, we must check our z-domain characteristic equation against a number of specific rules and requirements. If the function fails any requirement, it is not stable. If the function passes all the requirements, it is stable. Jury's test is a necessary and sufficient test for stability in digital systems.

Again, we call D(z) the '''characteristic polynomial''' of the system. It is the denominator polynomial of the Z-domain transfer function. Jury's test will focus exclusively on the Characteristic polynomial. To perform Jury's test, we must perform a number of smaller tests on the system. If the system fails any test, it is unstable. 

=== Jury Tests ===

Given a characteristic equation in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;D(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + \cdots + a_Nz^N&lt;/math&gt;

The following tests determine whether this system has any poles outside the unit circle (the instability region). These tests will use the value N as being the degree of the characteristic polynomial.

{{TextBox|1=The system must pass all of these tests to be considered stable. If the system fails any test, you may stop immediately: you do not need to try any further tests.

;Rule 1:If z is 1, the system output must be positive:
::&lt;math&gt;D(1) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
;Rule 2:If z is -1, then the following relationship must hold:
::&lt;math&gt;(-1)^ND(-1) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
;Rule 3:The absolute value of the constant term (a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) must be less than the value of the highest coefficient (a&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;):
::&lt;math&gt;|a_0| &lt; a_N&lt;/math&gt;

If '''Rule 1''' '''Rule 2''' and '''Rule 3''' are satisified, construct the '''Jury Array''' (discussed below).

;Rule 4: Once the Jury Array has been formed, all the following relationships must be satisifed until the end of the array:
::&lt;math&gt;|b_0| &gt; |b_{N-1}|&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;|c_0| &gt; |c_{N-2}|&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;|d_0| &gt; |d_{N-3}|&lt;/math&gt;
:And so on until the last row of the array. If all these conditions are satisifed, the system is stable.}}

While you are constructing the Jury Array, you can be making the tests of '''Rule 4'''. If the Array fails '''Rule 4''' at any point, you can stop calculating the array: your system is unstable. We will discuss the construction of the Jury Array below.

=== The Jury Array ===

The Jury Array is constructed by first writing out a row of coefficients, and then writing out another row with the same coefficients in reverse order. For instance, if your polynomial is a third order system, we can write the First two lines of the Jury Array as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\underline{
       \begin{matrix} z^0 &amp; z^1 &amp; z^2 &amp; z^3 &amp; \ldots &amp; z^N
                   \\ a_0 &amp; a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; a_3 &amp; \ldots&amp; a_N
                   \\ a_N &amp; \ldots &amp; a_3 &amp; a_2 &amp; a_1 &amp; a_0
       \end{matrix}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, once we have the first row of our coefficients written out, we add another row of coefficients (we will use '''b''' for this row, and '''c''' for the next row, as per our previous convention), and we will calculate the values of the lower rows from the values of the upper rows. Each new row that we add will have one fewer coefficient then the row before it:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\underline{
       \begin{matrix} 1) &amp; a_0 &amp; a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; a_3 &amp; \ldots &amp; a_N
                   \\ 2) &amp; a_N &amp; \ldots &amp; a_3 &amp; a_2 &amp; a_1 &amp; a_0
                   \\ 3) &amp; b_0 &amp; b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; b_{N-1}
                   \\ 4) &amp; b_{N-1}&amp; \ldots &amp; b_2 &amp; b_1 &amp; b_0
                   \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots
                   \\ 2N-3) &amp; v_0 &amp; v_1 &amp; v_2
       \end{matrix}}}&lt;/math&gt;
Note: The last file is the (2N-3) file, and always has 3 elements. This test doesn't have sense if N=1, but in this case you know the pole!

Once we get to a row with 2 members, we can stop constructing the array.

To calculate the values of the odd-number rows, we can use the following formulae. The even number rows are equal to the previous row in reverse order. We will use k as an arbitrary subscript value. These formulae are reusable for all elements in the array:

:&lt;math&gt;b_k =  \begin{vmatrix} a_0 &amp; a_{N-k} 
                           \\ a_N &amp; a_k
              \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_k =  \begin{vmatrix} b_0 &amp; b_{N-1-k} 
                           \\ b_{N-1} &amp; b_k
              \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d_k =  \begin{vmatrix} c_0 &amp; c_{N-2-k} 
                           \\ c_{N-2} &amp; c_k
              \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
This pattern can be carried on to all lower rows of the array, if needed.

=== Example: Calculating e&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ===

{{TextBox|1=Give the equation for member e&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; of the jury array (assuming the original polynomial is sufficiently large to require an e&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; member).

Going off the pattern we set above, we can have this equation for a member e:

:&lt;math&gt;e_k = \begin{vmatrix} d_0 &amp; d_{N-R-k} 
                          \\ d_{N-R} &amp; d_k
             \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Where we are using R as the subtractive element from the above equations. Since row c had R &amp;rarr; 1,  and row d had R &amp;rarr; 2, we can follow the pattern and for row e set R &amp;rarr; 3. Plugging this value of R into our equation above gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;e_k = \begin{vmatrix} d_0 &amp; d_{N-3-k} 
                          \\ d_{N-3} &amp; d_k
             \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And since we want e&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; we know that k is 5, so we can substitute that into the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;e_5 = \begin{vmatrix} d_0 &amp; d_{N-3-5} 
                          \\ d_{N-3} &amp; d_5
             \end{vmatrix}
           = \begin{vmatrix} d_0 &amp; d_{N-8} 
                          \\ d_{N-3} &amp; d_5
             \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

When we take the determinant, we get the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;e_5 = d_0d_5 - d_{N-8}d_{N-3}&lt;/math&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is of vital importance that your original photographs, letters, maps, documents and other artifacts are stored properly, with primary attention paid to the preservation of these things.  An archiving policy must meet two key requirements: the archives ''must'' ensure the long-term physical preservation of the archives, and it also needs to facilitate access to the archives; at times, these two factors can be in opposition.

In this chapter, you can read more about how to preserve and catalogue your:
* [[/Photographs|photographs]]; and
* [[/Paper documents|paper documents]].


==Notes to be added to this page==
* Accessioning: sequential/serial (former implies no gaps in numbering) accession numbers given to ''all'' artifacts (photos, documents, etc.), with no duplicates.
* Don't fold or roll anything.
* Accession things, in any order, and store correctly; then catalogue and re-order (most commonly chronologically -- which is why there's no need to try and order at accessioning time).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book will discuss the topic of Control Systems, which is an interdisciplinary engineering topic. Methods considered here will consist of both &quot;Classical&quot; control methods, and &quot;Modern&quot; control methods. Also, discretely sampled systems (digital/computer systems) will be considered in parallel with the more common analog methods. This book will not focus on any single engineering discipline (electrical, mechanical, chemical, etc.), although readers should have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of at least one discipline. 

This book will require prior knowledge of linear algebra, integral and differential calculus, and at least some exposure to ordinary differential equations. In addition, a prior knowledge of integral transforms, specifically the Laplace and Z transforms will be very beneficial. Also, prior knowledge of the Fourier Transform will shed more light on certain subjects. Wikibooks with information on calculus topics or transformation topics required for this book will be listed below:

Project Management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirement [PMBOK 1.3]  There are books out there that teach about Project Management and the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), and a few others teach how to pass CAPM/PMP.  The intent of this book is to bridge the gap between knowledge of Project Management and how to use it in an exam.  This book will be neutral in nature and does not cover a particular industry.  As you can see from the table of contents, this book consists of several chapters.  Exactly one chapter is dedicated to each Project Management Process.  This will enable you to view each process as its own entity.

==== Audience ====
This book is intended for those who would like to become a Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or a Project Management Professional (PMP), and for those who would like to get started in Project Management.  If you are already certified, congratulations! This book will help you keep current on the subject.  Understanding the content of this book does not require you to be an experienced project manager. It is useful to anyone willing to study the art of project management.  A brief introduction at the beginning of each chapter gives an overview of what is to be covered. If you are an experienced project manager, you may encounter concepts with which you are already familiar. Feel free to skip those sections and proceed.

==== Exam Information ====
This exam is conducted by [[w:Project Management Institute|Project Management Institute]] (PMI), a &quot;not-for profit&quot; (as opposed to &quot;non-profit&quot;) organization dedicated for project management practices by setting standards and providing associations for project manager.
This book covers PMI's Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), Third Edition published in 2004.  The Fourth edition came out in December 2008.

==== Prerequisite ====
The citations on this book are from the PMBOK 3.0 published in 2004.  So it is advisable to have a copy of PMBOK 3.0 published by PMI.

=== Part I: Concepts and Practices ===
==== Introduction ====
This part gently introduces the Project Management Fundamentals.  
Chapter 1 deals with the Framework of Project Management building the blocks for essential project management function.  Chapter 2 provides an in-depth knowledge of the Project Life Cycle

==== Chapter 1 Project Management Framework ====
After reading this part, the user should be able to
- Identify the difference between project and Operational Work.
- Understand the characteristics of the project.

Definition of Project: A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result [1.2.1].

Characteristics of the Project:
 - Temporary
 - Have definite beginning and end
 - Create unique product or service
 - Have objective that indicate completion
 - Progressive Elaboration

'''Temporary'''&lt;br&gt;
Temporary in the sense that the project by itself has definite beginning, definite end and is not an ongoing process.  Bear in mind, temporary does not apply to the product, service or result itself.  Projects are carved to last long.&lt;BR&gt; 
For instance, construction of road is a project. The project last for a specified period of time.  Once the road is laid, the project is said to be complete.  The project completion should be measurable.  Once this project is completed, the on-going process of maintaining the road which is not a project will put in place.  The road lasts longer while the project wraps until complete.

'''Unique'''&lt;br&gt;
Product or service produced by the project is different from anything else on the market and involves creating something new to this environment.  Unique nature does not mean that no such project exists.
Consider construction of a bridge.  It is considered as a project, because either the existing bridge is torn down and a new one is constructed or a new bridge is constructed.  In the first case, since the outcome is a new bridge and not routine maintenance of the bridge, it becomes project.  Even though the technology of bridge construction exists, it becomes unique as they are carried at different locations with different owner, different river.  

'''Purposeful (Objective)'''&lt;br&gt;
Well defined set of desired end result.  One of the requirements of objective is that it is measurable.  This quality of the objective will enable to mark the project complete.

'''Have Life cycle'''&lt;br&gt;
Progress from an idea, through planning and execution, until they are complete.&lt;br&gt;
Have definite beginning and ending

'''Have interdependencies'''&lt;br&gt;
Have defined sequence.

'''Progressive Elaboration'''&lt;br&gt;
Developing in steps and continuing by increments.
Project entities are described in broad terms at the start of the project but detailed as project progress.  Initially this may look failure prone as the details are not detailed, but will eventually 
 
''Example:''&lt;br&gt;
The activity undertaken to construct a bridge is considered as project as (1) the project ends by the time the construction is complete (2) have time limit as to when the bridge should be finished (3) Not a routine maintenance work (4) Will provide an ability to cross the river. 

'''Portfolio / Program / Project'''&lt;br&gt;

A portfolio can be a collection of programs or projects and without dependency between each other. One example or portfolio would be to improve facility services. It would be composed of a program to improve water, other to improve electricity, other to improve gas. Programs and projects are grouped to achieve strategic business objectives. Portfolio management is about management of one or more portfolios.

A program is a collection of projects, but they all share similar goals and would have benefits if coordinated together. Managing each of them alone would not allow to achieve same benefits. Program management helps in resolving issues constraints, aligning directions.

Project has a specific goal and scope.

==== Chapter 6 Project Management Plan ====
3.2.2.1 (4.3)


==== Chapter 7 Scope Planning ====
3.2.2.2 (5.1)

Have you ever made a trip to the grocery store just to buy a loaf of bread and milk.  However when you check out you realize that you were enticed to buy meat, cookies, candy, pies, and every other item that looked tasty in store.  It is easy to exceed your original intentions if you do not have a clear objective of what your plan of attack is and how you plan to prevent yourself from diverting from your original path.  

The following section discusses scope management which is how to get your work completed – and make sure you only get the correct work completed.  We will also discuss how as a project manager you can create a plan to control your projects scope to ensure you have a plan to keep your work in line with your customers requirements.

According to the PMBOK Project scope management is “the processes to ensure that the project includes all of the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully”.  The project scope statement also meets the following criteria

    1.  It determines what is included in the project.
    2.  It serves as a guide to determine what work is not needed to complete the project objectives
    3.  It defines what work is needed to complete the project objectives.
    4.  It serves as a point of reference for what is not included in the project.

All this contributes to show that a Project Scope Statement is really just a statement that tells all stakeholders for the project what work is required to complete the project.  It is a great tool for a project manager to determine what work is included on the project and all the project manager to add or remove work from the project.


== Scope Planning Process ==

'''Inputs'''
Project Charter, Preliminary project scope statement, project management plan

'''Outputs'''
Scope Management plan

The Scope Management plan is a document that plays a key role at helping the project manager avoid possible issues with future scope changes, and scope creep.  The Scope Management plan consists of some of the following characteristics.

1.	It can be very formal or informal
2.	The document describes how scope changes will be classified and identified
3.	The plan describes how the project scope will be managed
4.	The plan can be as detailed as the project manager deems necessary
5.	This document is considered a subsidiary piece of the overall project management plan.

==== Chapter 8 Scope Definition ====
3.2.2.3 (5.2)

{{TODO|Transwiki or mine [[w:scope_(project_management)]]}}

==== Chapter 9 Create WBS ====
3.2.2.4 (5.3)

The WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) is a method of representing work packages, from the high level down to the low level. The project may be &quot;Clean Kitchen&quot; and is made of secondary level work packages such as &quot;Wash Floor,&quot; &quot;Clean Fridge,&quot; and &quot;Wipe Countertops&quot;. &quot;Wash Floor&quot; might be broken down into &quot;Prepare Materials,&quot; &quot;Clear Floor of Objects,&quot; and &quot;Scrub&quot;. 

Work Packages should be broken down to whatever level is needed; either common sense takes over or the project scope limits the detail level. This is graphically represented by something such as:

==== Chapter 10 Activity Definition ====
3.2.2.5 (6.1)

{{TODO|mine http://project-management-knowledge.com/definitions/a/activity-definition/}}

==== Chapter 11 Activity Sequencing ====
3.2.2.6 (6.2)

Activity sequencing is a process for identifying dependencies between scheduled events.

==== Chapter 12 Activity Resource Estimating ====
3.2.2.7 (6.3)

This process is required for finding out what types of resources are required for each scheduled activity.

{{TODO|mine http://project-management-knowledge.com/definitions/a/activity-duration-estimating/}}

==== Chapter 13 Activity Duration Estimating ====
3.2.2.8 (6.4)

This process tries to find out the number of work periods shall be required for each activity which has been scheduled.

{{TODO|mine http://pmp-preparation.blogspot.com/2008/01/activity-duration-estimation.html - http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/estimate-activity-duration-HA001139963.aspx}}

==== Chapter 14 Schedule Development ====
3.2.2.9 (6.5)


This process is used to analyze sequences of activities, schedule constraints, 
resource requirements, and activity durations to come up with a feasible project schedule.

==== Chapter 15 Cost Estimating ====
3.2.2.10 (7.1)

A good cost estimation includes the identification of cost components through thorough research.   This enables the costs of a project to be monitored, and while the project is in progress, avoids cost overruns.

Inaccuracies in the cost estimation are inevitable. The goal is to be as realistice as possible 

Typical cost components include labour, supplies, materials, equipments, and overheads.


S-Curve.

The S Curve is a tool which consists of a display of cumulative costs, labour hours or other quantities plotted against time.

The name of the S-Curve comes from the S-like shape of the curve, flatter at the beginning and end and steeper in the middle. The S-curve is useful as a cost estimation tool because it is the way most of the projects look like in the real world.

The S curve can be used as an indicator for many applications related to project management such as: target, baseline, cost, and time.

There are multiple types of S curves and they include : 

The Cost versus Time S Curve. This is useful for projects that contain labour and non-labour tasks.

The Target S Curve. This is useful for the ideal progress of the project if all tasks are completed as currently scheduled.

The Value and Percentage S Curve. This is a useful for calculating the project's actual percentage completion.

The Actual S Curve. This one ise useful in depicting the actual progress of the project until the present time.

==== Chapter 16 Cost Budgeting ====
3.2.2.11 (7.2)
This process is used to find out the quality standards and metrics which shall be used in the project and also how they can be met satisfactorily.
Budgeting means allocation of funds, suppose the estimate is of 100 units, but the money which can be provided for that activity is only 70 units. then 70 units becomes our budget.
moreover it is the comprehensive short-term operational plan for a business.


The bill of materials defines the complete set of materials required in order to create a product.

The BOM can be in the form of a tree with multiple levels.
It can also be in a document format which is indented to the lowest level required, so that it accurately lists all parts and raw materials needed to make the specified product.

The BOM is then used by the project manager and/or purchasing department to order any supplies which are necessary for the project.

==== Chapter 17 Quality Planning ====
3.2.2.12 (8.1)

{{TODO|mine http://www.projectperfect.com.au/info_project_quality_planning.php - http://www.mymanagementguide.com/project-quality-planning-steps-to-developing-a-project-quality-plan-template/}}

==== Chapter 18 Human Resource Planning ====
3.2.2.13 (9.1)


This process is carried out to find out the human resources required for the project.

Also the roles of all team members.

1.  Plan Purchases and Acquisitions 

2.  Plan Contracting 

3.  Request Seller Responses 

4.  Select Sellers 

5.  Contract Administration 

6.  Contract Closure 


'''Types of bilateral procurment contrats'''

'''Request for Proposal (RFP):''' this is a request for a detailed proposal on price, how the work will be accomplished, skills and experience of the people to be included and various other details. These items of service are usually higher dollar value and tend to be for nonstandard items.

'''Request for Quotation (RFQ):''' requests a price quote per item and hour. These items are relatively low dollar value.

'''Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Bid (RFB):''' requests a single price for the entire package of work. Items of service are usually high dollar value and are standard.

=== Part V - Monitor and Control Phase ===
12 Chapters
==== Chapter 34 Monitor and Control Project Work ==== 
3.2.4.1 (4.5)


This process is used to observe the execution of the project. 
The objective is to identify problems and issues in a timely manner and suggest corrective action so that the project's objectives can be met. 

By knowing the variances of the project from the plan, corrective action can be suggested.

This includes monitoring project parameters and comparing them to the performance baseline.

Preventing the circumvention integrated change control so that only approved changes ar implemented.

Thus avoiding scope creep and gold plating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why Project Management? ==
	Project Management is one of the field that did not get much industry attention.  The reason for this is two fold.  This subject often associated with another underlying industry, be it a constructional engineering or Information Technology, which acts as a back bone while Project Management makes it successful.  The second reason is the benefit is often hidden to gain popularity or even get a credit.  When you meet a successful Project Manager, he or she is normally associated with an industry.  Though this is not a requirement for Project Management, but it is the fact.  Let us face it, you can not identify 'Risks' if you are not familiar with the industry which is a crucial point in successful Project Management.  Remember, Project Management Practices can be applied to literally any industry, the missing link between the best practices in Project Management and the industry itself will be the main course of this book.  We tell you the bits and pieces of Project Management Practices and use your judgment as to how you can apply this to your industry.

== Is this a new career? ==
	Project Management is not new to us.  Project Management exists since civilization and the need is ever growing.  As early as third dynasty (2650 BC), when Egyptians build pyramids, they had exactly the same factors we have today – Time constraint, budget and resource.  Netjerikhet Djoser was successful building pyramids, just because he used right tool to get the work done - Project Management.

== Where to go from here? ==
	Today, handful of universities offer courses on Project Management.  One such course that attain popularity is Master of Science in Project Management (MSPM).  There are few certifications out there that give the confident to hiring organization that the holder knows the best practices in Project Management.  The accreditation depends on which part of the world you live.  US and its affiliated countries recognize PMI's certification while UK affiliates recognize Prince2.  Depending on your industry, each organization may follow a slightly different practices which are based on industry standard subsidized level of PMI or Prince2 practices.

== How should I use this book? ==
	If you are aiming at the certification from PMI (CAPM/PMP), then this book covers most of your need.  Learn the basics, each process groups and knowledge areas processes thoroughly.  As you learn through the prose, you will also learn how this has been applied or applicable to a set of industry – Then try to associate with this knowledge in your industry and advance.

== Am I eligible? ==
	Please visit PMI's website [http://www.pmi.org]for eligibility requirements.

== Can I submit this as SDL-PDU? ==
	Not at this time.  SDL PDU stands for Self-Directed Learning and PDU for Professional Development Unit.  As this is currently work in progress book, I have no intention of taking to PMI for a proposal at this time.  If this would ever change, you can find the details in this section.

== Disclaimer ==
	This work is no way related to PMI or it's affiliation thereby.  As with all wiki works, put this book for good use.</text>

=== Description ===
This step requires two dancers, usually one male and one female.
# The dancers stand side by side, right hip to right hip.  Each dancer places his or her right hand on his/her partner's waist, on the partner's left hand side.  The left arm is raised in fifth position.
# The dancers perform bihunets, turning in a circle around each other.

The direction of the step may be reversed.  Dancers join left sides and raise their right arms into fifth position.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This exercise describes how to convert a UTF8 string into a Unicode string in Haskell.

UTF8 is a superset of ASCII, so the following ASCII string is also a valid UTF8 string.  To convert this to a unicode code point, simply take the ASCII ordinal value as the code point.

{| cellspacing=5
|- align=center bgcolor=lightgreen
| String             ||  H   ||   e   ||   l   ||   l   ||   o   
|- align=center
| ASCII code         || x48  ||  x65  ||  x49  ||  x49  ||  x6F 
|- align=center
| Unicode code point || U+0048|| U+0065|| U+0049|| U+0049|| U+006F
|}

Non-ascii characters span multiple byte and take more work to convert to a unicode code point.

{| cellspacing=5
|- align=center bgcolor=lightgreen
| String             ||      你     ||      好
|- align=center
| ASCII code         || xE4:xBD:xA0 || xE5:xA5:xBD
|- align=center
| Unicode code point ||   U+4f60    ||   U+597d
|}

Every non-ASCII unicode character when encoding in UTF8 must consist of a leading byte and one or more trailing bytes.  Trailing bytes are of the form 0x10nnnnnn so they are easy to recognise.  Leading bytes are of the form 0x110nnnnn, 0x1110nnnn, or 0x1111nnnn, each signifying that there are 1, 2, or 3 trailing bytes respectively.

The UTF8 to unicode translation can be describe thus:

{|
| Bytes || UTF8                                        || Unicode
|-
| 2     || 0x110aaaaa 0x10bbbbbb                       || 0x0000000000aaaaabbbbbb
|-
| 3     || 0x1110aaaa 0x10bbbbbb 0x10cccccc            || 0x00000aaaabbbbbbcccccc
|-
| 4     || 0x11110aaa 0x10bbbbbb 0x10cccccc 0x10dddddd || 0xaaabbbbbbccccccdddddd
|}

In the case of 2 bytes, if the resulting code point is less than or equal to 127, then the UTF8 character sequence is illegal because codepoints 0 to 127 are already represented in the ASCII subset.  Notice that each trailing byte contributes 6 bits to the code point while the leading byte contributes 5, 4, or 3 bits to the code point depending on the type of leading byte.  Keep this in mind because we will use bit shifting and recursion on this property for the translation.

==The code==

First we need to import the &lt;tt&gt;ord&lt;/tt&gt; function from &lt;tt&gt;Data.Char&lt;/tt&gt; and the bitwise operators &lt;tt&gt;.&amp;.&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise AND), &lt;tt&gt;.|.&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise OR), and &lt;tt&gt;shiftL&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise shift left) from &lt;tt&gt;Data.Bits&lt;/tt&gt;.

 &gt; import Data.Bits
 &gt; import Data.Char

To help document the code we define UTF8 type synonyms for character and string datatypes.  The type synonyms will make it clear which function argument, or return type contains what sort of data.
 
 &gt; type Utf8Char = Char
 &gt; type Utf8String = String

Here we define a helper function that will be used later on in the code.  The function determines if a value is inclusively between two values.

 &gt; within :: Ord a =&gt; a -&gt; (a, a) -&gt; Bool
 &gt; within value (min, max) = (min &lt;= value) &amp;&amp; (value &lt;= max)
 
 &gt; consumeUtf8 :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Utf8String -&gt; String
 &gt; consumeUtf8 ordinal 0 remainder = (chr ordinal):(fromUtf8 remainder)
 &gt; consumeUtf8 ordinal n (next:remainder) =
 &gt;   consumeUtf8 newOrdinal (n-1) remainder
 &gt;   where
 &gt;     nextOrdinal = (ord next) .&amp;. (ord '\x3f')
 &gt;     newOrdinal = (ordinal `shiftL` 6) .|. nextOrdinal
 &gt; consumeUtf8 _ n [] =
 &gt;   error &quot;Incomplete character.  Expecting &quot; ++ (show n) ++ &quot; more bytes.&quot;
 
 &gt; fromUtf8 :: Utf8String -&gt; String
 &gt; fromUtf8 [] = []
 &gt; fromUtf8 (lead:remainder)
 &gt;   | lead `within` asciiRange = fromUtf8 remainder
 &gt;   | lead `within` plus1Range = consumeUtf8 (ordinal plus1Mask) 1 remainder
 &gt;   | lead `within` plus2Range = consumeUtf8 (ordinal plus2Mask) 2 remainder
 &gt;   | lead `within` plus3Range = consumeUtf8 (ordinal plus3Mask) 3 remainder
 &gt;   | otherwise = error $ &quot;Invalid lead byte: &quot; ++ (show lead)
 &gt;   where
 &gt;     asciiRange = ('\x00', '\x7f')
 &gt;     badRange00 = ('\x80', '\xbf') -- Only tail bytes in this range
 &gt;     badRange01 = ('\xc0', '\xc1') -- Prevent duplicating code points &lt;= 127
 &gt;     plus1Range = ('\xc2', '\xdf')
 &gt;     plus2Range = ('\xe0', '\xef')
 &gt;     plus3Range = ('\xf0', '\xf4')
 &gt;     badRange02 = ('\xf5', '\xff') -- Illegal in Unicode, or RFC 3629
 &gt;     plus1Mask = '\x1f'
 &gt;     plus2Mask = '\x0f'
 &gt;     plus3Mask = '\x07'
 &gt;     ordinal mask = (ord lead) .&amp;. (ord mask)</text>

[[Image:Library organization chart simple partial.jpg|In a library, all the books are carefully classified and organised.]]

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Think about how books are organised in a library. How do you find the book called '''High-speed Trains'''?. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Books on '''&quot;Trains&quot;''' should be kept together.

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;All the books on trains might be in with all the other books on '''&quot;Transport&quot;'''.

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Books on transport will be in '''&quot;Non-fiction&quot;''' (books of facts). 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;All the books for children will be in the '''&quot;Children's&quot;''' part of the library. 


&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;So books in a library are organised by the sort or '''class''' of books they are.

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;We say they are '''class'''ified. It makes them easy to find.


&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Linnaeus classified plants and animals in the same sort of way. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Just like organising books, the idea was to think of what was the '''same''' 
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;about all the plants or animals in a group.

Hi - 
     I've reverted to a previous edition on this page which does not put forward the doctrine of God's causation of man's fall, and other strongly deterministic elements. Although, not being all-knowing, I can't judge whether these ideas are right or wrong - these ideas shouldn't be evident in a page on the essence of Christianity when the vast majority of Christians would disagree with them! 
     Hope that is ok, please talk if you disagree!

&lt;code&gt;\def &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; &amp;lt;parameter-text&amp;gt;{&amp;lt;replacement-text&amp;gt;}&lt;/code&gt;

==Description==
&lt;code&gt;\def&lt;/code&gt; allows you to define new macros.
The command must begin with an escape character ([[category code]]&amp;nbsp;0) and
be composed of a series of letters ([[category code]]&amp;nbsp;11) or one single non-letter, following the escape character.
(For instance &lt;code&gt;\delta&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\{&lt;/code&gt;.)  Alternatively, &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; can be an active
character ([[category code]]&amp;nbsp;13).  Then, the parameter text tells TeX the
valid syntax of the command being defined; furthermore, in the parameter text, one can
include arguments (denoted by &lt;code&gt;#1&lt;/code&gt;, etc., up to &lt;code&gt;#9&lt;/code&gt;) which can be reused
in the replacement text.  For example, in
&lt;pre&gt;
\def \foo [#1]#2{The first argument is ``#1'', the second one is ``#2''}
&lt;/pre&gt;
The first argument ''must'' be delimited by two square brackets while the second may
be a single character (strictly speaking, a single token having a category code distinct
from 1&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;2) or any balanced text surrounded by braces &lt;code&gt;{...}&lt;/code&gt;.
Finally, the replacement text tells TeX what the command is supposed to expand to and how
to deal with the arguments if any (see example above).

Note that there should not be any space ''after'' parameter text. You can use % character if your command definition takes up multiple lines, for example
&lt;pre&gt;
\def \foo [#1]#2%
  {The first argument is ``#1''.

  The second one is ``#2''}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Contrarily to LaTeX (with &lt;code&gt;\newcommand&lt;/code&gt;), TeX doesn't check whether
the command to be defined is important or not.  You might well say &lt;code&gt;\def \def&lt;/code&gt; etc.,
except that the most probable is that you encounter some problems quite quickly.
One way to be safe in this respect is to write
&lt;pre&gt;
\ifx &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; \undefined
  \def &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; . . .
\fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;code&gt;\def&lt;/code&gt; can be preceded by [[TeX/global|\global]] (the redefinition
isn't confined to the current group, also controlled by [[TeX/globaldefs|\globaldefs]]),
[[TeX/long|\long]] (the command admits long arguments),
[[TeX/outer|\outer]] (the command is not tolerated in
parts of the code which are read at high speed).

See also the commands [[TeX/let|\let]], [[TeX/edef|\edef]], [[TeX/xdef|\xdef]].

==Examples==

This defines a simple shortcut:
&lt;pre&gt;
\def \NAS {National Academy of Science}
\def \author {William {\sc Smith}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This defines a quotation environment
&lt;pre&gt;
\def \beginquote {\par \begingroup \narrower}
\def \endquote {\par \endgroup}
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
To use Eclipse as IDE to develop web applications using the framework ZK, often database access is needed too. This HowTo shows the basic steps in creating an environment in which Eclipse runs together with ZK, XAMPP, MySQL, Tomcat and JDBC. Often occurring errors are described. The installation as described runs on Windows 2000 machine.

== Downloads ==
The following software packages should be downloaded:
*'''ZK''': The ZK libraries ([http://www.zkoss.org/download/ Homepage ZK]);
*'''Eclipse &amp; WTP''': The Eclipse IDE combined with the Web Tools Platform (WTP is also separately available as part of the Callisto Project) ([http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/ Homepage Web Tools Platform]);
*'''XAMPP''': An Apache distribution with MySQL, phpMyAdmin ([http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html Homepage XAMPP]);
*'''Tomcat''': The Tomcat server/container ([http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html XAMPP Add-ons]);
*'''JDBC Connector''': A converter of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) calls to MySQL protocols ([http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.0.html MySQL Connector/J 3.1.14, NOT 5.0.4]).

== Installation ==
How to setup Eclipse with ZK is discussed in [[ZK/How-Tos/HowToSetupEclipseWtpForZK|How To Setup Eclipse Wtp For ZK]]. 

=== Locations ===
The Apache distribution is installed in the ${XAMPP} folder. The Tomcat server in the ${XAMPP}/tomcat folder: ${TOMCAT}. The MySQL connector is placed in the ${TOMCAT}/common/lib folder. Eclipse automatically finds all the jars in this folder, so it is not necessary to add it manually as an External Jar to a project. The project in Eclipse runs in the ${APPL} folder (can be outside Tomcat container).

=== Binding together ===
Opposed to [1] the information about the connection to the database will be stored in the files: ${APPL}/META-INF/context.xml and ${APPL}/WEB-INF/web.xml. Eclipse adds option &quot;Update root context for Web module MyProject&quot; that uses this information when Run on Server &lt;tt&gt;[Alt+Shift eXecute, Run]&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== File content ===
In the ${APPL}/WEB-INF/web.xml should be added under the &lt;web-app&gt; key the following reference:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- JDBC --&gt;
  &lt;resource-ref&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      Resource reference to a factory for java.sql.Connection
      instances that may be used for talking to a particular
      database that is configured in the server.xml file.
    &lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;res-ref-name&gt;jdbc/nicedatabasename&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;
    &lt;res-type&gt;javax.sql.DataSource&lt;/res-type&gt;
    &lt;res-auth&gt;Container&lt;/res-auth&gt;
  &lt;/resource-ref&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
And the ${APPL}/META-INF/context.xml should have the following content:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;Context path=&quot;/MyProject&quot; docBase=&quot;MyProject&quot; 
      debug=&quot;5&quot; reloadable=&quot;true&quot; crossContext=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Resource name=&quot;jdbc/nicedatabasename&quot; 
      username=&quot;youknow&quot; password=&quot;secretexceptifcalledsecret&quot;
      url=&quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/actualdatabasename&quot;
      auth=&quot;Container&quot; defaultAutoCommit=&quot;false&quot;
      driverClassName=&quot;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&quot; maxActive=&quot;20&quot;
      timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis=&quot;60000&quot;
      type=&quot;javax.sql.DataSource&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Errors ==
It is possible that error after error pops up. These are often encountered errors. The errors are in a certain order. If an error about an empty JDBC driver pops up, it means that the reference to the resource is correctly found in the web.xml file. If the error about the character set pops up, the JDBC driver is found.

=== Not Bound in Context ===
An error about a wrong name:
&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: Name **** is not bound in this Context&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
This error occurs when &lt;resource-ref&gt; in web.xml is not equal to the resource name in context.xml.

=== Empty JDBC Driver ===
An error about an empty JDBC driver:
&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot create JDBC driver of class '' 
for connect URL 'null'&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
This error has probably to do with the version of the Tomcat server that is used. The 5.5 version uses the syntax like described above. The 5.0 version likes the syntax with the ResourceParams elements:
&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;Resource name=&quot;jdbc/nicedatabasename&quot; auth=&quot;container&quot; type=&quot;javax.sql.DataSource&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;ResourceParams name=&quot;jdbc/nicedatabasename&quot;&gt;
    &lt;parameter&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;driverClassName&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/parameter&gt;

    &lt;parameter&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;url&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/actualdatabasename?autoReconnect=true&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/parameter&gt;
  &lt;/ResourceParams&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
It can be the case that the Tomcat server has to be restarted.

=== Character Set ===
An error about the character set used:
&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;java.sql.SQLException: Unknown initial character set index ’48’ received from server.
Initial client character set can be forced via the ‘characterEncoding’ property.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Probably, the error is in the MySQL Connector/J JDBC software version 5.0.4, downloaded from www.mysql.org. It is not an Eclipse or QuantumDB issue. If you downgrade to MySQL Connector/J JDBC software version 3.1.14, the issue is resolved.

== Windows Hints ==
Start the MySQL server (as a service) - not with [Win+X] &amp; &quot;services.msc&quot; but - with a shortcut that has as target: 
:&lt;tt&gt;%windir%\system32\net.exe start &quot;MySQL Server&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;
&quot;MySQL Server&quot; is the name that the service has in &quot;services.msc&quot;. The attributes &quot;start&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; are recognized. The Tomcat Server can be started from Eclipse itself, and does not need a shortcut.

Information regarding startup of the MySQL server incorporated in XAMPP is stored in ${XAMPP}/mysql/bin/my.cnf. In Windows can a *.cnf not be edited by default. Open a Command Shell box and edit by &quot;edit my.cnf&quot;. The character set can be added or altered beneath the elements [mysqld] (the server), [mysql], [client]. The phpMyAdmin tool can be used to do such things with editboxes for the GUI-minded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''Metal Gear'' series of videogames presents plots rooted in reality, often with fictionalized characters and events. An examination of the series' connections to the real world is given below.

==1960s==
At the point of ''Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater'', set in 1964, many real events and persons from the era such as the early stages of the Vietnam War, President John F. Kennedy's Assassination, American President Lyndon B. Johnson, Russian President Nikita Khrushchev, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. All of these events are mentioned and have significance to the plot, although they are coupled with fiction and conspiracy theories. Another real event was the infiltration of Tselinoyarsk by a United States CIA agent in order to rescue a Soviet rocket scientist who was defecting. At the same time, another US agent defected to the Soviet Union. In the game, these events are fictionalized with these roles filled by Naked Snake and The Boss suggesting that, apart from the in game events, the timeline was almost entirely parallel to reality at this point. 

==1970s==
Set six years after the Virtuous Mission of Snake Eater, ''Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops'' for the PlayStation Portable chronicles Big Boss's departure from the FOX unit and the founding of FOXHOUND. Little additional information has been released about the game's plot, however it has been cofirmed by Hideo Kojima to follow the expected style of the ''Metal Gear'' series. 

==1990s==
In the original two games in the series, ''Metal Gear'' and ''Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake'', set in 1995 and 1999 respectively, the fictional countries of Outer Heaven and Zanzibar Land are key figures in the plot, but no reference is made to world leaders. ''Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake'' however, branches dramatically from reality with a number of fictional political events including Zanzibar Land's dramatic rise to power, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia remaining intact, and a major world oil crisis. The inclusion of these ideas is attributed to the fact that the game was created in 1990. ''Metal Gear Solid'', set in 2005, makes references to real events of the 1980's and 1990's such as the Gulf War, and Chernobyl incident, but no reference to world leaders of that era. This suggests that, up until the early 1990's, the series' history still followed a path generally the same as that of the real world. Though even recent translations ''Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake'' keep the same background, the more historically-disparate elements of the game are generally glossed over in Solid series- ''Metal Gear Solid's'' Previous Operations file, for instance, refers to Russia and the CIS rather than the Soviet Union, and indicates that Zanzibar Land became ''a'' nuclear superpower rather than the ''only'' nuclear superpower.

==2000s==
In the 21st century, the series branches even further from reality. In ''Metal Gear Solid'', set in 2005, a fictional United States Secretary of State is named and later ousted from power as part of the game’s plot. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'', set in the years 2007 and 2009, the differences from reality are further explored. Two fictional US Presidents are named, the first being George Sears (a.k.a. Solidus Snake), who had been President at the time of the events in ''Metal Gear Solid'' and resigned thereafter. His successor, James Johnson, is the second of these imaginary leaders. This implies that, in the ''Metal Gear'' timeline, US elections followed the same course as reality until some point around 2001 to 2004 when fictionalized candidates began winning elections.

==2010s==
The next ''Metal Gear'' game and finale to the ''Metal Gear Solid'' series, ''Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots'', has been reported to take place six years after ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'', in the year 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Polar graph paper.svg|thumb|right|300px|A polar grid with several angles labeled in degrees]]
The '''polar coordinate system''' is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by an angle and a distance. The polar coordinate system is especially useful in situations where the relationship between two points is most easily expressed in terms of angles and distance; in the more familiar Cartesian coordinate system or rectangular coordinate system, such a relationship can only be found through trigonometric formulae.

As the coordinate system is two-dimensional, each point is determined by two polar coordinates: the radial coordinate and the angular coordinate. The radial coordinate (usually denoted as &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) denotes the point's distance from a central point known as the ''pole'' (equivalent to the ''origin'' in the Cartesian system). The angular coordinate (also known as the polar angle or the azimuth angle, and usually denoted by θ or &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) denotes the positive or anticlockwise (counterclockwise) angle required to reach the point from the 0° ray or ''polar axis'' (which is equivalent to the positive x-axis in the Cartesian coordinate plane).

==Plotting points with polar coordinates==
[[Image:CircularCoordinates.png|thumb|250px|The points (3,60°) and (4,210°) on a polar coordinate system]]
Each point in the polar coordinate system can be described with the two polar coordinates, which are usually called &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (the radial coordinate) and θ (the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth angle, sometimes represented as φ or &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;). The &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; coordinate represents the radial distance from the pole, and the θ coordinate represents the anticlockwise (counterclockwise) angle from the 0° ray (sometimes called the polar axis), known as the positive x-axis on the Cartesian coordinate plane.

For example, the polar coordinates (3, 60°) would be plotted as a point 3 units from the pole on the 60° ray. The coordinates (&amp;minus;3, 240°) would also be plotted at this point because a negative radial distance is measured as a positive distance on the opposite ray (the ray reflected about the origin, which differs from the original ray by 180°).

One important aspect of the polar coordinate system, not present in the Cartesian coordinate system, is that a single point can be expressed with an infinite number of different coordinates. This is because any number of multiple revolutions can be made around the central pole without affecting the actual location of the point plotted. In general, the point (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;θ) can be represented as (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;θ&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;×360°) or (−&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;θ&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;(2&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)180°), where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is any integer.

The arbitrary coordinates (0,&amp;nbsp;θ) are conventionally used to represent the pole, as regardless of the θ coordinate, a point with radius 0 will always be on the pole. To get a unique representation of a point, it is usual to limit &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to negative and non-negative numbers &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and θ to the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;360°) or (−180°,&amp;nbsp;180°] (or, in radian measure, [0,&amp;nbsp;2π) or (−π,&amp;nbsp;π]).

Angles in polar notation are generally expressed in either degrees or radians, using the conversion 2π rad = 360°. The choice depends largely on the context. Navigation applications use degree measure, while some physics applications (specifically rotational mechanics) and almost all mathematical literature on calculus use radian measure.

===Converting between polar and Cartesian coordinates===
[[Image:Polar to cartesian.svg|right|thumb|250px|A diagram illustrating the conversion formulae]]
The two polar coordinates &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and θ can be converted to the Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; by using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine:
:&lt;math&gt;x = r \cos \theta \,&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;y = r \sin \theta, \,&lt;/math&gt;

while the two Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; can be converted to polar coordinate &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \,&lt;/math&gt; (by a simple application of the Pythagorean theorem).

To determine the angular coordinate θ, the following two ideas must be considered:
* For &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; = 0, θ can be set to any real value.
* For &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; ≠ 0, to get a unique representation for θ, it must be limited to an interval of size 2π. Conventional choices for such an interval are [0, 2π) and (&amp;minus;π, π].

To obtain θ in the interval [0, 2π), the following may be used (&lt;math&gt;\arctan&lt;/math&gt; denotes the inverse of the tangent function):
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = 
\begin{cases}
\arctan(\frac{y}{x})        &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0 \mbox{ and } y \ge 0\\
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) + 2\pi &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0 \mbox{ and } y &lt; 0\\
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) + \pi  &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0\\
\frac{\pi}{2}               &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y &gt; 0\\
\frac{3\pi}{2}              &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y &lt; 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

To obtain θ in the interval (&amp;minus;π, π], the following may be used:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = 
\begin{cases}
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0\\
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) + \pi &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \mbox{ and } y \ge 0\\
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) - \pi &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \mbox{ and } y &lt; 0\\
\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y &gt; 0\\
-\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y &lt; 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

One may avoid having to keep track of the numerator and denominator signs by use of the atan2 function, which has separate arguments for the numerator and the denominator.

==Polar equations==
The equation defining an algebraic curve expressed in polar coordinates is known as a ''polar equation''. In many cases, such an equation can simply be specified by defining &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as a function of θ. The resulting curve then consists of points of the form (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;(θ),&amp;nbsp;θ) and can be regarded as the graph of the polar function &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

Different forms of symmetry can be deduced from the equation of a polar function &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;(−θ)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;(θ) the curve will be symmetrical about the horizontal (0°/180°) ray, if &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;(π−θ)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;(θ) it will be symmetric about the vertical (90°/270°) ray, and if &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;(θ−α°)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;(θ) it will be rotationally symmetric α° counterclockwise about the pole.

Because of the circular nature of the polar coordinate system, many curves can be described by a rather simple polar equation, whereas their Cartesian form is much more intricate. Among the best known of these curves are the polar rose, Archimedean spiral, lemniscate, limaçon, and cardioid.

For the circle, line, and polar rose below, it is understood that there are no restrictions on the domain and range of the curve.

===Circle===
[[Image:circle_r=1.PNG|thumb|right|A circle with equation &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;(θ)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1]]
The general equation for a circle with a center at (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;φ) and radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;r^2 - 2 r r_0 \cos(\theta - \varphi) + r_0^2 = a^2.\, &lt;/math&gt;

This can be simplified in various ways, to conform to more specific cases, such as the equation

:&lt;math&gt;r(\theta)=a \,&lt;/math&gt;

for a circle with a center at the pole and radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

===Line===
''Radial'' lines (those running through the pole) are represented by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \varphi \,&lt;/math&gt;, 
where φ is the angle of elevation of the line; that is, φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;arctan&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the slope of the line in the Cartesian coordinate system. The non-radial line that crosses the radial line θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ perpendicularly at the point (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, φ) has the equation  
:&lt;math&gt;r(\theta) = {r_0}\sec(\theta-\varphi). \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Polar rose===
[[Image:rose_r=2sin(4theta).PNG|thumb|right|A polar rose with equation &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;(θ)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;4θ]]
A polar rose is a famous mathematical curve that looks like a petaled flower, and that can be expressed as a simple polar equation,

:&lt;math&gt;r(\theta) = a \cos (k\theta + \phi_0)\,&lt;/math&gt; 

for any constant &lt;math&gt;\phi_0&lt;/math&gt; (including 0). If ''k'' is an integer, these equations will produce a ''k''-petaled rose if ''k'' is odd, or a 2''k''-petaled rose if ''k'' is even. If ''k'' is rational but not an integer, a rose-like shape may form but with overlapping petals. Note that these equations never define a rose with 2, 6, 10, 14, etc. petals. The variable ''a'' represents the length of the petals of the rose.
{{-}}

===Archimedean spiral===
[[Image:Archimedian_spiral.PNG|thumb|right|One arm of an Archimedean spiral with equation ''r''(θ)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;θ for 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;θ&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;6π]]
The Archimedean spiral is a famous spiral that was discovered by Archimedes, which also can be expressed as a simple polar equation. It is represented by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;r(\theta) = a+b\theta. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Changing the parameter ''a'' will turn the spiral, while '''''b''''' controls the distance between the arms, which for a given spiral is always constant. The Archimedean spiral has two arms, one for θ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and one for θ&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0. The two arms are smoothly connected at the pole. Taking the mirror image of one arm across the 90°/270° line will yield the other arm. This curve is notable as one of the first curves, after the [[Conic Sections]], to be described in a mathematical treatise, and as being a prime example of a curve that is best defined by a polar equation.
{{-}}

===Conic sections===
[[Image:Elps-slr.svg|thumb|right|250px|Ellipse, showing semi-latus rectum]]
A conic section with one focus on the pole and the other somewhere on the 0° ray (so that the conic's semi-major axis lies along the polar axis) is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;r  = { \ell\over {1 + e \cos \theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the eccentricity and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the semi-latus rectum (the perpendicular distance at a focus from the major axis to the curve). If ''e''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1, this equation defines a hyperbola; if ''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, it defines a parabola; and if ''e'' &amp;lt; 1, it defines an ellipse. The special case  ''e'' = 0 of the latter results in a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Don't mean to be rude, but I started editing this article because there were several misuses of there/their/they're. Soon I found some bizarre sentence constructions followed by an unfortunate volume of... content errors. I found this article while looking for some common equations used in high school physics.

If people want to make contributions, please do some research. Research isn't plagerism, copying the way people explain things or example problems is plagerism, but if you don't know what you are talking about, or really don't feel like doing the work to find the right answers, please don't post. In this case &quot;someone else will do it&quot; might be the right way to think about it.

It makes sense why so many teachers are becoming frustrated with wikipedia and are more frequently discouraging students from using it for reference.

I think the content of this page would be better viewed by nobody. It is a mix of weak information out of context without reference or explanation... and that only applies to the good parts.

Darren Baird (physics teacher), Toronto ON writes...
I agree, this article is an awkward attempt at being &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;engaging&quot;. The first paragraph vaguely recalls Venus Flytrap in WKRP in cinninati teaching about the structure of the atom.

The article is rife with errors... 
* Kids, it is joules not jeules (the SI unit of energy)
* Wave energy is a type of mechanical energy.
* The equation for potential energy varies on how it is stored... for example spring potential energy is PEspring=0.5kx^2, where k is the spring constant that depends on the stiffness of the spring and x is how far the spring is stretched. Gravitational potential energy is simplified as PEgrav=mgh where m is mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the height of the object above a reference height. IF PE=0.5mv^2, then would not this formula require a velocity... if the object has a velocity then you would say that it is moving and therefore it has &quot;actual&quot; rather than potential energy?

I still stand by Wiki... It is 90% of the time a good start point to get an overview. These bad articles give our students a chance to practice discriminating between good and bad information.

Thanks Mr. Baird.</text>

Enquiry Skills is the analysis of sources and presenting thesis on its relevance and usefulness. Many authors may not know what CABPLACE is, but once explained, I'm sure there will be many who will be able to contribute. This book is aimed toward those of age 12 and above, so edits can have a certain amount of complicated language, but not overdosing on &quot;technobabble&quot; is advised.

      <text xml:space="preserve">History isn’t all about facts, figures and dates.

History covers a lot more than you imagine. If you’re good at history, you’re good at thinking, and analysing and weighing the odds. This sort of thinking is enquiry skills.

Over the course of this book, you will look at different sources, and see the different techniques you can use to value them. At the end, you will be able to look at a text from 150 years ago, or a painting of a historical event painted at the time, and you will be able to look between the lines and deeper into the artwork and be able to find out more about history from history itself. History isn’t about having facts told to you, it’s about finding the facts yourself.

History is now prepared to unveil its true nature before you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is a source?

A source is anything. Absolutely anything that relates to the time period you’re studying. A letter addressed to Gavrillo Princip is a source. A school textbook is a source.

Wait. A school textbook? How? Now, I can’t answer that question in a single sentence, so now, you will learn about '''Primary''' and '''Secondary''' sources.

==Primary Sources==

A Primary source is a source that comes from the time period you’re studying. It can be anything, from a letter, to a gramophone to a painting. The Bayeux Tapestry, depicting the Battle of Hastings is a source. We’ll look at that later.

==Secondary Sources==

A Secondary source is a source that doesn’t come from the time period you’re studying. It can also be anything, but more often, it’s the written word. A school textbook is an example. Secondary sources can be a summary of primary sources as well as a summary of other secondary sources.

These terms: polar equation, polar graph, ... are they standard? I have always heard the more
verbose 'equation in polar coordinates', etc. So I'm curious. -[[User:128.135.100.161|128.135.100.161]] 22:43, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

CABPLACE is a mnemonic (i.e. memorization device)that will form the center of this book. It stands for:

*Consistency
*Accuracy
*Bias
*Purpose
*Language
*Author
*Contemporary
*Exaggeration

Each of these can be used to examine [[Enquiry Skills/Sources|sources]] and give us an idea of what the time we're studying was like.

There are two types of question that you can be asked in enquiry skills:

*How useful is the source?-What can it tell us about the time period concerned?
*How reliable is the source?-Can we use it to examine the time period in question accurately?

==Consistency==

If something is consistent with other sources, it is reliable because the information it gives matches information found elsewhere.

Source A is a newspaper article from 1914, speaking about the German attempt to capture France through neutral Belgium. This is consistent with other sources, for instance, a school textbook on WWI, therefore Source A is reliable.

==Accuracy==

Very much like Consistency. If something is accurate, it can be relied on.

==Bias==

If something is bias, it does not give impartial information, and therefore is not reliable, BUT, it can be useful.

If a peasant from the French Revolution wrote an account of how disgusting they found King Louis, it would be bias, because he or she lives in poverty, and so is blaming her harsh life on the king. The account is bias, so it is not reliable, but it is useful, because it can tell us what some people thought at the time.

==Purpose==

What was it meant to be?

A diary account is reliable, because it's purpose was to express opinion. A letter to a friend is reliable because it's purpose is to express opinion or state fact. (However, this may be bias. See above.) A political speech to a population may not be reliable, because it's purpose was to change people's opinions.

==Language==

Words can tell us a lot about history. Adjectives are useful to historians because they describe the time. Nouns can give us an idea of what things were called and what was invented at the time.

In a letter to a politician, a member of the public may use words that express anger, telling us what some or many people thought at the time.

==Author==

The people who paint or write things can be very influential in history.

If an article in a newspaper is written by an infamous journalist, we know it is not reliable because it is bias.

==Contemporary==

Is it a primary or secondary source?

This usually comes last. If something is a primary source, it is one of two things.
:*Reliable, because it was made at the time.
:*Not reliable, because it was subject to bias.

If something is secondary, it is usually reliable because the author has compiled it from many different sources to form an unbiased opinion.

==Exaggeration==

The last letter in CABPLACE refers to things that exaggerate the truth.

The usual suspect is a cartoon. Cartoons are exaggerated in nature, and so are usually not as reliable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Data Mining is a process that uses rules of association with the collection of vast amounts of data. It incorporates statistics, data collection and recognition of patterns and trends. The most common type of data mining today is the use of programs within programs that record computer habits, websites visited and much more information about both the user and computer. The analysis of the data provides profiles that are used by all kinds of organizations. Frequently the programs to do the data mining are included in purchased software and downloaded software. However it is also frequently installed on a computer through the use of a virus or worm or other such malicious tool.

There is no inherent danger to data mining. It is the use of the information that is most troubling. When such techniques can include information like credit card numbers and bank accounts there is an obvious troubling potential for the use of the data. What is meant by no inherent danger is the software data mining collection does not damage a computer, it just records what the computer is doing.

One of the major reasons for collecting such vast amounts of information is for resale. Different on-line merchants would like to know where and when each online shopper is spending their money. Then they can use that information to direct their marketing and timing to a more dedicated market.

The data that is mined, or collected, can come from a vast array of sources. As stated above, the most common form of data mining is the infection of a computer. It can also be extracted from POS (Point Of Sale) transactions, all kinds of data bases, online resources, articles, etc. Although this is an easy way to gather information there is also off-line sources and databases that can be included through the old-style manual data entry.

==Fusion/cleaning==
With all the information they receive the company must filter through the information to find what their consumers need. Companies wish to have only one type of information it can take time to decipher all the information and see, for example, who buys Huggies brand diapers. All this information is to be fused together and cleaned. Many of these data sources have something wrong with them, such as inconsistencies or is a poor quality. This must be cleaned and checked for the consistency of formats.

==Data==
Meta-Data is data about data; it describes how and when and by whom a particular set of data was collected and how it’s formatted. Meta-Data is essential for understanding information stored in data warehouse

==Warehouse==
Data warehouse is a special database of cleaned up data and Meta-data. Both the data and the Meta-Data are sent to the data warehouse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Database Management System is a system on your computer which allows you to access information stored in the database.  They exist in different sizes and are smaller on personal computers and go on to have large systems on mainframes.  The programs in the database give you the option to accumulate, modify, and retrieve information.  You can request information from the DBMS as well.  Examples include: ATM’s, computerized inventory systems, computerized reservation systems, and business management information.

==DBMS - Benefits==
One of the most valuable benefits of DMBS databases is that it helps organizations organize, collect and manipulate information (http://audilab.bmed.mcgill.ca/~funnell/Bacon/DBMS/dbms.html).  It provides structured fields, titles and tables to assist people in entering data.  These databases provide structure to many organizations, fields of business and to all kinds of occupations.  These databases are especially imperative in the Medical, Accounting and Human Resources fields where data input and storage is an essential part of the occupation.  These databases need to be organized and easy to use in order to effectively manage. Another benefit to DMBS systems is that people within an organization can share data through this system.  It is what computer experts called Centralized data (http://audilab.bmed.mcgill.ca/~funnell/Bacon/DBMS/dbms.html).  Another advantage of DBMS is that information is current.  If one person enters data into the system when it is saved everyone can see when the information was entered that way everyone is up to date with current events which vastly improve the communication process in organizations.  The data entered into the system is kept consistent, the structure of the database allows for everyone to enter data in a manner that is the same therefore minimizing mistakes or incomplete information (http://audilab.bmed.mcgill.ca/~funnell/Bacon/DBMS/dbms.html).   These central databases have improved the speed, consistency and way we deal with information which has decreased paperwork in our daily working lives.

==DBMS - Disadvantages ==
On most of occasions, all data is integrated into a single database. If database is damaged due to electric failure or database is corrupted on the storage media, then the valuable data may be lost forever. Another disadvantage is the complexity of this database system. It is costly, and it creates more requirements. 

[[File:Data-transfer.svg|thumb|Data-transfer]]

==DBMS - Principal Components==
There are three principal components integrated into the database management system software.  These will be covered in more detail in this section.  The components are:

#a database dictionary,
#DBMS utilities, and
#a report generator.

First, the database dictionary does not contain actual data.  It does, however, contain information to manage the data in the database, thereby enabling a database management system (DBMS) to function or access data from the database.  A data dictionary may also be referred to as a “repository.”  It is a file or document that is generally not made available to users, but contains a list of files in the database, the number of records in the files and names, as well as types of fields – “… data definitions and descriptions of the structure of the date used in the database”  (Williams, B.K. &amp; S.C. Sawyer,  2007,  Using Information Technology: A Practical Introduction to Computers &amp; Communications,  7th ed.,  Montreal: McGraw-Hill Irwin, p. 415; and  http://webopedia/com/TERM/data_dictionary.html  Retrieved Nov 23, 2006).  

A database dictionary or repository stores descriptions of:

#data elements defined in all tables,
#tables defined in all databases,
#indexes defined for each table,
#defined databases,
#programs that access the database,
#access authorizations for all users, and
#relationships among data elements  (http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ir0xLKnVB0PkJ:nsu-cc.northern.edu/MIS/MIS484/notes/CH15.ppt+DBMS+utilities&amp;hl+en&amp;gl+ca&amp;ct+clnk&amp;cd+12&amp;client+firefox-a  Retrieved Nov 23, 2006).

There are different types of data dictionaries.  Included with the DBMS is the “integrated data dictionary.”  A “stand-alone data dictionary” maybe available from a vendor.  An “active data dictionary” has the potential to be updated by the DBMS automatically whereas the “passive data dictionary… requires a batch process to create and update the dictionary”  (http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ir0xLKnVB0PkJ:nsu-cc.northern.edu/MIS/MIS484/notes/CH15.ppt+DBMS+utilities&amp;hl+en&amp;gl+ca&amp;ct+clnk&amp;cd+12&amp;client+firefox-a  Retrieved Nov 23, 2006).

The second component, DBMS utilities, is essentially for maintaining the database.  These are programs that enable the user to undertake this maintenance by creating, editing and deleting the data, records and files.  This component also includes automatic backup and recovery procedures  (http://web.archive.org/web/20100619033849/http://www.cse.sc.edu/~holderfi/files/chap8.pdf  Retrieved Nov 23, 2006).  The database user can monitor the types of data being input and sort it by key fields because of DBMS utilities  (Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 416).

The third component of a database management system (DBMS) makes the whole thing worthwhile.  This program, the report generator, as the name implies, allows the user of any skill level to generate reports.   It can produce on-screen or printed reports or documents from the database, or portion thereof, as specified by the user.  For example, the user may specify the format as per row, column or page headers  (Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 416 and http://web.archive.org/web/20100619033849/http://www.cse.sc.edu/~holderfi/files/chap8.pdf  Retrieved Nov 23, 2006).  

==DBMS - Database Administrator==

Database Administrator:

It is a person who analyzes, administers, coordinates, controls and manages activities within the data administration department. Also, this person handles organization’s “database” administration and data relationship. 

Database Administrator can perform a variety of activities as follow: 
*Establish and enforce policies about user privacy. Database access and security
*Implement and manage configuration management approach for all database
*Implement and manage database change management processes
*Implement and manage a backup / restore strategy
*Provide proactive performance monitoring of databases. 
*Monitor databases and server system configuration for performance optimization 
*Install software and upgrades 
*Develop a strategy to manage large data volume growth and address impacts on auditing, backups and restores
*Develop a working knowledge of applications deployed on the database 
*Maintain knowledge and proficiency of current and upcoming hardware/software technologies

      <text xml:space="preserve">
'''Projects''' involve the planning, designing and implementation of an information system for a specific purpose. An '''information system''' is a system that has been set up to store and carry out tasks using information. Most information systems in today's modern society utilize computers, but this has not always been the case, and some information systems, such as address books and filing cabinets, are still operated manually.

Projects can be done for any of the systems listed below

*Database information systems
*Communication systems
*transaction processing systems
*Decision support systems
*Automated manufacturing systems
*multimedia systems

The skills learnt in this topic can be applied to any of the listed topics, as developing any of those systems will require good planning, so the project work topic is foundational to your studies of the HSC component of IPT.

==Project Management==

'''Project management''' is the process of planning, scheduling and controlling all the activities within each stage of the system development cycle. It aims to deliver a new system within an acceptable time frame and budget using any required knowledge, skills, tools or techniques necessary for the particular project.

A '''project''' can be any undertaking that sets out a specific objective

The advantages of using project management include:
*cost control
*development within specified times
*organised use of the available hardware and software
*an improved end product

Project management is best described as a set of five processes that guide the developer of a project. These five processes are known as the '''system development cycle''':
*Understanding the problem
*Planning decisions
*Designing solutions
*Implementing Solutions
*Testing, Evaluating and Maintaining 

===Developing a Project Plan===

A project plan is a summary of a project that specifies who, what, how and when. It clarifies what needs to be done and helps people to understand how they fit into the project. A project plan breaks the project into major tasks called subprojects.

The start of a project plan is the '''problem definition'''. All the subsequent steps come from the problem definition.

A project plan:
*Is a summary of a project, specifying who, what, how and when.
*Clarifies what needs to be done, helps people understand how they fit into the project.
*Provides overall schedule, details of subprojects and a schedule for each subproject.
*Identifies people, information technology and data/information required by the system.
*Helps to deliver a system on time and minimise the effect of unanticipated problems.

A very important tool used in project planning is a Gantt chart, which shows how long each stage of a project or subproject will take 

&lt;!-- need image of gantt chart --&gt;

Project Plans involve goals, deliverables and schedules. People working on projects need to understand the need for these things to minimize problems later on

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot;
|Goals
|Result of the project if it is successful. Goals may be broad or specific.

|-

|Deliverables
|A tangible item expected from a task. Diagram, report, data dictionary, program or training manual.

|-

|Schedules
|The timing of major tasks and who will do the work.

|}

===Participants in the Project Plan===





===Communication Skills===

Participants in a project must always be kept informed. Communication skills incorporate a variety of strategies and techniques for dealing with other people. Good communication facilitates the sharing of information and genuine understanding. All team members must contribute to the team cohesiveness by actively using communication strategies such as:

{|borer=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding = &quot;5&quot; align = &quot;centre&quot;
|Active listening
|Involves restating, reflecting and summarising the speakers major
points.

|-

|Conflict resolution
|Solves arguments and disputes.

|-

|Negotiation skills
|Involves discussing a problem and arriving at an agreement.

|-

|Interview Techniques
|A list of questions prepared with a clear purpose.

|-

|Team building
|Is the process of getting a group of people working together.

|}

==Social and Ethical Design==

All projects have social and ethical implications. A persons '''ethics''' are their values, a set of beliefs about what is right or wrong. A project should be considered unethical if it:

*harmed others in some way
*was against society's standards of what is right
*violated the rights, freedom or justice due to others
*broke the law

Some ethical issues that should be thought of while going through project design are:

*crime and security, including data protection, piracy, hacking, and virus issues
*privacy of the individual
*intellectual property rights and copyright
*computing etiquette or rules that respect the rights of others
*the health and safety of all participants
*equity or the equal access of all participants to the benefits of an information system

===Design of System===

Information systems should be designed to take into account the strengths and weaknesses of
both people and machine.

{|border=&quot;1&quot; align = &quot;centre&quot; cellpadding = &quot;5&quot;
|Machine-centred
systems
|Are designed to simplify what the computer must do at the expense of
participants. They assume people will follow confusing procedures and
illogical user manuals.

|-

|Human-centred
systems
|Are those that make participants work as effective and satisfying as
possible. The allow people to do their work without wasting time and
effort struggling with the information technology.

|-

|User-friendly
|Describes a tool that people find easy to use. User-friendly information
systems are more productive as participants do not waste time and effort
dealing with the system.

|}



===The Environment===

The '''environment''' is any aspect which is not directly part of the system but which affects it in some way. The information system has a '''boundary''' that sets the limits of the system environment. Within the limits are both human and physical resources.

Ergonomic design that considers the users by arranging the work environment to minimise the problems that can result from the use of hardware and software is desirable. Ergonomic design may include adjustable furniture, correct lighting, controlled noise and software that helps the user to carry out the tasks involved

==Understanding the Problem==

Understanding the problem is the first stage in the system development cycle. The exact
nature of the problem must be determined and whether it can be solved by an information
system. This may involve redefining the problem and identifying its important elements. A
clear problem statement is essential at this stage.
*What are the problems with the existing system?
*How does the existing system work?
*How do you identify the problems with the existing system?

===Prototypes===

A prototype is a working model of an information system. Prototypes are built in order to
understand the requirements of the system. The also can help in defining the problem to be
solved and in determining how an information system might solve the problem.
Advantages of using prototypes
*Clarifies how the existing system will work.
*The requirements of the system more accurately reflect the needs of the participants.
*Participants have the opportunity to be involved earlier and more directly in the
development of the new system.
*The new system is easier to create from a prototype.
After all the information has been gathered, a requirements report is produced. This is a
statement about the purpose/ requirements of the new information system. It includes aims
and objectives of the new system and how it will help the organisation.

==Making Decisions==

*This stage involves making decisions using the data gathered. The first task is to develop
one or more potential solutions to the problem.
*A constraint is a factor that affects the system and prevents it from achieving the desired
objectives. There are different types of constraints.

===Feasibility Studies===

A feasibility study is a short report that analyses potential solutions in terms of the known
constraints and makes a recommendation. It does not attempt to find a detailed solution. The
feasibility study briefly examines the available options, estimates costs and identifies any
constraints to be considered. It judges whether a potential solution can actually be
implemented.

A feasibility study can make three recommendations: No Change, Develop a new system or
investigate other solutions.




====Can the Problem be Solved?====

====Is the Problem Worth Solving?====

Deciding whether the problem can be solved.
*Will the existing system be able to perform the required tasks in the foreseeablefuture?
*Will the proposed system meet future needs?
*Have existing similar solutions been examined?
*How crucial is the new system to the total organisation?

====Is it economically feasible?====

The systems analyst must determine whether the solution to the problem is affordable.
*Development hardware/ software costs?
*Development personnel costs?
*Outsourcing costs?
*The available capital
*Costs savings as a result of the products implementation
*Future upgrade costs

====Is it operationally feasible?====

Analyse whether a solution will be usable by the target customers.
*What expertise was required to complete this project?
*What resources are required to develop this project?
*Are we able to support this product in the future?
*Can we retrain/ redistribute existing resources to this project?

====Is it technically feasible?====

Determine what hardware and software is currently being used.
*Is the technology readily available for this solution?
*Can the product operate on a variety of platforms and hardware components?
*Will the solution continue to operate on any new and developing technologies?

====Scheduling  Can it be completed in the required time?====

The schedule feasibility takes into account the time frame in which a solution must be
developed. The solution being developed must be achievable within an appropriate time
frame. (Use of Gantt Charts).
*When is the best time to implement the product?
*Are personnel available at the require times?
*How long will each stage of the development take?
*Are required resources available when needed?
*What if key personnel leave during development?

====Are there other alternative solutions?====

After determining the feasibility of a solution, a decision must be made as to whether the
solution is to be implemented.
*Smaller scale solution to the project
*Discontinue the project

====What are the social and ethical issues?====

Ensuring that the software being developed is not socially biased as this may impact the
feasibility of the solution.
*Changing nature of work for users
*Affects on level of employment
*Affects on the public
*Legal issues

===The Project Plan===
This is a summary of who, what, when, and how
It involves helping participants understand their role in the project. Identifies sub-projects and gives a time frame for them.
Identifies the need for the users and participants and their feedback.
Identifies the people, information technology, and data/information required by the system.
There are three important parts to a project plan:
1. project goal- desired outcome
2. deliverable- the tangible item expected from the task
3. schedule- gantt chart

NOTE: the project leader is responsible for developing the project plan and ensuring it is implemented correctly!

==Designing Solutions==

Designing a solution is the transformation of the specifications into appropriate hardware,
software and information processes. It involves purchasing hardware, writing or purchasing
software, and specifying information processes to make the system operational.

===Refining and Modifying a Prototype===

===Participant Development===

Participant development occurs when people within the information system develop the
solution. Participants produce their own information system using readily available
information technology. Information system personnel do not develop the system.
Stages in the system development cycle are affected by participant development.

{|border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot;
|Understanding the Problem
|Participants identify the problem. Information system personnel might be
used to advise the participant on possible tools to solve the problem.

|-

|Making
Decisions
|Participants chose an appropriate solution.

|-

|Designing
Solutions
|Participants develop the solution, often using guided processes found in
application packages. The participant may require some training to design
a solution.

|-

|Implementation
|Participants begin using the system. This stage is often easier to
accomplish with participant development than with a system developed by
information system personnel as the participant is familiar with the
application and does not require further training.

|-

|Testing,
Evaluating and
Maintaining
|Participants are totally responsible for the maintenance and testing of the
solution and determining if any changes need to be made to the solution.

|}



===Design Tools===

Design tools assist in the development of a new system.

====Context Diagrams====

Context Diagrams are used to represent entire information systems. The system is shown as a
single process along with the inputs and outputs (external entities) to the system. The external
entities are connected to the single process by data flow arrows. Processes are represented by circles, entities by boxes and data flow by arrows.

====Data Flow Diagrams====

A data flow diagram is an expansion of a context diagram. DFDs represent the information
system as a number of processes that together form the single process in a Context Diagram.
The focus is on the flow of data between information processes in the system. DFDs show
where data is collected, organised, analysed, stored, processed, transmitted and displayed.
They provide a simple technique for visualising the movement of data and describing what
participants do, rather than what the computers do.
Data Flow Diagrams share the same symbols as Context Diagrams but have an extra one, an open ended box for data storage.

====Decision Trees====

Decision trees are a diagrammatic way of representing all possible combinations of decisions
and their resulting actions. It represents the decisions made within a system as the branches of
a tree. For every condition, there is an action/ outcome.

====Decision Tables====

Decision tables represent all possible conditions and the actions that will result. It indicates
the alternatives for different conditions and actions based on the rules.

====Data Dictionaries====

A data dictionary is a description of the fields and data stored within the system. From the
dictionary it is possible to determine the name used to reference the data, the type of data
stored, the length of the field, the application program and an example of data being stored in
the system. Data Dictionaries can also be used to calculate the storage required for each
record. This forms part of the documentation for the system.

====System Flowcharts====

System flowcharts are a diagrammatic way of representing both the flow of data and logic
through an information system. It documents the essential details of the system, such as
sequence, processes, and rules for selecting particular actions.
A system flowchart shows the hardware used to process data such as peripheral devices,
storage mediums and processing units.

'''Note these have been removed from the 2010 Onwards Syllabus for HSC'''

===The use of Design Tools===

==Implementing the Project Plan==

The implementation stage delivers the new information system to users and participants.
Participants will be provided with at least some of the following new components of the
system: Hardware, Software, Data or Processes

===Training Participants===

Training ensures participants can use the new system and understand its benefits. Training is
also needed in the installation of a new system and to ensure that the computer is being used
efficiently. The type of training depends on the existing knowledge of the participants and the
features of the new system.
Technical support staff are people who assist participants of a system on an as-needed basis.

===Determining the Conversion Method===

Conversion of a system only takes place when a system already exists. It must be carefully
planned and executed to avoid errors. There are four methods that can be used to upgrade or
replace an existing system.
'''Direct Conversion'''
The old system is shut down or removed and the new system immediately replaces the old
one.

'''Parallel Conversion'''
During the change-over phase, both systems are running together. This method is often used
when converting from a non-computing system to a computerised system.

'''Phased Conversion'''
Parts of the old system are replaced by the new system until the whole system has been
converted.

'''Pilot Conversion'''
This involves trialing the new system in a part of an organisation. The pilot site is selected
and a conversion method is used to convert to the new system. Once the pilot test is ok, the
rest of the system is changed.

Advantages and Disadvantages of conversion methods:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot;

|-

|Direct
|
*Fast

system

|-

|Pilot
|
*Any difficulties are confined to
separate location
*Participants can be trained in
the new system at the pilot site
|
*Pilot site running a different
system from rest of system

|}

===Deciding Testing Methods===

Testing a system is a very important part of the implementation of a system. Without rigorous
testing, the system cannot be guaranteed to work as expected.

===Taking Steps to Convert the New System===



==Testing, Evaluating and Maintaining==

Testing a solution ensures that it works. Testing is carried out throughout the system
development cycle. Evaluation determines whether the system is working as expected or
whether changes are required. It occurs after the new system is established and minor
problems have been fixed. The system must also be tested, to make sure that the original
objectives and aims have been achieved.

Test data must be sufficient to ensure the program is completely operational and free of logic
errors. Test data must be constructed to test every part of a program, including the mainline
of the program and any modules used by the program. Test data should test:
*All parts of the program
*Each path of execution
*Boundary conditions  the values of variables or expressions that determine the
choice of available options to be taken.

===Live Test Data===
Live data is real data, used to ensure that a program works under real-life conditions. Stress
testing involves increasing the load on a program in an attempt to make it fail.

===Larger File Sizes===
A program developed to access files should be tested with a range of file types and sizes. The
use of large files will highlight problems associated with data access.

===Mix of Transaction Types===
A variety of different transaction types and sequences of data entry should be tested with live
data. Module and program testing usually involve testing specific transactions or processes
one at a time. During system testing, transactions occur in random order and checked to see if
any errors arise.

===Response Times===
Live data is used to ensure that the system response times are appropriate. Response times are
dependent on all the system components, together with their interactions with each other and
other processes that may be occurring concurrently. Response times should be tested on
minimum hardware using typical data of different types.

===Volume data===
It is important to test a system using expected loads. It is also necessary to test the system
under heavy loads. Multi-user products should be tested with large numbers of users entering
and processing data simultaneously to see if the program can handle the load.

===Interfaces between Modules===
Interface tests will ensure that the correct numbers of parameters are sent to and from the
module and that the format is correct. Interface tests will also detect conflicts between local
and global variables.
Comparison with Program Test Data
Software developers generate test data to test the limits of the system that may not be tested
under normal use.

===Benchmarking===
A benchmark is a standard against which performance of a computer program can be
assessed. Established programs are often used as a benchmark to indicate the quality and
performance expectations of a new product. Benchmarks allow users of software products to
make informed purchasing decisions.

===Quality Assurance===
Quality Assurance is a set of procedures used to certify that a generated product meets
specified criteria with respect to quality and reliability.
*Correctness
*Reliability
*Efficiency
*Integrity
*Maintainability

*Does it do what it is supposed to do?
*Does it do it all of the time?
*Does it do it the best way possible?
*Is it secure?
*Can it be understood?

Quality Assurance is not just about testing a product once it has been completed. Quality
Assurance techniques should be implemented throughout the software development process.

===Alpha Testing===
Testing of the final solution by personnel within the software development company prior to
the products release.
The client uses the system in a controlled environment and checks to see if it meets their
requirements.

===Beta Testing===
Testing of the final solution by a limited number of users outside the software development
company using real world data and conditions.
The program is given to a number of potential clients who will also report to the developers
any problems they encounter in the program.

===Evaluation===
*Usability 
*Speed
*Security 
*Accuracy
*Efficiency 
*Rate of Usage

===Maintenance===
Maintenance is the modification of the system by making minor improvements. It involves
documentation and logs.

===Operation Manual===
An operation manual details procedures participants follow when using a new system.
Participants need to be instructed about and assisted with the major features and functions of
the system. An operation manual includes:
*User-friendly format and structure
*Clear and concise instructions
*Steps listed in point form
*Tasks completed in the simplest way
*Appropriate instructions for file management and security
*Screen dumps included where possible.

== Optimization ==

'''Optimization''' is an important concept in engineering. Finding any solution to a problem is not nearly as good as finding the one &quot;optimal solution&quot; to the problem. Optimization problems are typically reformatted so they become '''minimization problems''', which are well-studied problems in the field of mathematics. 

Typically, when optimizing a system, the costs and benefits of that system are arranged into a '''cost function'''. It is the engineers job then to minimize this cost function (and thereby minimize the cost of the system). It is worth noting at this point that the word &quot;cost&quot; can have multiple meanings, depending on the particular problem. For instance, cost can refer to the actual monetary cost of a system (number of computer units to host a website, amount of cable needed to connect Philadelphia and New York), the delay of the system (loading time for a website, transmission delay for a communication network), the reliability of the system (number of dropped calls in a cellphone network, average lifetime of a car transmission), or any other types of factors that reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of the system.

Because optimization typically becomes a mathematical minimization problem, we are going to discuss minimization here.

=== Minimization ===

Minimization is the act of finding the numerically lowest point in a given function, or in a particular range of a given function. Students of mathematics and calculus may remember using the derivative of a function to find the maxima and minima of a function. If we have a function ''f''(''x''), we can find the maxima, minima, or saddle-points (points where the function has zero slope, but is not a maxima or minima) by solving for ''x'' in the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{df(x)}{dx} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, we are looking for the roots of the derivative of the function ''f'' plus those points where ''f'' has a corner. Once we have the so called critical points of the function (if any), we can test them to see if they are relatively high (maxima), or relatively low (minima). Some words to remember in this context are:

;Global Minima: A global minimum of a function is the lowest value of that function anywhere.  If the domain of the function is restricted, say ''A'' &lt; ''x'' &lt; ''B'', then the minima can also occur at the boundary, here ''A'' or ''B''.

;Local Minima: A local minimum of a function is the lowest value of that function within a small range.  A value can thus be a local minimum even though there are smaller function values, but not in a small neighborhood.

== Unconstrained Minimization ==

'''Unconstrained Minimization''' refers to the minimization of the given function without having to worry about any other rules or caveats. '''Constrained Minimization''', on the other hand, refers to minimization problems where other relations called ''constraints'' must be satisfied at the same time.

Beside the method above (where we take the derivative of the function and set that equal to zero), there are several numerical methods that we can use to find the minima of a function. For these methods there are useful computational tools such as '''Matlab'''.

=== Hessian Matrix ===

The function has a local minima at a point ''x'' if the Hessian matrix ''H''(''x'') is positive definite:

:&lt;math&gt;H(x) = \frac{\partial^2 f(x)}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''x'' is a vector of all the independant variables of the function. If ''x'' is a scalar variable, the hessian matrix reduces to the second derivative of the function ''f''.

=== Newton-Raphson Method ===

The '''Newton-Raphson Method''' of computing the minima of a function ''f'' uses an iterative computation. We can define the sequence:

:&lt;math&gt;x^{n+1} = x^n - \frac{f'(x)}{f''(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where 

:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \frac{df(x)}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f''(x) = \frac{d^2f(x)}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt;

As we repeat the above computation, plugging in consecutive values for ''n'', our solution will converge on the true solution. However, this process will take infinitely many iterations to converge, but if an approximation of the true solution will suffices, you can stop after only few iterations, because the sequence converges rather quickly (quadratic).

=== Steepest Descent Method ===

The Newton-Raphson method can be tricky because it relies on the second derivative of the function ''f'', and this can oftentimes be difficult (if not impossible) to accurately calculate. The '''Steepest Descent Method''', however, does not require the second derivative, but it does require the selection of an appropriate scalar quantity &amp;epsilon;, which cannot be chosen arbitrarily (but which can also not be calculated using a set formula). The Steepest Descent method is defined by the following iterative computation:

:&lt;math&gt;x^{n+1} = x^n - \epsilon \frac{df(x)}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Where epsilon needs to be sufficiently small. If epsilon is too large, the iteration may diverge. If this happens, a new epsilon value needs to be chosen, and the process needs to be repeated.

=== Conjugate Gradient Method ===

== Constrained Minimization ==

''Constrained Minimization''' is the process of finding the minimum value of a function under a certain number of additional rules called constraints. For instance, we could say &quot;Find the minium value of ''f''(''x''), but ''g''(''x'') must equal 10&quot;. These kinds of problems are more difficult, but the '''Khun-Tucker''' theorem, and also the '''Karush-Khun-Tucker''' theorem help to solve them.

There are two different types of constraints: equality constraints and inequality constraints. We will consider them individually, and then mixed constraints.

=== Equality Constraints ===

The Khun-Tucker Theorem is a method for minimizing a function ''f''(''x'') under the equality constraint ''g''(''x''). The theorem reads as follows: 

Given the cost function ''f'', and an equality constraint ''g'' in the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, 

Then we can convert this problem into an unconstrained minimization problem by constructing the '''Lagrangian''' function of ''f'' and ''g'':

:&lt;math&gt;L(x) = f(x) + \langle \Lambda, g(x)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;Lambda; is the ''lagrange multiplier'', and &amp;lt; , &amp;gt; denotes the '''scalar product''' of the vector space R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''n'' is the number of equality constraints). We will discuss scalar products in more detail later. If we differentiate this equation with respect to ''x'', we can find the minimum of this whole function ''L''(''x'',''&amp;Lambda;''), and that will be the minimum of our function ''f''. 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{df(x)}{dx} + \left\langle\Lambda,\frac{dg(x)}{dx}\right\rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This is a set of ''n+k'' equations with ''n+k'' unknown variables (''n'' &amp;Lambda;s and ''k'' ''x''s).


=== Inequality Constraints ===

Similar to the method above, let us say that we have a cost function ''f'', and an inequality constraint in the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) \le 0&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can take the Lagrangian of this again:

:&lt;math&gt;L(x) = f(x) + \langle \Lambda, g(x)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

But we now must use the following three equations/ inequalities in determining our solution:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{df}{dx} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\Lambda , g(x)\rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

These last second equation can be interpreted in the following way:
:if &lt;math&gt;g(x) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:if &lt;math&gt;g(x) \le 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

Using these two additional equations/ inequalities, we can solve in a similar manner as above.

=== Mixed Constraints ===

If we have a set of equality and inequality constraints

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h(x) \le 0&lt;/math&gt;

we can combine them into a single Lagrangian with two additional conditions:

:&lt;math&gt;L(x) = f(x) + \langle\Lambda, g(x)\rangle + \langle \mu, h(x)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mu, h(x)\rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

== Infinite Dimensional Minimization ==

The above methods work well if the variables involved in the analysis are finite-dimensional vectors, like those in the '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;. However, when we are trying to minimize something that is more complex than a vector, i.e. a function we need the following concept.  We consider functions that live in a subspace of L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;), which is an infinite-dimensional vector space. We will define the term '''functional''' as follows:

;Functional: A functional is a map that takes one or more functions as arguments, and which returns a scalar value.

Let us say that we consider functions ''x'' of time ''t'' (''N''=1). Suppose further we have a fixed function ''f'' in two variables.  With that function, we can associate a cost functional ''J'':

:&lt;math&gt;J[x] = \int_a^b f(x,t) dt&lt;/math&gt;

Where we are explicitly taking account of ''t'' in the definition of ''f''. To minimize this function, like all minimization problems, we need to take the derivative of the function, and set the derivative to zero. However, we need slightly more sophisticated version of derivative, because ''x'' is a function.  This is where the '''Gateaux Derivative''' enters the field.

=== Gateaux Derivative ===

We can define the '''Gateaux Derivative''' in terms of the following limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta F(x, h) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{1}{\epsilon} [F(x + \epsilon h) - F(x)]&lt;/math&gt;

Which is similar to the classical definition of the derivative in the direction ''h''. In plain words, we took the derivative of ''F'' with respect to ''x'' in the direction of ''h''. ''h'' is an arbitrary function of time, in the same space as ''x'' (here we are talking about the space L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Analog to the one-dimensional case a function is differentiable at ''x'' iff the above limit exists.  We can use the Gateaux derivative to find the minimization of our functional above.

=== Euler-Lagrange Equation ===

We will now use the Gateaux derivative, discussed above, to find the minimizer of the following types of function:

:&lt;math&gt;J(x(t)) = \int_a^b f(x(t), x'(t), t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

We thus have to find the solutions to the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta J(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The solution is the '''Euler-Lagrange Equation''':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x'} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The partial derivatives are done in an ordinary way ignoring the fact that ''x'' is a function of ''t''. Solutions to this equation are either maxima, minima, or saddle points of the cost functional ''J''.

=== Example: Shortest Distance ===

We've heard colloquially that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. We can use the Euler-Lagrange equation to prove this rule. 

If we have two points in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a'', and ''b'', we would like to find the minimum curve ''(x,y(x))'' that joins these two points. Line element ''ds'' reads:

:&lt;math&gt;ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Our function that we are trying to minimize then is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;J[y] = \int_a^b ds&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt;J[y] = \int_a^b \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}dx&lt;/math&gt;

We can take the Gateaux derivative of the function J and set it equal to zero to find the minimum function between these two points.  Denoting the square root as ''f'', we get

:&lt;math&gt;0=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}-\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y'}\right)=y''\frac{1}{\left(1+y^{\prime2}\right)^{3/2}} \;.&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that the line element will be finite this boils down to the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=0&lt;/math&gt;

with the well known solution
:&lt;math&gt;y(x)=mx+n=\frac{b_y-a_y}{b_x-a_x}(x-a_x)+a_y \;.&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Characteristics of Communication Systems==

COMMUNICATION SYSTEM- allows people to send and receive data and information. All communication systems have five basic components:
*DATA SOURCE- produces the data to be sent.
*TRANSMITTER- encodes the data into a single signal suitable for a transmission medium.
*TRANSMISSION MEDIUM- is a channel, such as a cable, is which the signal is transmitted to the destination. Signal may be changed or distorted during transmission.
*RECEIVER- decodes the signal back into the original data or an approximation of the data.
*DESTINATION- is the receiver of the information.

Communication systems are used in information systems when participants need to transmit and receive data and information. Good communication systems have an accurate, reliable and secure transmission medium and should have a minimum delay in communicating. Good communication depends on protocols, handshaking, speed of transmission and error checking which all depends on the information technology used in the communication system.


===Protocols===

PROTOCOL- is a set of rules that governs the transfer of data between computers. It defines how the information is transmitted and how errors are detected. Two computers must use the same protocols when communicating otherwise the data transfer may be unsuccessful. Protocols are written into internationally accepted standards such as the OSI reference model.
*OSI REFERENCE MODEL- divides data communications into seven layers. Each layer expresses the standard using a protocol. The bottom layers are responsible for data transfer from one place to another. They specify things such as plugs, format, method of transmission, error checking.
*(See page table below for examples of common protocols).

|TCP/IP
|'''Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol'''

TCP/IP is the basic communication language or protocol of the Internet. It can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network. When you are set up with direct access to the Internet, your computer is provided with a copy of the TCP/IP program just as every other computer that you may send messages to or get information from also has a copy of TCP/IP.

|-

|HTTP
|'''HyperText Transfer Protocol'''

The HTTP is the set of rules for exchanging files (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the WWW. HTTP is an application protocol.

|-

|FTP
|'''File Transfer Protocol'''

FTP, a standard Internet protocol, is the simplest way to exchange files between computers on the Internet.

|-

|SMTP
|''''Simple Mail Transfer Protocol'''

SMTP is a TCP/IP protocol used in sending and receiving e-mail. However, since it’s limited in its ability to queue messages at the receiving end, it’s usually used with one of two other protocols, POP3 or IMAP, that let the user save messages in a server mailbox and download them periodically from the server.

|-

|IMAP
|'''Internet Message Access Protocol'''

IMAP is a standard protocol for accessing e-mail from your local
server.

|-

|POP/
POP3
|'''Post Office Protocol (3)'''

POP3 is the most recent version of a standard protocol for receiving e-mail. POP3 is a client/server protocol in which e-mail is received and held for you by your Internet server.

|-

|MIME
|'''Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions'''

MIME is an extension of the original Internet e-mail protocol that lets people use the protocol to exchange different kinds of data files on the Internet: audio, video, images, application programs, and other kinds, as well as the ASCII handled in the original protocol, the SMTP.

|-

|UDP
|'''User Datagram Protocol'''

UDP is a communications method (protocol) that offers a limited amount of service when messages are exchanged between computers in a network that uses the IP. UDP is an alternative to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and, together with IP, is sometimes referred to as UDP/IP. Like the TCP, UDP uses the IP to actually get a data unit (called a datagram) from one computer to another.

===Handshaking===

Handshaking is used to establish a communication session for senders and receivers. It refers
to a series of messages or signals used to establish whether the devices are compatible and
thus able to communicate.

HANDSHAKING is an agreement about which protocol to use to accomplish the exchange of information. Data can only be successfully transferred if this occurs. It is a series of signals that flow between devices during data transmission. Handshaking is needed between devices as they may have different capabilities and may transfer data different ways. Handshaking involves sending signals to indicate the type of protocol to be used.  The transmitting device will send this signal and wait for a response. When two devices successfully handshake a connection is made. If unsuccessful the devices ‘hang up’ and try again. There are two methods of handshaking to control the flow of data;

*HARDWARE FLOW CONTROL uses a dedicated connection such as a wire. It is only practical when devices are close enough to be linked by a cable. Common hardware protocol is RTS/CTS (request to send/ clear to send).

*SOFTWARE FLOW CONTROL uses a special code sent with the data and is used for long distance communication. Common software protocol is XON/ XOFF (X stands for transmission).  When a break in transmission is required the XOFF command is sent etc.


===Transmission Speeds===



====Bandwidth====

BANDWIDTH- is the capacity of the channel or transmission medium. The speed of transmission is determined by the transmitting device and the bandwidth. A transmission medium with a high bandwidth can transfer more data. The speed of data transfer is measured by the number of bits per second, or the baud rate.

====Bits per Second====

BITS PER SECOND (bps) or BIT RATE- is the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted in one second. This includes special bits used in asynchronous transmission and any error checking bits.

====Baud Rate====

BAUD RATE is the maximum number of data symbols or electrical signals that can be transmitted in one second. Because one data symbol may contain more than one bit the baud rate and bit rate may not be the same.

===Error Checking Methods===

Received data may contain errors caused by interference in the signal or by errors in encoding and decoding the data. Errors must be detected then corrected. Methods include:

====Parity====

PARITY CHECKING is a method of checking for errors in data transmission using an additional bit called a parity bit. This bit is used only for the purpose of identifying if the bits being moved have arrived successfully. The sender and receiver decide whether to send using an odd or even parity bit. For example with 8 bit ASCII: 
*10011010 0 (even parity, 9th parity bit must be 0 to keep it even)
*11001001 1(odd parity, 9th bit must be a 1 to make it odd)


====Checksum====

CHECKSUM is a method of checking for in data transmission by counting the total number of bits in a data packet. A data packet is created by dividing the total data into smaller groups called packets. The count of bits in a data packet is attached to the data packet. It is used by the receiver to check whether all the bits have arrived successfully. If the count matches it is assumed that a complete transmission was successful.

====Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)====

CYCLIC REDUNDANCY CHECK (CRC) is a method of checking for errors in data transmission using a division process. The data is divided into predetermined lengths by a fixed divisor. The remainder of the calculation is attached and sent with the data. When the data is received, the remainder is recalculated. If the remainders do not match, an error in transmission has occurred. 

====Dealing with Errors====
The receiver may drop the packet, such as in IP, they may only acknowledge correct packets as occurs in TCP, or they may request that packets containing errors be resent, as occurs with Ethernet.

===Communication Settings===

PARAMETER is a variable that is given a constant value for a particular application. Communication settings can be changed by the user to ensure a connection between two devices. These settings are often a parameter. Some common parameters include bps, data bits, parity, stop/ start bits, and flow control:

BITS PER SECOND is the speed of transmission

DATA BITS are the number of bits in each group of data. Each group is usually sent as a byte such as 7-bit or 8-bit ASCII.

PARITY is whether the data contains a parity bit for error detection. Parity is odd, even or none.

STOP/ START BITS are the number of stop and start bits used in asynchronous transmission. This parameter is used to identify each byte. The normal range is between 0 and 2 while some systems only use a stop bit.

FLOW CONTROL is the software handshaking protocol.

==Examples of Communication Systems==



===Teleconferencing===

TELECONFERENCING is the use of an electronic transmission to allow a meeting to occur at the same time in different locations. It is an alternative to face-to-face meetings. Teleconferencing uses audio and video communication to go beyond the normal telephone call:

====Audio Conferencing====

AUDIO CONFERENCE- is a single telephone call involving three or more people at different locations. It is a service provided by a telephone company where audio data is transmitted and received using existing phone lines. 

====Video Conferencing====

VIDEO CONFERENCE- is a meeting that allows people in different locations to see video images if each other on a screen, as well as hear speech. Video conferencing requires a high bandwidth. Video conferencing simulates face-to-face meetings and reduces costs on not buying airfares, accommodation and meals, and saves time and energy involved in travelling. Teleconferencing is frequently used in business and distance education. However it does remove the inter-personal relationship of face-to-face meetings.

===Messaging Systems===

MESSAGING SYSTEMS- are used to send messages to people in different locations who may receive the message at a later time. Messaging systems involve the creation, storage, exchange and management of messages, which are sent to an individual, or a group of people. The oldest form of messaging system is letters while tradition systems include the telephone and fax:

*TELEPHONE- is a system for transmitting sounds or speech along telephone lines to distant locations. It is a convenient method of communicating with people around the world. A telephone answering machine is a communication system as it stores messages for hearing at a later time.
*FAX (OR FACSIMILE) MACHINE- is a system of transmitting and reproducing documents by means of signals sent over telephone lines. The fax machine scans a document and converts it into a bit-mapped image, which is compressed and sent over the telephone network to a destination fax machine. This destination machine decompresses the image and reconstructs the original document. Fax machines have become popular as people can quickly transfer a hard copy off a document or send a written message. Computers equipped with a fax modem can perform the same tasks.



====Voice Mail====

VOICE-MAIL (V-MAIL)- allows communication with other people by storing and forwarding spoken messages. The sender dials a voice-mail number and records a message, which is digitally stored on a computer system and can only be retrieved by the intended receiver. To retrieve the message this person dials the voice-mail number using any phone, enters an account number and password. Once in they can delete, save or forward the message to another person. Voice mail combines the features of a telephone answering machine and some of the concepts of email. It provides some advantages over email as more people have access to a phone than a computer, and people often express feelings better with the spoken word. However email is better for sending complex information and different data types.

====Electronic Mail====

ELECTRONIC MAIL (EMAIL)- allows communication with other email users by sending and receiving electronic messages using a computer. Email was one of the earliest uses of the Internet. It is a fast, economical and convenient method of sending messages all over the world in minutes. To use email you need a computer that is linked to a network or the Internet, an account with an Internet service provider (ISP), an email address and email software. 

EMAIL ADDRESS- anyone with an email address can receive email and email can be written to anyone that has one. Email addresses are unique and obtained free. They consist of two parts separated by @ symbol in the form ‘name’@’domain name’. The first part is the name of the account. The second is the domain name, which is the location of the account on the Internet. It identifies the specific computer or server where the person’s email messages are stored. 

EMAIL MESSAGES contain two main parts, the header and body of the message: 

*HEADER- is similar to an envelope as it contains information needed to deliver the message. The sender'’ email address is usually automatically inserted. The header contains four main parts that the sender fills in:
**EMAIL ADDRESS (To:) is the address of the person receiving the message, which must be correctly typed.
**CARBON COPY (Cc:) sends the same message to other people apart from the main recipient (optional).
**BLIND CARBON COPY (Bcc:) sends a copy to other people without revealing that these other people got the message (optional).
**SUBJECT is the topic of the message or a brief description (optional).

*BODY- of the message is typed using the email software or imported or copied from a word processor. The user does not have to be online to compose. Messages can be written offline and sent when the user logs on to the network or Internet. This saves ISP on charges. Email messages are often short and typed quickly. Some people use inventive spelling. When email is sent it is stored on the server where the receiver’s account is until the person checks their email. After the email is read, it can be deleted, printed or stored in an appropriate folder for later reference. The user can also:
**REPLY to the email message by clicking the ‘reply’ icon. The address of the original sender and the subject are automatically inserted in to the header of the reply. Leaving the subject the same identifies the ‘thread’ of the message. 
**QUOTING is retaining the previous message in the reply so that the original sender remembers the message.
**FORWARDING is sending a message already received to someone else.

Email software also provides a number of features to help create email:

ADDRESS BOOK- is used to store email addresses. This saves time typing the address and avoids having to remember each one.

MAILING LIST- is a group of people who may want to receive the same messages e.g. people working on the same project or with the same interests. Mailing lists are created by entering each address of each person in the list and giving it a name.

SIGNATURE- is several lines automatically appended to outgoing email messages and may include an email address, Web site, graphic, occupation or phone number.



===Electronic Commerce===

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE (E-COMMERCE) is the buying and selling of goods and services via the Internet. It has become a multi-billion dollar source of revenue for the world'’ businesses. It provides 24-hour availability, global reach, the ability to interact and provide customer information, and a multimedia environment. E-commerce is expected to expand into retail areas as each day there are businesses being established which rely entirely on Web sales.

===Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)===

EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer at point-of-sale) is a system that allows people to purchase goods and services using a credit or debit card. It is the electronic transfer of money from the customer’s bank account to the retailer’s. It has made shopping easier for customers and allows retailers immediate payment if the connection is made and approved. Each point-of-sale terminal is linked to the computer of the customer’s bank using the account number on the card. Entering the PIN number is a security measure to identify the customer. 

ELECTRONIC BANKING allows customers to view their account balances and transaction histories, transfer money between accounts and pay bills using Bpay. It provides services 24 hours a day but cannot counter for cash or cheque withdrawals. However automatic electronic debits are replacing cheques, which are expensive and ineffective as they pass through many hands before the transaction is completed. Some electronic banks require people to download special banking software and install it. Electronic banking raises the issue of security yet all banks are determined to make their online services safe from interference and to secure customer details using data encryption to secure data transfer between the two involved computers.


==Transmitting and Recieving==

===Methods of Data Transmission===

DATA TRANSMISSION occurs in two ways:

====Parallel Transmission====

PARALLEL TRANSMISSION is the transmission of data simultaneously using separate channels. 

====Serial Transmission====

SERIAL TRANSMISSION is the transmission of data one after the other. It is used to transmit data to peripheral devices, and is used on networks. Serial transmission can be either synchronous or asynchronous:

====Synchronous and Asynchronous Transmission====

*ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSMISSION is the sending of data by identifying each byte with special start and stop bits. It has become the standard for personal computers. 
*SYNCHRONOUS TRANSMISSION requires all the data to be sent at the same rate (the same number of bytes is sent each second). This is synchronised by each device using a clock. Synchronous is faster and more efficient than asynchronous as there are no extra bits. It is used on larger computer systems.

===Modes of Data Transmission===

DIRECTION OF DATA- can be simplex, half-duplex or full-duplex mode:

*SIMPLEX MODE allows transmission in one direction only from the sender to the receiver e.g. radio.
*HALF-DUPLEX MODE allows transmission in both directions but not at the same time. The sender and receiver take turns e.g. walkie-talkie.
*FULL-DUPLEX allows transmission in both directions at the same time e.g. email. Most communication systems use this mode.


===Processes involved in Data Transmission===

====Protocols====

===Networks===

NETWORK- is a number of computers and their peripheral devices connected together in some way. Each device in a network is called a node. Terminals are any devices that send data to and receive data from another computer system. If a terminal has both memory and processing capabilities it is called an intelligent terminal. Most personal computers are classified this way and called workstations on a network. The simplest form of a network is when two computers are connected directly to each other via a cable yet networks can involve thousands of computers. Networks are classified as LANs or WANs:

===LANs===

LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (LANs) connect computers within a building or group of buildings on one site. LANs cover a small geographical area and the computers are linked by coaxial cable or fibre-optic cable. There are three main advantages in using a LAN:
*sharing limited hardware resources such as printers, hard disks and modems.
*sharing application software such as word processors and DBMSs.
*improved communication among uses by sending electronic messages.

===WANs===

WIDE AREA NETWORKS (WANs) connect computers over hundreds or thousands of kilometres. WANs often consist of a mainframe computer called the host and a number of terminals e.g. EFTPOS and ATM terminals. A WAN may use a private lased line, the normal phone network, or a combination of both:
*PRIVATE LEASED LINE- is dedicated to the network. It offers higher transmission speeds than the PSTN.
*PUBLIC SWITCHED TELEPHONE NETWORK (PSTN) are relatively cheap if computers do not require a constant connection however they are not guaranteed and can be interrupted.

===Packet Switching===

PACKET SWITCHING is a technique that divides messages into small data packets, transmits these packets, and later joins them to form the original message. It is used to send most data over networks and the Internet. It allows multiple users to use the same transmission line by interspersing the data packets from different users. Data packets may not be sent over the same path and could arrive at the destination at different times and in the wrong order. Each packet contains an address and control instruction to reassemble the message in the correct order.

===Network Topologies===

NETWORK TOPOLOGY is the physical arrangement of the devices in a network. Types include:

*STAR TOPOLOGY- has a central computer WITH EACH DEVICE CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO IT. The central computer serves as a switch. It receives messages and sends them to the destination device. This topology requires extra cabling as each device is connected to the central computer rather than the next device. If one cable is broken the network can still operate. Yet if the central computer fails, the whole network fails. It is also limited by the processing power of the central computer. Star networks use a time sharing device that allocates a certain amount of CPU time to each user. It is the most common topology for a mainframe.
*BUS TOPOLOGY- is an arrangement where all devices are connected to a direct line called a bus. Each device has a unique identity and can only recognise the signals intended for it. Devices check the bus and retrieve their messages as data travels along the bus. Each device is considered to be connected to every other device and can communicate directly along the bus to any other device. Bus topology is one of the easiest to set up and can still operate if one node fails. It is used by Ethernet and PowerTalk.
*RING TOPOLOGY-is an arrangement where all devices are attached so that the path is in the shape of a continuous circle. Each device in the ring has a unique address. Data flows in one direction, moving from device to device until arriving at its destination. Token ring is the most common form of access for a ring topology. 

====Network Access Methods====

NETWORK ACCESS METHODS for dealings with multiple users wanting to access the network at the same time include:

*ETHERNET- the first industry-standard LAN access method, or protocol, based on a bus topology. It is defined in a standard called IEEE 802.3. Ethernet allows data to be transmitted simultaneously to all nodes on the network in both directions. Addressing information allows each node to recognise and receive individual data packets intended for it. With these packets travelling simultaneously collisions will occur and cause errors. To overcome this Ethernet uses (CSMA/CD).
**CARRIER SENSE MULTIPLE ACCESS AND COLLISION DETECTION (CSMA/CD)- all nodes have the ability to sense signals on the network. When a node wishes to transmit it ‘listens’ to the bus for signals. When there is no signals it transmits. A collision may occur if two nodes sense a clear bus at the same time. When a collision is detected each device stops transmitting and retransmits at a later time. 
*TOKEN RING- a LAN access method, or protocol, based on a ring topology. The token ring operates by continually passing special data packets called tokens between nodes on the network. Workstations with data to send capture a free token and attach data along with addressing information. A busy token with data cannot be used by other nodes. When the data arrives at the destination, it is replaced with an acknowledgment and sent back to the original sending node. 

===Network Hardware===

NETWORK HARDWARE- special purpose hardware devices are needed to successfully construct a network.

====Network Interface Cards====

NETWORK INTERFACE CARD  (NIC)- is required by every computer connected to a network. An NIC is an expansion card that fits into an expansion slot on a computer or other device so that it can be connected to the network. Most NICs require a network cable connection and have connectors on the card for different cable types. The type of NIC depends on the type of network. NICs package data according to the rules of the network operating system.

====Servers====

SERVER- is a computer that provides services to other computers on the network. Individual computers log on to the server, which gives them access to files, applications or peripheral devices. Types include:
*FILE SERVER- is a controlling computer in a network that stores the programs and data shared by users. These can be retrieved by any node that has access rights.
*PRINT SERVER- is a computer in a network that controls one or more printers and stores data to be printed. It can be used with or without a file server.
*MAIL SERVER- is a computer in a network that provides email facilities. It stores incoming mail for distribution to users and forwards outgoing mail to appropriate devices.
*WEB SERVER is a computer in a network that provides a connection to the Internet. All Net traffic is directed through it.

====Linking Hardware====

Devices used to determine the path between networks include:

*ROUTER- a device that determines where to send data packets between at least two networks. Its decision is based upon its current understanding of the networks. A router maintains a table of the available routes and their conditions. It uses this together with distance and cost algorithms to determine the best route for a given data packet. Data packets often travel through a number of network and routers before arriving at their destination.
*SWITCH- a device that directs data packets along a path. May include the function f a router although switches are a faster and simpler mechanism, as they don’t maintain a knowledge of the networks. A switch is not always required as many LANs are organised so each node inspects each data packet.


The actual interconnection between networks is achieved using a:

*BRIDGE- a combination of hardware and software to link to similar networks. Often connects LANs that use the same protocol such as Ethernet. A bridge examines each data packet on a LAN and forwards any data packets addressed to a connected LAN. Bridges are faster than routers because they connect networks using the same protocol.
*GATEWAY- a combination of hardware and software to link two different types of networks. This usually involves converting different protocols. 


REPEATER- is used to rebuild a fading signal (caused by long distances or electromagnetic field interference) to its original strength and shape before transmitting it onwards. It ensures data is received as it was sent. A network repeater is used in a LAN to connect network segments. They are less intelligent than a bridge or gateway. 

HUB- is a central connecting device in a network. Data arrives at the hub from one or more devices and is forwarded out using just one cable. A hub can include a router. Most were originally passive (data simply passed through without change). Intelligent hubs are more frequently used today. These contain a CPU and network operating system, which allows them to perform some server functions.

====Transmission Media====

*WIRE TRANSMISSION transfers the data through wires and cables, which must be, protected from damage, take up space and can be difficult to install. However wire transmission can carry large amounts of data with little interference from other signals. Two types of transmission are used. Baseband networks use the entire capacity of the cable to transmit only one signal at a time. Broadband networks divide the cable so that several signals can be transmitted at once. Types include:
**TWISTED-PAIR consists of two thin copper wires twisted to form a spiral. This reduces the amount of interference from other cabling. Two main types are unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) which is the most common and shielded twisted-pair, which is used, in ‘noisy’ environments where its shield protects from excessive electromagnetic interference. Twisted-pair is slowest medium with a bandwidth up to 60Kbps.
**COAXIAL CABLE consists of a single copper wire surrounded by an insulator, grounded shielding and an outer insulator. Shielding allows data to be transmitted with little distortion. Commonly used over distances less than a few kilometres.  Bandwidth is 10Mbps.
**FIBRE-OPTIC CABLE uses a small laser of light to carry data in small glass fibres free from electromagnetic interference, securely and at high speeds without errors. These are replacing conventional copper-wire cables. Bandwidth is in excess of 400Mbps where a single strand can carry thousands of phone conversations. However it is expensive.
*WIRELESS TRANSMISSION moves the data through air and space without the need for a fixed physical connection between source and destination e.g. radio. Wireless LANs use radio waves, not cables. Wireless LANs are not popular due to problems in maintaining signal quality and concerns about electromagnetic radiation. Wireless transmission involves:
**MICROWAVE is a high frequency radio signal sent through space in a straight line from one antenna to another. Antennas are placed on tall buildings or mountaintops to continue transmission over long distances. Microwave is faster than phone lines or coaxial and even though it is reasonably error free, weather conditions and objects can obstruct the signal and affect transmission.
**SATELLITE. These are specialised transmitters and receivers that are launched by a rocket and placed in orbit around earth. A signal is sent from one ground station to the satellite, which receives and retransmits it to another ground station. Each ground station uses a satellite dish to send and receive. Satellites can transmits large amounts of data over long distances at great speeds. There are hundreds currently operating and used for weather forecasting, television broadcasting, and radio and Internet communications.
**MOBILE PHONES transmit data to a grid of cellular stations, which are linked to the wireless transmission telephone network. Mobiles use radio waves to communicate with the cellular station. They are a portable device, yet monthly fees are higher than those for a normal phone in most countries.

===Network Software===

NETWORK SOFTWARE must be installed on each computer in a network. This software contains the ‘rules’ for communication and determines how the network devices send and receive data. Network software is organised by a network administrator.

====The Role of the Network Administrator====

NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR- is a person who manages a network within an organisation. Their responsibilities include network security, installing new applications, distributing software upgrades, monitoring daily activity, enforcing licensing agreements, developing a storage system and providing routine backups. These are completed using the network operating system.

NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM (NOS)- is an operating system that is designed primarily to support computers connected to a LAN. Examples include Microsoft’s Windows NT and Novell’s Netware. One part of the NOS resides in each node and another resides in the server. It controls the flow of data between the network devices and requests for data, organises messages from nodes until the network is ready to process each message. Tasks include:

*ADMINISTRATION- adds, removes and organises users, installs hardware devices and software applications, and carries out maintenance operations such as backup.
*FILE MANAGEMENT- gives users access to remote hard disks on the server and provides a file system and the ability to manage a network directory.
*APPLICATIONS- handles requests from users to share data and applications.
*RESOURCE MANAGEMENT- allows network devices to be shared, assigns users to printers, and orders print jobs.
*SECURITY- monitors and restricts access to network resources.

LOGON is the procedure used to gain access to the network. The user is identified by a user ID and password. The ID usually conforms to a limited length and the password often must contain one digit. The password is a security measure and must not be readily available or easily guessed and must be kept secure. The password file should be encrypted and protected from unauthorised access. Network systems may require users to frequently change passwords as a security measure. The logon procedure usually allows the user two or three attempts to enter the correct ID and password. Mistakes can occur in typing or the communication link. After logging on the user is given access to only those features authorised by the network administrator. The correct logoff procedure should always be carried out to clear the communication line for another user.


====The Internet, Intranets and Extranets====

INTRANET- is a private network that uses a similar interface to the Web. It usually has a connection to the Internet and consists of many interlinked LANs. The main purpose of an intranet is to share information (e.g. staff news, policies) and computing resources among the employees of and organisation. When access to the Net is provided it is through firewalls.

FIREWALL- monitors the flow of data in both directions to maintain the security of the organisation.

EXTRANET- is an intranet that is accessible to customers, suppliers or others outside the organisation. Provides such information as product descriptions, answers to frequently asked questions, warranties and how to contact customer service. 

==Other Information Processes==

===Collecting===

COLLECTING data for a communication system involves generating the data to be transmitted. Collecting data involves a range of collection devices to gather different types of data. The choice of device depends on the application and the type of data to be transmitted. Some devices include:
*ATM terminals for electronic banking
*EFTPOS terminals for a retail store
*telephones for voice mail
*keyboards for email
*video cameras for a surveillance system.

===Processing===

PROCESSING of data in a communication system is the manipulation of the data. After collection the data must be converted into a form for transmission. This involves encoding and decoding:
• ENCODING involves converting data from its original form into another form for transmission.
• DECODING converts the data from the form used for transmission back into its original form.

The type of encoding or decoding depends on whether the original data is in analog or digital form:

• ANALOG DATA is represented by using continuous variable physical quantities such as voltages. Most natural events in the real world are therefore in analog form. Sounds, images and video are in analog form. Analog signals are pulses, usually electrical or optical, in the form of a continuous wave.

• DIGITAL DATA is represented in the form of digits or numbers. IT works with data in digital form. Digital signals are represented using a series of 0s and 1s. 

====Encoding and Decoding Methods====

The form of the data and the transmission signal affect the quality of the data received and the cost of transmission. The quality of analog data depends on maintaining the exact wave as it moves through wire or space. It is corrupted there is no way of regenerating the wave. It is possible to regenerate digital data because it only involves distinguishing between a 0 and a 1. There are four encoding and decoding possibilities in transmission:

*ANALOG DATA TO ANALOG SIGNAL. The wave shape of the data is encoded into the signal e.g. a telephone.

*DIGITAL DATA TO ANALOG SIGNAL. A series of 0s and 1s is encoded into a continuous wave e.g. a modem modulates (encodes) digital data from a computer into analog signals for a phone line. When this is received by another modem it demodulates (decodes) it back to digital data.

*DIGITAL DATA TO DIGITAL SIGNAL. A series of 0s and 1s is transmitted by sending it through a channel as a series of on and off pulses e.g. a LAN where the computer or a peripheral devices encodes the data. Low error rate.

*ANALOG DATA TO DIGITAL SIGNAL. The wave shape of the data is encoded into a series of 0sand 1s e.g. TV. This is called digitising. Images are digitised by scanners using a process called sampling. 

====Data Conversing====



====Client-Server Arhitecture====

CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE describes the software relationships between the client (user) and the server. A client sends a request to the server according to an agreed protocol and the server responds. It provides a convenient way to interconnect programs that are distributed across different locations in a network. Most business applications and the Internet use client-server architecture. The Web browser is a client program that requests services from a Web server to complete the request. 

===Displaying===

DISPLAYING is the presentation of information in the form of text, images, audio, video or numbers. A range of software and hardware combinations are used including:

*TELEPHONE- displays audio information. A phone contains a transmitter that converts sound into a signal suitable for the transmission medium and a receiver to convert it back to sound. A phone also displays voice mail messages.

*EFTPOS TERMINAL- displays information about EFTPOS transactions. The terminal contains a screen to display the name and price of the product being purchased. When the customer’s bank is contacted the terminal displays the approval is funds are available. It then provides a receipt.


==Issues Related to Communication Systems==



===Issues Related to Messaging Systems===

MESSAGING SYSTEMS have improved communication but raised issues:

*SOCIAL CONTEXT. Ideas delivered by messaging systems appear less forceful and caring than those delivered personally. MSs have difficulty when communication depends on expression of feelings.

*DANGER OF MISINTERPRETATION. Communication often depends on the context inflection on a person’s voice and body language. Misinterpretation can occur with email, or phone etc.

*POWER RELATIONSHIPS. MSs may change the relationship between people in an organisation. The normal communication through middle management is affected.

*PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY. A characteristic of MSs is that the messages are stored (e.g. email messages are stored on servers and can be accessed by the service providers) therefore there is no guarantee of privacy and confidentiality.

*ELECTRONIC JUNK MAIL. Unwanted mail is a problem for MSs. People can send a message to one or thousands of people (spamming) very easily. If a person receives hundreds per day it wastes time and prohibiting this practice would be difficult and compromise free society.

*INFORMATION OVERLOAD. This term refers to the enormous amount of information that people have to absorb. MSs are a source of information. The large amount of email received by some people has increased their workload and stress levels. There is often an expectation that people will reply quickly to an email than to a letter written down by someone else.

===Issues Related to the Internet===

INTERNET TRADING or e-commerce, is increasing at a staggering rate to meet the needs of consumers. The Net provides significant advantages for consumers such as more information about products and services, global shopping and increased competition resulting in lower prices. Some implications include:

*TAXATION. Present governments have been unable to tax Internet transactions. This increased Net business will reduce the money governments receive from their goods and services.

*EMPLOYMENT RAMIFICATIONS. The increase in Net trading requires more people to be employed in the IT industry and may result in fewer shop fronts and people required to run them.

*NATURE OF BUSINESS. Traditional businesses that provide interaction opportunities are being challenged. People can complete some of their business at home without travelling.

*TRADE BARRIERS. The developments in communication technology have made trade barriers irrelevant. The issue of where one country ends and another begins is open to question. People are buying and selling on the Net with little thought given to such issues.

CENSORSHIP is one of the most controversial issues to have arisen with the Net as it provides access to a large amount of offensive material especially to children. Some believe offensive material should be banned while others believe this would compromise free society. There have been unsuccessful attempts to censor material on the Net by governments and law enforcement bodies worldwide. The Internet Industry Association (IIA) represents Australian ISPs. It has released a code that deals with censorship of online content. The code requires ISPs to remove offensive content from their servers and to block access to classified material on overseas sites. The federal government has passed a law requiring ISPs to subscribe to this code. The difficulty with enforcing censorship is the enormous number of Web sites and the thousands of new ones published daily. Monitoring on a global basis is impossible. Clearly a multinational agreement is necessary however this would be difficult to obtain and regulate. The prime responsibility of preventing children from offensive material lies with the parents and carers.

The Internet now provides radio and video:

RADIO is being broadcasted by Web sites from around the world. These stations cater for a range of tastes. 

VIDEO is also being provided online. It is replacing videotapes and other media. It allows organisations to create unlimited video channels, which are used for sales, training, communication and other purposes. Video on the Net saves time, reduces costs and provides global ability viewing. The size and quality of the video is currently less than TV broadcast but will improve with advances in technology and increased bandwidth.


===Issues Related to Electronic Banking===

INTERNET BANKING has raised issues:

*SECURITY. All banks are determined to make their online services secure from interference and customer details secure. Data encryption is used to secure data transfer between computers.

*CHANGING NATURE OF WORK. People working for the bank do not carry out the services for the online bank. Banks require more people with IT skills and fewer with banking skills.

*BRANCH CLOSURES AND JOB LOSSES. With many people using Net banking, ATMs and EFTPOS there is less need to access the facilities provided by a branch resulting in closures and job losses. 


===Work-Related Issues===

====Working from Home====

TELECOMMUTING is working from home and electronically communicating with the office. It is expected to increase. Factors that will affect this include availability of bandwidth, the perceived value of telecommuting, and the opportunities to work collaboratively across distances. The Internet has allowed a new type of organisation to develop whose employees work almost entirely through telecommunication with an occasional face-to-face meeting. The main advantages of telecommuting include a greater flexibility in work hours, saving money on food, transport and clothing, and saving time. It also benefits people who are physically impaired or required to look after children. The employer saves time on overheads such as office space and furniture. Disadvantages include a lack or missing of social and professional contact offered by an external workplace, loneliness and isolation. Telecommuting can also blur the line between work and home life. The home is no longer a place where the pressures of work can be forgotten and work may be interrupted by domestic chores.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Corel Draw is vector design software with bitmap capabilities that enforce Corel Draw to be a design software that encompasses all the necessary tools to print and publish graphic media.
 
However, since every graphic software specializes in something and has got a user feature that is unique to uses Corel's features are the following:

#Imposition options for Printing, 
#Detailed plate separation options for hexachrome plates and smart plates.
#Easy Learning curve, this is evident as print shops like the franchise Minuteman Press use Corel because it is user-friendly for owners to edit and change files as well.
#If you optimize the keyboard shortcuts then the speed of designing doubles itself.

There are many more advantages in comparison to other software such as Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, Quark Express, Etc.

Corel Draw does have some cons for example 

#Duotone separation is faulty. 
#Lens effects cause postscript errors. 
#Bitmap effects are prone to errors and Corel crashing rituals. 
#Moreover Corel Draw does not have the biggest Market share in design software. By far Adobe does. Adobe InDesign. 
#Corel Draw is not also effective for web-site development and files are erroneous being publishing to HTML files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multimedia Systems will probably be the easiest and most intuitive part of any IPT exam, because while you may have never know any thing about the system development cycle and the seven information processes before you began IPT, you would have known what resolution was, and what a bitmap was, etcetera.

==Characteristics of a Multimedia System==

Multimedia means the use of different media to present a message or to entertain. Multimedia systems are information systems that combine a variety of different media types. In computer terms, Multimedia applies to software that can different forms of information and it has only become a possibility due to development of powerful and inexpensive computers that have the ability to record and play sound, display millions of colours and record and playback video. 

===Types of Media Systems===

===Text, Hypertext and Numbers===

'''Text''' is any sequence of symbols that have meaning such as keyboard symbols and in multimedia text allows the users to read and review the information at their own speed. 

'''Hypertext''' is text presented in such a way that when selected it links to new information. Hypertext makes multimedia interactive as it allows the user to obtain new information in any direct order which doesn’t have to be linear. 
'''Numbers''', like text, are used to display information and often used for exact, accurate information. 

====Fonts====

====Menus====

====Hypertext====

===Audio===

Sound is digitised by measuring its pitch and volume thus audio can either be in waveform or MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) format which uses a digital version of sounds to create music. 

====Storage in MP3 Format====

lossy format

====Selection of Audio Files====

===Images===

an image is the fundamental part of multimedia presentation as they contain a wide range of graphical information like graphs, drawings, pictures, icons etc. The hypertext images when used to provide navigation links, images are classified as hypermedia which is any display object that links to new information. An animation is a moving graphic like video and the basic principle of animation (on movie screens, TV and VDUs) is the persistence of vision. 

====Bitmapped Graphics====
Bit-mapped graphics treat each pixel on the screen individually and represents this by bits in memory. They produce good quality images where shading and detail are needed. However, when transformed (resized or stretched), bit-mapped graphics become ragged and suffer loss of resolution. Enlarging each pixel in a bit-mapped image graphic creates staircase pattern called aliasing. Bit-mapped images require large amounts of storage. They are often stored in compressed formats, such as GIF and JPEG.

====Vector Graphics====
Vector graphics are made up of objects, such as a straight line, a curve or a shape. Each object is defined by its characteristics, such as position, line width, and pattern. These characteristics are stored as mathematical expressions and displayed on the screen as pixels. Some common formats include CGM, EPS and WMF.

{{TODO|Mine and add relevant content from [[wikipedia:Image file formats#Vector formats]]}}

====Animation====

===Video===

Video – or moving images are similar to animation. Both video and animation add enormous appeal to a multimedia system. Video and animation are complex data types for information systems to handle since huge amounts of data needs to move between storage devices (both primary and secondary) and the display device fast enough to create smooth motion effects. Often data must be processed before it can be displayed. 

===Print and Multimedia===

The differences between print and multimedia including: 

====Modes of Display====

Different modes of display – print (static) media is limited to hard copy such as books, newspapers, magazines and posters. However multimedia (dynamic media) can be implemented for computer use, wireless pocket PCs, PC/TV combination and other diverse applications. Once a book is published it cannot change thus its static but multimedia can be updated and distributed easily. In static media, changes have to be reprinted which is time-consuming, only one user can view it at one time, it can’t have sound and requires some imagination. Multimedia however has many advantages as its dynamic, changes can be immediately updated and put on website, allows multiple views at same time, has sound and interactive animations, is interactive through hypertext and hypermedia, but requires hardware and software. Print is limited to hardcopy mode while multimedia has multiple modes and print is presented in a linear or sequential way but multimedia is presented in non-linear and hierarchical way.

====Interactivity====

Interactivity and involvement of participants in multimedia systems – the interactive nature of multimedia is another difference from static media. Interactivity means that the user is able to make an immediate response to what is happening and modify the process. Effectively, there is a dialogue between the user and the computer or communications device and the data access and transfer can be non-linear. 

===The Demands Placed on Hardware by Multimedia Systems===

the audio and video/animation component of a multimedia require the greatest amount of storage space and processing. Thus a high level CPU is required plus high resolution (at least 1024 x 768) for multimedia applications. Text, numbers and hypertext is usually stored as ASCII or ANSI codes as they need little space and processing. 

====Primary and Secondary Storage====

*Bit depth and the representation of colour data – the bit depth describes the number of data bits needed to store each pixel in an image. This sets the number of possible colours for each pixel. The bit depth controls the number of possible colours for each pixel. A display system with a bit depth of 1 could only store a 0 or a 1 for each pixel. If 1 represented white and 0 represented black, then every pixel on the screen would be either black or white. With a bit depth of 24, the colours that could be displayed are 16777216, thus a higher bit depth of 24 (true colour) represents true colour data. 
*Sampling rates for audio data – sound and other analog data is generally represented as transverse wave and converted to digital form by a process called sampling. The sampling size is the number of bits used to store each sample from the analog wave. A higher sample size results in increased accuracy but higher data storage requirements. The sampling rate is the number of samples or slices taken of the analog wave in a second. The higher the sampling rate, the better the representation of the initial analog signal.  

====Processing Demands====

*Video data and frame rates – processing video files requires special hardware and software to enable it to be recorded and played back. Piped video is the simplest method of displaying video footage on computer screen.  A frame is a single image in a video or sequence and frame rate is the speed with which video frames are displayed on the screen. Video is shown at a certain speed so that observer’s perception of movement is one of smooth motion. The PAL (phase alternate line) displays a frame rate of 25 frames per second and current PCs cannot sustain a transfer rate between primary and secondary storage of 1,500 Mb per minute, thus compression, decreased colour depth and decreased resolution are used to process video data. Digital video editing software allows digital video to be manipulated either by an insertion or deletion of a scene and can be stored on digital media like hard disk drive, CD, DVD or tape. 
*Image processing, including morphing and distorting - when an image undergoes a process of metamorphosis and changes slowly from on image to a completely different one is called morphing where image is changed pixel by pixel. Warping or distorting is another animation technique where an image is gradually distorted by changing its pixels either by stretching or resizing so image results in a different form e.g. Changing your picture so you have very large ears. Image processing is an aspect of video work that demands processing power and morphing and warping are the primary types. 
*Animation processing – is the process of displaying a series of drawn images in quick succession, creating the effect of movement. Each drawing is a frame. Animation is based on the principle of persistence of vision thus animation seeks to create an illusion of smooth movement. Computers have made the task of animation easier via 2 methods: Cel-based animation is an animation technique where each individual frame is stored separately into a memory page and creates a separate picture for each frame with only small changes between the frames. This types of animation gives the animator complete control over every frame in the animation but is time and space consuming. Path-based animation is an animation technique in which the only part of the frame that changes is the moving object. The animator describes the path or movement of every object and the system then creates the animation frames with each object drawn in its correct position. The generation of scenes in-between by path-based animations is called tweening as animator only defines the starting and end point and the path to be taken, so tweening occurs. Thus path-based relies on system to create animations much faster with less storage requiring but animator doesn’t have much control.  

====Display demands====

*Pixels and resolution – a pixel is a single picture element which is the smallest controllable element on a graphics screen. A typical home VDU PC contains more than 600,000 pixels and each individual pixel’s colour and brightness is set by the computer to create an image that is displayed. The resolution is a measure of the quality or detail present in a displayed image. It’s usually described as the number of pixels across and down the screen (e.g. 640 x 480 was considered HIRES (high resolution before but is now LORES with 1200 x 860 now considered HIRES). High and low resolution describes graphic images and graphic display systems. The more pixels that can be displayed by a screen, the better the image quality or resolution.

===Expertise===

a number of different skills are required for the development of a good quality multimedia application such as – 
*Content providers – are people who provide material such as video footage, audio tracks, competitions and other materials. They’re experts in the subject matter of the application and ensure its technical accuracy. 
*System designers and project managers – are basically the people who plan and design the system. They’re responsible for the overall design, development and completion of the application. They require leadership skills as well as technical knowledge about systems development. 
*Those skilled in the collection and editing of each of the media types – collection and editing of media types is an area that requires particular expertise. Depending upon the intended delivery mode, e.g. CD or Internet, collectors/editors are required to consider issues such as bandwidth and data transfer requirements, screen resolution and memory and processor demands to ensure the chosen media mode is sufficient to meet the application’s purpose. 
*Those skilled in design and layout – are required to ensure that the presentation of the application, screen layout, keyboard commands, flow of information and other such areas produce an ergonomically sound interactive application which meets its design goals. 
*Those with technical skills with the information technology being used – are required to assist developers and users of a computer system with questions relating to hardware and software maintenance, usage and repair and so on. In terms of development of multimedia systems, such skills would involve selecting, installing and configuring appropriate hardware and software. 

==Examples of Multimedia Systems==

===Education and Training===

Multimedia is excellent for educational purposes as it uses different methods of display whereas animations provide changing scenes, text and subtitles assist the students who are hearing impaired and sound can assist those with sight disabilities. Multimedia offers education at an individual level with desired speed and convenience. Students can be trained via the Internet through multimedia terminals at home. Multimedia education is thus interactive assistance in developing student’s skills by educating and informing them. Its components are: Data and Information (text, images and video that combine to produce structured activities the user views as information, more emphasis will be on text-based information), Participants (teachers and students, parents and siblings, they will also be using the system), IT (high resolution VDU, audio speakers, CD/DVD drive, sufficient RAM and reasonably fast processor, keyboard and mouse for children’s click n drag, headphones) and Relationships (the direct user, the students who are also the participants, will control the path taken through applications as they select from the interactive menu via a mouse or keyboard and use the multimedia CD to their own need, speed and preference).

===Leisure and Entertainment===

electronic games, 3D adventure games, sporting games and interactive movies have become extremely popular forms of multimedia applications due to their high level of interactivity. The new generation of games provide ingenious levels of interactivity and realism to captivate the user thus they based mainly on animations and videos rather than text due to their entertainment purposes.  The components are: Data and information (realistic videos, animations and sounds with limited text), Participants (game players, ordinary people of all ages and abilities, more likely to be children and teenagers), IT (peripherals such as joystick, mouse, keyboard and track-pad, high resolution VDUs, high quality audio speakers, CD and DVD drive) and Relationship (the participants are also the players who play the games for leisure using a joystick etc. and make their own choices via navigational and hidden hypermedia). 

===Information===

multimedia has been used to provide guidance through the use of information centres in locations like museums, airports, rail stations etc. They’re aimed at quickly providing very basic information. An information kiosk allows the user to obtain specific information without asking a stranger like location details, product availability, arrivals and departures are all examples of information that can presented in this format. Its components are: Data and information (text with graphics and signs to provide basic information, audio to give directions, simple navigational options with little text, hypermedia to provide basic details), Participants (general public who happen to visit an information kiosk, travellers, tourists etc.), IT (touch screen for ease of using multimedia computer, trackball built into the system, display terminals including high resolution VDUs and monitors, laser screens) and Relationships (the general public is also the participant as they use hypermedia via touch screens to obtain basic information). 

===Virtual Reality and Simulation===

simulation is designed to duplicate real situations so user can gain valuable training and experience from using the system. It represents the behaviour of physical or abstract systems to help pilots and drivers to deal with various real-life situations in a safe environment. Virtual reality is a computer-generated artificial reality that projects a person into a sensation of 3 dimensional space, it convinces the user that they are part of a real situation.  Components are: Data and information (audio and video to represent situations,  in a VR – a 3D video headset will allow user to feel the reality) Participants (simulation – pilots and specialists to further knowledge and training, VR- ordinary people who play games etc.), IT (high resolution VDUs, simulator – keyboard and controls to interact with the flight’s cockpit, VR -  joystick, mouse and keyboard) and Relationships (both participants are also the users as they interact with the system via a keyboard or joystick).   

===Combined Areas===

this is where multimedia applications provide leisure as well as educational value through games that seek to interact with the student and make learning fun. Games such as building blocks by using times table is one such example. In this multimedia, text will be limited but animation and video will be emphasised to make learning fun and interactive. The data and information (limited text, animation, audio and video), Participants (students, teachers) IT (joystick, mouse, high resolution VDUs etc.).

===Advances in Technology Influencing Multimedia Development===

====The Worldwide Web====

appearing in 1993, www was the first method of sharing and linking text documents over the Internet, it was the 1st widely available hypertext system that could be used by people with totally different computer systems. It has made it extremely easy for large number of people to access multimedia systems stored as a series of linked webpages. Continued improvement in communication speed (or bandwidth) through technologies such as cable, ADSL and satellite have made the presentation of multimedia content via Internet a viable option. It has overcome the slow download speeds particularly for pages with graphic, sound and video. With an advanced ADSL connection, these data types can be downloaded within seconds and have improved communication capacity.  

===Optical Discs===

*CD-ROM speed – this stands for compact disk-read only memory and is an optical disk format that is used to hold pre-recorded text, graphics and sounds which can be run many times by purchaser. Before it had a single speed drive with the ability to access data at 150Kb p/sec. Through improved technology its now possible to purchase drives that are 40 or 60 times faster and the faster the drive spins, the more quickly it is able to deliver information to the processor. This improvement effectively began the multimedia revolution due to the sudden availability of high capacity random access data storage offering better quality animations. CD-RW or Compact Disk Re-writable allows the content stored on the disk to be overwritten and deleted as needed
*Digital Video Disc – this is what DVD originally stood for but now it stands for digital versatile disc. The enormous storage capacity of a DVD means that a single disc can store an entire movie, with extra scenes, multi- language options etc. A DVD can store anything from an encyclopaedia, interactive and far realistic games, complete training systems and complex simulations. Its biggest advantage over CD-ROM is greater storage capacity allowing up to 17Gb of data to be stored in contrast which is 28 CDs in every DVD. Increased storage means increased flexibility for multimedia developers, so it will replace CD-ROM and VHS for most applications.

===Multimedia Design===

====Good Design Principles for Different Types of Media====

==Displaying in Multimedia Systems==

===Hardware Devices Used===



====Screens====

Screens: CRT displays, LCD displays and touch screens – A CRT is the most commonly used graphic display device. A Cathode Ray Tube is a sealed vacuum chamber that can fire and accurately focus beams of electrons on a chemically coated screen. A LCD (liquid crystal display) is an electro-optical device used to display digits, characters or images that uses transistors and a complex chemical solution to display each pixel. LCDs use a thin layer of liquid crystal material that changes electrical properties when electric current is applied, thus light is either blocked or allowed to pass through. Each area of the screen that represents a pixel can be individually affected. LCDs are smaller in size and weight with considerable savings in power, more clarity and resolution than CRTs but are more expensive. A touch screen is a computer display screen that is sensitive t human touch, allowing a user to interact by touching pictures or words on screen. They are used in information kiosks, in computer-based training services, and in systems designed to help impaired individuals with difficulty using a mouse or keyboard. 

====Projection Devices====

this allows the projection of video and graphic images onto a screen. It produces an electronic image onto another medium. They were once very expensive and only worked in very dark rooms though still expensive, the projectors can display very bright light and clear high-resolution images in broad daylight. They’re now common in sporting and mass entertainment events or classroom teachers. It contains a chip with up to 500,000 mirrors which can individually controlled. By shining a bright light onto the chip while supplying its electrical circuits with a TV signal (from a camera, VCR or computer) the chip is able to create an image that can be projected onto a screen.  

====Speakers====

sound has become an important part of a multimedia presentation as PCs are sold with high quality speakers. Sound special effects, particularly those giving ‘3D’ sounds are now common in computer games. The sound cards in most multimedia PCs can also play and create both MIDI and waveform files.  Speakers provide the cheapest and easiest output device for audio but the quality matters. A sound card is needed for digital audio output and convert binary data into information by producing a digitised sound. 

====Heads-Up Displaying=====

virtual reality often uses a headset to give the wearer a 3D image and stereo sound. It removes all the other outside distractions so that the user’s senses of sight and sound are totally dominated by the artificial sound. Two VDUs are used in the headset, each giving the user a slightly different perspective view of the same scene. When the brain combines the 2 images, a realistic 3D view is created. Head up displays are smaller, less intrusive version of the headset developed for use by pilots. 

===Software for  Creating===

====Presentation Software====

these use graphics and data/information from other software to communicate and make presentations of data to others assisting users in making automated slide presentations.  The PowerPoint is an example of presentation software. Modern presentation software allow the creation of a professional looking multimedia with just a few clicks and these presentations They can incorporate text, numbers, images, audio, animation and video and allow relatively fast generation of a series of linked screens. They can be viewed using a standard monitor, data projector for a large group, hard copies of slides and transparencies and hard copies of paper handouts. 

====Application Software====

application software is a computer program used for a specific task. They allow you to add the elements of multimedia into just about any document. Programs like Word (used to produce word processed documents), and Adobe Photoshop (used to generate complicated graphical images) can be used to generate content that can be incorporated into a multimedia project. Digital video editing packages for computer systems allow user to create transitions, titles and sound, and to record sound and video clips but are expensive with high quality. Video or sound can even be imported by some word processing software. Specialist multimedia application software like Windows Media Player or Real Jukebox allows sound and video files to be displayed.    

====Authoring Software====

these multimedia software are new that incorporate many features of stand-alone applications. They allow users to create multimedia using both static and dynamic media and records the final product onto CD, DVD, tape, a computer hard drive or other electronic media. Authoring software allows the user to sequence and time the occurrence of events determining which graphics, sound, text and video files are to be utilised at any given point in the final product and allows creator to determine the level of user interaction. Examples include Macromedia Authorware and Adobe Acrobat.      

=====Animation Software=====

this software eases the burden of drawing the hundreds of cells or frames required for even a simple animation. There’s a wide range of animation software available each with weaknesses and strengths, but the majority provide the tools to produce an animation using 1 of the different animation techniques, including traditional frame-by-frame, path-based, morphing or warping e.g. GIFAnimator.  Programming languages e.g. Consumption++   and Java are used to create high quality professional multimedia applications. 

===Web Browsers/HTML Editors===

these are known as scripting software packages that allow the development of quite sophisticated multimedia applications. A web browser is software that allows you to browse through and view the thousands of websites that exist on WWW such as Internet Explorer. Editors allow the generation of pages on the Web and range from simple text-based programs which require coding of HTML to WYSIWYG systems like Macromedia Dreamweaver which allow coding to be generated without direct user intervention. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the language or code that is written on pages on the Web. Web browsers and HTML editors assist users in creating and editing multimedia material for the WWW and for locating and viewing material on the Web.  

==Other Information Processes==

===Collecting===

*Text and numbers in digital format – for use on computer, data needs to be converted into binary numbers – digitisation – which is done by coding. ASCII is a standard 7bit code that represents 128 letters, numbers and punctuations as a 7bit binary number with 0s and 1s.  
*Audio, video and images in analog format – these three data types in the real world are referred to as analog data and fill the physical environment that surrounds us. They have continuous values and an analog signal is an electrical signal in the form of a wave. Analog or real world data must be converted to digital for processing by a computer after collecting it as digital data represents the computer world. 
*Methods for digitising analog data – audio is digitised via sampling where regular measurements are taken of the sound. Video data is displayed by the piped video system where a video card receives and translates the video data in a form that can be displayed over the screen. Capturing full motion video requires a video capture card to digitise the signal before storing on disk for later editing. Analog video data also undergoes the sampling process where a video digitiser measures and records signals that represent colours and light intensities where in contrast to audio sampling, the quantity of data that the video digitiser handles is considerably larger. Digitising an image involves converting it into bit patterns within a computer’s memory which can be edited, manipulated and improved. Optical scanners and video digitisers convert images into bit patterns by making many measurements of the signal coming. An optical scanner is a digitising device that shines an intense beam of light at a paper document. The light detectors inside the scanner measured the intensities and colours of the reflected light and analog to digital converters then turn these measurements into digital bit patterns that can be stored for later use.  

===Organising Multimedia Presentations===

a '''storyboard''' is an illustrated scene-by-scene layout of the multimedia presentation showing the sequence of events and navigational links: 
*Linear – the user moves sequentially through the multimedia presentation where only options are back and forward. It’s ideal for testing presentations where 1 task must be finished before moving on to next one. 
*Hierarchical – this allows the user to choose from multiple options. The information is presented in a linear format but the user can choose which direction to take allowing them to explore more in detail. It’s ideal for information or leisure related tasks where at each stage, multiple options are provided. 
*Non-linear – allows the freedom to move in any direction within the structure at any time. They choose any path without significant restriction. Ideal for content presentations like multimedia encyclopaedia. 
*A combination of these – composite layout is where each of the 3 structures are combined. It includes a linear, non-linear and hierarchical structure.  

===Processing for a Multimedia System===

involves the manipulation of data as collected data is imported into multimedia software which use compression techniques to minimise data transfer rates, bandwidth and storage requirements. 

====Data Integration or Hypermedia====

The integration of text and/or number, audio, image and/or video – multimedia by definition consists of information presented in various forms including text, numbers, audio, images and video. Thus integration occurs in multimedia where items of data from a range of forms of information are combined together leading to increased storage requirements. The solution of course is compression to reduce redundant data. 

====Compression and Decompression====

Compression and decompression of audio, video and images – the 3 data types are compressed to reduce their file size thus the storage capacity and the processing required. In compressing a file, processing occurs when the multimedia is moved from a secondary storage (like hard disk or CD-ROM) into the system RAM. Because multimedia contains enormous amounts of data, processing is an elemental part of creation.   

====Hypermedia====

Hypermedia is the linking of multiple mediums to each other. Hypermedia is often utilized in multimedia and refers to the linking of data types. For example, activating a particular object on a website may cause additional text to be displayed, cause the user to ‘jump’ to a different section of the program, or to cause a video clip to play. The term ‘hyper’ refers to a link between elements of the program and so hypertext for instance is text that links to new information.

===Storing and Retrieving===

*The different file formats use to store different types of data – images, audio and video can be stored in a wide variety of formats. For text and numbers: ASCII, RTF (Rich Text Format), TXT and DOC are available. For images: JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) compresses images, GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) compresses images, BMP (Bit Map) uncompressed bit-mapped file format that increases size and HTML is a text based language used to create documents on web for images, text, audio and video.  For audio: WAV (wave file) uncompressed sound format with large sizes but very common, MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) has small file size and is common, MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer 3) compresses file size greatly with high quality and easy to create and QuickTime which supports both wav and MIDI but uncompressed.  For video: QuickTime which supports multiple file formats but has poor compression creating larger files, MPEG (Motion Pictures Experts Group) has very high compression and is standard for moving images and AVI (Audio Video Interleave) is the standard for digital video and common format but large size. 
*Compression and decompression – compression reduces the quantity of data in a file by a variety of methods. Audio files are compressed to reduce their storage space and transmission time and popular format is MPEG-1 audio layer 3 or MP3 – it uses lossy compression technique with little loss of quality. Video compression is achieved by use of codec a compression/decompression algorithm which is the method used to compress and then restore a data file. A number of video codes are in use including MPEG-1, -2 and -3 created by the Moving Pictures Expert Group. Image compression involves minimising the size in bytes of a file without degrading the quality of the image to an unacceptable level. This reduction in file allows more information to be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space, it also reduces the time required for information to be sent over Internet. Compression schemes can be lossless (where the decompressed data is identical to the original data with nothing lost in transaction such as GIF) and lossy (where the decompressed data is slightly different from the original e.g. JPEG and MPEG-1). Decompression, or the expansion of a compressed file, is only possible if a lossless compression scheme is utilised. So it’s only possible to expand a compressed file format to the original data set if the compression algorithm doesn’t discard information in the original compression process.       

==Issues Related to Multimedia Systems

===Copyright===

Copyright is the ownership of intellectual property. It is illegal to copy or reproduce a multimedia work without the express permission of the author. The particular issue with computer programs is that they’re relatively easy to copy and modify digital data with the appropriate tools. This becomes an ethical issue for users who have the technology to break copyright and avoid detection. The author of a saleable item has the right to expect a just a reward for their efforts. Another aspect of this is the need for the developer to fully acknowledge all sources that they use. E.g. if a multimedia encyclopaedia developer produced a program without acknowledging external sources of information and images, then they’re contravening copyright laws. When original work is produced using published sources, the author, URL address, date of publication, publisher, etc. should be acknowledged. The digital data in multimedia is easy to locate copy and edit.     

===Appropriate use of the Internet===

appropriate use of Internet and other multimedia contents involves the issues of ethics and moral behaviour. As communications technology improves and new uses of Internet appear, like netbanking, there are many opportunities of misuse and abuse. Materials can be easily copied and presented as original work without acknowledging. In using the Internet, ethical considerations such as privacy need to be addressed as it’s a common practice for people and organisations to set up video cameras and streamline video on Internet. People captured on video may not want to be displayed worldwide on personal screens. The placement of pornographic images and other disturbing materials within the reach of young people browsing the Internet raises legal and ethical issues, as does the presence of flashing hyperlinks indiscriminately tempting Internet users of all ages to visit casino websites.     

===Merging Technologies===

the increasing usage of digitisation due to digital convergence where content can be stored as a digital file rather than the more traditional analog form in multimedia has merged communications via radio, TV telephones, computers, the Internet and other modes into one. Web-TV allows the TV to act as a monitor connected to Internet; telephony is also possible with Internet using a sound card, microphone, PC and Internet to communicate as audio-conferencing. Desktop radio broadcasting is available on the Internet and audio and video files are available as streaming audio/video allowing you to listen or view video while it is being downloaded for playing at a later stage. Streaming technology has allowed the development of online broadcasting and WebTV.  

===Data Integrity of Source Data===

data integrity is the accuracy, consistency, currency and reliability of the data. The integrity of data becomes more important as amount of information on Internet increases. Sometimes browsers will be unaware that the information on a website is dated if site hasn’t been updated. Publishing on the Internet is less formal and can be done by anyone with appropriate technology so data can be anything pretending to be fact. Integrity and accuracy is vital in a multimedia application designed to educate. An educational multimedia should provide a bibliography and identify its sources so that the accuracy of its information can be checked. The publishers of the Encyclopædia Britannica, who have print, CR-ROM, and online versions of their world-renowned reference materials available, could choose to use data from questionable sources but don’t instead they ensure the integrity of their product. However, overtime the accuracy of their factual information diminishes which is why they reproduce yearly editions. If the aim is information, such as a multimedia kiosk, then integrity will be judged by ease of use and honesty where accuracy is important but the need to check for sources is rarely an issue. If the aim of multimedia is entertainment, then factual accuracy isn’t important but integrity is judged by speed, reliability and variety of the games. In a training simulation (and VR), integrity will be judged by how closely the simulations match reality and to what extent its presents the users with a realistic experience otherwise it’ll be of little value.

      <comment>/* Rhyming epics? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Thank you for your lovely information about this topic .I am really happy to read it.

&lt;h2&gt;Formatting&lt;/h2&gt;
Given that this is a &quot;draft,&quot; I acknowledge that the content needs a lot of fine-tuning. However, I am quite surprised at the improper utilization of bolding and italics in the article. Titles of books should be italicized, according to the rules of the English language--not bolded. The bolding option is overused to the point of making my eyes hurt. Oh, and Henrik Ibsen was not an English writer. He was Norwegian. -- [[User:Cqbarton|Cqbarton]] ([[User talk:Cqbarton|talk]]) 23:58, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

==Rhyming epics?==
Since when do classical epics have rhyming couplets? Neither the ''Iliad'', nor the ''Odyssey'', nor the ''Aeneid'', nor ''Paradise Lost'' rhyme. Classical Greek and Latin don't rhyme as a rule, and Milton hated rhyme. The rest of this &quot;Guide&quot; is pretty much as informative as that segment. - [[User:Sukidakara|Sukidakara]] ([[User talk:Sukidakara|talk]]) 23:38, 16 January 2010 (UTC)

&lt;h2&gt;Title&lt;/h2&gt;
I suggest we change the name into ''The Occasional Reader's Guide to English Literature''. --[[Special:Contributions/80.121.38.30|80.121.38.30]] ([[User talk:80.121.38.30|talk]]) 13:42, 15 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Types of Catalog Files ==

Celestia's universe contains three broad categories of objects:

* [[Celestia/STC_File|Stars]] (STC)
* [[Celestia/DSC_File|Deep sky objects (galaxies and nebulae)]] (DSC)
* [[Celestia/SSC_File|Solar system bodies (planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and spacecraft)]] (SSC)

Each is defined in a different type of catalog file. [[Celestia/SSC_File|Solar system catalog (.ssc) files]] contain definitions for solar system bodies; [[Celestia/DSC_File|.dsc files]] contain definitions for deep sky objects; and stars may be defined in either [[Celestia/STC_File|.stc files]] or in [[Celestia/Binary_Star_File|stars.dat]], which is in binary format. A binary star format is used because Celestia's universe contains many more stars than deep sky objects or solar system bodies, so having a compact, quickly loadable format is very important.

== Common Syntax of Catalog Files ==

Except for binary .DAT star catalogs, all other catalogs are text files that contain lists of object definitions of a similar format. Each definition has a name followed by a list of properties. Property lists are a collection of name and value pairs grouped by braces. Here is the list of properties for the star Proxima Centauri:

&lt;code&gt;
 {
    RA 217.429167
    Dec -62.679444
    Distance 4.225
    SpectralType &quot;M5.5V&quot;
    AppMag 11.09
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

The property names are particular to the type of object. Property values have a type. In the example above, all of the properties are ''numbers'' except for the SpectralType which is a ''string''. Celestia catalog files may contain comments -- any text between a hash character (#) and the end of a line is ignored.

=== Number Values ===

A ''number'' in a Celestia catalog file is a scalar real value. Very large or small values can be written in C-like exponential form, e.g. 1.2e-3 instead of .0012. Examples of valid number values:

 1234
 3.14159265
 1.234e10
 0.1025
 -2.24
 
 .1025  (Celestia v1.5.0 or later)
 +2.24  (Celestia v1.5.0 or later)


Note: Celestia v1.4.1 and earlier versions have two restrictions which have been fixed in v1.5.0. In Celestia v1.4.1 and earlier, all numbers must start with either a numeric character or a minus sign. A leading decimal point or a leading + should not be used.  That is, values less than 1 must have a leading 0: 0.5 is OK, but .5 is not. Also, a leading + is assumed. Providing one will cause an error.

=== String Values ===

''Strings'' are arbitrarily long sequences of characters enclosed by double quotes. They can span multiple lines, though any
newlines inside a string will be interpreted literally. Some special characters may be represented by backslash-prefixed escape sequences.

; &lt;nowiki&gt;\&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; : Double quote character
; &lt;nowiki&gt;\n&lt;/nowiki&gt; : Newline
; &lt;nowiki&gt;\\&lt;/nowiki&gt; : Backslash
; &lt;nowiki&gt;\u&lt;/nowiki&gt;''xxxx'' : Unicode character, where ''xxxx'' is a sequence of four hex digits

=== Vector Values ===

A ''vector'' in a Celestia catalog file is a list of three real values enclosed by square brackets. Example vectors:

&lt;code&gt;
 [ 0 +1 0 ]
 [ 1.2 -3.4 5 ]
 [ 1.0e3 2.2 63 ]
&lt;/code&gt;

=== Property List Values ===

Some properties in a list have complex values that are themselves property lists. Like top-level property lists, these are just brace enclosed lists of name-value pairs. Here is how you would set the value of the property named UniformRotation in a solar system catalog (.ssc) file: 

&lt;code&gt;
 UniformRotation
 {
    Period 24.0
    Inclination 23.5
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

(This is just an example to show the format. The directive UniformRotation is not recognized by Celestia v1.4.1 and earlier. It requires Celestia v1.5.0.)

=== Date Values ===

A date value may be written either as a ''number'' or as a ''string.'' A ''number'' is interpreted as a Julian day number. Date ''strings'' contain the Gregorian year, month, and day of the month. They may optionally have an hh:mm:ss formatted time. A 24-hour clock is used for the time. Negative year values are used instead of BC or BCE; if you want a date in 1 B.C., you should set the year to be zero. (This is the astronomical convention, which is not the same as the Christian convention used in most calendars. The Christian calendar has no year numbered 0.)

Examples of date values with explanatory comments:

&lt;code&gt;
 2451545.0              # J2000 - noon January 1, 2000
 2453023.1232
 &quot;2006 11 8&quot;            # midnight November 8, 2006
 &quot;1984 12 25 1:30:00&quot;   # 1:30am December 25, 1985
 &quot;-4 8 23 10:00:00&quot;     # 10:00am August 23, 5 B.C.
 &quot;2130 4 1 22:10:34.15&quot; # 22:10:34.15 April 1, 2130
&lt;/code&gt;

Starting with Celestia v1.5.0, all catalog times are specified using the TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time) time scale. However, the on-screen time is shown in UTC. TDB is offset from UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) by 32.184 seconds plus some integer number of leap seconds. As of 2006, TDB is 65.184 seconds ahead of UTC. For further information, see the page on [[Celestia/Time Scales|time scales.]]

      <comment>/* Time Scales */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== UTC vs TDB ==

Versions of Celestia before v1.5.0 use UTC to calculate times and positions. Unfortunately, UTC includes &quot;leap seconds&quot; in order to stay aligned with the Earth's varying rotation. Leap seconds happen essentially randomly, when they are needed. Although Celestia does incorporate a table of leap second times, its use of UTC causes problems when used with ephemerides which are defined using TDB. Starting with v1.5.0, although it still displays UTC on the screen, Celestia uses the TDB time scale internally for everything else. As a result, Celestia places objects much more accurately than before.

== Time Scales ==

It may be helpful for Celestia users to understand the various time scales that are used in the field of astronomy. The most familiar is local time, which is probably what you see if you look at a nearby clock. The local time zone determines the difference between local time and Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. UTC is the current time at the zero degree meridian; it replaces Greenwich Mean Time as the standard world clock.

Astronomical ephemerides are typically defined in terms of Barycentric Dynamical Time, or TDB. TDB is the time measured by a clock at the solar system barycenter. It differs from Terrestrial Time (TT)--the time measured by a clock on the Earth--because of relativistic effects, but the difference between the two scales is always less than 0.002 seconds. The two scales can usually be considered equivalent in Celestia.

TT is ahead of International Atomic Time (TAI) by constant value of 32.184 seconds. Finally, UTC differs from TAI by some integer number of leap seconds. Leap seconds are inserted occasionally because the Earth's rotation is irregular, and it's desirable to keep our everyday time scale from drifting with respect to the terrestrial day-night cycle--except at the poles, the sun should be in the sky at noon. The most recent leap second occurred at 23:59:60 on December 31, 2008 and made UTC 34 seconds behind TAI. (See [[wikipedia:International Atomic Time|Wikipedia on TAI]])

To briefly summarize the relationship between time scales:
 TT = TAI + 32.184
 TAI = UTC + ''leap second count''
 Thus, TT = UTC + 32.184 + ''leap second count''

UTC is used in the Celestia's Set Time dialog and it's also the time displayed in the upper right of the screen. Unless you're creating scripts or add-ons for Celestia, UTC is all that you will see. But everywhere else, the time scale is TDB: xyz trajectory files, attitude files, beginning, ending, and epoch times in .ssc files.

I saw your edits to [[MIPS]] and [[Circuit Theory]]. Thanks for the help! Every little bit helps, and even small edits make books better. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:32, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

Congratulations also for all the corrections you are making on the [[C++ Programming]] book, big help thanks... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:48, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

== Hello again ==
Where was the problem you detected on the print version?&lt;br&gt;
I have restored it to the previous state so we can fix it (duplicating the all chapters will not fix it and will break the auto-update functionality that was created, editors will have to remember to edit both pages, and that is prone to generate errors).&lt;br&gt;
Due to transclusions taking some time to update (probably the error you mentioned was due to that) it will take some time for the serve to restore the structure (probably more than 24h), try to check in the all chapters version (that should be the same without some of the print version text).&lt;br&gt;
I will also take a closer look also later to see if I detect any problem. (You can use the by chapter view to make it easier, all views are structured as to represent smaller parts of the bigger page that is the print version)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:39, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

The TOC problem should be a minor one, as stated in the header that information should not get printed, if it is then I or someone else have probably forced a toc on a low content subpage to help navigation (I remember doing something like that somewhere) but was confident that the print version would not print it...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:43, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

:The problem I saw with the print version was with putting
:&lt;pre&gt;{{:C++ Programming/All Chapters}}&lt;/pre&gt;
:in the print version code. It made a link to All_Chapters instead of including its text. It might just do that for me though, or you might want that. The only thing that the print version page has that All_Chapters doesn't is the license, so if you added the license to the All_Chapters page, you could use that as your print version, because a print version should have all chapters. Shouldn't it?

:I know in the code for the Fundamentals section there is a &lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; above the transcludes, but by removing that the TOC is moved down further in the page to another section that has TOC forced. I didn't want to go through just getting rid of TOCs because that might make the single page views look very bad. When I put the transcludes from All_Chapters in the print version after &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; a TOC still shows up because &lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the Fundamentals chapter overrides &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the top of the print versions code. This doesn't really matter for registered users because we can turn off TOCs in preferences, but unregistered readers would get the TOC just before the Fundamentals chapter when reading it. Not a big issue but I couldn't really do anything else to help so I just decided to try and fix this. Please check this, sorry for any inconvenience, and hello again to you too =) [[User:Ikarsik|rawrawrer]] ([[User talk:Ikarsik|talk]]) 18:16, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

::Hummm I see, what you saw was the same that is present now ? only a link, this can be due to two things something was changes in the way transclusion works or some change was made and the server hasn't yet updated the output. Lets see if it takes more than 24h to update and if it does we should ask in the administration area why it stopped working.
::The previous, and what we want is the view of the all chapters with the inclusion of the license (needed to satisfy its requirements on the print version) also the top header removes some of the navigation schemes from the output (like TOCs) so it should solve the last part of your post above, even if it is shown when you view the print version, it will not be present (as the warning box), it will be removed.  
::Well let's wait and see if the trasnclusion is updated, if not then something was changed or some error exists on the page, I can swear that it worked as intended but not on this location the creation date of the page to recent (04:47, 5 November 2006) so I can't check if something was different or altered. I think what is happening is that since the page is generated form another transcluded page if any change is done down the chain it will have to be generated for the hole collection to work, since I recently moved some pages that maybe the reason also.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:17, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

::I've asked [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard]] to see if he reaches the same conclusion or knows of a feasible alternative.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:25, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

:::Ok, so it works now and [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] has removed all the forced TOCs from the pages, so no more TOC in the middle of the book. Thanks Mike! But this still has the code from All_Chapters being copied to the print versions code, so updating All_Chapters wont update the print version. Maybe if we transcluded the individual pages in All_Chapters instead of the chapters containing them, which transclude the pages anyway, the software would let us transclude All_Chapters.

== Hic ==
That last wording/logic correction made my skin crawl a lot more that normal because the previous edition was attributed to me. I take this chance to state that I only have the blame of not having noticed that before :) hic...&lt;br&gt;
Great work on  proofreading  it (I have asked several persons to take to that task but I've come to believe that most people doesn't read books cover to cover any more, at least technical books).&lt;br&gt;
I can have some blame on some crazy wording as my first language isn't English and I do some of the edits at weird hours, any way it's 11.01 a.m and I'm off to bed now, I just checked your last work and couldn't sleep without commenting on it :)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:05, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

:thankyou =). I'm just reading quickly through the intro part. I'll probably do better proofreading in the object oriented chapter, because I never bothered to learn any of that the first time I looked at c++, so it will all be new material. I'm not really worried about the spelling, as long as I can read it. I made a quick PDF file for fun for this book, I'll upload it later and put the tag on the TOC1 page. It's messy but I think some of the pages look pretty good, and adobe reader can generate the bookmarks for each section. [[User:Ikarsik|rawrawrer]] ([[User talk:Ikarsik|talk]]) 11:50, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

::I will move for the to removal TOC2, it always created problems, in navigation and the logical flow of the content. Most people don't use it and it has not been maintained. If that occurs it will restore TOC1 to the front page and restore  navigation (no fallback to the multiple toc page to resume reading). I don't know if that will also help the PDF navigation (I never created a PDF from a Wikibook). I prefer reading on the screen than on real paper. Did multiple TOC created any problem on the PDF?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:55, 18 April 2008 (UTC)
::The code highlight in off on the PDF. O solution to remove TODOs from the print version should also be studied and the green syntax label that I've been using on the C Standard Library has lost it's box rendering it very ugly, may it be a result of a skin change you made on Wikibooks ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:25, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

:::I noticed that, but just ignored it. I think it is caused by the way I created the PDF. I had never created a PDF from a wikibook either and so I just tested it by saving the print page as a html file then opening it in OpenOffice.org writer and doing some basic formatting then exporting it to PDF. I'm pretty sure the change in formatting is caused by the monobook.css and common.css styling rules being left out. I think this might just be firefox not saving the css files locally, or something, so maybe if I just add the styling rules in at the start of the saved html file it will all be good. Meh, I'll look at it later. I just wanted C++ Programming to look like it meant business with a PDF file and all.

:::But the removal of the protected page with links to all 3 TOCs will be great. There hasn't been any talk on that for a while now, so there shouldn't be any opposition (right?). [[User:Ikarsik|rawrawrer]] ([[User talk:Ikarsik|talk]]) 19:58, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

::::I can only hope. It has all been my fault, I did think having multiple structures of a single book could be great and the framework (Wikibooks) does permit it, the only problem was the navigational aspect (only one of the navigations could be dominant), before [[User:Darklama]] implemented TOC2 there was another TOC also (deprecated by lack of use) that fallowed the main TOC but implemented a distinct navigational and layout scheme. Problems arose because TOC2 did not fallow the structural integrity of the previous TOCs it shifted pages and chapters (TOC1 did try to comply with some of the new views to enable the changes and in the long run it did improve structurally). My main objection was that [[User:Darklama]] changes were made unilaterally and disregarding stated oposition (that lead to moving TOC2 to the front page), deletionist (removed content due to idea that the book should be smaller and more to the point as in stick only to the standard side not the practical aspects, most alterations have still to be verified)...). [[User:Darklama]] has now created a new C++ book that would enable him to express his vision. To be fair and transparent I will have inform him that I'll be pushing for the pages removal, lets see if he can live with the changes...&lt;br&gt;
::::As result that mess I'm also pushing for the prohibition of additional TOCs, see the conventions discussion page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:17, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a developing chapter of a wikibook entitled [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine|Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine]].

Magnetic resonance imaging ('''MRI''') is widely used to provide colocalization information for correlative applications with nuclear medicine images.  An introduction to this imaging method is provided in this chapter. We'll consider fundamental features to a depth sufficient to describe the contrast and spatial characteristics of MR image data so that spatial correspondence features with nuclear medicine data can be appreciated.  Since MRI is such a vast field, we'll limit our treatment to a description of essential features only and you should refer to the [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine#Bibliography|Bibliography]] for more comprehensive accounts.

We'll start with an overview of the imaging process and then describe magnetic resonance features of the simplest atomic nucleus known, i.e. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H. From there we'll describe phenomena which generate contrast in MR images and finish with a description of image formation using spatial encoding techniques.

== MR Imaging Process ==

In principle, MRI is quite a simple imaging technique, as illustrated in the animated graphic below.  A patient is first of all placed inside a large magnet - the poles of which are indicated by the N and S boxes in the figure.  Radio waves are then used to excite the nuclei of hydrogen atoms within the patient's body using an external coil and these are subsequently re-emitted by the patient in a manner which is characteristic of the NMR properties of the tissues involved. These radio waves are detected using an external coil, digitized, processed by a computer and displayed as tomographic slices revealing the distribution of different tissues.

&lt;center&gt;

The human body contains a substantial amount of [[W:Water|water]] and therefore has a large number of hydrogen nuclei distributed throughout its volume to generate NMR signals for imaging purposes.&lt;/small&gt;]]
|- 
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The imaging process is a bit more complex in practice, as indicated in the following figure:

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=0 cellspacing=4 cellpadding=4
| [[Image:mriProcess.gif|frame|center|Flow diagram for the MR imaging process.]]
| [[Image:mriScanner.gif|frame|center|Illustration of the principal components of MRI scanner. Tx and Rx refer to RF transmitter and receiver circuitry, respectively.  The gradient coils are used to establish gradients in the magnetic field generated by the magnet.]]
|- 
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The complexity arises from the use of gradient magnetic fields and sophisticated radio wave excitations so as to provide spatial localization information for the subsequent detection phase, and to isolate a particular NMR characteristic of interest.  One powerful feature of MRI is that the method can generate images depicting a number of different contrast characteristics.  Three such image types are shown as examples below:

[[Image:t1t2PD.jpg|frame|center|Three types of MR image: the T1 weighted image depicts relatively bright grey matter and dark CSF; the T2 weighted image highlights the CSF, while the PD weighted image shows little contrast between tissues.]]

The physics behind the production of these types of images is briefly described in this chapter.  We'll start with some insights into the nature of nucleons which we have not considered previously in this wikibook.

[[#top]]

== Nuclear Spin ==

Our [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Atomic_%26_Nuclear_Structure|earlier consideration]] of the atomic nucleus concentrated on its composition in terms of the mass, electrical charge and the relative number of its neutrons and protons - the intention being to introduce the phenomenon of radioactivity.  We neglected to mention, for the sake of simplicity, that nucleons can be considered to spin in space around a central axis.  We'll now concentrate on this spinning characteristic in order to introduce the phenomenon of [[W:Nuclear_magnetic_resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance]] ('''NMR'''), and we'll see later how images can be formed on this basis.

Let's take an isolated proton as an example - see the following figure:

[[Image:spinningProtonMagnet.gif|frame|center|A spinning proton produces a magnetic field similar to a bar magnet.]]

Besides having an electrical charge, the proton also spins on its axis.  Since this spinning constitutes a moving electrical charge (i.e. rotating around a central axis), a magnetic field is generated, as illustrated, similar to that generated by a bar magnet - but on a much smaller scale, of course.  This spinning magnet aligns itself with any external magnetic field, as shown.

There's an additional feature to this rotation, however, called &lt;b&gt;[[W:Precession|precession]]&lt;/b&gt;, which can be seen in many rotating objects, as illustrated by the spinning gyroscope below:

[[File:Gyroscope_precession.gif|frame|center|The precession of a gyroscope.]]

The rate of proton precession is what's important in NMR and has an [[W:Angular_frequency|angular frequency]] referred to as the [[W:Larmor_frequency|Larmor frequency]].  Its specified by the [[W:Gyromagnetic_ratio|gyromagnetic ratio]] of the nucleus in question and for hydrogen it has a value of 2.68x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; rad/s/T. This ratio implies a rate of 42.58 million precessions per second when a hydrogen nucleus is placed in a magnetic field of strength 1 [[W:Tesla_%28unit%29|Tesla]], i.e. rather higher than that for the precession shown in the animation above!

The following equation is of relevance here:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;f = γ B&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;f&lt;/font&gt; is the precessional frequency, &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;γ&lt;/font&gt; is the gyromagnetic ratio and &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is the strength of the magnetic field. This is a very important relationship in NMR and is exploited in numerous ways in MRI, as you will see below.

Clinical MRI scanners typically use field strengths between 0.1 and 3 T depending on the application.  The strength of the [[W:Earth%27s_magnetic_field|earth's magnetic field]] in comparison is about 50 μT, i.e. about 2,000 to 60,000 times smaller, while that of a magnetic door lock is about 0.1 T.

We've just considered the situation for an isolated proton in a magnetic field. An interesting phenomenon occurs when many billions of protons, in a sample of tissue for example, are placed in a magnet: 

:::&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;some of the protons line up in parallel with the field and some line up against it.&lt;/font&gt;

These two states are referred to as '''parallel''' and '''anti-parallel''' states, as illustrated in the following figure:

[[Image:paraAntiPara.gif|frame|center|The protons align themselves either parallel or anti-parallel to an external magnetic field, B&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. The parallel state is slightly lower in energy than the anti-parallel state.  Transitions from the lower energy to the higher energy state can occur if an exact amount of energy ΔE is supplied.]]

The above figure also indicates that the two alignments are equivalent to two quantum energy states separated by an energy difference, ΔE. More nuclei occupy the lower energy than the higher energy state, but their excess is incredibly small - less than 0.001%. Its enough, however, to exploit in NMR!

This energy difference is directly related to the precessional frequency through the following equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;ΔE = h f&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

where &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;h&lt;/font&gt; is Planck's Constant and &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;f&lt;/font&gt; is the precessional frequency, related to the Larmor frequency, &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;ω&lt;/font&gt;, through:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;ω = 2 π f&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

The important point here is that:

:::&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;transitions from the parallel to the anti-parallel state can be induced in the sample when it is excited with electromagnetic radiation of energy, ΔE.&lt;/font&gt;

This energy is about 1.75x10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; eV for a proton in a 1 T field, i.e. a tiny amount of energy compared with electron binding energies, for instance. Compared to a 140 keV gamma-ray emitted by &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc, its energy is over a million, million times smaller.

The energy difference is equivalent to the energy of electromagnetic radiation in the [[W:Radio_frequency|radio frequency]] ('''RF''') region of the [[W:Electromagnetic_spectrum|electromagnetic spectrum]], as illustrated below:

[[Image:NM3_11.gif|frame|center|The electromagnetic spectrum indicating regions exploited in nuclear medicine, radiology and MRI.]]

So, if we had a tissue sample placed in a magnetic field of 1 T and we beamed in radio waves at 42.58 MHz, we can expect to excite protons from the parallel to the anti-parallel state.  This phenomenon is the &lt;b&gt;''resonance''&lt;/b&gt; feature of NMR.

Its what happens following excitation that's exploited in MRI:

:::&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;transitions back to the parallel state occur spontaneously over a time period which is characteristic of individual tissues and their various pathological conditions.&lt;/font&gt;  

These transitions cause electromagnetic radiation to be emitted from our tissue sample whose amplitude decreases with time. The detected emissions form what is called a [[W:Free_induction_decay|Free Induction Decay]], as illustrated below:

[[Image:fid.gif|frame|center|A free induction decay characterized by a time constant, T2*.]]

Its the [[W:Time_constant|time constant]] of signal decays such as these which is determined in MRI and which can be encoded into MR images - once we've figured out where within the patient the signals have originated from.

[[#top]]

== Magnetic Sum Vector ==

Its useful before proceeding to consider the situation from a magnetic vector perspective, as illustrated in the following figure:

[[Image:magSumVector12.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of the cancelling effect feature of parallel and anti-parallel vectors.]]

The figure shows the situation for a hypothetical tissue sample placed in a magnetic field such that seven hydrogen nuclei are in the parallel state and five are in the anti-parallel state.  Five of the parallel vectors cancel the effects of the five anti-parallel vectors and we're left with a net condition of two parallel vectors.  We can simplify the situation further by considering the [[W:Vector_sum|summation of these two vectors]] to give us a magnetic sum vector along the Z-axis, as illustrated in the following diagram:

[[Image:magSumVector3_1.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of the magnetic sum vector, M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

Since the magnetic field direction is generally along the Z-axis in MRI, our magnetic sum vector is referred to as '''Longitudinal Magnetization'''.  As a result, a longitudinal magnetization becomes established when a patient is placed inside the magnet of an MRI scanner.

[[#top]]

== RF Excitation ==

Let's consider the situation once longitudinal magnetization has become established and when a pulse of RF radiation at the resonant frequency is beamed into our tissue sample, as illustrated in the following diagram:

[[Image:excitation1_1.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of RF excitation.]]

Two processes occur simultaneously during absorption of the radiant energy:

:*'''Reduction in M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''': Some of the protons resonate and move to the anti-parallel state, resulting in a reduction in the longitudinal magnetization, as illustrated below:

[[Image:excitation2_1.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of the reduction in M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; during RF excitation.]]

::Notice that our initial situation with five protons aligned parallel, which gives rise to a longitudinal magnetization, M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, of relatively large magnitude, changes to one where three are left with this alignment and two with the anti-parallel alignment.  The magnitude of M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced as a result.

:*'''Phase Coherence''': the vectors align with each other in phase, as illustrated below:

[[Image:excitation3_1.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of the establishment of transverse magnetization.]]

::The outcome of phase coherence is the establishment of a magnetic sum vector in the X-Y plane, called the '''Transverse Magnetization'''.

So, once longitudinal magnetization is established by placing a patient in the magnet of an MRI scanner and radio waves at the resonant frequency are generated, we in effect establish a transverse magnetization while reducing the longitudinal magnetization.  Its what happens next to these two magnetic sum vectors, M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, that's of interest in MRI.

[[#top]]

== RF Emission ==

We can consider the emission phase of the MR imaging process from both the longitudinal as well as the transverse magnetization perspectives.  Since the protons in our tissue sample have been excited by the  absorption of RF energy at the resonant frequency, the emission phase corresponds with what is called '''relaxation''' as protons return to their lower energy state.

* '''Longitudinal Relaxation'''

::The situation following excitation is illustrated in the top left panel of the following figure:

[[Image:longRelax.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of longitudinal relaxation.]]

::A hypothetical situation is shown where four protons are aligned parallel to the external magnetic field, and four excited protons are aligned anti-parallel. The magnetic sum vector is zero at this stage.  Excited protons then return progressively to their lower energy state, as shown by the other panels in the above figure.  The result is a re-establishment of the longitudinal magnetization, M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, as illustrated in the following figure:

[[Image:longRelaxCurve.gif|frame|center|A T1 curve.]]

::It is seen in this figure that the longitudinal magnetization becomes re-established in an exponential manner characterized by a time constant, called '''T1'''.

* '''Transverse Relaxation'''
::The situation following excitation is illustrated in the top left panel of the following figure, with phase coherence taken into account.  As a result, a transverse magnetization, M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; becomes established:

[[Image:transRelax.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of transverse relaxation.]]

::A hypothetical situation is illustrated where three protons are aligned parallel and three anti-parallel, in phase coherence wih each other.  The other panels in the figure illustrate a progressive loss of coherence that is characterized by this form of relaxation, where the transverse magnetization decreases to zero, as shown in the following figure:

[[Image:transRelaxCurve.gif|frame|center|A T2* curve.]]

::It is seen in this figure that the transverse magnetization decreases in an exponential manner characterized by a time constant, called '''T2*''' - also called ''T2 Star''.

In case you're wondering about phase coherence at this stage, a good analogy to think of is that of analogue time clocks in different parts of the world.  You may have seen such clocks on international TV news programmes showing the time in different parts of the world or in foreign exchange banks, for instance.  Dublin, Sydney, New York and Mumbai, for example, all have clocks which take 60 minutes for one revolution of the big pointer.  Their frequencies are identical, in other words. But they each show times separated by several hours because of their geographic location and daylight saving factors.  We can conclude that these clocks are out of phase with each other, even though their frequencies are the same. However, all clocks located in Sydney, for example, would have the same phase and we can say that they are in ''phase coherence''.  In a similar manner, phase coherence of proton precessions results during RF excitation in NMR and its the loss of this coherence which happens in transverse relaxation.

So, what do these two time constants, T1 and T2*, mean in terms of our tissue sample?

The protons which generate NMR signals are primarily those in cellular fluids and lipids, i.e. nuclei of hydrogen atoms that are relatively free to move within their environment. Hydrogen protons in tightly-bound environments such as within proteins or DNA, however, usually do not contribute to NMR signals and the same situation exists for those in solid structures such as bone.

We can first of all consider a water molecule moving through its environment within our tissue sample as a result of local chemical and physical forces.  The magnetic properties of its two hydrogen protons generate a small magnetic field of about 1 mT and the molecule's motion is therefore also influenced by the magnetic properties of other water molecules in its vicinity - and it in turn influences their motion. When excited protons are involved following RF excitation, it is interactions with their local environment which cause them to loose their excess energy and return to the lower energy state with the emission of RF radiation.  This can be considered to be the origin of the re-establishment of longitudinal magnetization during relaxation.  Chemistry calls this phenomenon '''spin-lattice relaxation''' - ''spin'' referring to the spinning proton and ''lattice'' to its local environment.

The rate at which molecules can move within their environment is related to their size and hence small molecules have a low probability for interaction.  This is why fluids such as CSF have long T1 values, for instance - see the table below. Medium-sized molecules (e.g. lipids), in contrast, move more slowly, have a greater probability for interaction as a result, and exhibit relatively short T1 values.

The T2* phenomenon results from the compounding effect of imperfections in the external magnetic field and from so-called '''spin-spin''' interactions. These latter are interactions where two nearby protons can cause each other to flip so that one changes from anti-parallel to parallel alignment, while the other changes from parallel to anti-parallel, i.e. one gains the excitation energy from the other. Phase coherence with other excited protons is lost during this exchange and the end result is a relaxation of the transverse magnetization.  This spin-spin interaction is also called T2 relaxation.  It tends to happen much more rapidly than T1 relaxation and T2 values are therefore generally less than T1 values, as shown in the following table:

|}
&lt;br&gt;

Since T2 arises mainly from neighbouring protons, a higher interaction probability exists with larger than with smaller molecules.  Macromolecular environments will therefore display shorter T2 values than water-based fluids, e.g. CSF.

A final point to note is that both T1 and T2 measurements from a small volume of tissue result from the integrated motional effects of all molecular species which contain hydrogen protons in that volume, be they those of small molecules, lipids or macromolecules.

== Inversion Recovery ==

A practical problem arises when we try to measure T1 because M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; exists within the Z-axis of the patient.  If we could flip the longitudinal magnetization vector into the XY plane, then T1 could be measured using external coils.  This is what the Inversion Recovery imaging technique is designed to do.

It involves a two stage excitation process, where an RF pulse of sufficient duration to excite all the lower energy protons is applied initially and this is followed by a second RF pulse after a time interval of duration sufficient for similar numbers of protons to exist in the two alignments.  The first stage is illustrated in the following figure:

[[Image:invRecov3.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of the application of a 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; RF pulse.]]

The RF pulse in this case is referred to as a 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; pulse since the longitudinal magnetization, M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, has been inverted during the excitation process.

Then a short time interval is used to allow some longitudinal relaxation to occur, as illustrated in the following figure:

[[Image:invRecov6_1.jpg|frame|center|Recovery of M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; following a 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; RF pulse in cases where T1 is long (left panel) and short (right panel).]]

Notice that M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; recovers relatively slowly when the T1 of the tissue in question is relatively long, and that it recovers quite quickly when T1 is short.  We can conclude that the extent of the recovery is related to T1.

A 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; RF pulse is then used to move M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; into the XY plane so that its amplitude can be measured, as shown in the next figure:

[[Image:invRecov8.jpg|frame|center|The recovered M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; is moved onto the XY plane using a 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; RF pulse.]]

The sequence of RF pulses is shown in the left panel of the figure below, separated by the time interval, TI, and the resultant Free Induction Decay (FID) is shown below it. The amplitude of the FID is dependent on the relative values of T1 and the time interval, TI. For instance, when the time interval is less than T1, the longitudinal magnetization can still be negative when the 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; is applied - as we saw in an earlier figure.  At the other extreme, when the time interval is much greater than T1, the longitudinal magnetization has sufficient time to fully recover and the amplitude of the FID is dependent primarily on the '''proton density'''. 

The figure in the right panel below shows the dependence of the longitudinal magnetization measured from the FIDs of grey matter and CSF against the time interval, TI.  It is seen that both substances generate a negative value of M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; when the time interval is short, as we might expect.  It is also seen that M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; increases in each case when the time interval is increased and a region is reached where the values are strongly dependent on T1. It is further seen that a large difference can exist between the measured values for our two substances in this region.  This feature gives rise to the generation of contrast between these two substances in T1-weighted images. Typically a time interval of 400 ms is used for such tissue discrimination.

[[Image:invRecov9.jpg|frame|center|The inversion recovery pulse sequence and resultant FID (left) and the dependence of M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; on the time interval, TI (right).]]

A final point to note is the proton density-weighting that results when long time intervals are used, with little tissue discrimination.  Typically an interval of 700 ms is used for such studies.

There are numerous other pulse sequences used besides Inversion Recovery in MRI.  These include:
:*Spin Echo
:*Saturation Recovery
:*Short TI IR (STIR)
:*Echo Planar Imaging
:*Small Angle Gradient Echo (SAGE).

The Spin Echo sequence, for instance, can be used to generate a T2-weighting in images.  You'll remember from earlier that an FID decays exponentially with a time constant, T2*. This parameter results from the combined effect of two phenomena:

:*static and oscillating magnetic fields induced by neighbouring protons (and unpaired [[W:Electron_spin_resonance|electrons]]!) which we've discussed earlier and which generate the T2 information;

:*small imperfections in the primary magnetic field, B&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, which are referred to as field inhomogeneities, and generate a time constant, T&lt;sub&gt;inh&lt;/sub&gt;.

These two time constants can be considered to add, such that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{T2^*} = \frac{1}{T2} + \frac{1}{T_{inh}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and the function of the Spin Echo pulse sequence is to disentangle this relationship to extract the T2 information.  Note that this pulse sequence can also be used to generate images with a T1 or a proton density weighting depending on various time intervals used in its pulse sequence.

The further treatment of Spin Echo and other pulse sequences is beyond the introductory level of this chapter and you are referred to the [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine#Bibliography|Bibliography]] for additional learning resources.  However, you're likely to find that the treatment above will provide a sufficient foundation for developing your understanding of these other pulse sequences.

== Spatial Localization of NMR Signals ==

Since we've seen above how contrast between tissues can be generated in MRI we're now in a position to consider how images are formed.  In other words, we'll consider how to localize the origin of the FIDs generated within the patient following RF excitation.

Its helpful to consider an analogy at this stage because this imaging situation is distinctly different to that encountered in nuclear medicine, radiography or sonography where the radiation travels in straight lines and imaging techniques based on emission, transmission and reflection can be readily conceptualized.  Its a little bit more difficult in MRI because the radiation is emitted in all directions simultaneously, so that there's little or no chance in knowing its origin from an FID measurement.  In other words, the FID only allows the amplitude, frequency and phase of the radio waves to be measured.

[[Image:pianoKeys.jpg|thumb|128px|right|A grand piano with a keyboard and scales overlaid.]]

The analogy we'll use is that of a [[W:Piano|piano]] keyboard and the playing thereof.  Let's imagine a concert pianist, for instance, on stage and playing the keyboard of a grand piano.  Notice that the pianist's fingers hit keys to the left of the keyboard in order to produce a relatively low frequency (i.e. low pitch) sound, keys on the right for high frequency notes and keys in the middle for intermediate frequencies. So, besides hearing the music produced while the pianist plays, we also receive information about where in space the pianist's fingers were located at any individual moment. In technical jargon we can say that we are using a method of spatial localization through frequency discrimination of audio signals to determine locations along the piano's keyboard.  This same approach can be applied in MRI using frequency discrimination techniques for the spatial localization of radio signals.

The 3D situation is of course a bit more complex than the 1D piano keyboard, but the principle is basically the same.  Frequency discrimination can be achieved by arranging for RF emissions from the patient to have slightly different frequencies depending on their origin. Furthermore, phase discrimination can also be applied so that the phase of the RF emissions can be related to locations within the patient.  The fidelity of the frequency and phase discrimination should of course be sufficient so that the corresponding voxels within the patient are sufficiently small enough for clinically-useful views of the anatomy to be generated.  Afterall, the fidelity of our frequency discrimination in the case of a piano keyboard is limited at an extreme by the width of the keys!

The magnetic field of the magnet in an MRI scanner is therefore supplemented by small fields introduced using gradient coils so that a linear gradient, for instance, in the field can be established. With such a gradient applied along the patient's Z-axis, we can expect the resonant frequency of hydrogen protons to be different for planes along this axis, as illustrated in the following figure:

[[Image:zGradient.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of the application of a linear gradient (in blue) in the magnetic field along a patient's Z-axis so that the resonant frequency can be related to planes along this axis.]]

Should we wish to excite a single slice along this axis, for instance, all we need to do is generate radio waves of the relevant frequency, as dictated by our earlier equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;f = γ B&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This approach is called '''slice selective excitation'''.  Both the strength of the gradient field and the [[W:Bandwidth|bandwidth]] of the RF pulse produced by the transmitter can influence the thickness of the selected slice as indicated in the following figure:

[[Image:sliceThickness.jpg|frame|center|Effect of gradient field (left) and bandwidth (right) on slice thickness.]]

We can see in the left panel above that increasing the gradient in the magnetic field from G&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; to G&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, for instance, decreases the slice thickness, ΔZ, when the bandwidth, Δf, is kept constant.  In comparison, we can see in the right panel that increasing the bandwidth of the RF pulse generated by the transmitter circuitry, from Δf&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; to Δf&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; for instance, increases the slice thickness.

It is important to note that the slice selection gradient is applied during the application of the RF excitation pulses. The protons in any given plane can then be made to resonate by changing the RF pulse centre frequency, f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, during the scan. 

The G&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; gradient and the RF bandwidth control the slice thickness and position in this manner.  Note that although the slice selection gradient has been described here in terms of the Z-axis, there is no reason in principle why any other directions cannot be chosen for the application of the gradient.  The slice selection is therefore not governed by mechanical considerations, as is the case in X-ray CT, SPECT and PET.

One method of tomographic imaging based on this approach is considered next.  Let's assume for simplicity that our patient can be represented by an elongated cube, as shown in the following figure:

[[Image:Tomographic imaging slice selection.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of slice selection during the RF excitation phase using a longitudinal magnetic field gradient.]]

Notice that our patient is placed in a magnet with a longitudinal gradient in the field, as illustrated by the blue line.  The field strength is relatively low, as a result, towards the left of our cube and relatively high towards the right. A central slice of the cube can be excited when an RF pulse of the appropriate frequency is applied.  Suppose the selected slice contains two features which generate FIDs, as indicated by the red and green objects.

The RF pulse is used to excite protons in this slice so that they all precess at the same frequency. A transverse gradient in the magnetic field is then applied during the emission phase, as illustrated in our next figure, so that the field strength is low, for instance, to the left of the selected slice and higher to the right of the slice.  Precessional frequencies will therefore increase, decrease or remain the same depending on their horizontal location across the slice. The emitted FIDs will therefore contain a range of frequencies which represent this horizontal location.

[[Image:tomo2.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of the application of a transverse gradient during the RF emission phase.]]

The frequency content of the FIDs can be unscambled by computing the one-dimensional [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Fourier_Methods#Fourier_Transform|Fourier transform]], as illustrated in the figure above, to derive the horizontal spatial locations of the emitters. The resultant Fourier spectrum constitutes one projection, somewhat similar to that acquired in X-ray computed tomography. The subsequent steps are to generate projections at different angles around the slice by repeating steps 1 and 2 in the above figure using different transverse gradients.  A series of projections can then result which can be processed using [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Nuclear_Medicine_Imaging_Systems#Emission_Tomography|Filtered Back Projection]] to form an image of the axial slice.

This method is rather slow for clinical application and numerous other methods have been devised. We've considered it here simply because its a good exercise in integrating many of the features that you've learnt about in this chapter and because of its relative simplicity.  Faster image acquisition times can be generated using the so-called Spin Warp method, for example. Here, a two-dimensional Fourier transform is applied using repeated slice selective excitations along with frequency-encoding gradients (as we've just described) as well as phase-encoding gradients during the emission phases.

== Back to the Nucleus ==

There are many other features of MRI that are beyond the scope of this chapter.  Issues such as safety in magnetic environments are of vital importance and features such as [[W:Magnetic_Resonance_Angiography|magnetic resonance angiography]] ('''MRA'''), [[W:Magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy#Magnetic_Resonance_Spectroscopy|magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] ('''MRS'''), [[W:Diffusion_MRI|Diffusion Tensor Imaging]] ('''DTI'''), [[W:Functional_MRI|functional MRI]] ('''fMRI'''), contrast media, image artefacts as well as [[W:Electromagnet|magnet design]], shielding and siting are fascinating to consider from a nuclear medicine perspective.

We'll conclude this chapter with an important basic feature which we didn't consider earlier in the interests of clarity. This brings us back to the nucleus and the topic of nuclear spin.  You'll appreciate that its not just the hydrogen proton that demonstrates the NMR phenomenon and that it can occur, at the least, in situations where the nucleus has an odd number of protons.  In other words, situations where there's an isolated proton which does not have a partner to pair with magnetically in its nucleus.

There's actually three types of nucleus where nuclear spin is concerned - those with:

::*'''Odd Mass Number''', i.e. nuclei with one unpaired nucleon;

::*'''Even Mass Number &amp; Even Atomic Number''', i.e. nuclei with no unpaired nucleons;

::*'''Even Mass Number &amp; Odd Atomic Number''', i.e. nuclei with two or more unpaired nucleons.

Examples of nuclei with a net nuclear spin are given in the following table:

| style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | &lt;center&gt;17.19
|}
&lt;br&gt;

Only &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H has found application in routine medical imaging because of the vast quantity of [[W:Body_water|water in the human body]].

thats it... please adapt and extend this description, since i'm not very experienced with ZK until now... --[[User:Oberinspector|Oberinspector]] 16:55, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

The easiest way to get code completion for me was just to copy this fragment into a new zul-file:
&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;zk xmlns=&quot;http://www.zkoss.org/2005/zul&quot;   
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; 
    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.zkoss.org/2005/zul zul.xsd &quot;&gt;
  &lt;/zk&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Thats enough for me and eclipse, Tom.

==Content==
It can be expected that the ZK tutorial is followed. So, the code completion fragment is redundant. 

What remains to be done? [[User:MrQuincle|MrQuincle]] 10:53, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Regular formation ==
This tense is formed in the following way:
* repeat the central vowel of the verb and put it in front of it
* lengthen the central vowel, if possible
* add the ending -'''ië''' (-'''ier''' in the plural)

So we find e.g.
:'''mat'''- &quot;eat&quot;  &amp;rarr; '''amátië'''
:'''tec'''- &quot;write&quot; &amp;rarr; '''etécië'''
:'''not'''- &quot;count&quot; &amp;rarr; '''onótië'''

The A-verbs and U-verbs lose their final vowel before adding -'''ië''':
:'''mapa'''- &quot;take&quot; &amp;rarr; '''amápië'''
:'''palu'''- &quot;spread&quot;  &amp;rarr; '''apálië'''

== Exceptional cases ==
=== verbs with long central syllable ===
Verbs with a central vowel that cannot be lengthened are divided into three types:
* When the stem ends in a consonant-cluster, we cannot lengthen the central vowel, but otherwise the basic rule is followed:
:'''menta'''- &quot;send&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ementië'''
:'''nasta'''- &quot;prick&quot; &amp;rarr; '''anastië'''
:'''nurru'''- &quot;grumble&quot; &amp;rarr; '''unurrië'''
* When the central vowel is long, we put a short version of this vowel in front of the stem:
:'''móta'''- &quot;labour&quot; &amp;rarr; '''omótië'''
* When the central vowel is a diphthong, we add the first vowel of the diphthong:
:'''hauta'''- &quot;stop&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ahautië'''
:'''poita'''- &quot;cleanse&quot; &amp;rarr; '''opoitië'''
:'''vaita'''- &quot;wrap&quot; &amp;rarr; '''avaitië'''
:'''suila'''- &quot;greet&quot; &amp;rarr; '''usuilië'''
:'''tiuta'''- &quot;fatten&quot; &amp;rarr; '''itiutië'''

=== verbs starting in a vowel ===
When the verb starts in a vowel, we don't add an extra vowel to the beginning of the stem:
:'''anta'''- &quot;give&quot; &amp;rarr; '''antië'''
:'''allu'''- &quot;wash&quot; &amp;rarr; '''allië'''
:'''ulqua'''- &quot;rend&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ulquië'''
:'''ita'''- &quot;sparkle&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ítië'''

=== verbs with a prefix ===
Some verbs are formed by placing a prefix before another verb, in this case we first form the perfect tense of the original verb and then we put the prefix again in front:
:'''enyal'''- &quot;recall&quot; &amp;rarr; '''en + ayálië''' &amp;rarr; '''enayálië'''

=== verbs on -'''ya''' ===
Verbs on -'''ya''' lose both these letters:
:'''hanya'''- &quot;understand&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ahánië'''
:'''tulya'''- &quot;lead&quot; &amp;rarr; '''utúlië'''


Some ancient verbs end on a diphtong followed by -'''tya''', they probably follow the same rule as the others:
:'''paitya'''- &quot;repay&quot; &amp;rarr; '''apaitië'''

Some verbs have a vowel before the ending -'''ya'''.
Possibly the perfect can be formed by the insertion of an -'''n'''- between the stem and the ending:
:'''aya'''- &quot;honour&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ánië'''
:'''laya'''- &quot;flourish&quot; &amp;rarr; '''alánië'''
:'''naya'''- &quot;grieve&quot; &amp;rarr; '''anánië'''
:'''paya'''- &quot;punish&quot; &amp;rarr; '''apánië'''
:'''vaya'''- &quot;enfold&quot; &amp;rarr; '''avánië'''
:'''oya'''- &quot;salve, rub&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ónië'''
:'''loya'''- &quot;be thirsty&quot; &amp;rarr; '''olónië'''
:'''séya'''- &quot;appear, seem&quot; &amp;rarr; '''esénië'''
:'''súya'''- &quot;breathe&quot; &amp;rarr; '''esúnië'''
:'''ahya'''- &quot;change&quot;: as is mentioned on the page about [[Quenya/Phonology]], the combination '''hy''' has to be seen as a unit, so the perfect tense is probably '''ahyánië'''

Some verbs can be conjugated by using an ancient stem and don't need an extra '''n''':
:'''feuya'''- &quot;abhor&quot; &amp;rarr; '''efévië''' (ancient stem ''phew'')
:'''mauya'''- &quot;compel&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ambávië''' (ancient stem ''mbaw'', see also below: historical influences)
:'''tiuya'''- &quot;swell&quot; &amp;rarr; '''itíwië''' (ancient stem ''tiw'')

The verb '''tuia'''- comes from the ancient stem ''tuy'', so the perfect tense would also need '''n''':
:'''tuia'''- &quot;sprout&quot; &amp;rarr; '''utúnië'''

== Historical influences on the perfect tense ==
Most likely certain verbs undergo historical influences.
The problem can be found in the prefixed vowel. Quite a few letters are allowed in the middle of a word but not in the beginning, so they have evolved differently in the perfect tense.

In most verbs there is no problem because they begin in a letter that is allowed in both places: '''tul'''- &quot;come&quot; has '''utúlië''' &quot;has come&quot; as perfect tense. In Old-Elvish this verb was ''tul'' and there is no problem here because '''t''' is allowed at the beginning of a word (note: the [[../Verbal forms|Passive infinitive]] shows the same irregularities as a prefixed '''a'''- has the same effect).

===Verbs in '''d'''===
Take now the Old-Elvish verbs '''''dant''''' &quot;fall&quot; and '''''dab''''' &quot;allow&quot;. The letter '''d''' is no longer a separate letter in Neo-Quenya, neither in the beginning nor in the middle of a word. In the evolution a '''d''' in the beginning of a word changed into an '''l''' and in the middle of a word it changed into '''r'''.

So these verbs evolved into the Quenya verbs '''lanta'''- &quot;fall&quot; and '''lav'''- &quot;allow&quot; (the '''b''' changed into '''v''' but here there is no problem as this letter never appears at the end of a word).

But in the perfect tense the '''d''' changed into '''r''':
:'''lanta'''- &quot;fall&quot; &amp;rarr; '''arantië'''

If we apply this to '''lav'''- we get a nice consequence: Old-Elvish also had a verb '''''lab''''' &quot;lick&quot;. In Quenya this verb also evolved into '''lav'''-, but their perfect tenses have remained different:
:'''lav'''- &quot;allow&quot; &amp;rarr; '''arávië'''
:'''lav'''- &quot;lick&quot; &amp;rarr; '''alávië'''

===Verbs in '''mb'''/'''nd'''/'''ng'''===
These verbs are however not the only ones, in Old-Elvish we had verbs that began with the consonant clusters '''mb'''-, '''nd'''- or '''ng'''-. In Quenya these are no longer allowed in the beginning of a word, but in the middle of words they are still allowed.

The verbs '''namba'''- &quot;hammer&quot; and '''núta'''- &quot;set (of sun and moon)&quot; have evolved from the Old-Elvish stems '''''ndam''''' and '''''ndú'''''. So in the perfect tense we find:
:'''namba'''- &quot;hammer&quot; &amp;rarr; '''andambië'''
:'''núta'''- &quot;set&quot; &amp;rarr; '''undútië'''

The next verbs had originally a stem beginning with '''mb'''-:  '''mar'''- &quot;dwell&quot; ('''''mbar'''''), '''manca'''- &quot;trade&quot; ('''''mbakh'''''), '''martya'''- &quot;destine&quot; ('''''mbarat''''') and '''masta'''- &quot;bake&quot; ('''''mbas'''''). So we find following perfect tenses:
:'''mar'''- &quot;dwell&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ambárië'''
:'''manca'''- &quot;trade&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ambancië'''
:'''martya'''- &quot;destine&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ambartië'''
:'''masta'''- &quot;bake&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ambastië'''

The verbs beginning with '''ng'''- can in Tengwar script still be recognized as they are even now written with the Tengwa '''ñoldo''' or '''ngoldo''' (Tengwa 19). In pronunciation there is no difference between '''ñoldo''' and the normal '''n''' ('''númen''').

At the moment we know two verbs in this category: '''nol'''- &quot;smell&quot; ('''''ngol''''') and '''nanda'''- &quot;harp&quot; ('''''nganad'''''):
:'''nol'''- &quot;smell&quot; &amp;rarr; '''ongólië'''
:'''nanda'''- &quot;harp&quot; &amp;rarr; '''angandië'''

===Verbs in '''h'''===
Verbs beginning with '''h'''- can show the same problems because this '''h''' can have evolved from both '''''kh'''''- and '''''sk'''''-. This last combination gives in Neo-Quenya the letter '''h''' at the beginning of a word and an '''x''' in the middle of a word.

Here we have following verbs: '''halya'''- &quot;hide&quot; ('''''skal'''''), '''harna'''- &quot;wound&quot; ('''''skar'''''), '''hat'''- &quot;split&quot; ('''''skat''''') and '''helta'''- &quot;undress&quot; ('''''skel''''') and following perfect tenses:
:'''halya'''- &quot;hide&quot; &amp;rarr; '''axálië'''
:'''harna'''- &quot;wound&quot; &amp;rarr; '''axarnië'''
:'''hat'''- &quot;split&quot; &amp;rarr; '''axátië'''
:'''helta'''- &quot;undress&quot; &amp;rarr; '''exeltië'''

When this starting '''h''' appears in the combinations '''hy'''-, '''hl'''- or '''hr'''- then we find following forms (at this moment no verbs in '''hr'''- are known):
:'''hyar'''- &quot;cleave&quot; &amp;rarr; '''aryárië'''
:'''hlar'''- &quot;hear&quot; &amp;rarr; '''allárië'''

In the combination '''hw'''- the changes are like these:
:'''hwesta'''- &quot;breathe&quot; &amp;rarr; '''eswestië'''
:'''hwinya'''- &quot;swirl&quot; &amp;rarr; '''iswínië'''

=== Verbs in '''s'''===
The final irregularity is found with verbs starting in '''s'''. This '''s''' can either be a pure '''s''' (Tengwa 29 '''silmë''') or have evolved from '''th''' (Tengwa 9 '''súlë''').

In Old-Elvish the pure '''s''' was the letter '''''z'''''. In the beginning of a word this '''''z''''' became '''s''', but in the middle it changed into '''r'''.

Words with '''súlë''' however are not influenced (they are still written with '''súlë''' even in modern Neo-Quenya Tengwar).

:'''salpa'''- &quot;sip&quot; &amp;rarr; '''aralpië'''
:'''ser'''- &quot;rest&quot; &amp;rarr; '''erérië'''
:'''sil'''- &quot;shine&quot; &amp;rarr; '''irílië'''
:'''sir'''- &quot;flow&quot; &amp;rarr; '''irírië'''
:'''suc'''- &quot;drink&quot; &amp;rarr; '''urúcië'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Atom==

The Greek Philosopher [[w:Democritus|Democritus]] believed that all matter was made up of small indivisible parts, which he called [[w:atom|atom]]s. The word atom comes from the Greek a, meaning not, or without, and tom, meaning to cut. Therefore, the word atom means: not cuttable. He theorised that if one cut a piece of cheese in half, then in half again, and again, and again, et cetera, one would be left with a piece too small to subdivide. This was his single atom.

We now know that an atom is the smallest part of something that retains its identity, although the atom itself can be subdivided. In other words, once we begin to look inside the atom, we can no longer tell which element the atom is.

The atom itself comprises a central [[w:nucleus|nucleus]], in which most of the mass is concentrated, with [[w:electron|electron]]s orbiting around the outside of this nucleus. This central nucleus consists of [[w:proton|proton]]s and [[w:neutron|neutron]]s. The properties of these three kinds of particle are given in the following table.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! Particle !! Relative Charge !! Relative Mass
|-
! Proton
| +1 || 1
|-
! Neutron
| 0 || 1
|-
! Electron
| -1 || 0 (Negligible, or approximately &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1836}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

In the neutral, or elemental atom there are equal numbers of protons and electrons. This causes the atom to have no overall charge.

==Atomic Number and Mass Number==

There are two useful pieces of information that we can glean from the nucleus of an atom. The first is its atomic number. This allows us to identify which element an atom is. The atomic number, usually denoted by the letter Z, is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is this which places an element in the periodic table.

The second is the mass number. This is equal to the number of protons, plus the number of neutrons (remember that electrons have negligible mass). It is given the symbol A.The number of neutrons in an atom, therefore, is equal to the mass number (A), minus the atomic number (Z)

==Isotopes==

Sometimes an atom's proton number will show that it is a particular element, and yet its mass number will be different to other atoms of that element. Atoms which have the same proton number, yet different mass numbers, are referred to as isotopes of the element. The difference in mass number is caused by the presence of extra, or fewer neutrons in the nucleus.

Since the number of protons (and, therefore, of electrons) is the same, the chemical properties of these materials are the same as those of the standard element. The physical properties (melting/boiling point etc.) DO change.

We usually refer to isotopes by the element name, followed by the mass number. For example, a carbon atom with a mass number of 12 (six protons, and six neutrons) is known as carbon-12. This is represented thus: &lt;math&gt;{}_6^{12}\!C&lt;/math&gt;

One of the most useful isotopes is carbon-14. This is the atom &lt;math&gt;{}_6^{14}\!C&lt;/math&gt;. It is radioactive, and can be used to determine the age of organic material as old as 60,000 years! Other isotopes are used in medicine as tracers, to determine the location of any blockages in the body.

==Mass Spectroscopy==



[[w:Mass_Spectroscopy|Mass Spectroscopy]] is a technique used to determine the relative abundance of various isotopes within a sample. It can be broken down into four stages.

1. '''Vaporisation and Ionisation'''
The sample to be analysed is introduced into a vacuum chamber. The sample is vaporised. This is essential if the following stages are to succeed. The vacuum is very important, since the electrons which are to be fired at the sample must have a &quot;clear run&quot;, so to speak. If they were not in a vacuum they would collide with air molecules.

The sample is now ionised. For this, an electron gun is used. This is, in essence, a device which fires high energy electrons into the sample. These electrons knock electrons in the sample out of orbit, ionising it. Particles in the sample are now positively charged, as shown below.

&lt;math&gt;X_{(g)} \to X_{(g)}^+ + e_{(g)}^-&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;He_{(g)} \to He_{(g)}^+ + e_{(g)}^-&lt;/math&gt;

These two equations show the first ionisation stage. It is possible, however, for an ion to become ionised by a second electron. This is unlikely, since the second ionisation is much higher than the first, and unlikely to be reached. This rare event is represented by this equation:

&lt;math&gt;X_{(g)}^+ \to X_{(g)}^{2+} + e_{(g)}^-&lt;/math&gt;

2. '''Acceleration'''

Since opposite electrical charges attract, we can move the particles using an electric field. The particles are positively charged (electrons have been removed) so we use negatively charged electrical plates to accelerate the particles down the machine.

3. '''Deflection'''

We now use an electromagnet to deflect the particles. As the particles accelerate through the magnetic field, they change direction. Particles with large mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios are deflected by small amounts, whereas particles with smaller mass-to-charge ratios are deflected by larger amounts. This separarates ions of different mass-to-charge ratios.

4. '''Detection'''

The various species in the sample are now separated. The particles accelerate into a detector plate. Since they are charged, upon hitting the plate a small electrical current is produced. This current is recorded. The relative strength of the magnetic field at the time of detection can be used to calculate the m/z value of the ions detected. This allows us to determine the constituent ions of the sample. It is not possible, however, to distinguish between ions of the same m/z value, since they will be equally deflected!  

This page gives more information on mass spectroscopy: http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/masspec/howitworks.html#top.

==Relative Masses==

The following two definitions are required to be learnt for module one, although they may appear esoteric at first.

===Relative Atomic Mass (&lt;math&gt;A_r&lt;/math&gt;)===

&lt;math&gt;A_r = \frac{\mbox{Mean Mass of One Atom} \times 12}{\mbox{Mass of One Atom of } {}_6^{12}\!C}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be calculated from the mass spectrum of a sample by multiplying each peak's m/z value by its relative abundance. This sum is then divided by the total relative abundance. This is shown below for the mass spectrum of boron, in which the two peaks represent &lt;math&gt;{}^{10}\!B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{}^{11}\!B&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

[[Image:Boron_Spectrum.png|200px|The mass spectrum of boron]] 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{(19.9 \times 10) + (80.1 \times 11)}{100} = 10.8&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be calculated from data in a table, as shown in this example for lead.

{| align=&quot;left&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! m/z !! Relative Abundance
|-
| 204 || 1.55
|-
| 206 || 23.6
|-
| 207 || 22.6
|-
| 208 || 52.3
|}
(It is important to note here that the relative abundances add up to 100.05, NOT 100.)

&lt;math&gt;\frac{(1.55 \times 204) + (23.6 \times 206) + (22.6 \times 207) + (52.3 \times 208)}{100.05} = 207.24&lt;/math&gt;

===Relative Molecular Mass (&lt;math&gt;M_r&lt;/math&gt;)===

&lt;math&gt;M_r = \frac{\mbox{Mean Mass of One Molecule} \times 12}{\mbox{Mass of One Atom of } {}_6^{12}\!C}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be calculated from a mass spectrum by taking the m/z value of the peak furthest to the right of the graph, as shown in this example for ammonia.

==Electronic Configuration==

At GCSE level, electrons are presented as point like entities that orbit around the nucleus of the atom, with the first orbital being able to hold two electrons, the second eight, and the third eighteen. We now know that this is not strictly accurate, and at A level a more sophisticated model is required.

We think of the electron orbitals as inhabiting a sub-level within a principal level.  Each sub-level is capable of containing orbitals of a single shape referenced by the letters s,p,d and f. The sub levels themselves are commonly referred to by the letter of the orbital type which they can contain. Instead of saying the 3rd sub level of principal level 4 you would say the d sub level of level 4.

In the table below you should be able to see that the third sub level (d) of principal level 3 can contain 5 orbitals of type d.  As each orbital can contain up to 2 electrons this means that this sub level can contain 10 electrons.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! Principal Level !! Sub-level !! Electrons
|-
!n=1
| → 1 type s orbital || 2
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;color:red&quot; | Maximum Electrons in level || style=&quot;color:red&quot; | 2
|-
!n=2
| → 1 type s orbital || 2
|-
!&amp;nbsp;
| → 3 type p orbitals || 6
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;color:red&quot; | Maximum Electrons in level || style=&quot;color:red&quot; | 8
|-
!n=3
| → 1 type s orbital || 2
|-
!&amp;nbsp;
| → 3 type p orbitals || 6
|-
!&amp;nbsp;
| → 5 type d orbitals || 10
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;color:red&quot; | Maximum Electrons in level || style=&quot;color:red&quot; | 18
|-
!n=4
| → 1 type s orbital || 2
|-
!&amp;nbsp;
| → 3 type p orbitals || 6
|-
!&amp;nbsp;
| → 5 type d orbitals || 10
|-
!&amp;nbsp;
| → 7 type f orbitals || 14
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;color:red&quot; | Maximum Electrons in level || style=&quot;color:red&quot; | 32
|}
As shown in the table, the maximum number of orbitals in each type of sub level is related to its type. An 's' sub level can contain only one orbital (2 electrons), a 'p' sub level con contain a maximum of 3 orbitals (6 electrons) ; a 'd' a maximum of 5 orbitals (10 electrons); and an 'f' a maximum of 7 (14 electrons).

The capacity of each principal level is the sum of the capacities of its sub levels. You should be able to see that the capacities of the principal levels equate to the more simple GCSE model of electron shells.

There are certain rules that it is necessary to know about the filling of these orbitals.
# The orbitals are filled in the order of the table, from top to bottom. This is in ascending order of energy; that is to say, each successive energy level (lower down the table) has higher energy than the previous level.
#Each orbital must be filled before electrons are put into the next orbital. An atom, for example, must '''always''' have two electrons in its 1s sub-energy level before any are placed into the 2s orbital.

For AQA A level chemistry you are required to be able to fill energy level diagrams to level 4s.

==Example==
{{pestcontrol|
| Cultural controls = Farmers often plant summer squashes successively either in flats or in situ, to ensure further production even after SVBs are present. Plantings are done every 2 to 4 weeks during the growing season.
:For vining varieties such as winter squashes, compost or soil can be hilled over the nodes to encourage further rooting.
| Resistant varieties = Some varieties of squash are less vulnerable to infestation from SVBs. If they have been a problem in the past, there likely will be a problem with future plantings.
| Trapping = 
| Physical removal =  The stems may be slit open with a knife to allow access to the borers. The cut section is then covered with soil or compost to encourage further rooting and prevent dehydration through the cut. Less destructively, but with less precision, the borer(s) can be pricked through the stem with a needle, wire, or toothpick.
:If plants are severely wilted, the best approach is simply to remove the plant. The borers should be destroyed before the plant is composted to prevent them from maturing.
| Barriers = Row covers can be used as a barrier to the adult moth before the plants start producing female flowers, but these must be removed to allow pollination. If planting successively, new plantings can be kept covered until they are large enough to produce heavy crops.
| Repellents = 
| Pesticides = Few pesticides are effective, because the borers are protected by the plant stem.
:*'''Nicotine Sulfate:''' Only effective against the adult moth
| Organic pesticides  = Few pesticides are effective, because the borers are protected by the plant stem. However, Bt can work if injected.
:*'''Bt injection''': The biocontrol Bt can be used against SVBs, but must be injected into the stem, as sprays will not penetrate to where the caterpillars are feeding inside the stem. This can be done using a syringe needle, or alternatively use a plastic syringe (such as is used for giving medicine to an infant). The Bt should be mixed to the highest concentration permitted on the label, as it will be diluted once injected by the plant's fluids. Using a large-gauge needle, inject the fluid through the holes left by the borers where frass is expelled. Sterilize the needle with alcohol when moving from plant to plant to avoid transmitting bacterial and/or viral infections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Garden pests often feed on plants other than just those being intentionally grown in gardens. Many weeds can act as alternate hosts for plant pests, so in order to control a serious infestation, it may be important to also either control the pests on the weed plants or simply remove the weed population.

The '''Pine Sawflies''' are a group of insects that eat the needles of various species of pine. They feed as larvae in large colonies. They are often mistaken for caterpillars, but like all sawflies they are actually closer relatives to wasps and bees rather than moths and butterflies.

Because of their colonial habit, they can cause severe damage to individual pine branches, completely stripping the foliage and leaving only unattractive branches. They tend not to eat the buds, however, so the branch tips usually leaf out afterwards.

==Description==
The larvae are generally greenish, found in large colonies. They &quot;rear up&quot; when a branch they are feeding on is disturbed, which is a defense mechanism that can scare off birds.

==Ecology==
Found on pines throughout the landscape, with some species being preferred over others. The adults are good fliers.

'''Slugs''' are gastropod molluscs without shells or with very small internal shells, in contrast to [[../Snails|snails]], which have a prominent coiled shell. The loss or reduction of the shell is a derived character, and the same basic body design has independently evolved several times, making slugs a [[w:polyphyletic|polyphyletic]] group. Although they undergo torsion (180 degree twisting of internal organs) during development, their bodies are streamlined and worm-like, and so show little external evidence of it. Slugs include both marine and terrestrial species. The soft, slimy bodies of slugs are prone to desiccation, so land-living slugs are confined to moist environments.

Some species of slug are notable garden pests, and can cause considerable damage to both leafy vegetables (especially the brassicas) and &quot;fruit vegetables&quot; such as [[../Tomato/]]es. There are various methods of controlling them.  Best results may be achieved by combining several of the methods mentioned below.

==Description==
[[Image:Slug parts.png|250px|right|Anatomy of a slug]]

Slugs macerate food using their [[w:radula|radula]], a rough, tongue-like organ with many tiny tooth-like denticles.

Like snails, slugs have two pairs of 'feelers' or ''tentacles'' on their head. The upper pair--''optical tentacles''--are light sensors; the lower pair provides the sense of smell. Both pairs are retractable and can be regrown if lost. On top of the slug, behind the head, is the saddle-shaped ''[[w:mantle (mollusc)|mantle]],'' and under this are the genital opening and anus. The mantle also has a hole, the  ''pneumostome,'' for respiration. The slug moves by rhythmic muscular action of its ''foot''.

Among the various species of land slug are the grey field slug, ''Deroceras reticulatus''; the garden slug ''Arion hortensis''; the leopard slug, ''Limax maximus''; and the banana slug, ''Ariolimax columbianus''.

==Ecology==
Most slugs eat leaves, fungus, and decaying vegetable material, but some are predators and most also eat carrion including dead of their own kind. Frogs, toads, snakes, hedgehogs, and some birds and beetles are natural slug predators. Slugs, when attacked, can contract their body, making themselves harder and more compact and thus more difficult for many animals to get a hold of. The unpleasant taste of the mucus is also a deterrent.

Slugs produce two types of mucus: one which is thin and watery, and another which is thick and sticky. Both are hygroscopic. The thin mucus is spread out from the centre of the foot to the edges. The thick mucus spreads out from front to back.

Mucus is very important to slugs as it helps them move around, and contains fibres which prevent the slug from sliding down vertical surfaces. Mucus also provides protection against predators and helps retain moisture. Some species use slime cords to lower themselves on to the ground, or suspend from them during copulation.

[[Image:Slug_tadiandamol.jpg|thumb|A slug from the [[w:Western_Ghats|Western Ghats]]]]

Slugs are hermaphroditic: having both female and male reproductive organs. Once a slug has located a mate they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruding genitalia. A few days later around 30 eggs are laid into a hole in the ground. Although some species hibernate underground during the winter in temperate climates, in other species, the adults die in the autumn.

A commonly seen practice among many slugs is apophallation, when one or both of the slugs chew off the other's penis. The penis of these species is curled like a cork-screw and often becomes entangled in their mate's genitalia in the process of exchanging sperm. Apophallation allows the slugs to separate themselves. Once the penis has been removed, the slug remains female for the rest of its life.

Various species of slug can also reproduce via tiny &quot;darts&quot; of sperm which they fling in the direction of their mate's genitalia.

==Host plants==

Slugs feed on a wide variety of garden plants, including strawberries and lettuce.

==Control==   
[[Image:SlugsKilledwithbeer.JPG|thumb|Slugs killed in a beer trap]]
{{pestcontrol|
| Cultural controls  = Mulch provides an ideal slug habitat so mulch lightly around plants that are attractive to slugs. 
:Water only in the morning so that the ground will dry by evening when slugs are naturally active. 
:Prune lower leaves or stake large plants to reduce potential hiding places for slugs and allow better air circulation which helps keep the soil surface drier
| Trapping    = Beer traps can be used early in the season, when the slugs' favoured foods are more scarce, as slugs are attracted to the smell of beer. Such traps have various designs, but essentially the slug will venture into a half buried jar, or cut away plastic bottle, containing a small amount of beer (not stout or lager), succumb to the fumes and drown.
| Physical removal   =  Night time patrols for hand collection can be useful. These can be augmented by regularly setting out traps such as boards, shingles, overturned flower pots, or grapefruit halves for slugs to hide under.
| Barriers   = Slugs have an aversion to copper. Copper pipe can be used and commercial slug rings are available. A 15cm length of plastic pipe with copper foil tape around it can be used to protect individual plants. 
| Repellents  = Grapefruit and other citrus rinds, used coffee grounds, eggshells, and sharp sand can be used in gardens around plants to repel slugs. 
:They also find dry surfaces difficult to cross since they must extrude a wet slime coat in order to move and this can eventually lead to dehydration, so leave cleared borders or walkways around plants.
| Pesticides  = Commercial slug pellets containing [[w:metaldehyde|metaldehyde]] or [[w:methiocarb|methiocarb]] are available, but are not approved for organic gardening as they can poison creatures at a later stage of the food chain.
:[[w:Aluminium sulfate|Aluminium sulfate]] can also be used; its proponents claim that it is less toxic to the environment. 
:Salt will kill slugs, but is also poisonous to plants.
| Organic pesticides  = [[w:Diatomaceous earth|Diatomaceous earth]] is a natural abrasive that can cause small cuts or scratches on slugs, causing them to dehydrate. 
:Bait pellets containing [[w:ferrous phosphate|iron phosphate]] are also used for this purpose.
:The mixture of 50% water with 50% ammonia will kill slugs instantly.  This can be applied using a hand spray bottle early in the morning or during a warm rain. 
| Alternate hosts  = Comfrey can be used as a decoy by placing the leaves around plants to protect them. The slugs will eat the comfrey and leave the protected plant alone. This is a honeypot approach, and rarely effective as it merely increases slug populations in the longer term unless comfrey is used as a trap crop and the slugs are controlled on it.
| Predators and parasites  = Frogs, toads, snakes, ground beetles, ducks, pigs, birds.
| Biocontrols  = A recent development in the control of slugs is the introduction of 'Nemaslug', a microscopic [[../Nematodes|nematode]] (''Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita'') that will seek out and parasitize slugs, reproduce inside them and kill them. The nematode is applied by watering onto moist soil, and gives protection for up to six weeks, though is mainly effective with small and young slugs under the soil surface. The nematode is only effective in warm, moist conditions, above about 20°C.

You want to conditionally display a group of elements based on the value selected from a list.  This will work similar to a &quot;switch/case&quot; but you can have each view depend on complex XPath expressions that will evaluated to either true or false.

== Screen Image ==

[[Image:XForms-bind-select1.jpg|frame|center|Using bind and select1 to conditionally display a group]]

In the screen image above, the second item is selected.  When a different item is selected,  the view under the select list changes.

== Sample Program ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Dynamically bind to a group&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;!-- Using bind and relevant in the model to conditionally display a group --&gt;
      &lt;!-- Alternative to switch/case/toggle when the id of toggle is dynamically calculated --&gt;
      &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
      @namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
      xf|group {
         border: solid black 2px;
         background-color: silver;
         height: 100px;
      }
      xf|group xf|label {
         position: relative;
         font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
         font-weight: bold;
         background-color: white;
         padding: 2px;
         top: -10px;
         left: 10px;
      }
      xf|group p {
         position: relative;
         top: -30px;
         padding: 5px;
      }
      &lt;/style&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;

         &lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;view-2&quot; relevant=&quot;../current-view = 'two'&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;view-3&quot; relevant=&quot;../current-view = 'three'&quot; /&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Two Two Two Two Two Two Two Two Two Two Two Two Two Two Two Two Two&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/xf:group&gt;

         &lt;/xf:group&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
This program is very similar to the example that uses a button to toggle a switch/case but the value is calculated dynamically by any XPath expression.  The prior example that uses switch/case/toggle uses an XML Event to make a specific case visible.

XForms provides an easy ways to swap between views.  This also shows how the XForms group and label can be used like the HTML fieldset and legend.

Cultural Controls are methods for garden pests, diseases, and weeds by altering the environment in a way that makes it an unsuitable habitat for the target organisms.

Controls include mulching or removing mulch, pruning to provide better air circulation, and companion planting.

Controls alter any one of the following:
*Air circulation
*Sunlight exposure
*Soil chemistry, content, texture, and structure
*Atmospheric and soil moisture

Biological control of pests and diseases is a method of controlling pests and diseases in agriculture that relies on natural predation rather than introduced chemicals.
==Overview==
[[Image:CabbagepestsRetouched.png|thumb|left|250px|Diagram illustrating the natural enemies of cabbage pests]]
A key belief of the organic gardener is that biodiversity furthers health. The more variety a landscape has, the more sustainable it is. The organic gardener therefore works to create a system where the insects that are sometimes called pests and the pathogens that cause diseases are not eradicated, but instead are kept at manageable levels by a complex system of checks and balances within a living and vibrant ecosystem. Contrary to more 'conventional' gardening practices which often use chemical methods to kill both useful and harmful garden life forms indiscriminately, this is a holistic approach that seeks to develop an understanding of the webs of interaction between the myriad of organisms that constitute the garden fauna and flora. The organic gardener will often hold the view for example that the eradication of the creatures that are often described as pests is not only not possible, but also undesirable, for without them the beneficial predatory and parasitic insects which depend upon them as food or hosts would not be able to survive.

In a healthy natural woodland where there is little direct human intervention, pest and disease organisms will always be present, but, unless there is a drastic environmental change, will normally kept in a state of equilibrium where they are not able to get out of hand to a level which is detrimental to the overall woodland community. This is the model for which the sensitive organic gardener will strive, but at the same time it is wise to recognise that there will often be some degree of intervention needed to manipulate the natural checks and balances to the gardener's favour, particularly if growing plants for food or ornament which would not normally occur in natural situations. Therefore biological control is about developing a range of techniques that use living organisms to maintain the beneficial equilibria in garden landscapes without causing adverse effects to humans or the wider environment. Of course, introducing exotic insects into any ecosystem entails taking risks of moving further from the intended equilibrium through unexpected interactions.

An important part of the biological gardening approach is to become familiar with the various life forms that inhabit the garden, predators as well as pests, and also their life cycles, patterns of feeding and the habitats that they prefer.

Insects have devised many ways to eat other insects. Predators will directly attack and devour their prey, whilst parasitoids will deposit an egg within another insects body, from which a larva will emerge which will devour the host's innards.

== Examples of predators ==

[[Image:Ladybird aphid 7462.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Ladybird larva eating wooly apple aphids]]

[[Image:Chrysopidae_3035.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lacewings are available from biocontrol dealers.]]
[[../Ladybugs/|ladybugs]], and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July, are voracious predators of [[../Aphids/|aphids]], and will also consume [[../Mites/|mites]], [[../Scale Insects/|scale insects]] and small [[../Caterpillars/|caterpillars]]. The ladybird is a very familiar beetle with red and black markings, whilst its larvae are initially small and spidery, growing up to 17 mm long. It has a tapering segmented grey/black body with orange/yellow markings [[nettle]]s in the garden and by leaving hollow stems and some plant debris over-winter so that they can hibernate over winter.

[[../Hoverflies/]] are another very welcome garden predator. Resembling slightly darker [[../Bees/|bees]] or [[../Wasps/|wasps]], they have characteristic hovering, darting flight patterns. There are over 100 species of hoverfly whose larvae principally feed upon greenfly, one larva devouring up to fifty a day, or 1000 in its lifetime. They also eat fruit tree spider mites and small caterpillars. Adults feed on nectar and pollen, which they require for egg production. Eggs are minute (1 mm), pale yellow white and laid singly near greenfly colonies. Larvae are 8-17 mm long, disguised to resemble bird droppings, they are legless and have no distinct head. Semi-transparent in a range of colours from green, white, brown and black.
 
Hoverflies can be encouraged by growing attractant flowers such as the poached egg plant ''([[../Limnanthes douglasii/]])'', [[../Tagetes|marigolds]] or phacelia throughout the growing season.

[[../Dragonflies/]] are important predators of mosquitoes, both in the water, where the dragonfly nyads eat mosquito larvae, and in the air, where adult dragonflies capture and eat adult mosquitoes. Community-wide mosquito control programs that spray adult mosquitoes also kill dragonflies, thus removing an important biocontrol agent, and can actually increase mosquito populations in the long term. 

Other useful garden predators include [[../Lacewings/|lacewings]], anthrocorid bugs, rove and ground beetles, aphid midge, [[../Centipedes/|centipedes]], [[../Predatory Mites/|predatory mites]], as well as megafauna such as frogs, toads, hedgehogs, slow-worms and birds. Cats and rat terriers kill field mice, rats, June bugs, and birds. Dogs chase away many types of pest animals. Dachshunds are bred specifically to fit inside tunnels underground to kill gophers and rabbits.

==Parasitic wasps==
A diverse range of wasps lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is then used as a food for developing wasps. [[../Parasitic Wasps/|Parasitic wasps]] take much longer than predators to consume their victims, for if the larvae were to eat too fast they would run out of food before they became adults. Such parasites are very useful in the organic garden, for they are very efficient hunters, always at work searching for pest invaders. As adults they require high energy fuel as they fly from place to place, and feed upon nectar, pollen and sap, therefore planting plenty of flowering plants, particularly buckwheat, umbellifers and composites will encourage their presence.

Three of the most important groups are;

*[[../Ichneumon Flies/]]: (5-10 mm). Prey mainly on [[../Caterpillars/|caterpillars]].
*[[../Braconid Wasps/]]: Tiny wasps (up to 5 mm) attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including greenfly. A common parasite of the cabbage white caterpillar- seen as clusters of sulphur yellow cocoons bursting from collapsed caterpillar skin.
*[[../Chalcid Wasps/]]: Among the smallest of insects (&lt;3 mm). Parasitize eggs/larvae of [[../Aphids/]], [[../Whiteflies]], cabbage caterpillars, [[../Scale Insects/]] and [[strawberry tortrix moth]].

==Plants to regulate insect pests==
Choosing a diverse range of plants for the garden can help to regulate pests in a variety of ways, including;

*Masking the crop plants from pests, depending on the proximity of the companion or intercrop.
*Producing olfactory inhibitors, odors that confuse and deter pests.
Acting as trap plants by providing an alluring food that entices pests away from crops.
*Serving as nursery plants, providing breeding grounds for beneficial insects.
*Providing an alternative habitat, usually in a form of a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or [[w:beetle bank]] where beneficial insects can live and reproduce. Nectar-rich plants that bloom for long periods are especially good, as many beneficials are nectivorous during the adult stage, but parasitic or predatory as larvae. A good example of this is the soldier beetle which is frequently found on flowers as an adult, but whose larvae eat aphids, caterpillars, grasshopper eggs, and other beetles.

The following are plants often used in vegetable gardens to deter insects &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.didgood.com/health/naturalpestcontrol.html |title=Notes on Natural Pest Control for an Organic Garden - DigGood.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Basil''' &amp;mdash; Repels flies and mosquitoes.
*'''Catnip''' &amp;mdash; Deters flea beetle.
*'''Garlic''' &amp;mdash; Deters Japanese beetle.
*'''Horseradish''' &amp;mdash; Deters potato bugs.
*'''Marigold''' &amp;mdash; The workhorse of pest deterrents. Discourages Mexian bean beetles, nematodes and others.
*'''Mint''' &amp;mdash; Deters white cabbage moth.
*'''Nasturium''' &amp;mdash; Deters aphids, squash bugs and striped pumpkin beetles.
*'''Pot Marigold''' &amp;mdash; Deters asparagus beetles, tomato worm, and general garden pests.
*'''Peppermint''' &amp;mdash; Repels the white cabbage butterfly.
*'''Rosemary''' &amp;mdash; Deters cabbage moth, bean beetles and carrot fly.
*'''Sage''' &amp;mdash; Deters cabbage moth and carrot fly.
*'''Southern Wood''' &amp;mdash; Deters cabbage moth.
*'''Summer Savory''' &amp;mdash; Deters bean beetles.
*'''Tansy''' &amp;mdash; Deters flying insects, Japanese beetles, striped cucumber beetles, squash bugs and ants.
*'''Thyme''' &amp;mdash; Deters cabbage worm.
*'''Wormwood''' &amp;mdash; Deters animals from garden.

==Directly introducing biological controls==
[[Image:Waspcycle.png|thumb|right|250px|Diagram illustrating the life cycles of Greenhouse whitefly and its parasitoid wasp Encarsia formosa]]

Most of the biological controls listed above depend on providing incentives in order to 'naturally' attract beneficial insects to the garden. However there are occasions when biological controls can be directly introduced. Common biocontrol agents include parasitoids, predators, pathogens or weed feeders. This is particularly appropriate in situations such as the greenhouse, a largely artificial environment, and are usually purchased by mail order. 

Some biocontrol agents that can be introduced include;
*''Encarsia formosa''. This is a small predatory chaclid wasp which is parasitical on whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection over a long period of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupates. It should be introduced as soon as possible after the first adult whitefly are seen. Should be used in conjunction with insecticidal soap.

*Red spider mite, another pest found in the greenhouse, can be controlled with the predatory mite ''Phytoseilus persimilis''. This is slightly larger than its prey and has an orange body. It develops from egg to adult twice as fast as the red spider mite and once established quickly overcomes infestation.

*A fairly recent development in the control of slugs is the introduction of 'Nemaslug', a microscopic nematode (''Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita'')  which will seek out and Parasitize slugs, reproducing inside them and killing them. The nematode is applied by watering onto moist soil, and gives protection for up to six weeks in optimum conditions, though is mainly effective with small and young slugs under the soil surface.

*A bacterial biological control which can be introduced in order to control butterfly caterpillars is ''Bacillus thuringiensis''. This available in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. The bacterial disease will kill the caterpillars, but leave other insects unharmed. There are strains of ''Bt'' that are effective against other insect larvae. ''Bt israelensis'' is effective against mosquito larvae and some midges.

*A biological control being developed for use in the treatment of plant disease is the fungus ''Trichoderma viride''. Trichoderma species are free - living fungi that are very common in root ecosystems. This has been used against Dutch Elm disease, and to treat the spread of fungal and bacterial growth on tree wounds. It may also have potential as a means of combating silver leafroo disease.

==Economics of biological pest control==
Biological control proves to be very successful economically, and even when the method has been less successful, it still produces a benefit-to-cost ratio of 11:1. One study has estimated that a successful biocontrol program returns £32 in benefits for each £1 invested in developing and implementing the program, i.e., a 32:1 benefit-to-cost ratio. The same study had shown that an average chemical pesticide program only returned profits in the ratio of 2.5:1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Warning|Lock picking, or being in possession of lock picks, may be a crime in some countries. See '''Legal Status''', below, for more information}}

This how-to guide describes the techniques of lock picking.

Lock picking is an essential skill for a locksmith. It can also be an interesting skill to learn and can be useful to the householder. Lock picking is the ideal way of opening a lock without the correct key, while not damaging the lock, allowing it to be rekeyed for later use. This is especially important with antique locks that would be impossible to replace if destructive entry methods were used.

Usually it is possible to bypass a lock without picking it. Most common locks can be quickly and easily opened using a drill, bolt cutters, or a hydraulic jack. The hasp, door, or fixture they are attached to can be cut or broken. But lock picking is more rewarding than brute force.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Legal Status===

This entire section is bogus and has no sources. Possession of a lockpick illegal in the U.S.? Well, then how do locksmiths legally possess them? Locksmithing doesn't require a license or background check. You can even get into it as a profession through home study correspondence courses.

Also, [[Crowbar_(tool)|crowbars]] aren't illegal in the U.S.! You can buy a crow bar at any hardware store. You can even buy them at Home Depot online! Just do a search and see! Crowbars are used for removing nails and opening windows. Nearly all household hammers include a mini crowbar on the opposite end of their head.

Possession of crowbars can be considered burglary tools just as much as a screwdriver or a hammer.  All one needs to do is find the intent of the person who is carrying them. IE, late at night dressed in dark clothing, suspect has prior history of burglary. 

Possession of lockpick sets in California is restricted to Public Safety Persons and Locksmiths. Locksmiths have a license to possess lickpick sets.  &lt;&lt;-- Untrue.  Possesion in California is completely legal, and I have corrected that section with relevant cites to the penal code. [[User:Cosmos7|Cosmos7]] 07:23, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

'''edit**NOTE: The laws stated below only state that it is illegal to break and enter using such tools, it only says it's illegal to use them for illegal purposes, not illegal to only possess them. And duh crowbars are not illegal, it states clearly, its only illegal to USE THEM FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES.  only illegal if you POSSESS THEM WITH INTENT TO COMIT AN ILLEGAL ACT. but for hobbies and personal use not breaking the law, its not illegal, there u go. some places lockpicks are illegal, you should although check for yourself if your province or state has declared this so before obtaining lockpicks.'''

===US State Laws===

Oregon law [http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/164.html ORS 164].125 states that if you possess a &quot;burglary tool&quot; or &quot;theft device&quot; with intent to commit forcible entry it is a class A misdemeanor.  &quot;Burglary tools&quot; includes lockpicks and crowbars as they are &quot;adapted or designed for committing or facilitating a forcible entry&quot;.  Simple possession is not a crime, you must have intent to commit a crime.

Arizona has a similar law, [http://www.azleg.state.az.us/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/13/01505.htm&amp;Title=13&amp;DocType=ARS ARS 13-1505] as does Texas [http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/cgi-bin/cqcgi?CQ_SESSION_KEY=WRASLFXKRHLW&amp;CQ_QUERY_HANDLE=124025&amp;CQ_CUR_DOCUMENT=2&amp;CQ_TLO_DOC_TEXT=YES   Texas Penal Code Title 4, 16.01].

I have not looked into other states. --[[User:Schwern|Schwern]] 12:12, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

Mississippi State Law on lock picking tools
Reference: http://198.187.128.12/mississippi/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=fs-main.htm&amp;2.0
 
 § 97-17-35. Burglary; possession of burglar's tools.
  
 It is unlawful for any person to have in his possession implements, tools, or instruments designed to aid in the commission of burglary, larceny or robbery; and on the conviction of any person thereof, he shall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding five (5) years, or in the county jail not exceeding one year. The carrying concealed about one's person, or in one's baggage, implements, tools, or instruments peculiarly adapted to aid in the commission of burglary, larceny or robbery, shall be prima facie evidence of intention to use them for such purpose.     
 
 Sources: Codes, 1892, § 997; Laws, 1906, § 1074; Hemingway's 1917, § 802; Laws, 1930, § 818; Laws, 1942, § 2044; Laws,  1956, ch. 246.

 Prima Facie - at first apperance, at first view, before investigation, plain or clear, self-evident, obvious

My interpretation of the last sentence is that simple possesion of a lock pick is illegal in the state of mississippi. Unfortunately, one can not do lock picking as a hobby in this state.

===Bump Keys===
Bumps keys is a larg security issue because of its simplicity and its high functionality, wich open certain type of locks without damaging them. The Open Organisation of Lockpickers (TOOOL) puplished a descriptive Paper on it already in 2005 (http://www.toool.nl/bumping.pdf) and additionally talks and videos on this specific technique to prevent [[Security through obscurity]], also describing locks that are &quot;Bump Proof&quot; and why.

With help of a video on youtube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WexoP5ZDWgg) and similar sites (newsweek, digg, ...) this Topic has become quite popular in these days and may have a effect finnaly in the puplic. Even when this is known for years by the industry. [[User:RobertSt|RobertSt]] 19:56, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

Here is an article from ALOA: [http://www.aloa.org/pdf/bumpkeys.pdf Bumpkeys.PDF.] [[User:Dan D. Ric|Dan D. Ric]] 21:57, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

:To quote a small section: &quot;Initially the individuals who promoted this information to the press may have been making what ALOA perceives as a mis-guided attempt at consumer awareness. They gave the impression that opening locks by Key Bumping was a wide-spread problem. It certainly has not been a method used by most burglars for many reasons. However, now that this method of opening some locks has become a popular theme, the most probable effect will be to stimulate the interest of would-be burglars to attempt to Bump Open locks!&quot; [http://www.aloa.org/pdf/bumpkeys.pdf Bumpkeys.PDF.] [[User:Dan D. Ric|Dan D. Ric]] 22:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

-Problems with bumping: To successfully bump a lock, you need to have a key that will fit the lock. With so many key designs out there, a person using bumping will need to have thousands of specially modified &quot;bump keys.&quot; It is quite easy to make locks unbumpable. If you put a ball bearing on the top of each pin, the ball bearing absorbs the shock and keeps the pins from staying at the sheer line. Companies like Medeco have already caught onto putting objects such as these into their locks to prevent this kind of thing. Finally, it damages the lock. The impact can dent the keyway, making it impossible to get the real key back in. This leaves a trace, making the problem of insurance companies not paying for &quot;no traces of burglary.&quot;

===Lock bypassing===
This is, strictly speaking, a lock bypass method, not a lock picking method. We should move it to an article on jimmying, if there ever is one. [[User:JosephBarillari|jdb &amp;#x274b;]] ([[User_talk:JosephBarillari|talk]]) 15:22, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Yes, there are many ways to open locks that aren't technically picking.  Personally, I think we might as well keep the page as-is for now (with disclaimers as necessary), since the current text is neither large nor complete.  [[User:Wyvern|Wyvern]] 12:15, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Car lock]]s===
Car locks can sometimes be opened by slipping a metal ruler that has had its end cut into a hook shape (a ''slim Jim''), down the front of a car window (in between the rubber). The ruler is manipulated until the lock cable is caught on the hook. Pulling the cable up will open the door. On modern cars, however, this technique could easily damage the electrical wiring that controls the door locks or windows, so &quot;slim jims&quot; are usually inserted from the passenger side, to avoid the large amounts of wiring that are installed on the driver's door.

==Tools==
Why doesn't the lockpicking page have a section on lockpicks and how they are used?  Is it just that nobody's gotten around to writing it up yet, or is there some objection to being more detailed?  I'm sure there are people on Wiki more experienced than myself in this, but I could take a shot at a light overview.  [[User:Wyvern|Wyvern]] 12:15, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Go for it. A light overview can always be edited later to fill in more detail. I can help with any diagrams if you like. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa Knott]] [[User talk:Theresa knott| (ask the rotten)]] 12:48, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Columbia? ==

Does this mean Washington, D.C.? If it does, we should link to the statute in question. (And who refers to the nation's capital as &quot;Columbia&quot;? Everyone I know calls it &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;D.C.&quot;, or &quot;The District&quot;, though the latter is used only by insufferables.) [[User:JosephBarillari|jdb &amp;#x274b;]] ([[User_talk:JosephBarillari|talk]]) 21:24, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
*Im pretty sure its refering to D.C., but i left it be since i am unsure
::Found a resource that does say &quot;District of Columbia&quot; on it as to the place it is illegal at, [https://www.totse.com/en/bad_ideas/locks_and_security/altlock.html here], on question three where it asks if it's legal to carry lock picks.  I'm going to edit the article to reflect that, and post the resource. [[User:ZekeDragon|Zeke]]

When there is a disagreement about what should or should not be in this wiki, it is useful to have a discussion about it.  So whoever deleted it is not being very helpful, so do not do it again. [From Trakgalvis]

== Picture ==

As far as i understood, the torque wrench applies torque to the cilinder as if it was a key ( meaning, try to rotate clockwise )
however, this is not described in the text, nor in the diagram. If I am indeed right, I can add another view to make the diagram clear ( and i suggest tha someone such do it in the text )

==Improvements==
Although i am generally impressed with the quality of Wikipedias pages, i cannot unfortunatly say the same about this one - the article is written in the same vein as the majority of most published material on the topic, containing some gross errors that i do not believe to be intentional and being heavily biased towards American terminolgy. Unfortunatly this disenfranchises a large section of your readership from comprehending the article.
As a lecturer in lock picking and locksmithing in both the government and public sector, i would be happy to contribute to this article, being of the mind that such information is essential for informed decision and to promote greater ingenuity on the part of manufacturers.
Unfortunately, as this is the first time i have entered this site, i have no idea how to proceed further.
Should anyone be interested in my proposition, i would appreciate your help.[[User:Jwsa|Jwsa]] 16:20, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Cuisine of India]]

'''Hyderabadi Biryani''' is a popular variety of [[cookbook:Biryani|Biryani]]. The Hyderabadi Biryani is so named as it is seen mainly in the city of Hyderabad, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. The blending of [[Cookbook:Mughlai cuisine|mughlai]] and [[Cookbook:Andhra cuisine|Andhra cuisine]]s in the kitchen of the Nizam (leader of the historical Hyderabad state), resulted in a dish called the Hyderabad Biryani. It, like other biryanis, is made using [[cookbook:Basmati rice|Basmati rice]] which is only found on the [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|Indian subcontinent]]. The [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spices]] and other ingredients remain the same, however the method of preparation involves more time. 

It is usually accompanied with [[cookbook:Dahi ki Chutney|Dahi ki Chutney]], [[cookbook:Raita|Raita]] (a yogurt dish) or [[cookbook:Mirchi ka Salan|Mirchi ka Salan]].

There are 2 styles of preparing this variety. The ''Katchi'' Biryani is prepared with the ''Katchi Yakhni'' method (with raw gravy).  The raw [[cookbook:meat|meat]] is marinated in [[cookbook:curd|curd]] and cooked only by the ''dum'', or the baking process, which is done with [[cookbook:rice|rice]]. This is a challenging process as it requires meticulously measured time and heat to avoid overcooking or undercooking the meat. In ''Pakki'' Biryani, where the meat is cooked with all the accompanying spices and then the rice is simmered with the resultant gravy redolent of mace, ''ittar'' and ''kewra'' in a sealed vessel with [[cookbook:saffron|saffron]] and [[cookbook:cardamom|cardamom]]. It is accompanied by side dishes like ''Mirchi ka Salan'', ''Dhansak'' and ''Bagara Baingan''.

The meat used in the preparation is usually [[cookbook:mutton|mutton]], [[cookbook:beef|beef]] - popularly called Kalyani Biryani - or, less frequently, [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]].

There is also a [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian]] version of the Hyderabadi Biryani in which the place of the meat is taken by a mixture of vegetables such as [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]], [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]] and [[cookbook:potato|potato]]. The vegetarian version is called 'tarkari' biryani. The Hyderabadi Biryani version of the mixed Vegetable Biryani is the &quot;''Tahiri''&quot;.

{{see also|Cookbook:Katchi Biryani}}

==Ingredients==
&lt;div style=&quot;column-count: 2; -moz-column-count: 2;&quot;&gt;
* 1 kg [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]] preferably in 16 pieces and a couple of drumsticks 
* 1 kg [[cookbook:Basmati rice|Basmati rice]] 
* 1 cup finely chopped [[cookbook:onion|onion]]s 
* 2 tsp [[cookbook:ginger|ginger]] and  [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]] paste
* 3 tsp [[cookbook:Chili Powder|chilli powder]]
* ½ tsp [[cookbook:turmeric|turmeric]]
* 100 g [[cookbook:cashew|cashew]] nuts
* 4 or 5 [[cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* 4 or 5 [[cookbook:Clove|cloves]] 
* 2 cm long [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]] sticks
* 6 to 10 green [[cookbook:Chili Pepper|chile]]s ground to paste
* 3 or 4 [[cookbook:cardamom|cardamom]] pods
* 1 or 2 tsp [[cookbook:cumin|cumin]]
* 2 cups [[cookbook:mint|mint]] leaves
* 1 cup [[cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]] (cilantro)
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander powder]]
* ½ tsp [[cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]] powder
* 1 cup [[cookbook:coconut milk|coconut milk]]
* 1 [[cookbook:lemon|lemon]]
* 1½ tsp [[cookbook:salt|salt]] (according to taste)
* 1 cup [[cookbook:ghee|ghee]] (clarified butter)
* ½ cup [[cookbook:yogurt|yogurt]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]], 
* 2 tsp dried [[cookbook:coconut|coconut]] powder, 
* few strands of [[cookbook:saffron|saffron]], 
* 2 cups finely sliced [[cookbook:onion|onion]]s, 
&lt;/div&gt;

==Procedure==

# Make deep incisions on the chicken flesh - deep enough for spices to get absorbed but making them too deep could render the pieces smaller. Mix turmeric, chilli powder, salt, garlic paste, yogurt, and half-lemon's juice. Thoroughly apply this paste onto the meat flesh and let marinate for an hour. 
# Heat about 100 ml of oil. Roast cumin, cloves, cinnamon, depodded cardamom, bay leaves, ½ spoon cumin, 1 spoon coriander powder, and finally add onions(2). Wait a couple of minutes to add mint leaves. When onions turn slight brown, add marinated chicken and cook for about 20-30 min. It should NOT be fully cooked at this stage; add garam masala and coconut powder and turn off flame when about ¾ cooked. Gravy should not be much, chicken pieces should look roasted.
# Meanwhile, while the chicken is still cooking, prepare the biryani rice. Slightly rinse 3 cups of basmati, and add water little less than the volume of the rice itself so that its only half cooked preferably in an electric cooker. Amount of water actually depends on kind of rice at hand and your experience helps to judge it. Also add 1-2 teaspoons of salt to it. Take a few semi-cooked grains of rice and colour them with diluted saffron for garnishing.
# You will need a utensil of about 12&quot; (300 mm) base. Place about half of semi-cooked rice in it. Next, layer half of chicken on it again topped by a layer of rice (half of the remaining). One more layer of remaining chicken, finally with layer of rest of the rice on top ends the rice-chicken layering stage.
# Heat oil and deep fry half the sliced onions to golden brown. Similarly fry cashew. Garnish the top layer with these two along with 100 ml ghee, coconut milk, saffron rice grains and coriander. Lid the vessel and try making it airtight (but no pressure should build up). Put on high flame for 5 min before reducing it to low flame. The flame should NOT be at the vessel's centre, but on one side of it. Wait for 2-3 min and turn the vessel to heat other next part on its circumference. This way, keep rotating the vessel every 2-3 min for about 20 min. Every time you turn it, carefully disturb the contents by a shake/jerk so as to avoid settling of ghee at the bottom.
# Put off the flame and wait for about 10 min before opening. Before serving, mix the medley from the bottom. Serve with boiled egg halves. Enjoy. Rightly and carefully made, its an epicure's paradise.

I '''cannot''' agree with ''&quot;It is generally a good idea to let contributors to a book decide whether external links are inappropriate or not and to assume good faith.&quot;''  '''NO''' spammer is going to tell you that their links are spam and inappropriate.  The Spam Project on Wp would frequent mention the fact that the stronger the objection to deletion the more likely it was to be spam.  Some regime here will '''have''' to decide what is acceptable to Wikibooks or be overwhelmed --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 22:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:Equally the bit under &quot;External links&quot;.  Going to bed now - will return &amp; probably be unpopular in the morning --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 22:33, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:The wording probably isn't the best. It relies on their being more then one contributor to overwhelm any attempt of a spammer to spam a book and claim its anything but what it is. Wikibooks isn't Wikipedia what works there won't necessarly work here. Wikipedia is like a single book in terms of how Wikibooks works. Someone who knows something about the book subject is more qualified to know what is and isn't spam then a user who knows nothing about the subject. I could probablly add something about checking the user's contributions to see if they have done the same to other books on a wide variety of subjects, which may give a clue as to whether its spam or not. I'm not trying to define spam here. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 02:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

=Morphy Defence=
The last two moves ...a6 and Ba4 have made no substantial change to the position, therefore Black's options are much the same as they were on his previous move, although they are now known as deferred defences. 

[[/4...Nf6|4...Nf6]] is the most often played move and is referred to as the main line (rather than the Berlin Deferred). It attacks White's currently undefended e-pawn and helps prepare kingside castling.

[[/4...d6|4...d6]] is the Steinitz Deferred. Much more popular than the true Steinitz Defence, it cuts out any threats to the e-pawn and reserves the option of an f5 push.

This book will need editing, images and content from a wider range of sources. Also get rid of unnecessary sections and put separate sections on separate pages. I can't work on this any more atm, sry.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A special kind of infection that must be guarded against in case of animal bites is rabies  (sometimes called “hydrophobia”).  This disease is caused by a virus that is present in the saliva of infected animals. The disease occurs most commonly in wild animals, but it has been found in domestic animals and household pets. In fact, it is probable that all mammals are susceptible to it.   The virus that causes rabies is ordinarily transmitted by a bite,   but it can be transmitted by the saliva of an infected animal coming in contact with a fresh wound or with the thin mucous membrane of the lips or nose.  The virus does not penetrate normal unbroken skin.  If the skin is broken, '''DO NOT''' attempt wound closure. 

If rabies develops in man, it is usually fatal.  A preventive treatment is available and it  is very effective, but only if it is started shortly after the bite.  Since the vaccine can be obtained only at a medical treatment facility, any person bitten by an animal must be transferred quickly to the nearest treatment facility for evaluation, along with a complete report of the circumstances surrounding the incident. Remember, prevention is of utmost importance. Immediate local treatment of the wound should be given.  Wash the wound and the surrounding area carefully, using sterile gauze, soap, and sterile water. Use sterile gauze to dry the wound, and then cover the wound  with a sterile dressing. '''DO NOT''' use any chemical disinfectant.  All of the animal’s saliva must be removed from the victim’s skin to prevent further contamination of the wound.  '''CAUTION: DO NOT''' allow the animal’s saliva to come in contact with open sores or cuts on your hands. When a person has been bitten by an animal, every effort must be made to catch the animal and to keep it confined for a minimum of 8 to 10 days.  '''DO NOT''' kill it if there is any possible chance of catching it alive.  The symptoms of rabies are not always present in the animal at the time the bite occurs, but the saliva may nevertheless contain the rabies virus.   It is essential, therefore, that the animal is kept under observation until a diagnosis can be made.  The rabies treatment is given if the animal develops any definite symptoms, if it  dies  during  the  observation  period,  or  if  for  any reason the animal cannot be kept under observation. Remember that any animal bite is dangerous and '''MUST''' be evaluated at a treatment facility.

='''Using a PDA for Automatically Updated Text and Audio Input'''=
by Gary Cziko

For the past year or so I have been using a Palm PDA as a portable source of automatically updated text and podcast audio in French, Spanish, German and Portuguese. This allows me to hear and read the latest news in these languages, as well as articles and programs about science, technology and culture wherever I may be.  The content is updated when I re-synch my PDA with my desktop or laptop computer.

==Hardware==
I use a Palm Tungsten T5 PDA as my PDA. To allow additional memory for audio files, I have added a 1 GB SD memory card.

The synching computer is any one of a number of desktop and laptop computers on which I have installed AvantGo software. Any Windows computer connected to the Internet can be used for adding audio podcasts to the PDA.

==Software==
For text, AvantGo is used. This free software and service allows me to set up an account and select &quot;channels&quot; to be updated each time I synch my PDA.

For audio, I use the free MyPodder software (Windows only) provided by podcastready. Unlike iTunes (the most widely used software for subscribing to and downloading podcasts), Podcastready stores its program and audio files (downloaded podcasts) on your portable digital device only and does not use any program on your PC or store any podcasts there. This means that a person (for example, a student) could use any Windows connected to the Internet to check for new podcasts and download them to your PDA or other digital media player.

==Texts resources==
The texts I use (AvantGo channels) are the following:
*French
**Canada
***Ici Radio-Canada.ca &quot;Nouvelles en français par Radio-Canada.ca: actualité nationale, internationale, économique, technologique, sportive, météo et détente.
**France
***Le Monde interactif - actualités 
*German
**Germany
***SPIEGEL ONLINE 
*Portuguese
**Europe
***Euro News 
**Germany
***Deutsche Welle - DW-WORLD-DE Português 
*Spanish
**United Kingdom
***BBC Mundo 

==Audio resources==
The audio (podcasts downloaded via MyPodder) I listen to most are:
*French
**Canada
***Les années lumières (weekly):
**France
***France Info-Info santé:
***France Info-Info sciences:
***France Info-Savoir être:
***RFI - L'école des savoirs:
*German
**Germany
***Langsam gesprochenen Nachrichten (daily): 
***Tagesschau Podcast (daily): 
*Portuguese
**Brazil
***PodBrasil
*Spanish
**Netherlands
***La Ronda Informativa (weekly):
***La Matinal (daily): 
**Spain
***REE Hispanorama (weekly):
**USA
***Democracy Now!: Titulares en español (daily):
***Nuevos Horizontes (weekly):

==Needs and problems==
I have yet to find an audio podcast with matching transcript available as a AvantGo channel. Doing so would allow me to both listen and read to the same material using my PDA.

There is no way to control the speed of audio using my PDA, nor can I easily jump back a constant number of seconds to easily re-listen to what I have just heard.

==Conclusions==
Using my PDA to obtain and present updated foreign-language texts and audio has been the single most important tool in my foreign-language learning. No matter where I am or what time of day or night it may be, I always have current, interesting material to read and programs to listen to in French, Spanish, German and Portuguese. This is helping me to maintain my French, improve my Spanish, revive my neglected German and learn Portuguese.

== Discrete-Time Stability ==

The stability analysis of a discrete-time or digital system is similar to the analysis for a continuous time system. However, there are enough differences that it warrants a separate chapter.

== Input-Output Stability ==

=== Uniform Stability ===

An LTI causal system is uniformly BIBO stable if there exists a positive constant L such that the following conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;x[n_0] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\|u[n]\| \le k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

imply that

:&lt;math&gt; \|y[n]\| \le L&lt;/math&gt;

=== Impulse Response Matrix ===

We can define the '''impulse response matrix''' of a discrete-time system as:

{{eqn|Impulse Response Matrix}}
:&lt;math&gt;G[n] = \left\{\begin{matrix}CA^{k-1}B &amp; \mbox{ if } k &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{ if } k \le 0\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in the general time-varying case:

:&lt;math&gt;G[n] = \left\{\begin{matrix}C\phi[n, n_0]B &amp; \mbox{ if } k &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{ if } k \le 0\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

A digital system is BIBO stable if and only if there exists a positive constant ''L'' such that for all non-negative ''k'':

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 0}^{k}\|G[n]\| \le L&lt;/math&gt;

== Stability of Transfer Function ==

A MIMO discrete-time system is BIBO stable if and only if every pole of every transfer function in the transfer function matrix has a magnitude less than 1. All poles of all transfer functions must exist inside the unit circle on the Z plane.

== Lyapunov Stability ==

There is a discrete version of the Lyapunov stability theorem that applies to digital systems. Given the '''discrete Lyapunov equation''':

{{eqn|Digital Lypapunov Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;A^TMA - M = -N&lt;/math&gt;

We can use this version of the Lyapunov equation to define a condition for stability in discrete-time systems:

{{TextBox|1=
;Lyapunov Stability Theorem (Digital Systems):A digital system with the system matrix A is asymptotically stable if and only if there exists a unique matrix M that satisfies the Lyapunov Equation for every positive definite matrix N.}}

== Poles and Eigenvalues ==

Every pole of G(z)  is an eigenvalue of the system matrix A. Not every eigenvalue of A is a pole of G(z). Like the poles of the transfer function, all the eigenvalues of the system matrix must have magnitudes less than 1. Mathematically:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\operatorname{Re}(z)^2 + \operatorname{Im}(z)^2} \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

If the magnitude of the eigenvalues  of the system matrix A, or the poles of the transfer functions are greater than 1, the system is unstable.

== Finite Wordlengths ==

Digital computer systems have an inherent problem because implementable computer systems have finite wordlengths to deal with. Some of the issues are:

#Real numbers can only be represented with a finite precision. Typically, a computer system can only accurately represent a number to a finite number of decimal points.
#Because of the fact above, computer systems with feedback can compound errors with each program iteration. Small errors in one step of an algorithm can lead to large errors later in the program.
#Integer numbers in computer systems have finite lengths. Because of this, integer numbers will either '''roll-over''', or '''saturate''', depending on the design of the computer system. Both situations can create inaccurate results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Be Bold==
The Wikijunior community encourages users to be bold in updating articles. Wikis develop faster when people fix problems, correct grammar, add facts, improve the style, and so on. We want everyone to be bold: it's okay. 

Also, of course, others here will edit what you write. Don't take it personally. They, like all of us, just want to make Wikijunior as good as it can possibly be.

Please, if you can contribute to this book, do so.  Many sections are in need of cleanup and complete rewrites. You can work on almost anything including this page, but if you want to make some significant changes please bring them up [[Wikijunior talk:Ancient Civilizations|on the discussion page]].  New articles about additional Ancient Civilizations are welcome; see the section [[#Create or request an article|Create or request an article]].

==Guidelines==
When working on this project, remember that it's aimed at children between the ages of 8 and 12. 

Try to restrict discussion to the main discussion page so that people can actually see your message without having to check specific pages.

For more information about how to write excellent articles for Wikijunior see the [[Wikijunior:Style Guide|Style Guide]].

==Create or request an article==
You are encouraged to create an article on an interesting Ancient Civilization. Note however that not all articles will make it into the final published version, though they will all be available on this live online version. If you would like someone else to write a page about an Ancient Civilization, add your suggestion to the ''Article Stubs'' list. When creating stub articles please use the [[../Stub Template/]].

==Major Questions==
The questions that will appear in every article are:

#What country did they live in?
#What did their buildings look like?
#What did they eat?
#What did they wear?
#What did their writing look like?
#What did they believe?
#'''What is their History?''' 
#Are some of them famous even today?
#What is left of them today?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The term 'Indian music' spans a multitude of forms and styles, from tribal and folk traditions to intellectual classical structures and electronic-enhanced modern dance tracks. Of course, the distinctions between the forms are often slippery. It is not uncommon, for example, for 'filmi' composers to employ folk, religious, regional or classical elements into their songs to enhance the mood and relevance to the story. Likewise, classical music has absorbed and transformed folk elements while the rural traditions themselves have always been influenced by wider regional and international musics. As with literature, dance and the visual arts, Indian music is a complex interweaving of influences and ideas.

==Periods and Styles==

===Ancient===
Literary evidence points to the existence of codified musical traditions in early times. Classical Tamil poetry from South India was composed by itinerant and court-settled musicians and accompanied by instruments such as the harp, barrel-drum and flute. Set scales, known as pans, provided a framework for the singers and musicians. The pans were tuned to the strings of the harp. The 7th century epic ''Silappadikkaram'' features music and dance from this formal tradition as well as current folk and tribal styles. 

While much of the ancient Tamil tradition has been lost, there is speculation that some of the pans referred to in the literature made their way into the Carnatic tradition. In addition, the specialist temple singers of the Meenakshi temple in Madurai still include some songs set to pans (rather than ragams) in their repetoire.

===Classical===
The classical tradition of Indian music can be divided into two major movements, Hindustani and Carnatic.

&lt;Font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;All through history, people have been finding the shapes of creatures in the rocks.

&lt;Font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;We call them '''fossils'''. They are mostly very different from the creatures alive today.

&lt;Font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;People have had different ideas about what they were.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There's still a ton that needs to be done here! It's a topic that really merits a whole new WikiBook, in my opinion, but let's do this first. Can anyone grab some information about music referenced in old Sanskrit sources like Kalidasa or Valmiki? I don't have access to my books right now, and won't for another year or two. I'll see if I can pull together a section on music in the Vedas, but if anyone else wants to do it before me... Anyone familiar with Carnatic and Hindustani music is more than welcome to lend a hand with those bits. The rest is up to you! (--[[User:MeenSuup|MeenSuup]] 08:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC))</text>

1 meen, head and guts removed;
3 tomatoes, chopped;
2 limes;
1&quot; piece ginger;
.5&quot; piece galangal;
Water, sugar and salt to taste

Boil everything, then fling out the window. It probably wouldn't taste very good anyway.

      <comment>/* Neurotransmitter */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The physical structure of the body plays an important role in the behavior of an individual.  The most important physical structure for psychologists is the nervous system.
The nervous system carries orders from the brain and spinal cord to various glands and muscles, it also carries signals from stimuli receptors to the spinal cord and brain.
If you wanted to blink your eye a signal would be created in the brain, then it would be transported by neurons to the muscle controlling the eyelid.

==Neurons==

The base of the nervous system is the [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Neuron|neuron]].  
Neurons are cells that are specialized for communicating information.
They are the basic tissue and element of the nervous system.

Neurons have a basic structure of:
* One ''cell body''
* One ''axon''
* One or more ''dendrites''

The '''[[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Cell_body|cell body]]''' (or soma) is the bulbous end of a neuron, containing the cell nucleus.
The soma makes use of nutrients to supply energy for neuronal activity.

'''[[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Axon|Axons]]''' are [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Organelle|organelles]] that carry information away from the cell body.
Axons may be as small as several microns or as long as several meters in giraffes and whales.
The axons main job is to send a signal to the dendrites of another neuron, but some say that they may also receive signals in certain situations.
Each neuron has only one axon, but the axon may have branches with what are called terminal buttons at its end.

'''[[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Dendrite|Dendrites]]''' are organelles that sense the neurotransmitter secreted by the axon of another neuron.
Most neurons have more than one dendrite.
Dendrites and axons do not directly touch each other; there is a gap, called a [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Synapse|synapse]].

==The Transmission of the Signal==

The transmission of the signal is basically the same in all cells, the signal is sent across the synapse by the axon and the dendrite of the next cell picks up the signal.

===Synapse===

The [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Synapse|synapse]] is a gap between two cells.
Synapse are one way junctions between neurons and other cells.
The neurotransmitter is emitted from the axon of one cell and usually goes to the dendrite of the next cell.
Sometimes the signal goes to the soma or the axon of the next cell instead of the dendrite (Arnold Wittig 2001).

===[[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Neurotransmitter|Neurotransmitter]]===

The terminal button at the end of the axon holds the [[v:|synaptic vesicles]].
When the signal reaches the end of the axon the vesicles discharge  a chemical called a neurotransmitter. 
Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are used to relay, amplify and modulate electrical signals between a neuron and another cell.
There are approximately 40 to 60 different chemicals that are used as neurotransmitters.
The neurotransmitters from the axon fit into receptors of the dendrite on the next neuron.
They will then either ''excite'' the cell and make it fire or ''inhibit'' it and stop it from doing so.
The sum of the excitation and inhibition of the neuron is called the [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Grade_potential|graded potential]].
If the graded potential is greater than that cell's threshold then the cell fires, sending the message to the next cell.
Goto [[w:Neurotransmitter#Types_of_neurotransmitters|Here]] to see a list of some neurotransmitters.

===Resting Potential===

When the cell hasn't fired for a certain amount of time it is considered at its resting potential.
The resting potential of a neuron is approx. -70 mV because the membrane surrounding the cell lets in positive potassium ions (K+) and negative chloride ions (Cl-) and keeps out positive sodium ions (Na+).
It is easier to fire a cell that is at its resting potential than one that is in the refractory phase.

===[[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Actoin_Potential|Action potential]]===

When the graded potential passes the neurons threshold, an action potential takes place.
The action potential sends the signal the entire length of the cell and never dies within the cell, which can be referred to as the ''all-or-none-principle''.
During firing the inside of the cell becomes positive, which is sometimes incorrectly called [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Depolarization|Depolarization]] and should be called the raising phase of the action potential.
After the action potential hits its peak the cell starts the refractory phase.

===[[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Refractory_phase|Refractory Phase]]===

After the action potential changes the neuron from negative to positive there is a refractory phase where it changes back to negative.
At the beginning of this period it is impossible for another signal to be transmitted, this is called ''absolute refractory phase''.
After the absolute refractory phase is the relative refractory phase where it is possible to send another signal but more excitation than normal is needed.

===Signal Strength===

For the signal to be passed from one neuron to the next it must have enough energy to break a point called the threshold.
Once the threshold is broken the signal is transmitted.
The neuron fires at the same strength every time.
The strength of a signal is decided by how many different neurons are being fired and at what frequency they are being fired.

====Glial cells====

The amount of '''[[w:Glial_cells|glial cells]]''' to every neuron in the nervous system is disputed.
Glial cells function as support for the neurons; they produce the myelin sheath which surrounds some neurons and also form part of the ''blood-brain'' barrier. 
The blood-brain barrier is a structure that prevents certain substances in the bloodstream from reaching the brain. Many axons are sheathed with tubes of ''[[w:Myelin|myelin]]'', which is a fatty material.
Myelin is produced by the ''glial'' cells.
The myelin sheaths on axons have gaps, which are called the ''[[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Nodes_of_Ranvier|nodes of Ranvier]]''.
Myelinated sheaths help transmit information quickly and efficiently.

==Organization of the nervous system==

The neurons can all be placed in one of two systems, the central nervous system or the peripheral nervous system.

===[[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Central_nervous_system_.28CNS.29|The Central nervous system]]===

The central nervous system has a fundamental role in the control of behavior. It contains the brain and the spinal cord which are both encased in bone which shows their importance. Both the brain and spinal cord receive signals from the [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Afferent|afferent]] neurons and send signals to muscles and glands through [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Efferent|efferent]] neurons.


===The peripheral nervous system===

Any part of the nervous system that is not part of the central nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system.
The nerves in the peripheral nervous system are split up into the autonomic and somatic.
The somatic connect the central nervous system to sensory organs (such as the eye and ear) and muscles, while the autonomic connect other organs of the body, blood vessels and glands.

==The glandular systems==

The body has two types of glandular systems: the endocrine, which generally secrete [[w:Hormones|hormones]] through the bloodstream, and the exocrine which secrete fluids to the outer surfaces of the body, such as sweating.


====Exocrine glands====

Exocrine glands release their secretions into ducts which in turn release them onto the surface of organs. Examples of exocrine glands are sweat glands, salivary glands, mammary glands, etc. The pancreas is both an exocrine as well as an endocrine gland. It secretes digestive enzymes that are released into the digestive system while it also contains the Islets of Langerhans which secrete insulin into the blood.

====Endocrine glands====

* Pituitary Gland
* Adrenal Cortex
* Adrenal Medula
* Thyroid Gland
* Parathyroid Gland
* Islets of Langerhans
* Gonads
* Placenta

==Structure and function of the brain==

The brain is split up into three major layers, the [[w:hindbrain|hindbrain]] is the first, the second is the [[w:midbrain|midbrain]], and the [[w:forebrain|forebrain]] is last.

===Hindbrain===

The hindbrain is a well protected central core of the brain and includes the [[w:cerebellum|cerebellum]], [[w:reticular formation|reticular formation]], and the [[w:brain stem|brain stem]].
The cerebellum plays an important role in the integration of sensory perception and motor output.
It utilizes constant feedback on body position to fine-tune motor movements.
The brain stem contains the pons, and the medulla oblongata.
The pons relays sensory information between the cerebellum and [[v:School:Psychology/Psy_1001/Key_words_for_chapter_three#Cerebrum|cerebrum]].
The medulla oblongata is the lower portion of the brainstem.
It controls autonomic functions such as breathing and vomiting, and relays nerve signals between the brain and spinal cord.
The reticular formation is a part of the brain which is involved in stereotypical actions, such as walking, sleeping, and lying down.

===Midbrain===

This part of the brain is located between the hindbrain and the forebrain making up part of the brain stem.
All sensory and motor information going to and from the fore brain and the spinal cord must pass through the midbrain. It can also be refered to as the relay station

===Forebrain===

The [[w:Anterior#Usage_in_human_anatomy|anteriormost]] division of the developing vertebrate brain that contains the most complex neural network in the CNS. The forebrain has two major divisions, the lower diencephalon, which contains the thalamus and the hypothalmus, and the upper telencephalon, which contains the cerebrum.

==Methods for observing or evaluating brain activity==

In the past only two methods of observation were available. 
The first was observing individuals who have received brain damage and assume that the part of the brain that was damaged controlled the behavior or sense that had changed.
The second was connecting electrodes to the outside of someone's head and recording the readings.

Newer methods include computed tomography (CT scan), positron emission tomography (PET scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and superconduction quantum interference devices (SQUID).

==Footnotes==
(1) Voltage is a measure of the potential energy that moves electrons in an electric current: the electron motive force (force, in physics, is the first derivative of energy). It can be either positive or negative. The flow of electricity is from a negative potential to a positive potential. Voltages are not absolute, but only exist as differences in potential between any two given points.

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;In ancient times, people would find fossils by accident. Some of them were huge. 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;There are stories of giants and monsters from ancient Greece, China and Egypt

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;- from all over the world. Most people think that fossils are the reason for the stories.

[[Image:Georges Cuvier.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;Georges Cuvier]]
&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;Georges Cuvier was born in 1769. 

&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;He worked at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris.

&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;The museum had made a big collection of fossils 

&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;from many different parts of the world.

&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;At the time, people were not sure about fossils. 

&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;Were they species of animals that were no longer living?

&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;Cuvier showed that they were.

----


[[Image:Mammouth.png|right|thumb|&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;Cuvier found that mammoths were not like modern elephants. He decided they were '''extinct'''.]]

{|
|&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;Cuvier carefully studied elephants from Africa and India.

&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;He found that they were so different, that they are really two different species.

&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;He studied the remains of mammoths too.

&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;Mammoths are different to African elephants and Indian Elephants, 
&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;so they were a different species as well.


&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;Cuvier compared a lot more living creatures with fossil ones.


&lt;font size =&quot;4&quot;&gt;He decided that fossils were different species that had become '''extinct'''.

      <comment>/* Explanation */ Spelling Error</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!--Note: this tutorial was originally written by Alan Crowe [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/6c7ae63bfbc9dbae] and was copied here with his kind permission. Improvements are welcome.
--&gt;
Start up your Lisp implementation. You will most likely see a window with a prompt waiting for your input.  This prompt is called a REPL for Read-Evaluate-Print Loop. At this point, Lisp is waiting for the expression to ''read'' and then ''evaluate'', which in simple words means to calculate its result.

Type &quot;2&quot; and press Return (or Enter)

 2
{{Code:Green|2}}
The lisp interpreter looks at 2 and evaluates it. It recognizes it as a number, and applies the rule that numbers evaluate to themselves, so the answer is 2.

== Addition ==

Type &quot;(+ 2 2)&quot; and press Return

 (+ 2 2)
{{Code:Green|4}}
The computer sees the opening parenthesis and realizes it is being given a list. When it reaches the closing parenthesis it is able to work out that it has seen a list of three elements. The first is the + sign, so it knows to add together the values of the remaining items on the list. So it evaluates them, the number 2 having the value 2 as before. Answer: 4

===Things to do wrong ===

* Forget to type return. You always have to type return at the end to tell the computer that you have finished your turn and its is its go.

* Leave out the first space: 
 (+2 2)
{{Code:Red|Illegal function call}}  

* Think it's a typo and try:
 +(2 2)
{{Code:Red|Illegal function call}}
* Think it's a typo and do the infix thing
 (2+2)
{{Code:Red|Warning: This function is undefined}}
* Put in spaces
 (2 + 2)
{{Code:Red|Illegal function call}}

=== Clarification exercises ===
 (+ 1 2 3 4)
{{Code:Green|10}}

 (+ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)
{{Code:Green|7}}

 (+ 1 20 300 4000 50000)
{{Code:Green|54321}}

=== Explanation ===

Instead of writing 1+20+300+4000+50000, one writes the plus sign as the first item of a list that can be as long as you wish.

The list appears to be laid out like one might lay out a shopping list: (potatoes carrots onions bread milk) with no concession to the idea that + is part of arithmetic and a bit special. Be careful though. The first location on the list is special, and + has to come first.

== Multiplication ==

For multiplication we use the ‘*’ function.

 (* 5 7)
{{Code:Green|35}}
Can you use a list as long as you want? Yes.

 (* 2 2 2)
{{Code:Green|8}}

 (* 5 7 11)
{{Code:Green|385}}

 (* 1 1 5 1 1 1 7 1 1 1 11)
{{Code:Green|385}}

 (* 1 1 5 1 1 1 7 0 1 1 11)
{{Code:Green|0}}
In fact, you can use lists as short as you want.

 (+ 23)
{{Code:Green|23}}

 (* 137)
{{Code:Green|137}}

 (+)
{{Code:Green|0}}

 (*)
{{Code:Green|1}}
Why? There are depths here that must be deferred until later.

== Subtraction ==

Subtraction is as clunky in Lisp as in any other language.

 (-)
{{Code:Red|error}}

 (- 96)
{{Code:Green|-96}}

 (- 96 23)
{{Code:Green|73}}

 (- 96 20 1 1 1)
{{Code:Green|73}}
In other words,
 (- a b c d e)
is the same as
 (- a (+ b c d e))

== Division ==

Division contains a surprise.

Lisp does fractions
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (+ 1/2 1/2)
1

 (+ 1/2 1/3)
5/6

 (+ 1/10 1/15)
1/6

 (- 1/2 1/3)
1/6

 (* 1/10 1/15)
1/150

 (/ 1/10 1/15)
3/2
&lt;/source&gt;
This is potentially confusing:

If you try (/ 2 3) you get 2/3 which is probably an unpleasant surprise, if you were expecting 0.6666667. If you had tried (/ 8 12) you would also have got 2/3, which might
have been a pleasant surprise. If you don't want a fraction, you can always say
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (float 8/12)
0.6666667
&lt;/source&gt;
or
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (float (/ 8 12))
0.6666667
&lt;/source&gt;
Division works the same way as subtraction with
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (/ a b c d e)
&lt;/source&gt;
being the same as
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (/ a (* b c d e))
&lt;/source&gt;

This works OK in practice. A calculation such as 6&amp;times;5&amp;times;4/(3&amp;times;2&amp;times;1) gets translated to the following piece of Lisp:
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (/ (* 6 5 4) 3 2 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Binding ==

Binding is the act of specifying a place holder for a value. The concept is analogous to that of a local variable in C or Java. You often want to do this because it is cumbersome to write out long expressions multiple times, or if a computation needs to be done in small parts where a binding needs to be updated at various times during execution.  The main way to create bindings is via the “special form” LET.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(let ((5-squared (* 5 5))
      (10-squared (* 10 10)) )
  (* 5-squared 10-squared) )
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, 5-SQUARED and 10-SQUARED are place holders (&quot;local variables&quot;) for the results of the calculation (* 5 5) and (* 10 10), respectively.  It is good to note at this time that there are very few rules regarding what can be used as a place holder. These place holders are called symbols and it can have a name that includes most any characters with the exception of quotes, open or close parenthesis, colons, backslashes, or vertical bars (‘|’).  These all have special syntactical meaning in Common Lisp.  It is good to note that all of these things actually can be in the name of a symbol but they require special escaping.

Bindings have a limited scope. Once the LET form closes, the binding is invalidated.  This means that this is an error, because a is referred to outside of the enclosing LET form.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(let ((a (sqrt 100))))
(print a)
&lt;/source&gt;

It is interesting to note the behavior if you bind a symbol that has already been bound.  Once the inner binding is released, the outer one is in effect again.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(let ((a 1))
  (print a)
  (let ((a 2))
    (print a) )
  (print a) )

==&gt; 1
    2
    1
&lt;/source&gt;

The story gets a bit more complex, there are two types of way to make bindings in Common Lisp, lexical, which we have just seen, and dynamic.  For our purposes at this point, dynamic bindings are not much different from lexical bindings, but they are made in a different way and do not have the same finite extent of the LET form.  We can use DEFVAR and DEFPARAMETER to make dynamic bindings.  These can hold a value in between inputs.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defvar a 5)

(print a)

(let ((a 10))
  (print a) )

(print a)

==&gt; a
    5
    10
    5
&lt;/source&gt;

== Variables ==

In Lisp, variables have some extra features, and are called symbols. A variable is a box containing a value. A symbol is a somewhat larger box, with its name written on the side. A symbol has two values, a general purpose value, and a function value used instead in particular circumstances. You can use the symbol as a thing in itself, without regard to
its value.

=== setf ===
We start by setting a symbol's general purpose value. There are several commands for setting the values of symbols, set, setq, setf, psetq, psetf. One can get a long
way with just setf so we start with that one

 (setf my-first-symbol 57)
{{Code:Green|57}}
This sets the general purpose value of the symbol MY-FIRST-SYMBOL to 57, and returns 57. Now we can type

 my-first-symbol
{{Code:Green|57}}
and

 (+ my-first-symbol 3)
{{Code:Green|60}}

 (setf second-symbol (+ 20 3))
{{Code:Green|23}}
Well, plainly this has performed the calculation, and returned the answer, but what did the general purpose value of our second-symbol get set to? Have we used it to record
the calculation we requested, (+ 20 3), or the answer that the computer calculated?

 second-symbol
{{Code:Green|23}}
If we want to record the calculation for future reference we must &quot;quote&quot; it. Think of the computer as a horse and the quote as a bridle, reining it in, stopping it from rushing on to evaluate things before you want it to.

 (setf third (quote (+ 20 3)))
{{Code:Green|(+ 20 3)}}
Now

 third
{{Code:Green|(+ 20 3)}}
the general purpose value of our third symbol contains a calculation, which the computer
is champing at the bit to execute.

===eval===
If quote pulls on the reins, how do we get started again? The answer: eval.

 (eval third)
{{Code:Green|23}}
It is controversial to use eval in the first lesson because it is seldom typed in explicitly. One types

 (setf third '(+ 20 3))
{{Code:Green|(+ 20 3)}}
Notice that this is a very special abbreviation. Not only are the five letters of quote shortened to the single character ', but the brackets are also omitted.
It should be noted that when we use a lisp interpreter, we are essentially in an infinite READ-EVAL-PRINT loop. Thus, we are really using eval all the time.

=== list ===
We have set three symbols so far and are perhaps in danger of forgetting what they contain. The function list builds a list, e.g.

 (list 1 2 3)
{{Code:Green|(1 2 3)}}
so lets build a list of the values of our three symbols

 (list my-first-symbol second-symbol third)
{{Code:Green|(57 23 (+ 20 3))}}
There are two potential confusions here. One of them is figuring out which value is which.
Perhaps we should turn off evaluation using quote:

 (list 'my-first-symbol my-first-symbol 'second-symbol 
 second-symbol 'third third)
{{Code:Green|(MY-FIRST-SYMBOL 57 SECOND-SYMBOL 23 THIRD (+ 20 3))}}

The second and more serious confusion arise from comparing

 (list 1 2 3)
{{Code:Green|(1 2 3)}}
and

 (list my-first-symbol second-symbol third)
{{Code:Green|(57 23 (+ 20 3))}}
It looks as though list is somehow deciding whether or not to evaluate its arguments, refraining in the first instance and rushing ahead in the second.

With quote and eval we can investigate this. Let us evaluate 1 zero times, once, twice, and three times

 '1
{{Code:Green|1}}

 1
{{Code:Green|1}}

 (eval 1)
{{Code:Green|1}}

 (eval (eval 1))
{{Code:Green|1}}
Compare this to evaluation third, zero, one, two, and three times.

 'third
{{Code:Green|THIRD}}

 third
{{Code:Green|(+ 20 3)}}

 (eval third)
{{Code:Green|23}}

 (eval (eval third))
{{Code:Green|23}}
Numbers are not symbols. There is no box containing two values. They just are, and they evaluate to themselves. Since numbers are not symbols,

 (setf 1 '1)
{{Code:Red|error}}
does not work. You can get a feel for what is going on by typing

 (setf my-symbol-1 'my-symbol-1)
{{Code:Green|MY-SYMBOL-1}}
Now my-symbol-1 evaluates to itself. It shrugs off evaluation just as numbers do.

 'my-symbol-1
{{Code:Green|MY-SYMBOL-1}}

 my-symbol-1
{{Code:Green|MY-SYMBOL-1}}

 (eval my-symbol-1)
{{Code:Green|MY-SYMBOL-1}}

 (eval (eval my-symbol-1))
{{Code:Green|MY-SYMBOL-1}}
I'm going to belabor this point. I have a reason. The metaphor of a variable as a box that contains things is a good one. Much of the time the metaphor works well. You keep
something in the box for a while. Then you throw the contents away and use the box to keep something else instead. Unfortunately the metaphor is fundamentally flawed. Both the box and its contents are immaterial. Consider

 (setf 4th third)
Has the list describing a simple calculation been put in the box 4th?

 4th
{{Code:Green|(+ 20 3)}}
Yes.

Has it been taken out of third?

 third
{{Code:Green|(+ 20 3)}}
No.

Has it been copied? No. You make a copy like this:

 (setf 5th (copy-list 4th))
Has it been moved? No. To the extent that the metaphor of motion works at all, you move things like this

 (setf 6th 5th 5th nil)
There is a command (shiftf 6th 5th nil) which writes nil to 5th after moving the contents to 6th, but it returns the old contents of 6th, so it cannot be used on shiny new variables with no contents.

If it has not been copied and it has not been moved, what has happened? Something special to the immaterial world of tangled boxes, which we will not explore today.

For a striking example do

 (setf red 'green)
 (setf green 'blue)
 (setf blue 'red)
now

 'red
{{Code:Green|RED}}

 red
{{Code:Green|GREEN}}

 (eval red)
{{Code:Green|BLUE}}

 (eval (eval red))
{{Code:Green|RED}}
Now for the key test. What happens with (+ 1 (* 2 3)) and
(+ 1 '(* 2 3))?
The second of these is easy to understand. We have used quote to prevent evaluation, so (* 2 3) is a list of three items, giving instructions for an arithmetical calculation
to be carried out at some later time. It is not the result of the calculation it describes and is not a number. Sure enough:

 (+ 1 '(* 2 3))
{{Code:Red|Argument Y is not a NUMBER: (* 2 3).}}
By contrast

 (+ 1 (* 2 3))
{{Code:Green|7}}
appears cleverer than it really is. It looks like the
interpreter looks at its arguments and decides which ones to
evaluate. For example it looks as though

 (+ 1 (* 2 3) (* 10 10) 30)
{{Code:Green|137}}
is realizing that it needs to evaluate argument 2 and 3 while leaving 1 and 4 alone.

In fact

 (* 2 3)
{{Code:Green|6}}
only looks like it is doing what you think. It is evaluating 2 and 3, getting 2 and 3 as the results of the two evaluations, then multiplying the two results to get six.

When the interpreter evaluates (+ 1 (* 2 3)) it evaluates 1 and (* 2 3). 1 evaluates to 1, (* 2 3) evaluates to 6. Then it adds them to get 7.

There is something worth pondering here. Get a cheap, old, pocket calculator out of a drawer and try 1 + 2 x 3 Typically, when you press x, the calculator, lacking an extra register to hold pending results, carries out the addition of the one and the two. One ends up calculating 3 x 3 and getting 9, rather than 7. Modern calculators follow the standard rules of precedence, and defer performing the addition until after they have multiplied 2 by 3, eventually arriving at 7, as desired.

Computer languages have many more operations than addition and multiplication and often have elaborate systems of precedence controlling which operations are carried out first. Lisp has no such subtlety. One either writes

(1+2)x3 as
 (* (+ 1 2) 3)
or one writes

1+(2x3) as
 (+ 1 (* 2 3))
there is no way to preserve the ambiguity of 1+2x3

This turns out to be for the best in practice.

Obscure note:
You could try (+ 1 * 2 3). At the top level, * is used for recalling the result of the
previous command. If that was a number it will give the wrong answer. If that was not a number the interpreter will signal an error. Within a program, (+ 1 * 2 3) will generate
an error message saying that * has no value. More on this later.

Let us return to third. Remember that we set our third symbol to a list of three items. We can see the whole list by typing third

 third
{{Code:Green|(+ 20 3)}}
Lisp has functions for extracting items from a list. First gets the first item

 (first third)
{{Code:Green|+}}
The function second gets the second item on the list.

 (second third)
{{Code:Green|20}}
If we would prefer multiplication we can change the symbol at the start of the list

 (setf (first third) '*)
{{Code:Green|*}}

 third
{{Code:Green|(* 20 3)}}

 (eval third)
{{Code:Green|60}}
We can change the second item

 (setf (second third) 7)
{{Code:Green|7}}

 third
{{Code:Green|(* 7 3)}}

 (eval third)
{{Code:Green|21}}
and, mysteriously, we can do the same with the third item

 (third third)
{{Code:Green|3}}

 (setf (third third) 4)
 third
{{Code:Green|(* 7 4)}}

 (eval third)
{{Code:Green|28}}
How does this work? Remember what I said earlier &quot;A symbol has two values, a general purpose value, and a function value used instead in particular circumstances.&quot;

The particular circumstances are when eval is evaluating the first symbol in a list. The function that eval applies, to the result of evaluating the other items in the list, is the function value of the symbol, not the general purpose value of the symbol.

=== symbol-function, symbol-value ===
To make this clear, use symbol-function and symbol-value

 (symbol-function 'third)
{{Code:Green|#&lt;Function THIRD {103C7F19}&gt;}}

 (symbol-value 'third)
{{Code:Green|(* 7 4)}}

 (symbol-function 'my-first-symbol)
{{Code:Red|Error in KERNEL:%COERCE-TO-FUNCTION:  the function MY-FIRST-SYMBOL is undefined.}}

 (symbol-value 'my-first-symbol)
{{Code:Green|57}}

 (symbol-function '+)
{{Code:Green|#&lt;Function + {10295819}&gt;}}

 (symbol-value '+)
{{Code:Green|(SYMBOL-FUNCTION '+)}}
This is very confusing. The interpreter stores the last command executed as the general purpose value of the symbol +, so (symbol-value '+) depends on what you did last. In
side a program (symbol-val '+) will do something like

 (symbol-value '=)
{{Code:Red|&lt;nowiki&gt;Error in KERNEL::UNBOUND-SYMBOL-ERROR-HANDLER:  the variable = is unbound.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
just the same as

 (symbol-value 'my-misspelled-simbol)
{{Code:Red|Error in KERNEL::UNBOUND-SYMBOL-ERROR-HANDLER:  the variable MY-MISSPELLED-SIMBOL is unbound.}}
=== boundp ===
All these error messages are quite annoying. Is there any way to avoid them? Yes. boundp checks whether there is a general purpose value, and fboundp checks whether there is a
function value,

 (fboundp '+)
{{Code:Green|T}}
T is used for true

 (fboundp 'my-first-symbol)
{{Code:Green|NIL}}
NIL is used for false, rather than F

 (boundp 'my-first-symbol)
{{Code:Green|T}}

 (boundp 'my-misspelled-simbol)
{{Code:Green|NIL}}
Introductions to Lisp usually keep quiet about symbol-function. I understand why. Now that I have told you about it, you are equipped to wreck havoc, and undertake all sorts of devious mischief.

For example

 (symbol-function '*)
{{Code:Green|#&lt;Function * {1005F739}&gt;}}
and

 (symbol-function  '+)
{{Code:Green|#&lt;Function + {10295819}&gt;}}
give access to the functions that add and multiply.

Lets save them for later

 (setf mult (symbol-function '*) add (symbol-function  '+))
Notice that you can set as many symbols as you want with a single setf.

Notice also that I have put these functions in the general purpose values of the symbols

 (fboundp 'mult)
{{Code:Green|NIL}}

 (boundp 'mult)
{{Code:Green|T}}

 (symbol-value 'mult)
{{Code:Green|#&lt;Function * {1005F739}&gt;}}
Notice that

 mult
{{Code:Green|#&lt;Function * {1005F739}&gt;}}
works as well. I'm using symbol-value to make the parallel to symbol-function more apparent.

You can store functions in general purpose value of a symbol. It really is the general purpose the value of the symbol, not the data value of the symbol.

 (mult 4 5)
{{Code:Red|Warning: This function is undefined:
 MULT
 Error in KERNEL:%COERCE-TO-FUNCTION:  the function MULT is undefined.}}
doesn't work. When eval tries to evaluate a list that starts with a symbol, it looks for the function value of the symbol, and signals an error if it cannot find one.

 (funcall mult 4 5)
{{Code:Green|20}}
works. So does

 (apply mult '(4 5))
{{Code:Green|20}}
and

 (apply mult (list 4 5)).
{{Code:Green|20}}
and

 (apply add '(1 2 3 4))
{{Code:Green|10}}
It is worth remembering that apply subsumes funcall, i.e. all of these work

 (apply add '(1 2 3 4))
 (apply add 1 '(2 3 4))
 (apply add 1 2 '(3 4))
 (apply add 1 2 3 '(4))
 (apply add 1 2 3 4 '())
Back to mischief

 (setf (symbol-function '+) mult)
 (setf (symbol-function '*) add)
He he, you've got it, I'm swapping round + and *

 (+ 5 7)
{{Code:Green|35}}

 (* 25 75)
{{Code:Green|100}}
I'd better put them back

 (setf (symbol-function '+) add (symbol-function '*) mult)

 (+ 5 7)
{{Code:Green|12}}

 (* 25 75)
{{Code:Green|1875}}
phew, that's better.

symbol-function is heavily used. So not only is there an
easier way of writing it, (function +) instead of
(symbol-function (quote +)), but the simplified way even has
its own abbreviation #'+. Err, that's not quite right, but it
will have to do for now.

== Welcome, fellow gardener! ==

Hi there!

I saw you did a bunch of work on the [[Gardening/Tomato]] page... nice work! Only problem is that that book is being moved to wikisource (if you look at the oldest versions, they're actually just a transcription of an old public domain book).

The working garden book is [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]]. It's best to keep it all in one book for now to allow for easy linking between chapters (for example, I'm going to link the pests you mentioned to individual pages about those pests, with photos, organic and non-organic controls, etc). I probably won't get to merging it for a couple days, but it you want to add any information from [[A Wikimanual of Gardening/Tomato]] to the chapter you were working on, that'd be great! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:24, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

== Uh-oh. ==

Sorry, but I had to revert your edits... the copyrights from the sources you copied from are not compatible with the GFDL. OSU, for example, says: &quot;All or part of the Fact Sheets contained on Ohioline may be copied without permission for educational, non-profit purposes.&quot; The GFDL is specifically designed to allow both non-commercial ''and'' commercial use, so posting that here is a violation of OSU's copyrights. 

You could probably patch it back together using imported pages from wikipedia or pages already in the wikimanual of gardening or the Gardening book, but pasting large sections from non-commercial-use websites is unfortunately a no-can-do on wikibooks :(. I'm sorry i didn't catch it earlier... that was a lot of work! Good work too, but bad for the copyrights. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:18, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

You are on the South of an island (10 miles North to South) covered by dry vegetation.  There is a fire which started at the far North of the Island and, because the wind is blowing strongly Southward, is working its way slowly South (1 mile per hour).  You have no way to carry/channel water and no means of escaping the island.  How can you survive the fire?

      <comment>syntax highlighting</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''function''' is a concept that is encountered in almost every programming language, but in Lisp functions are especially important. Historically, Lisp was inspired by [[:w:lambda calculus|lambda calculus]], where every object is a function. On the other end of the spectrum there are many programming languages where functions are hardly objects at all. This is not the case with Lisp: functions here have the same privileges as the other objects, and we will discuss it in this chapter.

==Defining functions==

Functions are most often created using the '''defun''' (DEfine FUNction) macro. This macro takes a list of arguments and a sequence of Lisp forms, called a ''body'' of a function. A typical use of defun is like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defun print-arguments-and-return-sum (x1 x2)
    (print x1)
    (print x2)
    (+ x1 x2))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Here, the list of arguments is (x1 x2) and the body is (print x1) (print x2) (+ x1 x2). When the function is called, each form in the body is evaluated sequentially (from first to last). What if something happened and we want to return from the function without reaching the last form? The '''return-from''' macro allows us to do that. For example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  (defun print-arguments-and-return-sum (x1 x2)
    (print x1)
    (print x2)
    (unless (and (numberp x1) (numberp x2))
       (return-from print-arguments-and-return-sum &quot;Error!&quot;))
    (+ x1 x2))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The second argument to '''return-from''' is ''optional'', which means that it can be called with only one argument - in this case the function would return '''nil'''. But wait: how did they do this? Our function accepts exactly two arguments: nothing more, nothing less. The answer is that what we called &quot;argument list&quot; is not as simple as it seems. It is in fact called ''lambda list'' and it is not the only place where we will encounter it. Later, I will explain how to allow ''optional'' and ''keyword'' arguments in functions.

==Functions as data==

As was mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, Lisp functions can be used like any other object: they can be stored in variables, passed as parameters to other functions, and returned as values from functions. In the previous section we defined a function. The function in now stored in the ''function cell'' of the symbol '''print-arguments-and-return-sum''' - '''defun''' put it there. However, it is not bound to this location forever - we can extract it and put in some other symbol, for example. To access the function cell of a symbol we can use the accessor '''symbol-function'''. Let's store our function in some other symbol:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setf paars (symbol-function 'print-arguments-and-return-sum))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The first reaction would be to do something like that:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 &gt;(paars 1 1)
 EVAL: undefined function PAARS
   [Condition of type SYSTEM::SIMPLE-UNDEFINED-FUNCTION]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This is because we put the function into the ''value cell'' of the symbol instead of its function cell. It's easy to fix:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setf (symbol-function 'paars)
       (symbol-function 'print-arguments-and-return-sum))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Since '''symbol-function''' is an accessor we can use '''setf''' with it. Now &lt;code&gt;(paars 1 1)&lt;/code&gt; produces what it should.

While '''symbol-function''' is there for a reason, it is almost never used in the real code. This is because it is superseded by several other Lisp features. One of them is the '''function''' special operator. It works like the '''symbol-function''' special operator, except it doesn't evaluate its argument, and it returns the function that is currently ''bound'' to the symbol, which may not actually be its function cell. &lt;code&gt;(function foo)&lt;/code&gt; may also be abbreviated as &lt;code&gt;#'&lt;/code&gt; which tremendously improves its usefulness. On the flip side, it's impossible to write

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setf (function paars) (function print-arguments-and-return-sum))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Fortunately it's possible to call functions from other places than function cell of a symbol. A ''function designator'' is either a symbol (in this case its function cell is used) or the function itself. '''funcall''' and '''apply''' are used to call functions by their function designators. Remember that symbol '''paars''' now contains the same function in its function cell and its value cell. Let's change its value cell so that the difference is apparent:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setf paars #'+)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Now let's funcall it in different ways:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (funcall paars 1 2)   ;equivalent to (+ 1 2)
 (funcall 'paars 1 2)  ;equivalent to (funcall (symbol-function paars) 1 2)
 (funcall #'paars 1 2) ;equivalent to (paars 1 2)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The difference between the second and third example is that if '''paars''' was temporarily bound (with '''flet''' or '''labels''') to some other function, the third funcall would use this temporary function, while the second funcall would still use its function cell.

Carry a burning branch to a place that is one mile to the North of the Southern tip of the Island, set the vegetation on fire.  The small fire will then burn South for 1 hour before running out of fuel.  You can now sit out the big fire in safety at the Southern most tip of the island.

      <comment>/* Scene Layout Setup */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Graphics shown on the computer screen in 3-dimensional space, for example, location of points, lines, and, typically, faces. Makes the graphic more clear and more close to the real live.

==Modeling of 3D graphics==
With the help of digital computers and special 3D software, graphic works of art can be created called 3D computer graphics.  To perform calculations and render 2D images. a three-dimensional representation of geometric data is stored in the computer.  

The art of 3D modeling is somewhat like sculpting or photography, as it prepares geometric data for 3D computer graphics.  

There are three phases to creating 3D graphics:

#Content creation (this includes 3d modeling, texturing, and animation)
#Scene layout set-up
#Rendering

In the modeling stage, individual objects are shaped and later used in a scene.  The modeling process could also include adjusting object surface or material properties (such as luminosity, shading components, reflection characteristics, transparency, etc), adding textures, bump-maps and other features. 

Modeling could also include numerous activities related to preparing a 3D model for animation.  In this process, objects might be fitted with a central framework that has the capability of affecting its' shape or movements.

Dedicated programs can perform the modeling process (e.g.  Rhinoceros 3D).  Modeling can also be performed by an application component (e.g. Shaper) or some scene description language (e.g. Povray).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics
==Scene Layout Setup==


 Virtual objects as well as cameras and lighting are used to create a scene layout setup for 3D computer graphics.  This enables you to make a still image or an animation.

3D Animation is exactly that – animated objects that appear in a three-dimensional space.  You can rotate them or move them like real objects.  You will see a lot of 3D animation in things like games and virtual reality but they can also be used in graphics for designing nice presentations.  

Keyframe animation determines a path or direction for the animation to proceed.

We all know how important lighting is to photographers and stage sets.  Lighting is also very important to the effectiveness of 3D computer graphics.  The easiest type of light to simulate is “ambient” light.  It produces a constant illumination on all surfaces of a 3D object, regardless of their orientation.  There is also directional and positional light to be considered when creating 3D graphics.  

Color is also very important when creating 3D graphics.  Red, green and blue lights are the primary colors.  Other colors are produced by combining these colors together.

'''3D in Movies and Television'''[[File:IMAX 3D.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An example of a movie theater that shows movies that are in 3D. They are very rapidly becoming the norm.]]


The use of 3D technology has increased rapidly over the last several years. Most major movie titles are now filmed in 3D and shown in IMAX 3D in theaters because it gives the audience a better quality of entertainment by making them feel as though they are actually in the movie.  3D movies are so popular that some of the biggest movie titles from the 90s, such as Titanic, are being reproduced using 3D technology and show in theaters again.  Many television making companies, such as Sony and Sharp, started making televisions that use 3D technology and allow consumers to enjoy 3D entertainment right in their homes. 

Television companies have come out with a variety of ways to experience the 3D technology that has become a widespread phenomenon in the past decade. They have come out with televisions that you need the 3D glasses for, which is nice because you are able to watch regular channels without the glasses and now instead of just having that option there are 3D channels where you just put the glasses on and you have the 3D experience. Now technology has further advanced and there are televisions that have 3D channels and there is special technology in the screens where there is no longer a need for the special 3D glasses.

==Business 3D Worlds==
[[File: Digital_PR_en-Second_Life.jpg|thumb|Business 3D Worlds|left]]
Some businesses are opting for the use of 3D business worlds for business meetings and other business applications.  3D virtual business world is where employees meet in a virtual world for business meetings.  Virtual meetings can save companies the cost of travel, and also employees are more likely to be distributed throughout the country. So, instead of face-to-face meetings, meetings are held in a 3D world with avatar representation.  They can also be more engaging and interacting than regular online meetings. Some of the 3D business worlds allow the members to exchange documents. According to Inside the Industry, “a recent 3D virtual world development that opens up even more possibilities for the future is an experiment by IBM and Linden Lab in which research teams from these companies successfully teleported avatars from the Second Life Preview Grid to an OpenSim virtual world-the first time an avatar has moved from one virtual world to another (P. 399).” Business 3D worlds can possibly change the way business meetings are held.

[[Image:City_Grid.JPG|thumb|right|200px|An 8x8 city grid, with one possible path from A to B highlighted.]]
1. Picture a small town center, where the streets form an 8x8 square grid, as illustrated in the diagram.  How many ways are there to travel from one corner (A) of the town center to the opposite corner (B)?

2. On a chessboard, how many ways are there to position 8 rooks in mutually non-attacking positions?

3. At least how many students must there be in a lecture class to assure that the probability of any two students having the same birthday is at least 1/2?

4. Given n letters and n addressed envelopes, in how many ways can the letters be placed in the envelopes so that no letter is in the correct envelope? (The answer is the nearest integer to &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{e}&lt;/math&gt;).

5. Kirkman's schoolgirl problem: Fifteen schoolgirls walk each day in five groups of three. Arrange the girls walks for a week so that, in that time each pair of girls walks together in a group just once. &lt;ref name=&quot;graham1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Graham |first= Ronald L. |authorlink= Ronald Graham |coauthors= Martin Grötschel, László Lovász |title= Handbook of Combinatorics, Volume 2 |year= 1995 |publisher= The MIT Press |location= Cambridge, MA |isbn= 0-262-07171-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. (A solution is provided [[w:Kirkman's schoolgirl problem|here]].)

6. Euler's officers: Thirty six officers are given, belonging to six regiments and holding six ranks. (No two officers have the same rank and regiment, if their ranks matches then their regiments differ and vice versa). Can the officers be paraded in a 6 by 6 array so that in any line of the array each regiment and each rank occurs precisely once. (The answer is no.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = G. Terry | title = Le Probléme de 36 Officiers | journal = Comptes Rendu de l' Association Française pour l' Avancement de Science Naturel | volume = 1 | pages = 122–123 &amp; 2170–2203 | year = 1900–1901 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=qzkDAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=36+%22Recherches+sur+une+nouvelle+espece+de+quarres+magiques%22&amp;dq=36+%22Recherches+sur+une+nouvelle+espece+de+quarres+magiques%22&amp;ei=Y7e_Rp2cBKHgoAKI0tXvBQ&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

7. Ramsey's game: This 2 player game requires drawing 6 points (no 3 of which are in the same line) on a blank sheet of player and then giving the players differently colored pencils. The players now take turns to connect the points by drawing lines joining them. The first player to produce a monochromatic triangle loses. The question is: Can this game ever end in a draw? (The anwser is no. [[w:Ramsey%27s_theorem#Example:_R.283.2C3.29.3D6|See here]].)

==Early Life And Career==

Snake was born as a result of the ''Les Enfants Terribles'' project, which was an attempt to create the perfect soldier by cloning the &quot;Greatest Warrior of the 20th Century,&quot; Big Boss circa 1972. During the Shadow Moses Island incident, Liquid Snake was under the impression that he &quot;was the inferior one&quot;, having been granted the supposedly &quot;flawed&quot; recessive genes, whilst his brother received the &quot;superior&quot; dominant genes, hence his resentment towards Solid Snake during their confrontation and his believing himself to be &quot;garbage from the day (he) was born,&quot; the leftovers of what they had used to create his brother, &quot;the Legend,&quot; Solid Snake. In truth, it is revealed that Liquid is indeed the &quot;superior&quot; clone rather than Snake, although neither one is aware of the truth (at least until Liquid takes possesion of Ocelot's body as well as his memories). &lt;ref&gt;This is revealed in a conversation between Ocelot and the President (Solidus) at the end of the original ''Metal Gear Solid''. In the Japanese book, ''Metal Gear Solid naked'', Kojima states on page 65 that neither clones are genetically superior or inferior in the traditional sense, as the technology to modify a gene's phenotype did not exist during the 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of his early life are largely unknown, the only clue being Snake's own comment that he was &quot;raised by many people.&quot; In 1991, Snake infiltrated western Iraq during the Gulf War with a platoon of Green Berets. Not much else is implied about this other than Snake saying: &quot;I was just a kid myself back then...&quot;

==Outer Heaven Uprising==
:''Events in this section take place during '''Metal Gear'''.
Snake's career was notable enough that in 1995, he was recruited into the Special Operations group FOXHOUND as a Commando. Still a rookie, he was chosen to infiltrate the heavily fortified independent state of Outer Heaven near South Africa, rescue his fellow operative Gray Fox and other prisoners and destroy a new super weapon called Metal Gear. Unbeknownst to Snake, his superior who ordered him into Outer Heaven, Big Boss, the commander of FOXHOUND, was behind the uprising and actually counting on Snake's inexperience to lead him towards failure. 

Using all of his training and abilities, Snake managed to destroy Metal Gear and defeat Big Boss. After the Outer Heaven incident, Solid Snake decided to leave FOXHOUND with an honorable discharge. He was then scouted by the CIA and spent six months as a deep cover agent before he was dissatisfied with the system and left. He then became a mercenary for hire. Earning enough money, he went into semi-retirement in the Canadian wilderness.  During this entire period, he was haunted by nightmares of his battles in Outer Heaven.

==Zanzibar Land Disturbance==
:''Events in this section take place during '''Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake'''.
In 1999, Snake's former commander, Roy Campbell, recalled him for another operation in Central Asia . Snake's mission involved deposing the rising dictator of Zanzibar Land, who turned out to be none other than Big Boss himself, and had command of another Metal Gear tank Metal Gear D. The former FOXHOUND agent Gray Fox was found to be working with Big Boss as well.

Snake destroyed Metal Gear D and defeated Gray Fox in a brutal fist fight in the middle of a minefield. He then confronted Big Boss, who was waiting near the Detention Camp's exit. The match to the death between the two occurred and Snake emerged victorious over his former commander. 

As Big Boss was being burned alive from the makeshift flamethrower Snake created, Snake felt as if he killed his own father. It was only after he returned to base that he learned the truth. After the Zanzibar Land incident, Snake returned to North America and retired to the Alaskan wilderness retreat, Twin Lakes, to try to forget his war-torn past and recover from post-traumatic stress disorder which often led him to experience hallucinations and feelings of guilt. Snake decided to take up dog sledding in order to help take his mind off of such things. He owns 50 huskies and had been participating in the Iditarod.

==Shadow Moses Incident==
:''Events in this section take place during '''Metal Gear Solid'''.
In 2005, when members of recently re-formed FOXHOUND took over the nuclear disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island, Roy Campbell came forcedly calling on Snake again after sending armed soldiers to his cabin. This time, Snake found himself pitted against the Genome Army, an army of genetically altered soldiers using the genes of Big Boss, new members of FOXHOUND: Revolver Ocelot, Sniper Wolf, Vulcan Raven, Decoy Octopus, Psycho Mantis, and their leader, Liquid Snake.

Along the way, Snake periodically teamed up with Meryl Silverburgh, and Hal &quot;Otacon&quot; Emmerich, Metal Gear REX&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s designer. His support crew included his former commanding officer Campbell, data analyst Mei Ling, weapons expert Nastasha Romanenko and FOXHOUND's medical chief of staff Dr. Naomi Hunter.

Snake was successful in infiltrating the facility. He managed to neutralize all members of the FOXHOUND unit except for Revolver Ocelot, and was successful in destroying the Metal Gear REX prototype. However, Snake was implanted with the FOXDIE retrovirus as part of his mission objective without his knowledge. The virus was originally scheduled to kill Snake after he completed his mission. However, Naomi Hunter, who implanted the virus into Snake, changed the program and altered the incubation period to a wildcard value. Liquid, who was identical to Snake in the genetic level, was killed by the virus, confirming that Snake himself was still vulnerable to the virus at any random moment.

After the incident, Snake went into deep hiding with Meryl and no longer saw any reason to risk his life for his government again. They eventually parted ways (perhaps leading to Snake's chronic alcoholism: &quot;I was held up in Alaska, drinking too much.&quot;), and Snake would return to action later with Otacon as a means of &quot;fighting for a future.&quot; The two worked to create the first anti-Metal Gear political group, an NGO called &quot;Philanthropy.&quot; They have since gained official United Nations recognition. This lead to the destruction of countless Metal Gears all over the world's industrialized nations.

==Tanker Incident==
:''Events in this section take place during the &quot;Tanker Chapter&quot; of '''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'''.
Following the incident on Shadow Moses Island, Metal Gear's top-secret technology was leaked into the black market through the machinations of Revolver Ocelot. As a result, countless variations of Metal Gear have sprung up in every corner of the globe, making the weapon an increasingly common sight in the armed forces of nuclear powers.

In 2007, Solid Snake, now a member of the anti-Metal Gear group &quot;Philanthropy&quot;, has learned following an anonymous tip (that was later revealed to had come from Liquid Snake, living inside Ocelot) that a new prototype Metal Gear, designed to be a defense against other Metal Gears, has been developed by the U.S. Marines and is being transported secretly. To find out more about this prototype, getting support via the Codec from Otacon who is also a member of &quot;Philanthropy,&quot; Snake must infiltrate the transport as it makes its way down the Hudson River, New York, disguised as an oil tanker. 

Almost immediately following Snake's successful insertion onto the vessel, the ship was taken over by Gurlukovich Mercenaries, led by Colonel Sergei Gurlukovich and Revolver Ocelot.
As Snake silently made his way to the bridge of the ship, he came into contact with Sergei's daughter, Olga Gurlukovich, and was able to tranquilze her. After the fight, Snake's picture was taken by a U.S Army Cypher.         

Snake then made his way to the holds where Metal Gear RAY was being stored. After he took photographs of Metal Gear Ray, Ocelot and Gurlukovich's men raided the holds and prepared to steal Ray. Ocelot then revealed his true plans; he then betrayed and killed his friend Sergei Gurlukovich and Marine Commandant Scott Dolph before sinking the tanker and taking the prototype to an unknown location. Photographs taken by the U.S Army Cypher were released to the media and Snake was accused of sinking the tanker.

Framed for the terrorist act, Otacon and Snake then stole Liquid Snake's body and planted it at the scene, making it appear that Snake had been killed during the incident.

==Manhattan Incident==
:''Events in this section take place during the &quot;Plant Chapter&quot; of '''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'''.
In 2009, during an incident at the Big Shell, Solid Snake turned up (under the guise of Iroquois Pliskin), and assisted alleged FOXHOUND operative Raiden in rescuing hostages, one of them being the current President. He also aids in discovering the plot of former President George Sears, who reveals himself to be Solidus Snake, the third &quot;son&quot; of Big Boss, brother of Solid and Liquid Snake and the one who ordered Ocelot to steal Metal Gear RAY. As the leader of the Sons of Liberty, Solidus was working to overthrow a mysterious underlying force that drives the United States' government called the Patriots.

The real reason Snake went to the Big Shell was to uncover a new type of Metal Gear constructed underneath the treatment plant known as the Big Shell. The entire incident was orchestrated by the Patriots from the start as part of the S3 Plan, with the exception of Snake's actual presence. Instead, Snake only became involved due to the information that was leaked to him and Otacon by Liquid (who became a dormant personality within Ocelot's right arm).

With Olga Gurlukovich's help (whom Snake rescued during the Tanker incident), Snake used Raiden as a decoy to infiltrate Arsenal Gear itself and replaced the MO Disk containing the identities of the Wisemen’s Committee in Raiden's possession with a fake one. He helped Raiden neutralize an entire battalion of Tengu Commandos, before being captured by Fortune. However, Snake broke free (after Arsenal Gear's AI System broke down) and chased after the awakened Liquid when he took off with Metal Gear RAY. He was unable to capture Liquid/Ocelot, but still retained the MO Disk.

At the end of this mission, Snake began looking into where the Wisemen's Committee was and how Ocelot was involved. Otacon tells Snake about the Patriots information on the disk. Otacon discovers that the Wisemen are in New York, but had been dead for about 100 years, leaving them both in utter confusion.

==Early life and career==
Jack's history prior to joining the armed forces and becoming a disciple of The Boss is mostly a mystery. He was born in the early 1930s, while his military service would seem to date back as far as 1945. In 1950, he became The Boss' apprentice and developed the CQC (Close Quarters Combat) fighting style with her. In 1956, Jack was involved in the Bikini Atoll testing of the first airborne detonation of a hydrogen bomb. The Boss and Jack went their separate ways on June 12th, 1959, and later met for the first time in five years during Jack's first field mission in the FOX unit, on August 24th, 1964.

==Virtuous Mission==
:''Events in this section take place during '''Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater'''.
In the year 1964, Jack was recruited by the fledgling FOX unit (Force Operation X - which was the immediate predecessor of the high-tech special forces unit ''''FOXHOUND'''') and underwent an operation titled the '''Virtuous Mission''', in which he was to rescue and extract a defecting Soviet scientist, Dr. Nikolai Stephanovich Sokolov, from deep within mountainous Soviet territory. 'Jack' was given the codename of 'Naked Snake' for this mission.

The mission failed however, due to the defection of The Boss, a female soldier and a living legend who had originally led the Allies to victory in World War II, who indirectly had been responsible for the founding of the first US Special Forces units, and who had also been Jack's own mentor.

==Operation Snake Eater==
:''Events in this section take place during '''Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater'''.
A week after the incidents of the Virtuous Mission, the FOX unit and 'Naked Snake' were forcefully assigned ''''Operation Snake Eater'''', in which the objective was to eliminate The Boss and her Cobra Unit, assassinate her new Soviet ally and host, a hawk GRU colonel by the name of Yevgeny Borisovitch Volgin, as well as to destroy the prototype of the Soviet superweapon Shagohod and to rescue its chief engineer, Dr. Sokolov. It was during this same mission that 'Naked Snake' came across what would be the first prototype designs for a 'Metal Gear' bipedal tank from Director Aleksandr Leonovitch Granin, who was sending the documents to a friend and colleague in America (none other than the grandfather of Hal &quot;Otacon&quot; Emmerich), out of resentment for his superiors for their decision to adopt Sokolov's Shagohod project over that of his own bipedal tank research.

'Naked Snake' accidentally lost his right eye to a misplaced bullet from Revolver Ocelot's revolver during this operation, while enduring torture at the hands of Colonel Volgin after having been taken captive. However, he eventually escaped and would succeed in completing the mission in full, killing both The Boss and Colonel Volgin as well as eliminating the entire Cobra Unit and destroying the already completed Shagohod prototype. For these highly impressive feats, he became considered to be &quot;above even The Boss&quot; by the government and subsequently received the title of ''''Big Boss'''' as well as being awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by President Lyndon B. Johnson, during an official reception at the White House following the success of 'Operation Snake Eater'.

However, Big Boss was also a man who would be changed forever following the outcome of his landmark operation. He learned from his former cooperative EVA that The Boss had never actually intended to betray her country and had, in fact, willingly died for it as a scapegoat under orders of the US government, for the nuclear destruction of OKB-754 caused by Colonel Volgin in his continued attempts to have tensions escalate between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. This knowledge would apparently stunt Big Boss's patriotism further and he began developing a powerful, but veiled, resentment towards his superiors. And there after set out to destroy America. 

During the same reception at the CIA Headquarters, Big Boss stoically yet openly ignored an invitation to shake hands with the CIA Director who had ordered The Boss' death, and very nearly with President Johnson himself as well, a subtle warning sign of things to come.

==The San Herynimo Incident==
''Events in the section take place during '''Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops'''

After the events of Operation Snake Eater, Naked Snake, still distraught over the death of The Boss, quits the FOX unit and completely disappears from the world's eye and participating in dozens of conflicts across the globe for six years. Big Boss was unofficially called back in to active duty eventually to combat his former unit, FOX whom had revolted and stole a new type of nuclear weapon the Americans were developing. Unlike previous operations he had undertaken, Big Boss allied himself with numerous soldiers on the peninsula to stop the rogue FOX unit, which included a much younger Roy Campbell(the man who would later become FOXHOUND's commander). Big Boss is also aided by a young psychic named Elisa during his mission to take down FOX. After escaping the prison and rounding up a few soldiers to help them in their cause, Big Boss and Campbell eventually unearthed a shocking and troubling discovery, the new type of nuclear weapon FOX stole was being prepped for launch into the Soviet Union for a full-scale nuclear attack. That weapon was Metal Gear.

During the course of his mission Big Boss had numerous encounters with a young man known as the Perfect Soldier, whom turned out to be a child soldier he met in Mozambique that he had left in the care of a rehab facility. That young man turned out to be Frank Jaeger, the man who would later earn the codename of Gray Fox and become a mentor to Big Boss's son Solid Snake. After facing off against Null (Gray Fox) for the first time Snake is captured by the FOX unit and learns of a shocking conspiracy surrounding FOX's rebellion. Gene the ringleader of the revolt told Snake that FOX was under order's by the CIA to steal Metal Gear, Gene who had his own intentions for the use of Metal Gear used this opportunity to his advantage to gain a trump card in the founding of his mercenary nation Army's Heaven (a precursor to Big Boss's Outer Heaven). After escaping the prison Big Boss encounters Cunningham, who begins questioning him again over the missing half of the Philosopher's Legacy. Cunningham begin shooting down Snake's men before they were rescued by Elisa and escapes. Afterwards Big Boss and the others infiltrated the plant where Metal Gear was being stored to destroy it, but was caught by Gene and his men. Big Boss managed to sneak up to Gene and get him at gun point but failed to stop him from activating Metal Gear through Ursala (Elisa's dormant personality). Big Boss took on Metal Gear and destroyed it but soon after learned that it wasn't the real Metal Gear from Ghost who turned out to be Sokolov. 

After leaving the plant and destroying a power plant along the way Big Boss finally made his way to the underground silo where the real Metal Gear was being stored. While on his way down to the launch control room Cunningham appears before Big Boss once again when he finally revealed the true nature of his mission and Big Boss being captured and brought to the peninsula. Apparently the Pentagon and the CIA were fighting over the amount of influence each other has over military affairs, Cunningham was sent in by the DOD (the Department of Defense) to retrieve the missing half of the Philosopher's Legacy and make sure that Gene still launched the nukes into the Soviet Union. Once the nukes were launched Cunningham was to destroy the base using a Davy Crocket. When Big Boss learns of this he decides to stop Cunningham out of loyalty to himself not the CIA nor the Pentagon. Snake stops Cunningham and finally makes it to the control room to stop Gene. While Gene is preparing to launch Metal Gear he tells Big Boss of the true nature of his plans, the real target was never the Soviet Union it was the CIA headquarters and the Pentagon saying that &quot;the Philosopher's twin layers will be obliterated&quot;. Big Boss also learns of a shocking and disturbing conspiracy surrounding the events of Operation Snake Eater, the entire operation was a set up. Volgin was under orders to launch the nuke at Sokolov's research facility which led up to the events that took place during that mission. Big Boss demands to know who set it up but Gene does not answer and moves forward to activate Metal Gear but is stopped by Elisa/Ursala. After mortally wounding Elisa Gene heads to the next room to try to activate Metal gear again, Snake tries to comfort Elisa before she dies but she tells Snake of the grim future that will come to pass because of his family. Snake makes his way to the control room to stop Gene from launching Metal Gear but is too late as it has already been activated. Big Boss and Gene clash with each other during the countdown but is defeated by Big Boss. Gene gives the funds he amassed for Army's Heaven to Big Boss (giving him the foundation he will use later to build Outer Heaven) before dying. Snake then makes his way into the Silo itself to try to destroy Metal Gear, he succeeds with the help of the other Russian soldiers and it falls into the sea.

Soon after Big Boss and Campbell are returned to the states and Big Boss is commended and awarded as a hero once again which establishes his &quot;Greatest Soldier of the 20th century moniker&quot;. While on a phone call with Campbell he tells him he realizes something. &quot;I'm not living unless I'm in battle so I have to find my own reason to fight. I have to pass on what's been handed down to me&quot;, Campball tells Snake that they will meet again someday and hangs up the phone.

==Later career==
When direct American involvement in the Vietnam War started the following year, Big Boss offers his combat services in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East and Far East and participated in Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) as an &quot;unofficial soldier&quot; attached to a team of Green Berets and US Army Ranger units. His skills earn him the &quot;great mythological soldier&quot; moniker. Supposedly (perhaps after the hiatus of the Virtuous Mission and Operation: Snake Eater or by continuity error) he also fights in Congo until the Second Congo Crisis in 1968. Once the conflict Vietnam had ended, Big Boss took part in more than 70 missions attached to groups such as the SOG (Studies and Observations Group), the Wild Geese, and Delta Force. He also adopted a war orphan named Frank Jaeger (who would later become FOXHOUND member Gray Fox) in Vietnam. A year after the FOX unit revolted and was disbanded; Big Boss formed his own unit, FOXHOUND in it's place. 

An abundance of governments, military organizations, and terrorist groups contacted Big Boss to recruit him. However, he declined many (often well-paid) missions, and only participated in conflicts where people's liberation was concerned. This drew attention from journalists, who championed this perfect killer.

In 1972 the U.S. Government brought Big Boss' unconscious body (he was rendered comatose from a battle) to a lab where his genes were extracted to make genetically enhanced soldiers. This project would be known as &quot;Les Enfants Terribles&quot;. The goal was to create genetically perfected soldiers based on Big Boss' DNA. All three offspring of the project were given &quot;Snake&quot; codenames when they reached adulthood.

==Les Enfants Terribles Project==
Big Boss's genes would be used in a pair of secret projects to make the ultimate super-soldiers, one based on genetic information taken while he was in a coma, the other after his death (see the &quot;Genome Soldiers&quot; section below).

In 1972, the Patriots set out a plan to artificially create the most powerful super soldier possible through genetics, in a project called 'Les Enfants Terribles' (a French phrase, literally meaning &quot;the terrible children&quot;). Big Boss at the time was wounded in combat and in a coma, and being regarded as the world's greatest soldier, he was chosen as the project's model. His cells were collected. 

Clones were created from collected cells, combining 20th century analog cloning, and the Super Baby method. An egg was fertilized with one of the cells, and was then let to be divided into eight. The embryos were then transferred into a surrogate mother's uterus. When the eight embryos matured into fetuses, five were intentionally aborted to encourage strong fetal growth in the three remaining fetuses. Two of them were Solid and Liquid Snake. While both brothers are identical at the genetic level, Liquid is led to (wrongly) believe that he is an inferior clone with recessive phenotypes. The technology to alter a gene's phenotype did not exist during the 1970s. &lt;ref&gt;Hideo Kojima, ''Metal Gear Solid naked'' pg. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The third offspring created with the other two was Solidus Snake.

Solid Snake, with his natural self-confidence and determination, seemed to be the best clone. Liquid, having been told that he has the &quot;flawed, recessive genes&quot;, exhibited low self-esteem. However, a short telephone conversation between President Sears (Solidus) and Ocelot revealed that Solid Snake is &quot;inferior&quot; compared to Liquid, who is considered to be the superior clone. Liquid inherited all of the superior genes, Solid all of the inferior genes, and Solidus was a perfect copy of Big Boss, interpreting the same mix of all faulty and perfect genes that the person he was cloned from had. Even though it is Solidus who is considered the perfect mix of superior and inferior that Big Boss had, it was Solid Snake who inherited the majority of Big Boss's looks.

Following their births, the 'Snakes' were separated and raised in different places. Liquid was sent to the UK, while Solid Snake remained in the US. Solidus also remained in the U.S. and trained child-soldiers in the Liberian Civil War in the late 1980s. It is theorized, though not officially confirmed, that Solidus was kept in the U.S. where he was watched, and later used, by the Patriots. 

The lives of all three clones each ostensibly suffer from accelerated aging, a result of their vintage genetic material (the speed of this aging is evident with Solidus Snake, whom in his thirties already resembled Big Boss in his seventies). As of 2009, only Solid Snake is still alive as a whole being, while Liquid's consciousness lives inside Revolver Ocelot. Solidus Snake died at the outcome of the Big Shell incident, killed in a sword fight by his foster son, Jack, who went under the codename Raiden during the Big Shell operation.

==Outer Heaven Uprising==
:''Events in this section take place during '''Metal Gear'''.
In the 1990s, Big Boss used the exorbitant amount of money he had collected over the years from mercenary work to covertly create the fortress nation Outer Heaven, an organization opposed to the Western Powers (and, by proxy, the Patriots who controlled them), all the while ostensibly remaining the commander of the U.S.'s elite FOXHOUND unit. Big Boss also funded the development of the first Metal Gear prototype, called Metal Gear TX-55. It was a weapon system designed to give Outer Heaven military supremacy over the West.

When FOXHOUND was commissioned by the U.S. to infiltrate Outer Heaven and destroy Metal Gear, Big Boss first sent in his most trusted soldier, Gray Fox. Once Gray Fox was captured, Big Boss sent in Solid Snake, at that time FOXHOUND's greenest, least experienced member. Big Boss figured that there was no way that a rookie like Solid Snake could fulfill such a mission, that his efforts would delay further action by the West and buy Big Boss enough time to complete Metal Gear's development.

However, much to Big Boss's surprise, Solid Snake succeeded in defeating Outer Heaven's elite mercenaries and destroying Metal Gear itself. Faced with the failure of his plans, Big Boss confronted Solid Snake in the heart of Outer Heaven and revealed his identity as Outer Heaven's mastermind. After Big Boss activated the base's self-destruct countdown, the two of them engaged in one-on-one combat, dodging between crates and firing at each other. Even in his advanced age, Big Boss proved fast and dangerous, but Solid Snake eventually managed to defeat him.

==Zanzibar Land Disturbance==
:''Events in this section take place during '''Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake'''.
Big Boss survived his battle with Snake and managed to escape Outer Heaven during its destruction. Four years later, he took control of another nation known as Zanzibar Land after his involvement in the War of Mercenaries. Recruiting war orphans from across the Third World and raising them as soldiers, Big Boss hoped to create a nation dedicated to the ideals of warfare and battle. Big Boss also recruited Gray Fox to his cause. To ensure Zanzibar Land's success, Big Boss once again commissioned the creation of a Metal Gear, known as Metal Gear D. This time, Dr. Madnar (the scientist who was forced to develop the original Metal Gear prototype in Outer Heaven) developed the new model of his own free will, after being ostracized by the academic community in the U.S.

Solid Snake once again managed to infiltrate the enemy nation and destroy Metal Gear. 
Snake eventually defeated Fox in hand-to-hand combat and, bruised and unarmed, was once again confronted by a gun-wielding Big Boss. Having spent his entire life on the battlefield, Big Boss could not conceive of a world without war, and attacked Snake in one final battle. Snake managed to create a makeshift flamethrower using an aerosol can and a cigarette lighter, using it to kill Big Boss once and for all.

==Genome Soldiers==
After the death of Big Boss and the downfall of Zanzibar Land, members of Big Boss' mercenary dispatching company (Outer Heaven) are integrated into the Next Generation Special Forces after the U.S. Government purchases their contracts. The team is subsequently merged with Task Force 21 and are given VR training. Members of the team are also secretly enhanced with Big Boss' &quot;soldier&quot; genes, giving them augmented senses and reflexes.

In 2005, the Genome Soldiers took part in what was scheduled to have been a routine training exercise in Shadow Moses Island. The Genome Soldiers and FOXHOUND (under Liquid Snake's command) instead stage a revolt on the island, taking over the nuclear facility (where Metal Gear REX was secretly developed), along with a few hostages. The terrorists (calling themselves the &quot;Sons of Big Boss&quot;) threaten to launch a nuclear strike if the remains of Big Boss were not delivered to them in less than 24 hours. It is revealed that the Genome Soldiers are suffering from genetic defects as a result of their gene therapy treatments and that Big Boss' remains are the key to their survival. 

After the destruction of REX by operative Solid Snake and the death of Liquid, the surviving Genome Soldiers are transferred to the Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire, where they are imprisoned for treason. One Genome Soldier named Johnny Sasaki however managed to avoid being arrested and joined Sergei Gurlukovich's group.

      <comment>/* Liberian Civil War */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Spoiler}}

==Liberian Civil War==
As a child, Raiden was adopted by Solidus Snake, who (unbeknownst to him) had killed his parents. After being given the name &quot;Jack&quot; by Solidus, Raiden became a child soldier from as young as the age of six, in Solidus' &quot;Army of the Devil&quot; as part of the &quot;small boys unit&quot; during the first Liberian Civil War. Like the rest of his unit, he was regularly drugged in order to be conditioned and kept under control. Survival meant he was commended and rewarded, and killing to survive became his only purpose. He was trained personally by Solidus, to the extent that Solidus declared, &quot;Your name... your skills... everything you know, you know from me.&quot; Due to Jack's outstanding kill record, he gained a number of nicknames, two of the most prominent being &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; and &quot;White Devil&quot;, the latter probably in reference to his pale skin and fair hair. When the war ended, Jack was one of the survivors, and Solidus lost track of him.

==Later Life And Career==
After the end of the Civil War, Jack left Liberia for the United States and eventually forgot his past. There he joined the Task Force 21 Corps, where he received further training, and possible mental reconditioning (or else he surpressed his bloody childhood memories, as he had no recollection of them until Solidus jogged his memory when they met again years later) before being eventually deployed on the ill-fated Big Shell mission. He also trained through various VR (virtual reality) simulations, including some which were based on the Shadow Moses and Tanker incidents that Solid Snake was a major participant in.

On April 30th 2007, Jack met Rosemary, who eventually became his girlfriend. Jack loved Rose deeply, but his harsh experiences had left him melancholic and emotionally distant, and he constantly shut her out of his problems. Rose was persistent in getting Jack to open up to her, even during his missions, which became a constant source vexation for him. It isn't until the Big Shell incident that Jack regains his memories and finally opens up to her, explaining that his past had for a long time been a jumbled mess, and even though it haunted him he could never quite put it together to figure out why. Jack's revelation later brings Rose closer to him.

==Big Shell==
:''Events in this section takes place in '''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'''.
Raiden is initially introduced in the Big Shell as &quot;Snake&quot;, serving as a member of what appears to be a newly reinstated FOXHOUND. His features are concealed under a diver's mask. This deception is short-lived, as Jack removes the mask, revealing a youthful appearance completely the opposite of Solid Snake's.  After his true identity is revealed, he is assigned the new codename, &quot;Raiden&quot;, and infiltrates the Big Shell. His mission is to rescue President James Johnson from a terrorist group known as the &quot;Sons of Liberty.&quot; In this mission, he is supported over his CODEC radio by the Colonel, his commanding officer, and Rose, who is an experienced data analyst for the military and Raiden's girlfriend.

Raiden goes on to team up with Solid Snake (masquerading as a U.S. Navy SEAL named &quot;Iroquois Pliskin&quot;) and &quot;Mr. X&quot;, and discovers that the Big Shell is actually a front for &quot;Arsenal Gear&quot;, a mobile battle fortress with an AI (artificial intelligence) that controls the flow of information on the Internet (to protect the interests of an Illuminati-like group known as the Patriots), and that the Sons of Liberty were not mere terrorists, but instead trying to prevent its completion.

==Arsenal Gear==
:''Events in this section takes place in '''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'''.
In the course of this mission, Raiden's forgotten past is revealed. Raiden also learns that if he perishes or fails his mission, which is to eliminate the Sons of Liberty, Olga's baby will die. After disabling Arsenal Gear and the Metal Gear RAYs, Raiden confronts Solidus, discovers that the entire scenario was orchestrated by the Patriots for their S3 (selection for societal sanity) simulation, and that his commanding officer is actually just a digital construct created by GW, the Arsenal Gear's AI. He then completes his mission by confronting and killing Solidus, and is subsequently reunited with Rose, who is pregnant with his child.

Hi, sorry these images are so big.  I will get them resized a bit smaller here soon if someone doesn't replace them first.  I just wanted to get this ball rolling down the incline plane.  Feel free to modify them yourself; I think I did the licensing right to be as free as possible but I am not an expert on that.  So, if not, I here personally grant my (the authors) permission to do what-ever one pleases with these two works of original art. Adding in some examples of common fractions ( 3/4 etc.) by blocking out some of the pieces would be great; not to mention a little more explanation to go with them.[[User:Master.signal|sutton]] 05:05, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

== Addition of Fractions ==
I filled in this section.  I hope it is clear; could use some more examples,though.[[User:Master.signal|sutton]] 05:10, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

== nominator denominated ==
Changed the word &quot;nominator&quot; to &quot;numerator&quot; all over this page.[[User:Master.signal|sutton]] 05:18, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

== anti teacher sentiment ==
Does any one else have a problem with this (in the multiplying fractions section)?  I feel that this is demotivating for students who could otherwise be encouraged to pursue math seriously. .[[User:Master.signal|karrollea]]

== Dollars? ==

I think the money approach is a bad idea... rather talk about cents intead of dollars or just talk about fruits or just something else...I'm saying this because 70% of kids in Africa don't know what a dollar is. --[[User:Sibande|Sibande]] ([[User talk:Sibande|talk]]) 09:59, 31 March 2010 (UTC)

== Target audience ==

This book really needs a clear decision on what its target audience is - pre-school children? primary school kids? adults being alphabetized in Maths? teachers (as a meta-book)? For instance, have a look at the &quot;Multiplying fractions with nice pictures&quot; section: the conflicting tones make it confusing for anyone who reads it, regardless of age (furthermore I don't know what kids call chocolate bar blocks in English, but &quot;stories&quot; is horribly misleading. And I still can't figure out ''what'' Mr. Anaconda is supposed to be...)--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 02:37, 17 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

Baltimore Curriculum:
*Notes: Lessons can be used in conjunction with the Direct Instruction programs in reading, language, writing, and math. Adapt these lessons for your state/local standards.
*Subject: Science 
*Overview: September science lessons deal with taking care of the body through cleanliness, rest, and healthy eating. The teacher can develop healthy habits at the beginning of the year and assist children in following procedures all year long that are developed in September. It is strongly suggested that the teacher request children wash their hands prior to any food consumption. Review proper ways to cover the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing and to wash after sneezing and coughing. Provide opportunity to eat healthy foods at snack time. Emphasize the importance of rest and how the body requires time to 'recharge' if nap time is a part of your day. October science lessons deal with investigating the five senses of the human body. Each lesson is designed to be &quot;hands-on&quot; for the kindergarten-age child. The lessons are sequential, and therefore it is required that they be taught in the sequence written. 
*Suggested Books: Berger, Melvyn. Germs Make Me Sick. New York: HarperCollins, 1985, 1995.
*Grade: K
*Lesson Number: 1
*Topic (sub subject): The Human Body 
*Objectives:
**Recognize that the whole body is covered by skin.
**Understand the importance of washing the skin as protection against germs. 
*Materials
**Paper towels
**Two peeled potatoes, soaking in water to prevent discoloration
**Two paper plates
**A book to read aloud about skin, germs, and cleanliness 
*Procedure (Music, Movement, Art): Read a book to the children that talks about skin, germs, and cleanliness. It is very important to keep our skin clean and healthy with soap and water. Say: We are going to do an experiment to see whether there is dirt on our hands right now. Probably every one of you washed your hands and face, and maybe even your whole bodies before coming to school today. You wash your hands every time you finish going to the bathroom and after you eat your meals. You may think your hands are clean enough.

''Note: This information does not pertain to versions of Celestia prior to 1.5.0''
################################################################
   Warning This page is VERY out of date  for assistance with using SPICE see the Celestia forum 
http://www.shatters.net/forum/
################################################################
It is possible to use JPL's DE405/406 ephemerides with Celestia to compute the positions of the planets more accurately than the default VSOP87 theory does. The tradeoff is that since JPL's ephemeris files are essentially large lookup tables, a lot of memory is required to cover the same time span as VSOP87.

First, you need to download the ephemeris files. They are available here:

ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/unix/de406/

The ones named unxpNNNN.406 are probably of most interest. They contain 300 year blocks of the DE406 ephemeris beginning at year +NNNN. The files name unxmNNNN.406 cover the years prior 1 BCE. Each block is about nine megabytes, so the total size of the entire DE406 is about 180 MB. You don't need to use more than a single block, but if you want more than a 300-year ephemeris, there is a set of tools available on the JPL FTP site. The C tools may be found here:

ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/C-versions/hoffman/

DE405 is a larger and slightly more precise ephemeris than DE406, but DE406 should be more than accurate enough for most usages. The differences are explained in this document:

ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/README.txt

To use JPL ephemeris, you need to place in Celestia's data directory and name it 'jpleph.dat'. Then, you should modify the CustomOrbits of the planets defined in solarsys.ssc to use the JPL ephemeris instead of the default VSOP87 orbits. Here are the available CustomOrbit names:

* ''Heliocentric orbits for the planets''
 jpl-mercury-sun
 jpl-venus-sun
 jpl-earth-sun
 jpl-mars-sun
 jpl-jupiter-sun
 jpl-saturn-sun
 jpl-uranus-sun
 jpl-neptune-sun
 jpl-pluto-sun

* ''Planet orbits relative to the solar system barycenter''
 jpl-mercury-ssb
 jpl-venus-ssb
 jpl-earth-ssb
 jpl-mars-ssb
 jpl-jupiter-ssb
 jpl-saturn-ssb
 jpl-uranus-ssb
 jpl-neptune-ssb
 jpl-pluto-ssb

* ''Position of the Earth-Moon barycenter relative to Sun and SSB''
 jpl-emb-sun
 jpl-emb-ssb

* ''Position of the Earth relative to the Earth-Moon barycenter''
 jpl-earth-emb

* ''Geocentric and barycentric position of the Moon''
 jpl-moon-earth
 jpl-moon-emb

* ''Position of the Sun relative to the SSB''
 jpl-sun-ssb

The positions computed for jpl-mars, jpl-jupiter, jpl-saturn, jpl-uranus, jpl-neptune, and jpl-pluto are the barycenters of the systems. Venus and Mercury have no moons, so the barycenters are exactly the center of the planets. Although Mars does have moons, they're so tiny relative to Mars that Horizons appears to treat the Mars system barycenter and the center of Mars as identical. There's a slight inconsistency with jpl-earth: it gives the position of Earth. If you want the Earth-Moon barycenter, then use jpl-emb. 

In case you are curious as to how much the positions of the giant planets deviates from their system barycenters, a rough calculation for Uranus and Titania gives ~20km. The mass ratio of the Galilean satellites and Jupiter is similar, though they are further away from Jupiter and will thus displace the barycenter more.

=== Reference frame ===

Although the native reference frame of the JPL ephemerides is the Earth mean equator and equinox of J2000.0. Celestia internally transforms these (via a fixed rotation) to the J2000 ecliptic frame. This allows the default VSOP87 orbits to be replaced with JPL orbits by simply changing the CustomOrbit. The sole exception is the Moon. The default reference plane for moons is the plane of the equator of date for the planet that the moon orbits. Thus, when changing the orbit of the Moon to use the JPL ephemeris, the orbit frame must be overridden:

 OrbitFrame {
     EclipticJ2000 { Center &quot;Sol/Earth&quot; }
 }

=== Example ===

There are two ways to switch to using from using VSOP87 series to JPL ephemerides for the planets. You can either directly modify data/solarsys.ssc, or you can create a simple add-on that takes advantage of the ''Modify'' disposition for SSC objects. Following is an example that replaces the orbits of the all the solar system's planets and the Moon. Copy and paste this example into a new .ssc file in your extras directory, and the next time you start Celestia, the positions of the planets will be computed from the JPL ephemeris in data/jpleph.dat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Celestia uses catalogs to define its objects. It loads SSC catalogs only once, when it starts. First it loads the ones in its &lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt; directory in alphabetical order, then it loads the ones in the &lt;tt&gt;extras&lt;/tt&gt; directories, also in alphabetical order. 

=== What's an SSC file? ===

&quot;&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;olar &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;ystem &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;atalog&quot; files are primarily used to define the objects which can be found in a stellar system, such as planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and spacecraft. They also have four other uses: they can define alternative surface textures, locations on or near an object, and orbital reference points. An SSC file can also edit objects which have been defined in other SSC catalog files.

* Objects are defined by specifying a quoted name, the quoted path to the object, and a list of parameters. The type of object is specified by a Class statement among its parameters or will be assumed from the Radius specified for it. 
* Alternative surfaces are defined by prefixing the object's name by the keyword '''AltSurface'''. Their definitions can include any of the parameters related to surface textures. 
* Location labels are defined by prefixing the object's name by the keyword '''Location'''. Their definitions use special keywords.
* Orbital reference points are available only in Celestia v1.5.0 or later. They are defined by prefixing the object's name by the keyword '''ReferencePoint'''. Their definitions can include any of the parameters related to orbits or trajectories. 
* Editing a previously defined object can be done by prefixing the object's name by one of the keywords '''Modify''' or '''Replace'''. The revised definition can include any of the parameters used to define objects.

SSC catalog files are either in the &quot;data&quot; directory of the [[Celestia]] root or in an Add-on's root subdirectory (itself in Celestia's &lt;code&gt;extras&lt;/code&gt; directory).

Celestia's catalog files are plain text files, and can thus be modified with your favourite text editor.

Celestia uses the file &lt;tt&gt;Celestia/data/solarsys.ssc&lt;/tt&gt; to define most of the bodies that are in our own Solar System.

===Structure of an object definition===

'''&quot;&lt;tt&gt;object name&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;tt&gt;object path&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; { ...''parameters''... }'''


The first elements in an SSC object's definition are its name and its &quot;path&quot;.

&lt;tt&gt;object name&lt;/tt&gt; = Name of the object, in quotes (e.g. &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Mercury&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;). Provisional designations (e.g. &quot;&lt;tt&gt;S/2006 S 5&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;) are okay but won't be able to have secondaries (see below: confusion is caused by the &quot;/&quot; character.). As of Celestia 1.6.0, multiple names separated by colons are allowed (&quot;Eris:2003 UB313&quot;).

&lt;tt&gt;object path&lt;/tt&gt; = The sequence of primaries that lead to the object; 
in other words, the bodies that it orbits around. 
Paths start with a star and work down from there. 

:The path separator is a forward slash (&quot;/&quot;). For example, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Mercury&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;'s path is just &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Sol&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. The path of &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Romulus&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Remus&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;, the moons of the minor planet &quot;&lt;tt&gt;(87) Sylvia&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;, are both &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Sol/(87) Sylvia&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. The path of a Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) on the surface of the Moon would be &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Sol/Earth/Moon&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. Paths are also used in Celestia's browser menus.

:Because of the path separator used by Celestia, the names of objects known only by their provisional designations may need to be represented differently should they have secondaries. Alternatively, one could represent the slash (&quot;/&quot;) by a &quot;fraction slash&quot; (HTML &quot;&amp;amp;frasl;&quot; or &quot;&amp;amp;#8260;&quot; : &quot;&amp;frasl;&quot;) or a vertical bar (&quot;|&quot;).

The object's descriptive ''parameters'' follow within the accolades (&quot;braces&quot; or &quot;squiggly brackets&quot;: {} )

=== Representing colors ===

'''Color [ ''&lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt;'' ]'''


Colors are represented using the R G B (red green blue) convention. Each of the three numbers in the 0.0 to 1.0 range represents the saturation of that colour component. 0.0 0.0 0.0 is black, 1.0 1.0 1.0 is white, 1.0 0.0 0.0 is pure red, and so on.


=== Comments ===

'''#'''


The pound sign (&quot;crosshatch&quot; or &quot;sharp sign&quot;) begins a comment: whatever lies after this sign up to the next line terminator is ignored by Celestia.

----

== Object parameters ==
Below is an alphabetical list of the parameters used to define an SSC object.
Some of these parameters themselves require another list of parameters within {}.

=== Albedo &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===

The [[w:Bond albedo|Bond albedo]] of the object: a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (black to white, perfect absorber to perfect reflector). This determines the brightness of the point used to represent the object when it is too small to draw. If set to 0, the object is never drawn.

=== Atmosphere { ...''parameters''... } ===

Defines an object's atmosphere. This is not part of the surface texture of an SSC object. It's drawn surrounding the object. The possible parameters within the accolades (&quot;{ }&quot;) are:

==== CloudMap &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ====
:The cloud texture (a transparent png or dds).

:For more information, see the page [[Celestia/Textures]].

==== CloudHeight &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
:The cloud altitude in kilometres.

==== CloudSpeed &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
:The cloud speed in km/h (in the direct rotation direction?).


''The following parameters are deprecated in Celestia v1.5.0 and later. Mie and Rayleigh scattering parameters should be used instead.''

==== Height &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
:Thickness of the atmosphere in kilometres.

==== Lower [ &lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt; ] ====
:Colour of the atmosphere near the surface.

==== Upper [ &lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt; ] ====
:Colour of the atmosphere near its top.

==== Sky [ &lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt; ] ====
:Colour of the sky when seen from ''inside'' the atmosphere.

==== Sunset [ &lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt; ] ====
:Colour of the sunset.


----

=== Beginning ''f'' or &quot;''YYYY MM DD HH:MM:SS''&quot; ===
Specifies a time before which the object doesn't exist. 

The Beginning time may be provided as a floating point number, in which case it is interpreted an astronomical Julian date, or it may be provided as a quoted string, in which case it is interpreted as a Gregorian date.

If it is a quoted Gregorian date, &lt;tt&gt;YYYY MM DD&lt;/tt&gt; = year, month, day (integers); &lt;tt&gt;HH:MM:SS&lt;/tt&gt; = hour, minute, second (integers). Since version 1.3.1, Celestia converts these time-stamps into Julian Dates internally. A date to Julian Date and back converter can be found at the [http://www.aavso.org/observing/aids/jdcalendar.shtml U.S. Naval Observatory].

=== BumpHeight &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===
Defaulting to 2.0, the &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; parameter defines the vertical scale of the '''Bumpmap'''.

=== BumpMap &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ===
A texture file (JPG, PNG, or DDS) used to generate relief.

For more information, see the page [[Celestia/Textures]].

=== BlendTexture &lt;tt&gt;bool&lt;/tt&gt; ===
The &quot;&lt;tt&gt;bool&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; argument is either &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;. BlendTexture is used with '''&quot;Color&quot;''' to colorize the surface texture image. The Texture's individual color channels are multiplied by the corresponding Color values.

=== Class &quot;&lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ===
Class of object: one of '''&lt;tt&gt;planet moon spacecraft comet asteroid invisible&lt;/tt&gt;'''. By default, Celestia assigns Class based on the object's '''Radius'''. It is used by Celestia's View Options menu and determines the color of the orbit path drawn for this body. You could assign an artificial satellite to the &quot;moon&quot; class so its orbit is displayed along with those of the true moons. An object with a class of &lt;tt&gt;invisible&lt;/tt&gt; is not drawn. It can be used as an orbital barycenter, orbited by one or more visible objects.

{{Celx:v160}}
Celestia 1.6.0 adds several new object classes. The complete list of object types is:

* planet
* moon
* dwarfplanet
* minormoon
* asteroid
* comet
* spacecraft
* surfacefeature
* component
* diffuse
* invisible

Celestia treats planet, moon, dwarfplanet, minormoon, and asteroid as identical except for when showing labels and orbit paths in the 3D window, and object categories in the solar system browser. Whether an object is a planet or dwarf planet can be decided based on the criteria set forth in the IAU's 2006 resolution on the definition of a planet. Ultimately, it doesn't make too much difference in Celestia: the orbit and label of the body can be colored differently, but that is all. Asteroid is not a category officially defined by the IAU, but in Celestia this class is used for any natural, solid object that orbits a star and is too small to be a dwarf planet (i.e. it doesn't have enough mass to assume an ellipsoidal shape) and is not a comet.

A moon is a natural object in orbit around a planet. The distinction between moon and minor moon is arbitrary: Mars's two small satellites are both classified as moons, while dozens of objects of similar size orbiting the outer planets are minor moons. The minor moon class was introduced to eliminate the distracting clutter of moon orbits around the outer planets of the Solar System; a user now has a choice of whether or not to display the orbits of the swarm of rocks orbiting Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Comets are treated very much like asteroids, but are drawn with dust tails when sufficiently close to the Sun and labeled in a distinct color. Some objects in the Solar System have both comet and asteroid designations, such as Chiron. Such dual classification is not possible in Celestia.

Human-made objects traveling through space should be assigned the class spacecraft. In addition to affecting label and orbit color, slightly different information is displayed for spacecraft than for natural objects. The surface feature class should be used for buildings and other landmarks fixed to the surface of a planet, moon, or asteroid. Objects floating in space are rendered as points of light when they occupy less than a pixel on screen. This effect looks unrealisitic for objects on the surface of a planet, and so it is disabled by default for surface features. The component class is used for parts of either surface features or spacecraft that are defined as separate objects in an ssc file. As with surface features, they aren't shown as points of light at a distance.

The diffuse class should be used for gas clouds, dust plumes, and the like. By default, diffuse objects cannot be selected by clicking. They are also not labeled or visible at a distance as a point of light.

Warning: '''LongLat''' does not place objects correctly when used with '''Class &quot;surfacefeature&quot;''' in Celestia v1.5.0 and later. Use '''FixedPosition [ x y z ]''' or '''FixedPosition { Planetographic [ Long Lat Alt ] }''' instead.

=== Color [ &lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt; ] ===
Colorizes the object when there is no texture. Also specifies the color of the albedo point when the object is too small to resolve.

R, G and B should have values between 0 and 1, inclusive.

=== CustomOrbit &quot;&lt;tt&gt;orbit name&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ===
Invokes built-in high-precision orbit computations, such as  &quot;&lt;tt&gt;vsop87-mercury&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. CustomOrbit overrides EllipticalOrbit. If an invalid orbit name is provided, CustomOrbit is ignored.

For details, see [[Celestia/Trajectories#CustomOrbit|Celestia/Trajectories, section CustomOrbit]].

----

=== EllipticalOrbit { ...''parameters''... } ===
Defines an elliptical orbit (the generic case).

'''EllipticalOrbit''' parameters correspond to traditional Keplerian orbital parameters. A description of those parameters is in the [[Astrodynamics]] WikiBook, in its chapter on [[Astrodynamics/Classical_Orbit_Elements|Classical Orbit Elements]].

For more information, see [[Celestia/Trajectories#EllipticalOrbit|Celestia/Trajectories, section EllipticalOrbit]].

==== Eccentricity &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
Optionally determines the shape of the orbit. In fact, the name '''EllipticalOrbit''' is a bit misleading since the orbit may be circular, elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic depending upon the eccentricity:
** eccentricity = 0 -- circle
** 0 &lt; eccentricity &lt; 1 -- ellipse
** eccentricity = 1 -- parabola
** eccentricity &gt; 1 -- hyperbola

:''Note: An eccentricity of exactly 1 does not work in Celestia.''

:If '''Eccentricity''' is not provided, a circle is assumed.

==== Epoch &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; or &quot;''YYYY MM DD HH:MM:SS''&quot;====
Optional, the Epoch of the orbital elements (&lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, the date when they are valid, can be specified either with a number, which represents an astronomical Julian Date, or by a quoted string, which represents a conventional Gregorian date. If '''Epoch''' is omitted, 1 January 2000 is assumed.

For example,
&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;2452583.763194445 # 2002 Nov 5 06:19UT (Galileo encounter)&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;is the same epoch value as
&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&quot;2002 11 5 6:19:00&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

Starting with Celestia v1.5.0, '''Epoch''' must be specified in TDB. See [[Celestia/Time Scales]] for more information about TDB and UTC.

==== SemiMajorAxis &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
One of SemiMajorAxis or PericenterDistance is required.
The Semi-major axis of the orbit is in astronomical units (AUs) for objects which orbit around Stars or Barycenters, kilometres for everything else.

Note: the SemiMajorAxis of an hyperbolic orbit has a negative value.

==== PericenterDistance &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;====
Alternate for SemiMajorAxis, is in astronomical units (AUs) for objects which orbit around Stars or Barycenters, kilometres for everything else.

==== ArgOfPericenter &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
Optional, the orbit's argument of pericenter, in degrees (measured from the ascending node).  Specify either &lt;tt&gt;LongOfPericenter&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;ArgOfPericenter&lt;/tt&gt;, not both. If both are specified, &lt;tt&gt;ArgOfPericenter&lt;/tt&gt; is used.

==== LongOfPericenter &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
Optional, the orbit's longitude of pericenter, in degrees. This is the sum of the argument of pericenter and the longitude of the ascending node. Specify either &lt;tt&gt;LongOfPericenter&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;ArgOfPericenter&lt;/tt&gt;, not both. If both are specified, &lt;tt&gt;ArgOfPericenter&lt;/tt&gt; is used.

==== AscendingNode &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
Optionally defines the longitude of the point in its orbit where the orbiting body crosses the reference plane going &quot;upward&quot; or &quot;northward&quot;. It is measured in degrees from the fundametal direction. If '''AscendingNode''' is not specified, a value of 0 degrees is assumed.

==== Inclination &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
Optional orbital inclination, in degrees. It is with respect to the Ecliptic for the Solar System's planets, with respect to the primary's equator for everything else. Starting with Celestia v1.5.0, any of a number of different reference planes can be specified. See [[Celestia/Reference_Frames|Reference Frames]] for details. If '''Inclination''' is not specified, a value of 0 degrees is assumed.

==== MeanAnomaly &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
Optional, the object's mean anomaly for Epoch, in degrees. This is the time that has elapsed since pericenter, divided by the orbital period, times 360 degrees. Specify either &lt;tt&gt;MeanLongitude&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;MeanAnomaly&lt;/tt&gt;, not both. If both are specified, &lt;tt&gt;MeanAnomaly&lt;/tt&gt; is used.

==== MeanLongitude &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
Optional, the object's mean longitude, in degrees. This is the sum of the longitude of pericenter and the mean anomaly. Specify either &lt;tt&gt;MeanLongitude&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;MeanAnomaly&lt;/tt&gt;, not both. If both are specified, &lt;tt&gt;MeanAnomaly&lt;/tt&gt; is used.

==== Period &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
Required, the orbital period is given in Earth years for objects which orbit around Stars or Barycenters, Earth solar days for everything else.


For a closed, elliptical orbit around our Sun,

&lt;math&gt;P = \sqrt{( q / ( 1 - e)) ^3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
or &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P = a^{1.5}&lt;/math&gt;

When defining an hyperbolic orbit around our Sun, set period to be

&lt;math&gt;P = \sqrt{( q / ( e - 1)) ^3}&lt;/math&gt;

where: 
:&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the period measured in years, 
:&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the pericenter distance measured in AU,
:&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the eccentricity, and
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the semimajor axis of the orbit, also measured in AU, and which has a negative value for hyperbolic orbits.

----

=== Emissive &lt;tt&gt;boolean&lt;/tt&gt; ===
Specifies whether the object should seem to glow (true) or should be illuminated by light sources (false). Its default value is false.

&lt;tt&gt;Emissive true&lt;/tt&gt; objects are bright, but are not light sources. They do not provide any illumination for other objects or cause them to cast shadows.

=== Ending ''f'' or &quot;''YYYY MM DD HH:MM:SS''&quot; ===
Sets a time after which the object doesn't exist.

The Ending time may be provided as a floating point number, in which case it is interpreted the astronomical Julian date, or it may be provided as a quoted string, in which case it is interpreted as the Gregorian date.

If it is a quoted Gregorian date, &lt;tt&gt;YYYY MM DD&lt;/tt&gt; = year, month, day (integers); &lt;tt&gt;HH:MM:SS&lt;/tt&gt; = hour, minute, second (integers). Since version 1.3.1, Celestia converts these time-stamps into Julian Dates internally. A date to Julian Date and back converter can be found at the [http://www.aavso.org/observing/aids/jdcalendar.shtml U.S. Naval Observatory].

=== EquatorAscendingNode &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===

Ascending node, in degrees, of the object's equatorial plane.

''This object rotational parameter is deprecated in Celestia v1.5.0 and later.''

===FixedPosition [&lt;tt&gt; ''f f f''&lt;/tt&gt; ]===

''Available only in v1.5.0 or later.''

An orbital specification which positions the object at a fixed position relative to its '''OrbitFrame'''. See the page on [[Celestia/Trajectories|orbits and trajectories]] for more information.

=== HazeColor [ &lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt; ] ===
Atmospheric haze colour. Only works for Nvidia graphics cards. In Celestia v1.5.0 one can use Atmosphere Mie and Rayleigh scattering parameters instead, which work for all graphics cards which support OpenGL v2.0.

=== HazeDensity &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===
Atmospheric haze density, a number in the 0.0 to 1.0 range. Only works for Nvidia graphics cards. In Celestia v1.5.0 one can use Atmosphere Mie and Rayleigh scattering parameters instead, which work for all graphics cards which support OpenGL v2.0.

=== InfoURL &quot;&lt;tt&gt;URL&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ===
The URL of a Web page which describes the object.

=== LongLat [ &lt;tt&gt;Long Lat Alt&lt;/tt&gt; ] ===
'''Obsolete''' ''Deprecated in Celestia v1.5.0 and later''

Previously used to define a place's position, in the object's reference frame. &lt;tt&gt;Long&lt;/tt&gt; is the East longitude (in degrees), &lt;tt&gt;Lat&lt;/tt&gt; its latitude, and &lt;tt&gt;Alt&lt;/tt&gt; the altitude (in kilometres). Longitude is measured toward the East. West longitude can be specified as a negative value.

'''Warning:''' LongLat does not place objects correctly when used with '''OrbitFrame''', '''SurfaceObject''', or '''Object &quot;Surfacefeature&quot;''' in Celestia v1.5.0 and later. Use '''FixedPosition [ ''x y z'' ]''' or '''FixedPosition { Planetographic [ ''Long Lat Alt'' ] }''' instead.

=== Mesh &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ===
A 3D model file (cmod, cms, or 3ds) describing a non-spherical object. If no '''Mesh''' is specified, the object is assumed to be spherical. These files must be in a directory named &quot;\models&quot;. A '''Texture''' may be draped onto the mesh. See the page on [[Celestia/3D Models|3D Models]] for more information.

=== MeshCenter [ &lt;tt&gt;x y z&lt;/tt&gt; ] ===
Offset of the mesh with respect to its center.

=== MeshScale &lt;tt&gt;scaleFactor&lt;/tt&gt;===

MeshScale is only used when an object has a mesh file and NormalizeMesh is set to false. It specifies the scale factor needed to convert the mesh's internal units into kilometers. For example, if the mesh file has coordinates given in units of meters, the MeshScale should be set to 0.001:

 MeshScale 0.001

When NormalizeMesh is true (the default), MeshScale is ignored, and Celestia automatically scales the mesh to fit inside the sphere with a size equal to the value of the object's Radius property.

=== NightTexture &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ===
The night-side texture of the object (JPG, PNG, or DDS; use PNG or DDS for transparency).

For more information, see the page [[Celestia/Textures]].

===NormalMap &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ===
A map of surface normal vectors used to describe the irregularities in the surface.

For more information, see the page [[Celestia/Textures]].

===NormalizeMesh &lt;tt&gt;boolean&lt;/tt&gt; ===
Specifies whether Celestia should apply automatic scaling and centering to a mesh file. This property is true by default.

Overriding automatic scaling of meshes is useful when creating multicomponent spacecraft which have their parts in different mesh files. Celestia's automatic scaling and centering can make it very difficult to get the components to align with each other. When NormalizeMesh is false, the mesh is scaled by an amount specified by the MeshScale property. The Radius property doesn't affect the size of the mesh; it effectively just gives the radius of a bounding sphere for the object. The add-on creator must take care to ensure that the Radius is large enough to contain the scaled mesh, otherwise the Celestia may skip rendering the mesh even at times when it is actually in view.

=== Oblateness &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===
The oblateness of a spherical object when no '''Mesh''' is specified. Oblateness is defined as 1 minus the ratio of the polar to equatorial diameters.

=== Obliquity &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===
The object's rotational obliquity, in degrees. The name of this property is misleading: obliquity is angle between the rotation axis and the normal to the mean orbital plane, but in Celestia this quantity is the angle between the rotation axis and the normal to the body's ''reference plane'', typically the ecliptic for planets. Along with &quot;EquatorAscendingNode&quot;, defines the axis of rotation.

''This object rotational parameter is deprecated in Celestia v1.5.0 and later. The new rotation model syntax should be used instead.''

===OrbitFrame { ''...parameters...'' }===

''Available only in v1.5.0 or later.''

An '''OrbitFrame''' defines the reference coordinate system for the other orbital parameters of the SSC object. See the page on 
[[Celestia/Trajectories|orbits and trajectories]] for details.

Warning: '''LongLat''' does not place objects correctly when used with '''OrbitFrame''' in Celestia v1.5.0 and later. Use '''FixedPosition [ x y z ]''' or '''FixedPosition { Planetographic [ Long Lat Alt ] }''' instead.

===Orientation [ angle x y z ]===

Mesh orientation specified in angle-axis format.

'''Orientation''' is applied to the model before the rotation model. It is typically used to transform a mesh into a different coordinate system. Unlike the rotation model, '''Orientation''' does not affect the body fixed frame of an object.

=== OverlayTexture &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ===
A texture overlaid onto the main texture (PNG or DDS for transparency).

For more information, see the page [[Celestia/Textures]].

Note: there is a bug in Celestia v1.4.1 which causes OverlayTextures not to be drawn when the OpenGL 2.0 render path is selected. They are drawn by the other render paths. This problem is fixed in Celestia v1.5.0.

=== PrecessionRate &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===
The axis or rotation's precession rate, in radians per day.

''This object rotational parameter is deprecated in Celestia v1.5.0 and later. The new rotation model syntax should be used instead.''

=== Radius &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===
The equatorial radius of a spherical object, in kilometres. Also scales 3D models to the specified size.

----

=== Rings { ...''parameters''... } ===
Description of an object's rings.

==== Inner &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
The rings' inner edge, in kilometres from the object's centre.

==== Outer &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ====
The rings' outer edge, in kilometres from the object's centre.

==== Texture &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ====
The ring texture (PNG or DDS for transparency).

For more information, see the page [[Celestia/Textures]].

==== Color [ &lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt;] ====
The ring colour, when no texture is specified.

R, G and B should have values between 0 and 1, inclusive.

----

=== RotationEpoch &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===

The epoch of the rotation description (?).

''This object rotational parameter is deprecated in Celestia v1.5.0 and later. The new rotation model syntax should be used instead.''

=== RotationOffset &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===
Celestia lines the object up with its prime meridian; the offset (in degrees) is the object's phase, in order for the textures and mesh to line up correctly.

''This object rotational parameter is deprecated in Celestia v1.5.0 and later.''

=== RotationPeriod &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===
The object's rotation period in hours.

''This object rotational parameter is deprecated in Celestia v1.5.0 and later.''

===SampledOrbit &quot;''filename''&quot;===

File of Julian date and xyz coordinates.

Takes priority over [[Celestia/SSC File#EllipticalOrbit|'''EllipticalOrbit''']].

For details, see [[Celestia/Trajectories#SampledOrbit|Celestia/Trajectories, section SampledOrbit]].

===SampledTrajectory {...parameters...}===

''Requires v1.5.0 or later.''

Specifies a trajectory based on a file of Julian date / xyz coordinate records. SampledTrajectory is very similar to SampledOrbit with some added control over precision and interpolation.

Takes priority over [[Celestia/SSC File#SampledOrbit|'''SampledOrbit''']].

For details, see [[Celestia/Trajectories#SampledTrajectory|Celestia/Trajectories, section SampledTrajectory]].

===ScriptedOrbit { ''parameters'' }===
''Requires v1.5.0 or later.''

See [[Celestia/Trajectories#ScriptedOrbit|Celestia/Trajectories, section ScriptedOrbit]].

=== SpecularColor [ &lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt; ] ===
Colour of the specular reflection. '''SpecularColor''' must be specified if a '''SpecularTexture''' is used. Without it, no specularity is shown.

=== SpecularPower &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; ===
The intensity of the reflection; &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; must be a positive number with a value of 1 or more.  Smaller values produce a larger, more diffuse spot, while larger values produce a smaller, more intense spot. '''SpecularPower''' must be specified if a '''SpecularTexture''' is used. No '''SpecularPower''' or a value less than 1 will cause Celestia's rendering engine to do strange things.

=== SpecularTexture &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ===
A .jpg, .png, .dds or .ctx image used to define areas with a specular reflection. White = reflective, black = dull. Requires both '''SpecularPower''' and '''SpecularColor'''.

For more information, see the page [[Celestia/Textures]].

===SpiceOrbit { ''parameters'' }===

''Requires v1.5.0 or later.''

See [[Celestia/Trajectories#SpiceOrbit|Celestia/Trajectories, section SpiceOrbit]].

=== Texture &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ===

For more information, see the page [[Celestia/Textures]].

A texture image (any of the filetypes PNG, JPG, or DDS) draped over the object's mesh or spheroid. An asterisk wildcard (*) may be used for the extension (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;Texture &quot;mercury.*&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;). Textures are rooted in the &quot;\textures&quot; directory, and sorted in three subdirectories: &quot;\hires&quot; for high resolution, &quot;\medres&quot; for medium resolution, and &quot;\lores&quot; for low resolution.

When looking for texture image files, by default Celestia looks first in &quot;medres&quot;, then &quot;lores&quot;, and finally in &quot;hires&quot;. The keyboard shortcuts &quot;R&quot; and &quot;r&quot; change which directory is searched first.

''requires Celestia v1.6.0 or later (or build from SourceForge svn repository)''

See http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12050
and
[[Celestia/160Features#Object_timelines]]

Provides a way to structure multiple, sequential objects as a single object. A space mission consisting of multiple parts can be organized with a single name.

===UniformRotation { ...''parameters''... }===

''Available only in Celestia v1.5.0 or later.''

'''UniformRotation''' replaces the older stand-alone SSC object rotational parameters by a block containing appropriate parameters describing the object's orientation. In addition to '''UniformRotation''', blocks for '''FixedRotation''', '''PrecessingRotation''', '''SampledOrientation''', and '''ScriptedRotation''' also are available. 

An object's rotation is defined to be relative to its '''BodyFrame {}'''.

See the pages on [[Celestia/Rotation_Models|Rotation Models]] and [[Celestia/Reference_Frames|Reference Frames]] for details.

===Visible &lt;tt&gt;boolean&lt;/tt&gt;===

''Available only in Celestia v1.6.0 or later.''

The setting of the visible property determines whether an object can be seen. This property affects the visibility of the object's geometry, label, and orbit path. The default value of Visible is true for all objects other than reference points. Usually, setting an object's visibility to false is only done if when it's expected that a user may run a script to reveal the object. Setting the visibility of a reference point to true is useful when you want its orbit and label to be shown (e.g. the Pluto−Charon barycenter in the standard Celestia 1.6.0 package.)

== AltSurface ''&quot;&lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;tt&gt;object path&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;'' { ...''parameters''... } ==

Used to define a set of alternate surface textures for an object, such as a &quot;limit of knowledge&quot; or &quot;topography map&quot;. 

===&quot;&lt;tt&gt;''name''&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;===
is what shows up in the object's contextual menu in Celestia. This text need not be unique: the same name can be used for AltSurfaces of several different objects. When a particular AltSurface name is selected in the popup contextual menu for one object, the AltSurfaces with that same name are shown on all objects. If an AltSurface with the selected name does not exist for an object, the &quot;normal&quot; (default) surface is shown instead.

===&quot;&lt;tt&gt;''object path''&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;===
is the full path of the object, including its own name, on which to draw this alternate surface. e.g. &quot;Sol/Earth/Moon&quot; would tell Celestia that this is an alternative surface for our own Moon. 

===''parameters''===
An AltSurface's ''parameters'' can be any of the parameters which describe the surface textures of an SSC object. For details of each, see their corresponding entries above. 

* BlendTexture &lt;tt&gt;bool&lt;/tt&gt;
* BumpHeight &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;
* BumpMap &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; 
* Color [ &lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt; ] 
* NormalMap &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;
* OverlayTexture &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; 
* SpecularColor [ &lt;tt&gt;R G B&lt;/tt&gt; ] 
* SpecularPower &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;
* SpecularTexture &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;
* Texture &quot;&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;

==ReferencePoint ''&quot;&lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;tt&gt;object path&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;'' { ...''parameters''... } ==

''Available only in Celestia v1.5.0 or later.''

A '''ReferencePoint''' can be used to define an orbital barycenter. It's an invisible position around which other bodies can orbit.

===&quot;''&lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;''&quot;===
The name of the '''ReferencePoint'''

===&quot;''&lt;tt&gt;object path&lt;/tt&gt;''&quot;===
The path to the '''ReferencePoint''', specifying the bodies around which it orbits.

===''parameters''===

A '''ReferencePoint''' is defined using those SSC parameters which  define an orbit: CustomOrbit, EllipticalOrbit and SampledOrbit. See their definitions above.

OrbitFrame, FixedPosition, SpiceOrbit and ScriptedOrbit also can be used. See the page on [[Celestia/Trajectories| orbits and trajectories]] for more information about these new parameters.

Only orbit and position parameters are used. Rotation and orientation parameters are not relevant and are ignored.

==SurfaceObject ''&quot;&lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;tt&gt;object path&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;'' { ...''parameters''... } ==

''Available in Celestia v1.6.0 and later versions.''

Use of the '''SurfaceObject''' keyword invokes several useful defaults:

* The object's default '''OrbitFrame''' is the '''BodyFixed''' frame of the parent object
* The object's default '''BodyFrame''' is topocentric, with its Z axis pointing toward the zenith, its Y axis pointing toward the parent body's North Pole, and its X axis pointing to the East.
* The object's default '''Class''' is &quot;surfacefeature&quot;

Warning: '''LongLat''' does not place objects correctly when used with '''SurfaceObject''' in Celestia v1.5.0 and later. Use '''FixedPosition [ x y z ]''' or '''FixedPosition { Planetographic [ Long Lat Alt ] }''' instead.

==Location ''&quot;&lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;tt&gt;object path&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;'' { ...''parameters''... } ==
'''Location''' is an SSC directive used to designate a point of interest on an object in Celestia, such as Earth's major cities, where Pathfinder landed on Mars, or Apollo 11 on the Moon, etc. Celestia includes several .SSC catalogs of Locations, such as &quot;&lt;object&gt;_locs.ssc&quot; in the &quot;data&quot; directory. The display of '''Locations''' is toggled by the &quot;&amp;&quot; keystroke, and the &quot;Render:Locations...&quot; menu controls other aspects of their display.

===&quot;&lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;===
The name of the '''Location'''

===&quot;&lt;tt&gt;object path&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;===
The full path of the object on or near which the '''Location''' is to be placed, including the name of that object.

Used to define a place's position, in the object's reference frame. &lt;tt&gt;Long&lt;/tt&gt; is the East longitude (in degrees), &lt;tt&gt;Lat&lt;/tt&gt; its latitude, and &lt;tt&gt;Alt&lt;/tt&gt; the altitude (in kilometres). Longitude is measured toward the East. West longitude can be specified as a negative value.

====Size &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;====
the radius of the '''Location''' in km. Smaller sizes are not drawn until the viewpoint gets closer to them.

====Importance &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;====
alternative to '''Size'''

====Type &quot;&lt;tt&gt;string&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;====

Celestia recognizes many of the two-letter topographical types defined in the [http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/jsp/append5.jsp  USGS Gazetteer]:
*  &quot;AA&quot; = Crater
*  &quot;AS&quot; = Astrum
*  &quot;CA&quot; = Catena
*  &quot;CH&quot; = Chaos
*  &quot;CM&quot; = Chasma
*  &quot;CR&quot; = Corona
*  &quot;DO&quot; = Dorsum
*  &quot;FO&quot; = Fossa
*  &quot;FL&quot; = Fluctus
*  &quot;FR&quot; = Farrum
*  &quot;LF&quot; = LandingSite (Lunar Feature)
*  &quot;LI&quot; = Linea
*  &quot;ME&quot; = Mare
*  &quot;MN&quot; = Mensa
*  &quot;MO&quot; = Mons
*  &quot;PE&quot; = Patera
*  &quot;PL&quot; = Planitia
*  &quot;PM&quot; = Planum
*  &quot;RE&quot; = Regio
*  &quot;RI&quot; = Rima
*  &quot;RT&quot; = Reticulum
*  &quot;RU&quot; = Rupes
*  &quot;TA&quot; = Terra
*  &quot;TE&quot; = Tessera
*  &quot;UN&quot; = Undae
*  &quot;VA&quot; = Vallis
*  &quot;XX&quot; = Other

plus a few longer categories:
*  &quot;City&quot;
*  &quot;Crater&quot; (but &quot;AA&quot; is preferred)
*  &quot;Landing Site&quot;
*  &quot;Observatory&quot;

==Editing Directives==

''Available in Celestia v1.4.0 and later versions.''

An SSC file can be used to edit objects which were defined in previously loaded SSC files. You do not have to use a text editor to change their contents. This makes it possible for an Addon to update the SSC catalogs which are included in Celestia's distribution. You do not have to edit them manually every time Celestia is upgraded to a new version.

There is no '''Delete''' editing directive. However, one can  use the '''Replace''' directive and define the undesired object to be 
&lt;br&gt;Class &quot;invisible&quot;


The editing directives are

===Add ''&quot;object name&quot; &quot;object path&quot;'' { ...''parameters''... }===

'''Add''' creates a new object. This is the default action if no edit directive is specified.

===Modify ''&quot;object name&quot; &quot;object path&quot;'' { ...''parameters''... }===

'''Modify''' changes only the parameters listed in its block.
Other parameters defined for the specified ''object'' are not affected.

===Replace ''&quot;object name&quot; &quot;object path&quot;'' { ...''parameters''... }===

'''Replace''' deletes all of the parameters associated with the specified object and replaces them by the new block of ''parameters''.

== Distance Limits ==

SSC objects orbit around Stars or Barycenters.

Objects defined in SSC files cannot be seen when the viewpoint is more than 1 LightYear from their Star or Barycenter.

Prior to Celestia v1.6.0, Stars or Barycenters could not be drawn reliably if they were farther than 16,000 light-years from Sol.  This limit resulted both from the Hipparcos catalogue parallax precision limit, of about 1 milli-arc-second, and from technical limitations within Celestia. 

Starting with Celestia v1.6.0, the maximum distance is 10,000,000 light-years. However, star placement has an angular precision of about 1/10 of an arcsecond as seen from Earth. This is adequate for observationally derived data, but if you want to create a dense globular cluster, stars might end up getting stacked on top of each other because of the limited precision.

''&quot;We actually thought of selling [the C programming language] to the Soviets to set their computer science progress back 20 or more years. Imagine our surprise when AT&amp;T and other US corporations actually began trying to use Unix and C!  It has taken them 20 years to develop enough expertise to generate even marginally useful applications using this 1960's technological parody, but we are impressed with the tenacity (if not common sense) of the general Unix and C programmer. In any event, Brian, Dennis and I have been working exclusively in Pascal on the Apple Macintosh for the past few years and feel really guilty about the chaos, confusion and truly bad programming that have resulted from our silly prank so long ago.&quot;''

::::-&quot;Ken Thompson,&quot; ''Creators Admit Unix, C Hoax'', [http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/unix-hoax.html The VOGON News Service]

Good news. The above quote is from a UnixWorld conference that never happened. That's good news for me, at least--otherwise, I'd be out of a job.

Welcome to ''C++ Concepts and Programming'', an instructional text from the Wikibooks project. ''CCP'', as it will be referred to within the text, aims to be a guide to quickly learn one of the most widespread programming languages in use today (and, in the process, a second). We aim to teach, not by throwing facts and information at the wall and hoping it sticks, but instead by light humor and human-readable explanations. We will focus on pragmatic teaching, not on the memorization of rote facts and technical jargon that is not necessary to become productive in the C++ programming language.

C++ is what is known technically as a multi-paradigm imperative programming language. If the buzzwords in the previous sentence made you reach for a comfort object--be it a nice fluffy teddy bear or a bottle of Jack Daniels--you can relax. Breathe deeply, it'll help. That description of C++ not only means ''absolutely nothing to most users of the language'' outside of a computer science lecture hall, but it commits the egregious sin of telling you nothing about the language itself, nothing that will help you become proficient in its use or learned in its concepts and methods.

In other words: unless this book is your textbook for a computer science class and your professor wants you to know what a multi-paradigm imperative programming language is, you don't need to know it. I'm certainly not quizzing you.

(You will soon notice that the main text of this book tends to veer wildly at times, from aside to further aside to far afield. At least, it ''will'' veer wildly, unless some of the more responsible members of the Wikibooks community--for a description of Wikibooks, see the following section--properly chastise me and clean it up to better fit a textbook standard. Which means that this foreword is likely the first thing on the chopping block. ''Que sera, sera.'' I consider a bit of a diversion, especially a humorous one, to help keep information fresh and clear in the reader's mind. As is often said in programming circles, '''YMMV'''--your mileage may vary.)

C++ is an exciting programming language, one that offers you the choice of how to accomplish your goals. As a ''superset'' of C (explained in detail later), you are able to use whatever C++ extensions and improvements that you wish to use in a program and eschew the others. C++, by design, offers you a wide array of tools. You can pick and choose among them, selecting some and leaving others on the shelf, as you see fit. Other languages, such as Java, lock you into a certain way of programming, a paradigm from which it is exceedingly difficult, or even impossible, to break out of without resorting to tricks that make programming harder. With C++, you do things the way you want to. And that's a powerful thing.

Happy hacking.

== A Mention of Wikibooks ==

''CCP'' is a book written as part of the Wikibooks project. The Wikibooks project is a collection of free books and annotated texts that are written in a collaborative fashion on the Wikibooks website (http://www.wikibooks.org), which is part of the Wikimedia Foundation. The site is a ''wiki'' and any user can edit material on the site without their contributions being subject to review before being accepted. The site's content is licensed under the '''GNU Free Documentation License''', which makes the content freely accessible, with no limits on sharing it.

Wikibooks aims to be a place to build free, open-content textbooks for public use. There are books on everything from physics to organic chemistry to (obviously!) computer programming on the site, all in various stages of completion. These textbooks are legally bound to remain free and this has been added to that collection in hopes of being of use to its readers.

== What This Book Is ==

''CCP'' is designed to quickly bring the reader up to speed on the C++ programming language. By necessity, the reader will also become reasonably proficient with C, the predecessor language of C++, in order to progress to C++. It is aimed primarily at those who have never programmed before.

''CCP'' attempts to teach using a version of C++ that adheres as closely to the C++ Standard as possible. Information is presented a simple step at a time, so as to allow the reader time to understand and digest it before moving on. In ''CCP'' we write about what we think is important and necessary for the reader to understand the language, avoiding trivia and information important, not in the process of writing software, but instead in the process of writing compilers. ''CCP'' is presented in a friendly, sometimes humorous, and non-threatening way to ease the reader into the world of computer programming.

== What This Book Isn't ==

''CCP'' is not intended to be a primer on computers and assumes a basic understanding of how computers work. Basic terminology, while often outlined in the Glossary, may not be explained in the text proper. ''CCP'' assumes understanding of concepts such as variables, as they apply to mathematics (not necessarily as they apply to computers).

This book is not an information dump of the data contained in any one programmer's head (or all of them). The C++ Standard documentation provides an excellent place to learn about things such as operator precedence--a table that no programmer really needs to know about beyond the basic '''&quot;PEMDAS&quot;''' set learned in arithmetic classes--and a book targeted at users new to the language is best off without it unless it seriously affects how a reader might write code as they learn.

== Some Common Terminology And Formatting ==

{{TODO|Bolded text are important terms or concepts, monospace text is code or code keywords. Write up as fluff text whenever.}}

== Co-Authors and Contributor Forewords ==

==Le Portrait de Boule de Suif==

''Lisez cet extrait tiré de'' Boule de Suif ''par Guy de Maupassant''. ''Vous pouvez également consulter le texte entier de cette nouvelle sur Wikisource.''
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
La femme, une de celles appelées galantes, était célèbre par son embonpoint précoce qui lui avait valu le surnom de Boule de Suif. Petite, ronde de partout, grasse à lard, avec des doigts bouffis, étranglés aux phalanges, pareils à des chapelets de courtes saucisses ; avec une peau luisante et tendue, une gorge énorme qui saillait sous sa robe, elle restait cependant appétissante et courue, tant sa fraîcheur faisait plaisir à voir. Sa figure était une pomme rouge, un bouton de pivoine prêt à fleurir ; et là-dedans s'ouvraient, en haut, deux yeux noirs magnifiques, ombragés de grands cils épais qui mettaient une ombre dedans ; en bas, une bouche charmante, étroite, humide pour le baiser, meublée de quenottes luisantes et microscopiques.
&lt;br&gt;Elle était de plus, disait-on, pleine de qualités inappréciables.&lt;br&gt;
Aussitôt qu'elle fut reconnue, des chuchotements coururent parmi les femmes honnêtes, et les mots de « prostituée », de « honte publique » furent chuchotés si haut qu'elle leva la tête. Alors elle promena sur ses voisins un regard tellement provocant et hardi qu'un grand silence aussitôt régna, et tout le monde baissa les yeux à l'exception de Loiseau, qui la guettait d'un air émoustillé.
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Questions de compréhension==
''Voilà le portrait de l'héroïne éponyme de la nouvelle de Guy de Maupassant. Répondez en français aux questions suivantes par des phrases complètes.''

1. Que veut dire « embonpoint » ? &lt;br&gt;
2. À quoi la figure de Boule de Suif est-elle comparée ? &lt;br&gt;
3. De quelle couleur sont les yeux de Boule de Suif ? Quel autre adjectif Maupassant utilise-t-il pour les décrire ? &lt;br&gt;
4. A votre avis, quelles sont les « qualités inappréciables » dont parle le narrateur ? &lt;br&gt;
5. Quels mots furent chuchotés ? &lt;br&gt;
6. Quelle est la réaction de Boule de Suif quand elle entend ces mots ? &lt;br&gt;
7. Que veut dire le surnom de l'héroïne, « Boule de Suif » ? Comment traduiriez-vous cette expression en anglais ?


Je vous mets les réponses aux questions mais ne les regardez pas avant d'y avoir répondu, ce serait sans intérêt.

1. Embonpoint signifie l'état d'une personne assez grasse. &lt;br&gt;
2. La figure de Boule de Suif est comparée à une pomme rouge. &lt;br&gt;
3. Les yeux de Boule de Suif sont noirs. L'autre adjectif est &quot;ombragés&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
4. - &lt;br&gt;
5. Les mots qui furent chuchotés sont &quot;prostituée&quot; et &quot;honte publique&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
6. Elle a un fort caractère, elle lance un regard agressif envers ces personnes et est fière de ce qu'elle fait (&quot;hardi&quot;). &lt;br&gt;
7. Elle est surnommée &quot;boule de suif&quot; pour son embonpoint. Son surnom est dû à ses formes arrondies et à son physique gras, (le suif étant la graisse animale ou végétale servant à la fabrication de certains produits tels que le savon et au traitement du cuir).
En anglais : Suet Ball.

Vous pouvez corriger mes erreurs s'il y en a et compléter la question 4.

==Grammaire et vocabulaire==
===Être au passé simple===
Notice the expressions ''elle fut reconnue'' and ''furent chuchotés''. The words ''fut'' and ''furent'' are in fact the verb ''être'' in the past historic tense, which is reserved for books, newspapers and other works of 'literary' type. &lt;br&gt;
Memorize the following conjugation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EED2EE&quot;&gt;
'''ÊTRE''' - ''passé simple''&lt;br&gt;
je '''fus'''&lt;br&gt;
tu '''fus'''&lt;br&gt;
il '''fut'''&lt;br&gt;
nous '''fûmes'''&lt;br&gt;
vous '''fûtes'''&lt;br&gt;
ils '''furent'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
There are of course other examples of the ''passé simple'' in this extract.

==La description du portrait==
In French, a portrait is often characterized by the use of the imperfect tense (if the narrative is in the past tense) and adjectives which agree with the thing they describe. The portrait of Boule de Suif is a perfect example of this.

==Activités écrites==
1. '''Rédigez un portrait de quelqu'un que vous connaissez bien. Comme Maupassant, vous décrirez les deux côtés de cette personne'''. Write a portrait of someone that you know well. Like Maupassant, describe two sides/aspects to this person.&lt;br&gt;

2. '''Lisez le texte entier de ''Boule de Suif''. Ensuite, faites-en un court résumé.''' Read the entire text of ''Boule de Suif''. Then, write a short summary. &lt;br&gt;

3. '''Faites des recherches sur l'auteur de cette nouvelle, Guy de Maupassant. Rédigez le texte d'un discours que vous pourriez présenter à une classe de lycéens. N'oubliez pas d'inclure les dates et les évènements importants de sa vie.''' Research the author of this short story, Guy de Maupassant. Write the text for a speech that you could present to a class of high school students. Don't forget to include the important dates and events of his life.&lt;br&gt;

==Ouverture sur le monde littéraire==
===Qu'est-ce que c'est que la nouvelle ?===
''Voici la définition de la nouvelle, tirée d'un article sur Wikipédia.''
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
Une nouvelle est un genre littéraire basé sur un récit de fiction court en prose, pouvant aller jusqu'à une trentaine de pages (mais il n'y a pas de règle absolue). Contrairement au roman, il est centré sur un seul événement. Les personnages sont peu nombreux et sont doués de réalité psychologique bien que celle-ci soit moins développée que dans le roman.
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
'''''Traduisez le passage ci-dessus en vous appuyant sur le vocabulaire suivant :'''''&lt;br&gt;
*'''la nouvelle''' - short story&lt;br&gt;
*'''le récit''' - story, tale &lt;br&gt;
*'''la trentaine (de pages)''' - about thirty (pages) &lt;br&gt;
*'''l'évènement''' (m) - event &lt;br&gt;
*'''douer''' - to endow &lt;br&gt;

===Le réalisme===
The short story ''Boule de Suif'', by Guy de Maupassant, is considered an example of 'realist' writing. Maupassant himself was considered a major figure in French realism. The movement includes such writers as Honoré de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert and Maupassant himself. Here is once again Wikipedia, describing the Realist writer:
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
L'écrivain réaliste s'oppose au romanesque. Ce qui l'intéresse sont les faits de l'homme. Dans l'œuvre du réaliste, il y a absence de jugement, de moralité. Il veut donner la vision la plus complète de la réalité. L'effort d'impersonnalité vise l'objectivité. Il se retire ainsi de son livre (évite le je). Le réaliste est comme le disait si bien Maupassant : un illusionniste. Il s'intéresse beaucoup aux détails physiques et physiologiques. Il ne fait que décrire des faits et n'intègre aucune émotion, l'émotion que ressent le lecteur est uniquement dû au fait et non pas à l'écriture.
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
''Questions de compréhension''&lt;br&gt;
1. À quoi l'écrivain réaliste s'oppose-t-il ? &lt;br&gt;
2. À votre avis, que veut dire « évite le je » ? &lt;br&gt;
3. Quel nom Maupassant donne-t-il au réaliste ? &lt;br&gt;
4. Expliquez, en vous appuyant sur cette citation, ce qu'écrit l'écrivain réaliste. &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley Civilization]] was not the first settled culture in the Indian subcontinent. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of an earlier one called the Mehargarh culture. Mehargarh is in present day Pakistan. The site is in the Baluchistan province. It is about 125 miles from the Indus Valley. The site was first occupied around 7,000 or 8,000 B.C. It started out as a small village. The initial settlement practiced farming and raised crops, including wheat. As the community grew, farming continued, but the economy expanded and large scale trading began. Evidence shows that it traded with peoples far to the west. The goods included turquoise, cotton, and copper. Commerce was carried on with places as far away as Arabia. 

By 5,000 B.C. the Mehargarh people were living in mud brick houses and then built large permanent dwellings. Trade was the main aspect of the economy. The Mehargarh culture continued to exist well past 4,000 B.C. Hence it must have traded with the Indus Valley Civilization, which was in existence by then.

A French archaeologist named Jean Francois Jarrige has participated in the excavations around Mehargarh. Many of his digs took place from 1974 to 1985. He also did some field work there in 1990 and later; in 2002 Jarigge gave a presentation on evidence (such as carbon dating) to show that the Mehargarh culture began at least around 7,000 B.C. He showed slides of artifacts and gave a lecture at the Islamabad Club Auditorium.

Jarrige found a burial place with 30 graves. Most of the remains were of females of ages 18-22. Jarrige also discovered clay pots, ornaments, buildings, and other items.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following events take place in '''''Metal Gear'''''. This transcript is taken from the &quot;Previous Operations&quot; section of ''Metal Gear Solid''.
{{Spoiler}}

The year is 1995. Deep in South Africa, 200km north of Garzburg, Outer Heaven-
an armed fortress nation, established by the legendary mercenary. He was
feared in combat by both his friends and foes as a hero and a lunatic. The
&quot;Western&quot; nations have found that a weapon of mass destruction capable of
rewritting war history is under development at Outer Heaven. They have called
upon the high-tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND to take care of the
situation.  In response to this order, Big Boss, the commander-in-chief of
FOX-HOUND, sent Gray Fox, the man with the code name &quot;Fox&quot; which is given to
the best member of the unit &quot;Operation intrude N313&quot;

After a few days, his last message being &quot;Metal Gear...&quot; Gray Fox was missing
in action. Taking the situation seriously, the top men of the &quot;West&quot; again
called for FOX-HOUND. Big Boss selected Solid Snake, who had recently joined
FOX-HOUND, as the agent and entrusted everything to him.

Successfully making a solo infiltration to Outer Heaven, Snake got in touch
with local resistance members Schneider, Diane and Jennifer. With their
co-operation, Snake suceeded in rescuing Gray Fox. Gray Fox laid out the
terrifying facts about &quot;Metal Gear&quot; Metal Gear was the development name of a
nuclear warhead-equipped two-legged walking tank. It can walk through over the
toughtest terrains that would stop normal tanks. It can conduct local warfare
by itself with unique weapons like its vulcan-cannon and anti-tank missiles.
It was indeed a new type of weapon that can conduct a nuclear attack against
any place on the face of the Earth from any land surface...

With Metal Gear, Outer Heaven was trying to establish its military superiority
over the entire world. In order to destroy Metal Gear, Snake rescued Metal
Gear's chief engineer Dr. Pettrovich and his daughter, Elen, who was taken
hostage to force her father to continue with his development. Snake hears from
Dr. Pettrovich how to destroy Metal Gear.

However, as Snake approached the heart of Outer Heaven and Metal Gear, well
designed traps are set all around Snake- as if his actions are being leaked
to the enemy...

In the midst of the escalating battle, the leader of the resistance,
Schneider, fell into the hands of the enemy, and Snake himself was injured
through the deadly battles with Outer Heaven's best mercenaries. But Snake's
indomitable spirit lead him to the 100th floor basement of the secret base
where Metal Gear was developed. Evading the powerful defense system that wipes
out all intruders, Snake ultimately succeeded in destroying Metal Gear.

Snake tried to escape from Outer Heaven upon completing the mission. However,
during the escape he was comfronted by one man- FOX-HOUND's commander-in-chief
Big Boss. Big Boss laughed at the astounded Snake and told him the truth
behind his mission. While serving as commander-in-chief of FOX-HOUND Big Boss
also ran a mercenary dispatch company utilizing his connections and capitals
from his own years as a merc. He was planning on to build this company a
larger military establishment, and he built Outer Heaven as its base. His
purpose for sending the rookie Snake was to cause information confusion
amongst the west. However, Big Boss miscalculated. He never thought Solid
Snake would make it this far...

Having lost Metal Gear, Big Boss activated the self-destruct system of the
underground base. While the countdown to destruction continued, his screamed
echoed in the emptiness

	           &quot;YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR. TOO FAR!!!&quot;

On the 100th floor basement, the battle between the two men commenced- free of
ideology and politics. The armed fortress nation Outer Heaven collapsed. The
impenetrabe fortress made from the best military technology and occupied by
the toughest mercenaries burned in flames. Behind him, the flames reached
skyward, as Outer Heaven fell leaving Solid Snake all alone...

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following events take place in '''''Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake'''''. This transcript is taken from the &quot;Previous Story&quot; section of ''Metal Gear Solid''.
{{Spoiler}}

1999, the world was facing an energy crisis. It was obvious that the petroleum
would run out faster than what was expected. However, the development of an
alternative energy resource is far from completion. The price of petroleum has
skyrocketed and the world economy in confusion. The 21st century was expected
to be one of chaos. One mans invention changed the entire situation. A Czech
genius and biologist, Dr. Kio Marv, invented OILIX, a microorganism that
refines petroleum to product a highly purified form of petroleum. The world
was filled with hope upon the discovery of this messiah to solve the energy
crisis, but at the same time the world entered a time of tension regarding
this new algae.

Just when the whole worlds attention was drawn to OILIX and Dr. Marv, he was
abducted by someone and disapeared. Nations begun investigations immediatly
anda name soon appeared...'Zanzibar Land'...

Zanzibar Land was a democraticmilitary regime that suddently appeared in
central Asia in 1997. When their uprising took place, the CIS Army, formed
around Russia, sent in a suppressive unit immediatly. Zanzibar Land resisted
by gathering a band of Mercenaries from nations around the world and
fortifying most of its land. As a result, the CIS Army was repeatedly
defeated, and Zanzibar Land declared its independence. Due to the active role
mercenaries played, this war was called the 'Mercenaries War' and Zanzibar
Land was referred to as an armed fortress nation. A military nation with a
group of strong mercenaries, surrounded by a tough fortress.

According to the latest information, Zanzibar suppoedly was armed
with Nuclear Weapons. The whole scenario was crystal clear. By obtaining OILIX
in addition to nuclear weapons, Zanzibar Land was trying to establishits
economoic and military superiority over the entire world. Concerned about the
situation, the United States of America ordered Roy Campbell,
Commander-in-Chief of high tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND, to rescue Dr.
Marv. Campbell was a former member of FOX-HOUND. He brought back Solid Snake,
the man who single handedly brought down the armed fortress nation of Outer
Heaven 4 years ago, and asked Snake to bring back Dr. Marv and OILIX.

Successfully infiltrating Zanzibar Land and with help from CIA
angent Horry and others, Snake was able to go deep into the fortress and meet
again with Dr. Pettrovich, the chief engineer of Metal Gear from Outer Heaven.
He too was abducted to Zanzibar Land and forced to develop another Metal Gear.
He told to surprised Snake an even more shocking fact. Big Boss, the man Snake
had defeated at Outer Heaven, turned out to be the General Commander of
Zanzibar Land.

Snake rescued Dr. Pettrovich in co-operation with Natasha, Dr. Marv's guard
and former Czech International Secret Police agent, and then headed for the
confinement facility deep in the fortress to save Dr. Marv. When Pettrovich
and Natasha crossed the narrow suspension bridge over the deep valley, a
missile blew the bridge away. Natasha flew into the air because of the
explosion. While unable to do anything to save Natasha, Snake started hearing
a well-known voice &quot;Hey Snake, we're good buddies. I can let you go. Just
leave this place at once!&quot; Gray Fox. Snake saw Gray Fox controlling Metal
Gear. The best soldier in FOX-HOUND who, after the fall of Outer Heaven,
disappeared as if he followed BigBoss. Losing Natasha infront of his eyes and
letting Pettrovich get taken away, Snake screamed &quot;Fox! I will not give up!&quot;

After a series of deadly battles with mercenaries, Snake finally made it to
Dr. Marv's confinement facility. However, he arrived to late. He saw Dr.
Marv's corpse and Pettrovich, who could do nothing but just stand there.
Pettrovich told Snake that Dr. Marv could not withstand the repeated tortures
because of heart problems. Snake then recieved an emergency call from Horry.
The information she supplied was very shocking. Pettrovich had been
voluntarily visiting Zanzibar Land to develop Metal Gear. The abduction of Dr.
Marv was conducted under the the directions of Pettrovich himself. After the
truth came out, Pettrovich attacked Snake, but Snake easily put an end to him
and obtained the structual plan of OILIX.

While trying to escape, Snake was confronted by Metal Gear again, controlled
by Gray Fox. The tremendous battle took place in the underground base. Snake
finally succeeded in destroying Metal Gear. However, Gray Fox did not submit
and challenged Snake to the final battle. In the midst of a minefield, Snake
and Fox fought without any weapons. A fist-to-fist duel involving no hatred or
murderous intent. During that moment of purity the 2 were bound by forces
transcending words and emotions. Snake won the tough but pure battle against
Gray Fox. However, there was still someone else. Snake had to fight Big Boss.
Just like 4 years ago at Outer Heaven Big Boss was waiting for Snake.   &quot;One
who has experienced the tension of battle can never leave the battlefield.
I'm the one giving you something to live for, and that is war&quot; Snake was
infuriated at the arrogant Big Boss &quot;There is only one battle I have to fight.
To free myself from you, to shatter the nightmare...Big Boss, I will kill
you!&quot;

With the structual plan of Oilix, Snake and Horry escaped from Zanzibar Land
on a rescue helicopter. Snake once again saved the world.  However, there was
no smile on his face. Big Boss's last words kept ringing in his head &quot;Whoever
wins, our battle does not end. The loser is free from the battlefield, but the
winner must remain there and the survivor must live his life as the warrior
until he dies&quot; Snake then disappeared into the whitelands of Alaska... alone...

::''Some people may not feel comfortable jumping feet-first into programming without a little understanding of the background material. Others may want to see &quot;the big picture&quot; before they delve into the minutiae. The first part of this chapter is optional; the second, '''Setting Up Your Work Environment''', can be safely ignored if you already have a working '''toolchain''' on your computer.

At its most basic level, a computer understands '''machine code'''. This is raw data, zeroes and ones, that correspond with circuits in the computer's CPU (a generalization, but not an unfair one). Machine code is hard to read--not impossible, but you wouldn't want to spend your day doing it. A computer cannot understand source code, the lines of mostly-English text that you write in Notepad or some other text editor. The toolchain mentioned above--the '''compiler''' and '''linker''', about which we will go into detail later, is the mechanism for translating this source code into machine code.

When we use computers, we deal with them in abstractions. Our working knowledge of a computer is based upon abstractions that hide the deepest complexities from us. The computer contains interpreting layers that turn human-readable code into computer-readable machine language. The computer handles the ugly process of taking many different sources of memory and presenting them to you, the programmer and the user, in a unified fashion that is easy to work with.

These are not, however, the abstractions you'll see most directly as a programmer; you'll have to deal with memory, but unless you're doing something that's probably ill-advised you will rarely ever have to muck about with direct memory addresses--that's one of the abstractions your programming language handles for you (at least if you use C or C++). Each programming language is different in that it tailors its abstractions to a particular mode of thought, a particular ''kind'' of abstraction.

'''Assembly language''', also known as assembler or ASM, is a very basic abstraction of the underlying computer hardware--an abstract. Its saving grace is that it allows the use of human-readable names and instructions; the assembly language instructions directly correspond with a machine code instruction, but is named in such a way that people can remember them and use them. The use of assembly is not '''cross-platform'''--it is restricted to the kind of computer on which it was created, because the dialects of assembly language used on different computer architectures (such as i386, PowerPC, or SPARC) differs. If a program written in i386 assembly must be ported, or made to run on, a PowerPC architecture, the program itself must be entirely rewritten. The upside of such a limited, localized programming language is that it is generally faster and more efficient than the corresponding program written in a more abstracted language. This is less and less the case, however, as optimizers built into compilers keep improving.

The next step up from assembly language are '''imperative languages'''. These include '''BASIC''' (''B''eginner's ''A''ll-purpose ''S''ymbolic ''I''nstruction ''C''ode), a simplistic programming language included on many older computers, and '''C''', the language you will shortly be acclimatized to. Imperative languages are like assembly language in that they are used to tell the computer what to do directly--&quot;do this, then this, then this.&quot; They are a significant step up from assembly language, as they typically are written in a format more approximating a human language. The abstractions an imperative language provides are still limited in that they require the programmer to think in terms of the computer. There is a metaphor shear, a disjunction between the computer you are using to model the situation or problem and the problem itself. Many problems do not lend themselves well to this kind of metaphor translation.
{{User:Blacken/C++_Concepts_and_Programming/Internal Templates/SideNote|Imperative languages such as C are used for many applications still today; the Linux and BSD operating systems are written in C, as is most of Windows. Many detractors of imperative languages, C in particular, contend that the languages encourage unsafe programming behaviors, and there may be some truth to this statement. It may also be argued, though, that the problem with imperative languages lies in the programmers and not the languages themselves. In many cases it is fairly easy to cause '''buffer overflows''' (explained in detail later) that allow a malicious cracker to run their own code via a poorly coded C program. These are errors in programming, however, and not the fault of the language. The detractors, on the other hand, suggest that the languages be &quot;bullet-proofed&quot; against these kinds of attacks.}}

From here, the path diverges a bit. There are many programming paradigms for higher-level languages; the applicability of a higher-level language to any given task depends largely upon its design, its &quot;outlook on life.&quot; This makes some higher-level languages more suited to certain tasks than others, based on how they view problems. For example, the Lisp programming language and its derivatives reduce everything to binary pairs, with which lists are made and used. '''Declarative''' languages, such as Prolog, turn programming on its head by declaring something to be true and letting the computer figure out how to get there.

== Object-Oriented Programming ==

Languages such as Lisp or Prolog are good for problem sets with definitions that are not always exact. Both have a home in artificial intelligence research. But they, like all programming languages, are built on metaphors, and their metaphors tend to break down when they are presented with problems that are outside of the class of problem they are designed to solve. On the other hand, '''object-oriented programming''', or OOP, in languages such as '''C++''', results in a generalized higher-level language. Instead of limiting a user to a certain set of tools and a certain &quot;view of the world,&quot; they provide the tools for the programmer to represent elements of the problem ''itself''. Objects in the '''problem space''', or section of the program that represents the problem or task itself, directly represent elements of the problem.

A trivial example might be that of a car. A car can drive, of course, barring many hundreds of repairs that it could need (that, much like some kinds of bugs in computer programs, remain very well hidden until they explode). If you need, for some reason, to include a car in a problem space, the method of actually using the car changes from language to language. In BASIC or C you would have to say ''drive the car''. This is not to mean some imaginary person jumps in the car and begins to drive it--the program must externally drive the car, must model the firing of cylinders and turning of the wheels outside of the car itself.. A special procedure or section of code that is not part of the car itself would have to drive it. In an object-oriented language, such as C++, you say something subtly different: ''the car drives''. The car models itself. This allows for a metaphor that has less chance of shearing and looks more like the real world.

C++, while directly derived from C, inherits its ideas of classes from Smalltalk, an older language still in sporadic use and the first successful one to support object-oriented programming. Smalltalk espoused a &quot;pure&quot; object-oriented programming paradigm. C++ does not. There is nothing saying that you cannot write C++ like you would write C, in an imperative fashion. This is perfectly legal, and is not a &quot;bad&quot; thing to do. But the flexibility of object-oriented programming always remains available to you. C++ is not a strictly object-oriented language; that's why it is referred to as '''multi-paradigm'''. Standard C++ has an eye toward pragmatism, not an academic ideal. Despite this, the central ideas of Smalltalk are good ones and make it easier to understand ''why'' object-oriented programming is so powerful.

#'''Everything is an object.''' In this case, an object is a '''variable'''--a spot in memory that stores data. An object is a special kind of variable, though, that can also hold '''functions''' (subprograms). Essentially, it's a variable that can do things to itself (you'll pardon the lewd implications).
#'''Every program is a group of objects that tell each other to do things.''' In C++, an object is told what to do by way of a ''public method'', which is a special type of function tied to that object that is also available to other objects. An object can have '''private methods''' that only it can access, as well.
#'''Every object is made up of other objects.''' For those with experience in BASIC or C, this may seem difficult to understand. In those languages, you do not see the basic variables--integers, floating-point numbers, '''strings''' of text--as objects. In Smalltalk, all of those, and every object a programmer creates, is derived from the ''Object'' object. This provides every object with a basic interface, in the event (one might call it a certainty) that another object needs to talk to it. In C++, this is not quite the case. '''Primitive data types''' such as integers (&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;) are not objects, but that is an artifact of being originally from the procedural, imperative C language. There are a number of workarounds and methods used to abstract away the difference between these primitive data types and the objects of an object-oriented C++ program.
#'''Every object has a defined type.''' In C++, this would usually be written as &quot;every object is an ''instance'' of a ''class'',&quot; but that is just a question of terminology. This matters because the type of the object determines what methods the object &quot;knows&quot; how to do.
#'''Every object of a particular type has the same interface.''' In this case, ''interface'' is defined as &quot;the set of public methods that may be used with an object.&quot; The implications of this statement may not be immediately apparent, but will become clear in time. For now, understand that an object of type &lt;code&gt;Triangle&lt;/code&gt; is also an object of type &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; (in the jargon of C++, &lt;code&gt;Triangle&lt;/code&gt; inherits or derives from &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt;), any messages that you can send to an object of type &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; can also be sent to any object of type &lt;code&gt;Triangle&lt;/code&gt;--or a &lt;code&gt;Circle&lt;/code&gt;, or a &lt;code&gt;Square&lt;/code&gt;, or perhaps a &lt;code&gt;Heptadecagon&lt;/code&gt; if necessary. This concept results in extremely flexible code, as we will see later.

A further discussion of objects, as well as object-oriented programming, will continue later. For now, we need to get you started with the tools you need to make programs in C and C++.

I have created this book for the purpose of presenting detailed facts and information on the fictional universe of the ''Metal Gear'' series that would not usually be allowed on Wikipedia (such as writing detailed plot summary, fiction from an in-universe perspective, original research, etc.). The Wikipedia article [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_timeline Metal Gear timeline] which I wrote on 26th May 2006, and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_timeline_compared_to_reality Metal Gear timeline compared to reality] article, were later deleted due to not meeting these guidelines, so I've added them to this book instead. This book is not intended to be a strategy guide, so please avoid adding such information. Feel free to contribute to this book or perhaps discuss any improvements this book may need.

      <comment>Probability value is always less than or equal to 1, not in form of percentages.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

== Random Variables ==

A random variable is a variable that takes a random value at any particular point ''t'' in time. The properties of the random variable are known as the '''distribution''' of the random variable. We will denote random variables by the abbreviation &quot;r.v.&quot;, or simply &quot;rv&quot;. This is a common convention used in the literature concerning this subject.

== Probability Function ==

The probability function, P[], will denote the probability of a particular occurrence happening. Here are some examples:

*&lt;math&gt;P[X &lt; x]&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that the random variable X has a value less than some variable ''x''.
*&lt;math&gt;P[X = x]&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that the random variable X has a value equal to some variable ''x''.
*&lt;math&gt;P[X &lt; x, Y &gt; y]&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that the random variable X has a value less than ''x'', and the random variable Y has a value greater than ''y''.

=== Example: Fair Coin ===

Consider the example that a fair coin is flipped. We will define X to be the random variable, and we will define &quot;head&quot; to be 1, and &quot;tail&quot; to be 0. What is the probability that the coin is a head?

:&lt;math&gt;P[X = 1] = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: Fair Dice ===

Consider now a fair 6-sided dice. X is the r.v., and the numerical value on the face of the die is the value that X can take. What is the probability that when the dice is rolled, the value is less than 4?

:&lt;math&gt;P[X &lt; 4] = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

What is the probability that the value will be even?

:&lt;math&gt;P[X\mbox{ is even}] = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

== Notation ==

We will typically write random variables as upper-case letters, such as Z, X, Y, etc. Lower-case letters will be used to denote variables that are related with the random variables. For instance, we will use &quot;x&quot; as a variable that is related to &quot;X&quot;, the random variable.

When we are using random variables in conjunction with matrices, we will use the following conventions:

#Random variables, and random vectors or matrices will be denoted with letters from the end of the alphabet, such as W, X, Y, and Z. Also, &amp;Theta; and &amp;Omega; will be used as a random variables, especially when we talk about random frequencies.
#A random matrix or vector, will be denoted with a capital letter. The entries in that random vector or matrix will be denoted with capital letters and subscripts. These matrices will also use letters from the end of the alphabet, or the Greek letters &amp;Theta; and &amp;Omega;.
#A regular coefficient vector or matrix that is not random will use a capital matrix from the beginning of the alphabet, such as A, B, C, or D. 
#Special vectors or matrices that are derived from random variables, such as correlation matrices, or covariance matrices, will use capital letters from the middle of the alphabet, such as K, M, N, P, or Q.

Any other variables or notations will be explained in the context of the page where it appears.

== Conditional Probability ==

A '''conditional probability''' is the probability measure of one event happening given that another event already has happened. For instance, what are the odds that your computer system will suddenly break while you are reading this page?

:&lt;math&gt;P[\mbox{computer breaks}] = \mbox{small}&lt;/math&gt;

The odds that your computer will suddenly stop working is very small. However, what are the odds that your computer will break given that it just got struck by lightning?

:&lt;math&gt;P[\mbox{computer breaks}|\mbox{struck by lightning}] = \mbox{large}&lt;/math&gt;

The vertical bar separates the things that haven't happened yet (the ''a priori'' probabilities, on the left) from the things that have already happened and might affect our outcome (the ''a posteriori'' probabilities, on the right). As another example, what are the odds that a dice rolled will be a 2, assuming that we know the number is less than 4?

:&lt;math&gt;P[X = 2|X &lt; 4] = 0.33&lt;/math&gt;

If X is less than 4, we know it can only be one of the values 1, 2, or 3. Or another example, what if a person asks you &quot;I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10&quot;, what are your odds of guessing the right number?

:&lt;math&gt;P[X = x|0 &lt; X &lt; 10] = 0.1&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''x'' is the correct number that you are trying to guess.</text>

== Probability Density Function ==

The '''probability density function''', or '''pdf''' of a random variable is the function defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;f_X(x) = P[X = x]&lt;/math&gt;

Remember here that X is the random variable, and x is a related variable (but is not random). The subscript X on &lt;math&gt;f_X&lt;/math&gt; denotes that this is the pdf for the X variable. 

pdf's follow a few simple rules:

#The pdf is always non-negative.
#The area under the pdf curve is 1.
#:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x) dx = 1&lt;/math&gt;

== Cumulative Distribution Function ==

The '''cumulative distribution function''', (CDF), is also known as the '''Probability Distribution Function''', (PDF). to reduce confusion with the pdf of a random variable, we will use the acronym CDF to denote this function. The CDF of a random variable is the function defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;F_X(x) = P[X \le x]&lt;/math&gt;

The CDF and the pdf of a random variable are related:

:&lt;math&gt;f_X(x) = \frac{dF_X(x)}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_X(x) = \int f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

The CDF is the function corresponding to the probability that a given value ''x'' is less than the value of the random variable X. The CDF is a non-decreasing function, and is always non-negative.

=== Example: X between two bounds ===

To determine whether our random variable X lies between two bounds, [a, b], we can take the CDF functions:

:&lt;math&gt;P[a \le X \le b] = F_X(b) - F_X(a)&lt;/math&gt;</text>

__TOC__
== Parts of instruction==
*A presentation is giving information and a task is a student response to show the information has been learned.  
*A lesson is the day's worth of presentation (scripted teaching) that takes anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes.  
*Each lesson has 4 to 10 exercises (topics).  
*Each exercise (topic) is from a different track.  
*Tracks are sequences of an exercise (topic) that appear throughout lessons.

{{Body note|Insert diagram here}}

== Overall: Does the program ensure efficacy and high results ==
#Mastery comes at a good rate because you only introduce about 10% new items but keep 90% as review
#Write so that there are 4 or more exercise or topics per lesson.  Each section is designed to be covered in 3-12 minutes
#Teach with multiple exemplars.  Ensure examples show &quot;ness&quot; - &quot;pencilness&quot;, &quot;cupness&quot;. 
#Ensure you carefully select your examples so that the skill can be learned in the most efficient manner.  Analyze, organize be careful.

==Features of DI==
 
===Lessons need to:===
#Be clear and concise
#Only include necessary vocabulary
#Ensure the lesson includes sub skills you know has been taught earlier
#Information is true and doesn't mislead
#Only include enough examples to get the idea across, no busy work or too many examples but ensure a wide enough range of exemplars
#Use rules when needed
#Ensure rules are simple enough for students to remember after repeating it a few times.  Avoid abstract or complicated terms
#When available, use examples without a rule or lots of verbal definition
#Ensure you use enough examples to show &quot;ness&quot; in the universe of examples
#No extraneous prompts in examples (color, specific picture)
#Information given has only one interpretation
#Ensure amount of new information can be mastered within a few minutes
#Information doesn't require student to have great memory (maybe avg or just below avg)
#Don't use a rule and then contradict it later
#Give like examples and then dislike examples: &quot;This is xyz, this is NOT xyz&quot;
#Teach differences use examples that are slightly different and focus on the difference



===Ensure students show understanding of information===
#Teacher does testing on skill or information presented and taugh (sp) just before the test or present at an earlier time.  Do not test information that will be presented in the future in hopes of seeing which students happen to know the information
#Lesson should link sections to previous lessons and sections
#Rules presented in sections within the lesson need to be simple enough to repeat and master within a few trials (each time you ask for the rule is a trial - multiple trials can happen within a lesson)
#The section is efficient and simplified
#The section has no inadvertent prompting (specific picture, color, font, etc.)
#Ask questions or do fill in the blanks with only one correct answer to the group, if more than one correct answer ask individual students.
#Wording of the section and examples used to test understanding and mastery are consistent with previous sections and lessons
#Elicit 9-20 responses per minute with question and fill in the blanks while teaching a section
#If teaching new vocabulary, ensure you use the vocabulary in the section of the lesson and ensure students use the vocabulary in their oral responding
#Only prompt the student if the student can not produce the right answer
#Sections should teach the basic content, not peripheral items to the content

===Chaining Sections===

#Examples in a series of sections should be basically the same but with different wording to help generalize
#Give enough examples to provide &quot;ness&quot; of the example within the universe - &quot;cupness&quot;, &quot;pencilness&quot;
#Examples also help test student mastery of information or understanding of the rule already presented
#Ensure student apply the rule in the section using careful wording
#Section has new vocabulary or has the students responding with the new vocabulary
#Student responses show the students have understanding or show what they don't understand
#Examples in section don't have a pattern of answers or unintended cues

==You know it's DI when...==
The lessons go so smoothly and learning takes place so easily that it seems too simple for the student.  This is an often voiced concern. The overall goal of DI is to ensure success.  If the lessons are too hard then they were not designed correctly (missing steps, not stranded, too much information to memorize at once, etc.).

#Review 1 or 2 lessons.  Is the program missing less than 5 areas/features of DI?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

== Distributions ==

There are a number of common distributions, that are used in conjunction with random variables. 

== Uniform Distribution ==

The uniform distribution is one of the easiest distributions to analyze. Also, uniform distributions of random numbers are easy to generate on computers, so they are typically used in computer software.

:&lt;math&gt;f_X(x) = \left\{ \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{b - a} &amp; \mbox{ if } a &lt; x &lt; b \\0 &amp; \mbox{ otherwise}\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_X(x) = \left\{ \begin{matrix}0 &amp; \mbox{ if } x &lt; a \\ \frac{x}{b - a} &amp; \mbox{ if } a &lt; x &lt; b \\1 &amp; \mbox{ if } x \ge b\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

== Gaussian Distribution ==

The '''gaussian distribution''', or the &quot;normal distribution&quot; is one of the most common random distributions. A gaussian random variable is typically called a &quot;normal&quot; random variable. 

:&lt;math&gt;f_X(x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{\sigma^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;mu; is the '''mean''' of the function, and &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the function. we will discuss both these terms later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Expectation ==

The expectation operator of a random variable is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;E[x] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

This operator is very useful, and we can use it to derive the moments of the random variable.

== Moments ==

A moment is a value that contains some information about the random variable. The n-moment of a random variable is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;E[x^n] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^n f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

=== Mean ===

The '''mean''' value, or the &quot;average value&quot; of a random variable is defined as the first moment of the random variable:

:&lt;math&gt;E[x] = \mu_X = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

We will use the Greek letter &amp;mu; to denote the mean of a random variable.

== Central Moments ==

A central moment is similar to a moment, but it is also dependant on the mean of the random variable:

:&lt;math&gt;E[(x - \mu_X)^n] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x - \mu_X)^n f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

The first central moment is always zero.

=== Variance ===

The variance of a random variable is defined as the second central moment:

:&lt;math&gt;E[(x - \mu_X)^2] = \sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;

The square-root of the variance, &amp;sigma;, is known as the '''standard-deviation''' of the random variable

=== Mean and Variance ===

the mean and variance of a random variable can be related by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = \mu^2 + E[x^2]&lt;/math&gt;

This is an important function, and we will use it later.

== Entropy ==

the '''entropy''' of a random variable &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;H[X]= E \left[ \frac{1}{p(X)} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

[Support]I am in favour of this proposition.

[Support]I feel the order of chapters you have propsed is slightly odd in places but the combining of these materials is a good move--[[User:SuperJ587|SuperJ587]] 12:20, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

[Support] This sounds like a great idea... the algebra books say that the change was going to be made approx. September 2006... is that no longer the plan?

:Yeah, i had alot more time in september for starting this sort of project then I have now. However, there seems to still be plenty of support for the project, so I might need to take some time out to actually complete it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:59, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

[Support]
I agree with most of your restructuring ideas. Indented is a post I made on the Algebra talk page;

:It's a good idea for anything beyond a highschool level to be broken down by subject. A number of these subjects can be treated independently of each other, though they require a lot of internal cohesion. However, I'd like to think that the elementary algebra and highschool algebra follow a natural linear progression and would be well suited to fit in the same book. However, there is a question of reading level; early work on arithmetic should be done in a basic english tone while I think it's too tedious to keep such a tone for teaching highschool math. For that reason, perhaps there should be a difference between elementary algebra and intermediate algebra. I think the basic english introduction to algebra --- which is a part of the one laptop for every child program --- should be sufficient for the elementary algebra. I think the rest should be reworked into a single algebra book as Whiteknight proposes: that means role intermediate algebra and the verbose algebra into one algebra book. Also, I'm of the impression that all wikibooks should be verbose to distinguish them from wikipedia articles; they should be linear, provide motivation and assume background. Thus, any articles that don't meet this standard should be assumed broken, as opposed to being the model (this is my argument against the verbose book as a separate book). 

It's good to have some detailed outlines and I think its best to keep the main book page, for such a large project, very heirarchical. I've written a little on module theory, but it would be an eyesore if everything continued to appear in the same page. So, subsections from the main would be better than the course TOC. Also, as I've said above, I think the books have suffered from bad precedents on verbosity --- we need to establish a clear voice. Hopefully a reorganization will remove some of the staleness of these projects --- it's intimidating to start writing when there are too many places to put things and no structure to fall into. We should also try and drum up some support for the elementary algebra pages --- poke your local highschool teacher to make some contributions. Let know what you think and how the module theory pages sound. Thanks for your work. [[User:Ahhoefel|Ahhoefel]] 02:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

Oh, btw, I think some of the theoretical linear algebra should be a part of the core material. It's really hard to explain spans, bases, dimension without saying what a vector space actually is. [[User:Ahhoefel|Ahhoefel]] 02:32, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= An Introduction to C =

This chapter will begin a brief explanation of the C programming language (the most direct precursor to C++). You'll write your first code in this chapter and learn about compiling your code so that it will run.

== A Brief History of C ==
::::''...the history of Time just happened to wander in by accident. Still hasn't found its way out.

=== ALGOL ===
::::''&quot;Here is a language so far ahead of its time, that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors, but also on nearly all its successors.&quot;''
::::::-Sir C. A. R. Hoare

In the beginning, far back in the mists of computer history (about fifty years or so) there was '''ALGOL''', short for '''ALGO'''rithmic '''L'''anguage. ALGOL is a family of imperative computer languages that were originally designed to avoid the pitfalls of another language of the time, '''FORTRAN''' (which finds some very limited use still today). The language was designed and developed by a committee of American and European computer scientists. The most well-known version, the one referred to by the above quote by [[w:C. A. R. Hoare|Sir C. A. R. Hoare]], was ALGOL 60, a specification for which was released in 1960. ALGOL was designed to be as minimalistic as possible; the standard did not even specify a way for programs to accept user input. (Oops.)

A later version of ALGOL, termed ALGOL 68 (released in 1968--I see a pattern here!), expanded on the language extensively, earning the ire of the aforementioned Hoare and the computer science luminary [[w:Edsger Djikstra|Edsger Djikstra]] for losing the simplicity that made ALGOL 60 a good language to use. ALGOL 68 found some use in European military technology and, if not for the Department of Defense's [[w:Ada programming language|Ada]], might have found use in the United States. As it happened, ALGOL 68 had few fans in the United States.

=== CPL, BCPL, and B ===

The [[w:CPL|CPL]], or '''C'''ombined '''P'''rogramming '''L'''anguage, came out of a partnership between Cambridge University and the University of London in the 1960s. (Hence the &quot;combined&quot; in the name; previously it was the Cambridge Programming Language.) CPL showed heavy influences from the ALGOL series of languages, but lacked the simplicity and elegance of ALGOL 60. Unlike its illustrious predecessor, CPL was too complex and heavy for computers of the time and never had much of a following. By the time computers could reliably handle the language, its time had passed entirely.

The [[w:BCPL|BCPL]], or '''B'''asic '''CPL''', grew out of the ashes of the CPL. BCPL came with an interesting idea--the CPL was a good language, but had many parts that made writing a compiler difficult but did not provide any real benefit to the programmers. Where CPL never found a niche where it could be used, BCPL quickly found a home in systems programming. BCPL had a curious feature (some might argue &quot;misfeature&quot;): there were no primitive data types--no &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, no strings (though that same variable could be used ''as'' a character, allowing you to build strings of text out of many of these variables). From BCPL came '''B''', written by [[w:Ken_Thompson|Ken Thompson]] of Bell Labs. Thompson took out any component that he thought he could do without--otherwise the language would not fit into the memory-constrained minicomputers of the time.

=== C ===
::::''Oooooooh, aaaah.''

There are a lot of urban legends around the creation of C. The language was based at least in large part on Thompson's B programming language. It was called &quot;C&quot; because it was derived from Thompson's earlier B; programmers really are logical folks (some of the time). It began with the creation of the Unix operating system.

Unix was originally designed by a number of AT&amp;T employees at Bell Labs; some of the culprits include [[w:Dennis Ritchie|Dennis Ritchie]], [[w:Ken Thompson|Ken Thompson]], [[w:Brian Kernighan|Brian Kernighan]], and [[w:Douglas McIlroy|Douglas McIlroy]]. During the 1960s, AT&amp;T, General Electric, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology used an operating system called Multics on GE-645 mainframe computers. Eventually AT&amp;T pulled out, but Thompson continued to develop for the GE-645. He wrote a game called ''Space Travel'' on it, but discovered (no doubt to his chagrin) that each play of the game cost almost $75 in computer time. So Thompson rewrote the game for the state-of-the-art DEC PDP-7. This pushed him to lead a team at Bell Labs to write the Unix operating system (its name a pun on Multics), but in assembly language--C had not been invented yet, after all.

The state-of-the-art PDP-7 was soon no longer state-of-the-art, supplanted by the PDP-11. The Unix operating system that the Bell Labs engineers had coded in assembly language was not portable, so the team at Bell Labs decided to rewrite Unix in a high-level language so they could use it on multiple computer systems without having to rewrite it every time. Instead, all that would need to be written is the compiler to take the high-level language's source code and turn it into machine code. They looked at Thompson's B programming language, but it lacked needed functionality. Thus, the project to write the language that became C was born. By 1973, C had matured to the point that most of the Unix kernel had been rewritten in C.

By the late 1970s, C was the leading programming language for microcomputers. Until 1989, though, every compiler acted slightly different; the same code might not compile with two different companies' compilers. The ANSI C standard was ratified in 1989 (and became an ISO standard in 1990), though, and compiler writers slowly began the process of standardizing their compilers.

The updated ISO C99 standard was published in 1999 and, in a fitting turnabout, was ratified by the ANSI a year later. It actually contained a number of inclusions that actually stemmed from C++ (whose history branching from C will be covered later).</text>

==Ingredients==

* 5 pounds of pork
* Salt
* Sugar
* 1/2 chopped onion
* 1/2 pounds of carrots
* 1/2 pounds of mushrooms
* Rosemary
* Sage
* Parsley
* Bay leaves
* Dried orange peels
* Oil (any kind is fine, but corn oil works best)
* Flour
* Fat
* Corn starch

Note that not all the spices are necessary, but each adds to the distinctive flavour of traditional schunn.

==Procedure==
===Preparing the meat===
# Cube the meat. The more finely you cube the meat, the more deeply the spices will penetrate the mixture. However, it should not be ground.
# Mix the meat with 2 tsp of salt, 2 tsp of sugar, a touch of rosemary, sage, and a dozen or so bay leaves. The orange peels can be added for a stronger flavour.
# Begin to boil the carrots.
# When the carrots are nearly done, fry the meat, but be careful that it does not brown. It needs only be just cooked.

===Preparing the Sauce===

# Put the fat into a frying pan, and when hot, add the flour, and stir constantly until a nice brown.
# Add the chopped onion, and continue to stir for a few minutes; then stir for about 5 minutes, or until the liquid is mostly evaporated.
# Add one third of the liquid, and stir until smooth and free from lumps.
# Add the rest of the liquid, and let boil slowly for 10 minutes; then strain and serve.

===Finishing it off===

#Add the meat and the carrots to the sauce. Add extra flavouring as necessary. Do not let the dish sit unrefrigerated for extended periods of time.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A stroke is caused by an interruption of the arterial blood supply to a portion of the   brain. This interruption may be caused by hardening of the arteries or by a clot forming in the brain.   Tissue damage and loss of function result. Onset of a stroke is sudden, with  little or no warning.  The first signs include weakness or paralysis, especially on one side of the body.  Muscles of the face may be particularly affected.  The victim’s level of consciousness varies from alert to unresponsive. Difficulty speaking or understanding language; dizziness; sudden, severe headache; distorted, dim or patchy vision are all symptoms of stroke.

If the victim has sudden onset of any 2 or more of these signs and symptoms, call an ambulance immediately. First aid for a stroke is mainly supportive.  Special attention must be paid to the victim’s airway, since he may not be able to keep it clear.

* Call an ambulance
* Place the victim in on their side, with the ''affected'' side down
* Act in a calm, reassuring manner, and keep any onlookers quiet since the victim may be able to hear what is going on. 
* Carefully monitor the victim’s vital signs and keep a log.  Pay special attention to respirations, and pulse strength and rate (take the pulse in the neck).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Epilepsy, also known as seizures or fits, is a condition characterized by an abnormal focus  of activity in the brain that produces severe motor responses or changes in consciousness. Fortunately, epilepsy can often be controlled by medications. Grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizure is the more serious type of seizure. Grand mal seizures may be - but are not always - preceded by an ''aura''.  The victim soon comes to recognize these auras, which allows him time to lie down and prepare for the seizure’s onset. A burst of nerve impulses from the brain causes unconsciousness and generalized muscular contractions, often with loss of bladder and bowel control. The primary dangers in a grand mal seizure are injuries resulting from falls and the convulsions as well as a cessation of breathing. A period of unconsciousness or mental confusion follows this type of seizure. When full consciousness returns, the victim will have little or no recollection of the seizure.

First aid is aimed at preventing the patient from injuring himself or herself. '''Nothing''' should be placed between the patient’s teeth for any reason. Never try to restrain a victim during convulsions; however, do not leave them alone.

==1. Successfully complete a class sponsored by either the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, or an equivalent under a certified instructor in order to properly learn and demonstrate one-person CPR. This must be within the past 12 months. ==

You can find a class near you using one of the following web sites:
* http://www.americanheart.org
* http://www.redcross.org/

These organizations both provide excellent training, but they do charge fees.  It is possible to find people who are certified to teach CPR and who charge lower fees.  Contact your Pathfinder Area Coordinator to see if they know of any Pathfinder staff within your conference who are qualified to offer this class.

==2. Know and understand the location and function of the heart and lungs.==

[[Image:Heart-and-lungs.jpg|thumb|400px|center]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

The heart and lungs fill the upper chest cavity. The ribs and sternum form a cage that protects these vital organs. The heart is fairly central, with a lung on either side of it.  

The lungs extract oxygen from inhaled air and inject it into the blood.  The heart then pumps the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.  When a person performs CPR, the first task is to artificially fill the lungs with oxygen.  This is done by rescue breathing.  The second task is to move the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body - especially to the brain.  This is accomplished by chest compressions (which squeeze the heart).

==3. Define CPR and tell five conditions under which it would be used. ==

The chest compressions of CPR should only be performed if there is no pulse, but it is often difficult for non-professionals to sense the pulse. For this reason the current recommendations are that the non-professional should look for signs such as coughing, normal breathing, or movement. Checking for a pulse would waste valuable time in some circumstances. [http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/967590756.html &lt;math&gt;_1&lt;/math&gt;]

This may occur in:
:Electrocution
:Drowning
:Heart Attack
:Choking
:Shock

==4. Understand Prudent Heart Living. List five things a person can do to maintain a healthy heart. ==

There are a number of factors that can affect a person's heart health.

;Smoking: Smoking raises your risk of a heart attack by two to six times. In the United states 20% of all cardiovascular disease is related to smoking. The best advice is don't smoke.
;Diet:
:'''Heart healthy diet'''- A well balanced diet can improve your heart health. You should eat more fruits (especially those high in vitamin C), nuts, and vegetables (especially leafy vegetables). Increase your intake of omega 3 fatty acids by eating flax, leafy vegetables, or fish and use olive oil rather than other &quot;bad fats&quot;.

:'''Heart damaging diet'''- A diet rich in saturated fat, trans-fats, cholesterol, sugar and salt can damage your heart and blood vessels. Cholesterol is found only in animal products, and saturated fat is found in great quantities in meat, milk products, and eggs. Greasy or fried foods - especially the modern &quot;Fast Food&quot; diet - are very bad for your health.

:In Britain 50% of all deaths are from heart disease, but death from heart disease was found to be 28% less in vegetarians. Adventist's are known for their health message, but over the years, fewer and fewer people have adopted the health principles of the church, and there has been a noticeable increase in heart disease within the church. [http://www.vegsoc.org/info/health2.html &lt;math&gt;_4&lt;/math&gt;]

;Exercise
:Regular aerobic exercise keeps your heart (which is a large muscle) in good condition.
;Drink plenty of water
:To determine how much water you should drink to stay hydrated, take your body weight in pounds, and divide it by two.  This is the number of ounces of water you should drink each day.  The Adventist Health study found that those who drank 2 glasses a water per day had about 3 times more deaths from heart disease than those who drank 5 or more glasses per day.[http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/9/827 &lt;math&gt;_5&lt;/math&gt;]
;Stress
:Stress raises your risk of heart problems.
;Heredity
:There is nothing you can do about your genetics - you may have inherited heart properties that are good or bad.  If heart problems run in your family, it is even more important for you to address the risk factors you ''can'' control.
;Gender
:Men tend to have more heart disease than women although there has been some equalization in recent years as more women have started smoking.

==5. Develop, maintain, and keep a record of a personalized program in exercise, health, and diet habits for one month.==
See the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Physical Fitness|Physical Fitness]] honor for setting up a personalized exercise program.  If you opt for aerobic exercise and stick with it for one month, you may as well stick with the program for two more months and earn the Physical Fitness honor too.

The diet can be tracked with pencil and paper or with an online tool such as the one provided by the USDA at [http://www.mypyramidtracker.gov/ www.mypyramidtracker.gov].  This would also be a good opportunity to earn the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts/Nutrition - Advanced|Nutrition - Advanced]] honor (it requires that you track your diet for one week) and the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Health and Science/Digestion|Digestion]] honor (it requires that you track your diet for two weeks).

==6. Learn the significance of the colors and design used on the honor token for this honor as follows:==
:a. The person needing CPR is white, signifying no circulation. 
:b. The person giving CPR is red, signifying a very alive person. 
:c. The background of purple signifies loyalty or commitment. 
:d. The border of gold speaks to the value of the human life. 
:e. A heart is formed by the head, shoulders, and arms of the person performing the CPR, signifying compassion for another individual.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unless you have been trained to properly do so, avoid swimming to the assistance of a person who is drowning.  A drowning non-swimmer is typically in a panic, and may grab onto anyone or anything he can reach in an effort to support their airway above the surface of the water. If the victim submerges the rescuer, the rescuer's life is endangered and the original victim has nobody to assist them.

Instead of entering the water, do one of the following:
* Talk the victim in; coach them to kick their legs
* Throw life ring, life jacket, or some other flotation device to the victim
* Reach an item such as a rope, pole, oar, or paddle to the victim, and once the victim grabs it, pull them in
* Wade into shallow water attempt the above
* Row out to the victim in a boat, or use powered craft if possible; try the above from in the boat

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fainting is a self-correcting, temporary form of shock.  It often is the result of a temporary gravitational pooling of the blood as a person stands up.  As the person falls, blood again rushes to the head, and the problem is solved.  Usually, the serious problems related to fainting are injuries that occur when falling down from the temporary loss of consciousness. Fainting may be caused  by  stressful  situations.

If a person faints (is feels he is about to faint) do the following:
* Lay victim down
* Elevate feet
* Loosen tight clothing
* Maintain an open airway

      <text xml:space="preserve">Internal soft-tissue injuries may result from deep wounds, blunt trauma, blast exposure, crushing accidents, bone fracture, poison, or  sickness.  They may range in seriousness from a simple bruise to life-threatening hemorrhage and shock.

Visible indications of internal soft-tissue injury include the following:
* Vomiting or coughing up bright red blood.
* Excretion of tarry black stools.
* Excretion of bright red blood from the rectum.
* Passing of blood in the urine.
* Nonmenstrual vaginal bleeding.
* Nosebleed.
* Pooling of the blood near the skin surface.

More often than not, however, there will be no visible signs of injury, and you will have to infer the probability of internal soft-tissue injury from other symptoms such as the following:
* Pale, moist, clammy skin.
* Subnormal temperature.
* Rapid, feeble pulse.
* Falling blood pressure.
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears).
* Fainting.
* Dehydration and thirst.
* Yawning and air hunger.

First aid’s goal must be to obtain the greatest benefit from the victim’s remaining blood supply. The following steps should be taken: 
# Treat for shock. 
# Keep the victim warm and at rest. 
# DO NOT give the victim anything to drink
# Splint injured extremities. 
# Apply cold compresses (ice packs) to identifiable injured areas. 
# Transport the victim to a medical treatment facility as soon as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Though ticks and leeches are not technically insects, we will deal with them here as if they are.  Most of the time insect bites and stings will not require first aid.  However, you should be aware that there are many insect-borne diseases including Lyme's disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, malaria, yellow fever, bubonic plague, etc.  Be on the alert for any sickness following an insect bite, and contact a doctor if you suspect transmission of an insect-borne disease.


First aid is aimed at reducing the discomfort caused by an insect bite or sting and preventing infection:
* Get away from the insects to avoid additional bites or stings.
* For stings, scrape the stinger away - do not use tweezers or otherwise pinch a stinger, as this will cause more venom to be injected into the wound.
* Place an ice pack over the affected area to reduce pain and swelling.
* Apply hydrocortizone, calamine lotion, or make a paste from three parts baking soda and one part water and apply that to the affected area.
* Give the patient an antihistamine such as Benadryl.  
* Remove ticks by pulling them straight out with a pair of tweezers.  Be careful not to break a tick's mouth parts off beneath the skin.  Contact the child's doctor who may ask you to save the tick and bring it in for testing.  Do not try to remove a tick by touching it with a hot match head or by covering it with petroleum jelly.
* Do not scratch
* Wash the affected area with soap and water.

Just before the code example, there's a note regarding initWithFrame

For this exercise, we don't need to worry about the initWithFrame: method; all of our code will go in the drawRect: method.

It would be nice to have a sentence or so about what initWithFrame is and why we don't need to worry about it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About this book==
Since 1999 I have taught an introductory course of contemporary physics to high-school students (grades 11-12) and undergraduates at the [http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/saice/index.php Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education] (SAICE) in [[wikipedia:Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], India. The SAICE is not your typical high school or college. While the students enjoy an exceptional freedom to choose their projects and courses, the teachers are free to offer subjects of their own choosing and are encouraged to explore new methods of teaching. My course is therefore optional. It is suitable for anyone with an interest in what contemporary physics is trying to tell us about the &quot;nature of Nature.&quot; To students of physics it offers a perspective that is complementary to those of many excellent textbooks.

Every year at the beginning of the new term I revise and try to improve the material I hand out to my students. These revisions are to a considerable extent based on student feedback. I am presently preparing the handouts for the next term and intend to simultaneously make them available in these pages, hoping for additional valuable feedback from the Wikibooks community.

Postscript: I have not been able to add chapters and sections as fast as I would have liked, but it's going to happen. I haven't given up on this project!--[[User:Koantum|Koantum]] 03:05, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Atoms=
==What does an atom look like?==

===Like this?===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Barium_(Elektronenbestzung).png
Image:Atom.png
Image:Stylised_Lithium_Atom.png
Image:Rutherford_atom.svg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Or like this?===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Orbitals1.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{2p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals2.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{3p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals3.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{3d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals4.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals5.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals6.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4f0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals7.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals8.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5f0}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

&lt;br&gt;None of these images depicts an atom ''as it is''. This is because it is impossible to even visualize an atom ''as it is''. Whereas the best you can do with the images in the first row is to erase them from your memory, they represent a way of viewing the atom that is too simplified for the way we want to start thinking about it, the eight fuzzy images in the next row deserve scrutiny. Each represents an aspect of a stationary state of atomic hydrogen. You see neither the nucleus (a proton) nor the electron. What you see is a fuzzy position. To be precise, what you see is a cloud-like blur, which is symmetrical about the vertical axis, and which represents the atom's internal relative position — the position of the electron relative to the proton ''or'' the position of the proton relative to the electron.

* What is the ''state'' of an atom?
* What is a ''stationary'' state?
* What exactly is a ''fuzzy'' position?
* How does such a blur represent the atom's internal relative position?
* Why can we not describe the atom's internal relative position ''as it is''?

==Quantum states==
In quantum mechanics, '''[[wikipedia:Quantum state|states]]''' are probability algorithms. We use them to calculate the probabilities of the possible outcomes of [[wikipedia:Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurements]] on the basis of actual measurement outcomes. A quantum state takes as its input
* one or several measurement outcomes,
* a measurement M,
* the time of M,

and it yields as its output the probabilities of the possible outcomes of M.

A quantum state is called '''stationary''' if the probabilities it assigns are independent of the time of the measurement to the possible outcomes of which they are assigned.

From the mathematical point of view, each blur represents a [[wikipedia:Probability density function|density function]] &lt;math&gt;\rho(\boldsymbol{r})&lt;/math&gt;. Imagine a small region &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; like the little box inside the first blur. And suppose that this is a region of the (mathematical) space of positions relative to the proton. If you integrate &lt;math&gt;\rho(\boldsymbol{r})&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;R,&lt;/math&gt; you obtain the probability &lt;math&gt;p\,(R)&lt;/math&gt; of finding the electron in &lt;math&gt;R,&lt;/math&gt; ''provided'' that the appropriate measurement is made:
:&lt;math&gt;p\,(R)=\int_R\rho(\boldsymbol{r})\,d^3\boldsymbol{r}.&lt;/math&gt;
&quot;Appropriate&quot; here means capable of ascertaining the truth value of the proposition &quot;the electron is in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, the possible truth values being &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. What we see in each of the following images is a surface of constant probability density.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Orbitals1a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{2p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals2a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{3p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals3a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{3d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals4a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals5a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals6a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4f0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals7a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals8a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5f0}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Now imagine that the appropriate measurement is made. ''Before'' the measurement, the electron is neither inside &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; nor outside &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. If it were inside, the probability of finding it outside would be zero, and if it were outside, the probability of finding it inside would be zero. ''After'' the measurement, on the other hand, the electron is either inside or outside &lt;math&gt;R.&lt;/math&gt;

Conclusions:
* Before the measurement, the proposition &quot;the electron is in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is neither true nor false; it lacks a (definite) [[wikipedia:Truth value|truth value]]. 
* A measurement generally changes the state of the system on which it is performed.

As mentioned before, probabilities are assigned not only ''to'' measurement outcomes but also ''on the basis of'' measurement outcomes. Each density function &lt;math&gt;\rho_{nlm}&lt;/math&gt; serves to assign probabilities to the possible outcomes of a measurement of the position of the electron relative to the proton. And in each case the assignment is based on the outcomes of a simultaneous measurement of three observables: the atom's energy (specified by the value of the principal quantum number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), its total [[wikipedia:Angular_momentum#Angular_momentum_in_quantum_mechanics|angular momentum]] &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; (specified by a letter, here ''p'', ''d'', or ''f''), and the vertical component of its angular momentum &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

==Fuzzy observables==
We say that an observable &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; with a finite or countable number of possible values &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt; is '''fuzzy''' (or that it has a fuzzy value) if and only if at least one of the propositions &quot;The value of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt;&quot; lacks a truth value. This is equivalent to the following necessary and sufficient condition: the probability assigned to at least one of the values &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt; is neither 0 nor 1.

What about observables that are generally described as continuous, like a position?

The description of an observable as &quot;continuous&quot; is potentially misleading. For one thing, we cannot separate an observable and its possible values from a measurement and its possible outcomes, and a measurement with an uncountable set of possible outcomes is not even in principle possible. For another, there is not a single observable called &quot;position&quot;. Different partitions of space define different position measurements with different sets of possible outcomes.

* Corollary: The possible outcomes of a position measurement (or the possible values of a position observable) are defined by a partition of space.  They make up a finite or countable set of ''regions'' of space. An exact position is therefore neither a possible measurement outcome nor a possible value of a position observable.

So how do those cloud-like blurs represent the electron's fuzzy position relative to the proton? Strictly speaking, they graphically represent probability densities in the mathematical space of exact relative positions, rather than fuzzy positions. It is these probability densities that represent fuzzy positions by allowing us to calculate the probability of every possible value of every position observable.

It should now be clear why we cannot describe the atom's internal relative position ''as it is''. To describe a fuzzy observable is to assign probabilities to the possible outcomes of a measurement. But a description that rests on the assumption that a measurement is made, does not describe an observable ''as it is'' (by itself, ''regardless of measurements'').

&lt;/div&gt;

=Serious illnesses require drastic remedies=
==Planck==
Quantum mechanics began as a desperate measure to get around some spectacular failures of what subsequently came to be known as [[wikipedia:Classical physics|classical physics]].

In 1900 [[wikipedia:Max Planck|Max Planck]] discovered a law that perfectly describes the spectrum of a glowing hot object. [[wikipedia:Planck's law of black body radiation|Planck's radiation formula]] turned out to be irreconcilable with the physics of his time. (If classical physics were right, you would be blinded by ultraviolet light if you looked at the burner of a stove, aka the [[w:UV catastrophe|UV catastrophe]].) At first, it was just a fit to the data, &quot;a fortuitous guess at an interpolation formula&quot; as Planck himself called it. Only weeks later did it turn out to imply the quantization of energy for the emission of [[wikipedia:Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic radiation]]: the energy &lt;math&gt;~E~&lt;/math&gt; of a [[wikipedia:Quantum|quantum]] of radiation is proportional to the frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; of the radiation, the constant of proportionality being [[wikipedia:Planck's constant|Planck's constant]] &lt;math&gt;~h~&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;~E = h\nu~&lt;/math&gt;.
We can of course use the [[wikipedia:Angular frequency|angular frequency]] &lt;math&gt;~\omega=2\pi\nu~&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. Introducing the reduced Planck constant &lt;math&gt;~\hbar=h/2\pi~&lt;/math&gt;, we then have
:&lt;math&gt;E = \hbar\omega&lt;/math&gt;.
This theory is valid at all temperatures and helpful in explaining radiation by black bodies.

==Rutherford==
In 1911 [[wikipedia:Ernest Rutherford|Ernest Rutherford]] proposed a [[wikipedia:Rutherford model|model of the atom]] based on experiments by [[wikipedia:Geiger-Marsden experiment|Geiger and Marsden]]. Geiger and Marsden had directed a beam of [[wikipedia:Alpha particle|alpha particles]] at a thin gold foil. Most of the particles passed the foil more or less as expected, but about one in 8000 bounced back as if it had encountered a much heavier object. In Rutherford's own words this was as incredible as if you fired a 15 inch cannon ball at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you. After analysing the data collected by Geiger and Marsden, Rutherford concluded that the diameter of the atomic nucleus (which contains over 99.9% of the atom's mass) was less than 0.01% of the diameter of the entire atom. He suggested that the atom is spherical in shape and the atomic electrons orbit the nucleus much like planets orbit a star.He calculated mass of electron as 1/7000th part of mass of alpha particle.Rutherford's atomic model is also called the Nuclear model.

The problem of having electrons orbit the nucleus the same way that a planet orbits a star is that classical electromagnetic theory demands that an orbiting electron will radiate away its energy and spiral into the nucleus in about 0.5×10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. This was the worst quantitative failure in the history of physics, under-predicting the lifetime of hydrogen by at least forty orders of magnitude! (This figure is based on the experimentally established lower bound on the proton's lifetime.)

&lt;/div&gt;
==Bohr==
In 1913 [[wikipedia:Niels Bohr|Niels Bohr]] postulated that the angular momentum &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of an orbiting atomic electron was quantized: its &quot;allowed&quot; values are integral multiples of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;L=n\hbar&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,3,\dots&lt;/math&gt;
Why quantize angular momentum, rather than any other quantity?
* Radiation energy of a given frequency is quantized in multiples of Planck's constant.
* Planck's constant is measured in the same units as [[wikipedia:Angular momentum|angular momentum]].

Bohr's postulate explained not only the stability of atoms but also why the emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation by atoms is discrete. In addition it enabled him to calculate with remarkable accuracy the spectrum of atomic hydrogen &amp;mdash; the frequencies at which it is able to emit and absorb light (visible as well as infrared and ultraviolet). The following image shows the visible emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen, which contains four lines of the [[wikipedia:Balmer series|Balmer series]].

[[image:Aequalsvsquareoverr.png|right|frame]]
Apart from his quantization postulate, Bohr's reasoning at this point remained completely classical. Let's assume with Bohr that the electron's orbit is a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;r.&lt;/math&gt; The speed of the electron is then given by &lt;math&gt;v=r\,d\beta/dt,&lt;/math&gt; and the magnitude of its acceleration by &lt;math&gt;a=dv/dt=v\,d\beta/dt.&lt;/math&gt; Eliminating &lt;math&gt;d\beta/dt&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;a=v^2/r.&lt;/math&gt; In the [[wikipedia:Centimeter gram second system of units|cgs system of units]], the magnitude of the [[wikipedia:Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] is simply &lt;math&gt;F=e^2/r^2,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the charge of both the electron and the proton. Via [[wikipedia:Newton's laws of motion|Newton's]] &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt; the last two equations yield &lt;math&gt;m_ev^2=e^2/r,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron's mass. If we take the proton to be at rest, we obtain &lt;math&gt;T=m_ev^2/2=e^2/2r&lt;/math&gt; for the electron's kinetic energy.

If the electron's potential energy at infinity is set to&amp;nbsp;0, then its potential energy &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; at a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the proton is minus the [[wikipedia:Mechanical work|work]] required to move it from &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to infinity,
:&lt;math&gt;V=-\int_r^\infty F(r')\,dr'=-\int_r^\infty\!{e^2\over(r')^2}\,dr'=
+\left[{e^2\over r'}\right]_r^\infty=0-{e^2\over r}.&lt;/math&gt;
The total energy of the electron thus is
:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V=e^2/2r-e^2/r= -e^2/2r.&lt;/math&gt;
We want to express this in terms of the electron's angular momentum &lt;math&gt;L=m_evr.&lt;/math&gt; Remembering that &lt;math&gt;m_ev^2=e^2/r,&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;rm_e^2v^2=m_ee^2,&lt;/math&gt; and multiplying the numerator &lt;math&gt;e^2\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;m_ee^2&lt;/math&gt; and the denominator &lt;math&gt;2r&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;rm_e^2v^2,&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;E=-{e^2\over2r}=-{m_ee^4\over2m_e^2v^2r^2}=-{m_ee^4\over2L^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Now comes Bohr's break with classical physics: he simply replaced &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;n\hbar&lt;/math&gt;. The &quot;allowed&quot; values for the angular momentum define a series of allowed values for the atom's energy:
:&lt;math&gt;E_n=-{1\over n^2}\left({m_ee^4\over2\hbar^2}\right),\quad n=1,2,3,\dots&lt;/math&gt;
As a result, the atom can emit or absorb energy only by amounts equal to the absolute values of the differences
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{nm}=E_n-E_m=\left({1\over n^2}-{1\over m^2}\right)\,\hbox{Ry},&lt;/math&gt;
one [[wikipedia:Rydberg|Rydberg]] (Ry) being equal to &lt;math&gt;m_e e^4/2\hbar^2 = 13.6056923(12)\,\hbox{eV.}&lt;/math&gt; This is also the [[wikipedia:Ionization potential|ionization energy]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{1\infty}&lt;/math&gt; of atomic hydrogen &amp;mdash; the energy needed to completely remove the electron from the proton. Bohr's predicted value was found to be in excellent agreement with the measured value.

Using two of the above expressions for the atom's energy and solving for &lt;math&gt;r,&lt;/math&gt; we obtain &lt;math&gt;r = n^2\hbar^2/m_ee^2.&lt;/math&gt; For the ground state &lt;math&gt;(n=1)&lt;/math&gt; this is the [[wikipedia:Bohr radius|Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom]], which equals &lt;math&gt;\hbar^2/m_ee^2 = 5.291772108(18)\times10^{-11} m.&lt;/math&gt; The mature theory yields the same figure but interprets it as the ''most likely'' distance from the proton at which the electron would be found if its distance from the proton were measured.

&lt;/div&gt;
==de Broglie==
In 1923, ten years after Bohr had derived the spectrum of atomic hydrogen by postulating the quantization of angular momentum, [[wikipedia:Louis de Broglie|Louis de Broglie]] hit on an explanation of why the atom's angular momentum comes in multiples of &lt;math&gt;\hbar.&lt;/math&gt; Since 1905, [[wikipedia:Albert Einstein|Einstein]] had argued that electromagnetic radiation itself was quantized (and not merely its emission and absorption, as Planck held). If electromagnetic waves can behave like particles (now known as [[wikipedia:Photon|photons]]), de Broglie reasoned, why cannot electrons behave like waves?

Suppose that the electron in a hydrogen atom is a [[wikipedia:Standing wave|standing wave]] on what has so far been thought of as the electron's circular orbit. (The [[wikipedia:Crest (physics)|crests, troughs]], and [[wikipedia:Node (physics)|nodes]] of a standing wave are stationary.) For such a wave to exist on a circle, the circumference of the latter must be an integral multiple of the [[wikipedia:Wavelength|wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of the former: &lt;math&gt;2\pi r = n\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:DB2.png
Image:DB3.png
Image:DB4.png
Image:DB5.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Einstein had established not only that electromagnetic radiation of frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; comes in quanta of energy &lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt; but also that these quanta carry a momentum &lt;math&gt;p=h/\lambda.&lt;/math&gt; Using this formula to eliminate &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; from the condition &lt;math&gt;2\pi r = n\lambda,&lt;/math&gt; one obtains &lt;math&gt;pr=n\hbar.&lt;/math&gt; But &lt;math&gt;pr=mvr&lt;/math&gt; is just the angular momentum &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of a classical electron with an orbit of radius &lt;math&gt;r.&lt;/math&gt; In this way de Broglie derived the condition &lt;math&gt;L=n\hbar&lt;/math&gt; that Bohr had simply postulated.

== Overview ==

&quot;How was the state advisory group formed? What is it charged to do?

When the advisory committees were formed, the major purposes of the Statewide Advisory Committee (SAC) were identified as follows:
# Provide early input to EPD and the Water Council on the description of Georgia’s over-arching goals for water management, water management objectives, and the array of new policy tools identified for development in the first water plan;
# Screen draft policy tool recommendations, for statewide applicability, before EPD submits them to the Water Council.

To accomplish these purposes, the SAC includes organizations with statewide perspectives and water-related interests that reflect Georgia’s geographic, economic, cultural, jurisdictional, and water resources realities. Governor Perdue and the Water Council identified such organizations and then, as Water Council Chair, the EPD Director formally asked each organization to name individuals from their ranks to represent the organization’s views on the SAC. ‘At-large’ individuals were also identified for their broad knowledge or expertise concerning water issues statewide.&quot;  (quoted from: [http://www.gadnr.org/gswp/Files_PDF/Materials_for_SAC_5.pdf SAC Discussion Paper, 10-20-06, pg.7])

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==


This is a developing chapter of a wikibook entitled [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine|Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine]].

Dual-energy radiography is an imaging technique which can be used to eliminate bone information in an radiograph, so that an image displaying tissues only can be displayed.  Alternatively, the technique can be used to generate the reverse effect where tissue information is eliminated and an image displaying bone only is generated.  This latter option ideally allows indicators of bone density to be assessed.  A theoretical background to this technique will first be developed below with the discussion leading towards [[W:Dual_Energy_X-ray_Absorptiometry|Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry]] ('''DEXA''').

== Dual-Energy Radiography ==

Dual-energy imaging is based on exploiting the difference in the attenuation of tissue and bone at different X- ray energies - see the following figure:

[[Image:macBoneTissue.jpg|thumb|384px|center|Energy dependence of the mass attenuation coefficients of soft tissue and cortical bone - adapted from [http://www.icru.org/ ICRU] Report 46.]]

It generally involves acquiring images at two 
X-ray energies and processing these images to suppress either the bone or the tissue information.  A simple mathematical model assumes that monoenergetic radiation is used and no scattered radiation is detected, so that the transmitted radiation intensity through a region of bone and tissue, acquired at a low X-ray energy and following logarithmic transformation, is given by:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;lo&lt;/sub&gt; = μ&lt;sub&gt;tlo&lt;/sub&gt; x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + μ&lt;sub&gt;blo&lt;/sub&gt; x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ,&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where: 
::*&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;tlo&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is the [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Attenuation_of_Gamma-Rays#Mathematical_Model|linear attenuation coefficient]] of tissue at the low X-ray energy; 
::*&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is the tissue thickness; 
::*&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;blo&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is the linear attenuation coefficient of bone at the low X-ray energy; and 
::*&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is the bone thickness.

Similarly, the transmitted radiation intensity for the same region of an image acquired at a higher X-ray energy is given by:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;hi&lt;/sub&gt; = μ&lt;sub&gt;thi&lt;/sub&gt; x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + μ&lt;sub&gt;bhi&lt;/sub&gt; x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ,&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where: 
::*&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;thi&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is the linear attenuation coefficient of tissue at the higher X-ray energy; and
::*&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;bhi&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is the linear attenuation coefficient of bone at the higher X-ray energy.

When these images are multiplied by separate weighting factors, &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;lo&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;hi&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, and the result combined to form a composite image, the output image is given by:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;I = k&lt;sub&gt;lo&lt;/sub&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;lo&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;hi&lt;/sub&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;hi&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; .&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;I = (k&lt;sub&gt;lo&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;tlo&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;hi&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;thi&lt;/sub&gt;) x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + (k&lt;sub&gt;lo&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;blo&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;hi&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;bhi&lt;/sub&gt;) x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


which indicates that tissue cancellation can be achieved by setting the coefficient of &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; equal to zero, i.e.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;lo&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;tlo&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;hi&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;thi&lt;/sub&gt; = 0&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;

Thus,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;lo&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;tlo&lt;/sub&gt; = - k&lt;sub&gt;hi&lt;/sub&gt; μ&lt;sub&gt;thi&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ,&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{k_{hi}}{k_{lo}} = -\frac{\mu_{tlo}}{\mu_{thi}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

which indicates that tissue can be eliminated from the composite image when the ratio of weighting factors in equation &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/font&gt; above is chosen to equal the negative of the ratio of the attenuation coefficients of tissue at the two X-ray energies.  A similar approach can be used to cause bone cancellation by setting the coefficient of &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; in 
equation &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/font&gt; to zero.

This form of image data processing is illustrated in the following figure:

[[Image:dualEnergyImageDemo.jpg|frame|center|Dual-energy images: A low and a high energy chest radiograph are shown in the top row, above the results for energy processing.]]

A chest radiograph acquired at 56 kVp is shown in the top left panel of the figure.  This is referred to as a low energy image.  In the top right panel is a radiograph of the same patient's chest acquired at a high energy - 120 kVp, with 1 mm copper filtration.  Results of the dual-energy processing are shown on the bottom row.  The bone-subtracted image is shown in the bottom left panel and the tissue-subtracted image in the bottom right panel.  Notice that the tissue-subtracted image demonstrates that the lesion in the patient's left lung is a calcified nodule, since it doesn't appear in the bone-subtracted image.

== Radiographic Image Receptors ==

There are at least three new technologies used in radiography which offer numerous advantages over the traditional screen/film image receptors.  An overview of these technologies is provided below to support our treatment of dual-energy imaging - and also our consideration of the registration and fusion of planar images in [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/PACS_and_Advanced_Image_Processing#Spatial_Registration_of_Images|another chapter]] of this wikibook.

:*'''Computed Radiography (CR)'''
:::This method of recording a projection radiograph is based on exploiting the photostimulable luminescent properties of barium fluorohalide compounds. The phosphor is layered on an '''imaging plate''' which when mounted in a cassette is used in place of the film/screen cassette used traditionally in radiography. The imaging plate is sometimes referred to as a storage phosphor because  it stores a latent image following the radiation exposure which can be scanned afterwards using a readout device - as illustrated in the following figure: 

[[Image:compRad1.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of the exposure, readout and erasure stages involved in generating a computed radiography image.]]

:::The figure shows the radiation exposure in the top left where the cassette is placed anterior to the patient to record the projected image.  The cassette is then placed in a readout device (follow the blue downward arrow!), where it is scanned by a laser beam to digitize the latent image.  The cassette can then be prepared for re-use by exposing it to intense [[W:Incandescent|incandescent]] light to erase any residual latent image information (top right in the figure above).

:::The readout stage is shown in more detail in our next figure:

[[Image:compRad2.jpg|frame|center|Illustration of the readout process involved in generating a computed radiography image.]]

:::The figure illustrates one mechanism used to scan the imaging plate where a narrow laser beam strikes a rotating mirror causing it to scan a single line across the plate. The plate is then moved so that the scanning laser beam can read the next line of the latent image information.

:::The latent image is formed through radiation absorption processes in the photostimulable phosphor where electrons are knocked into higher energy states where they remain until they're later stimulated to return to their ground states using the red laser beam - a process similar to thermoluminescence where  light is used instead of heat. The electrons emit blue light - called a photostimulable luminescence ('''PSL''') - as they return to their ground states with the amount of light being proprotional to the radiation exposure.

[[Image:compRad3.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of the excellent linearity and dynamic range of computed radiography (black line), a property not shared by film-screen image receptors (red curve).]]

:::The emitted light is guided by a light guide, as shown in the figure above, so that its intensity can be measured using a [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Scintillation_Detectors#Photomultiplier_Tube|photomultiplier tube]] ('''PMT''').  The output of the PMT is digitized using an analogue-to-digital converter ('''ADC''') before computer processing is applied.

:::One major advantage of computed radiography ('''CR''') over traditional methods is its excellent linearity and [[W:Dynamic_range|dynamic range]], as illustrated by the graph. The vertical axis on the left of the graph refers to the response of a CR plate, while the one on the right refers to a film/screen system.  Its seen that the film/screen response (red curve) contains regions which can generate under- and over-exposures of the radiographic film.  The ''linear'' region between these two is ideally used for recording a patient's image.  Notice that the range of exposures equivalent to this linear region is substantially smaller than that provided by CR technology, i.e. its got a smaller dynamic range (also called [[W:Exposure_latitude|exposure latitude]] in photography).

:::The important point to appreciate here is that CR images present data which is a superior record of the radiation exposure pattern incident on the cassette. They do not contain regions of over- and/or under-exposure, as is common is film/screen radiography.  An improved ability to discriminate within regions of high (or indeed low) transmission results, so that, for example, a renal calculus can be readily depicted within a contrast filled renal pelvis in an [[W:Intravenous_pyelogram|IVP]].  Note that the dynamic range of CR is rather broad and that [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Computers_in_Nuclear_Medicine#Digital_Image_Processing|contrast enhancement]] techniques are typically applied in a post-processing mode to ''window'' through the image data so that particular features of interest can be discerned.  Example CR images are shown below:

[[Image:chestNL.jpg|thumb|512px|center|The same CR image of a patient's chest displayed with contrast enhancement on the left and unprocessed on the right. Note the superior contrast within the lung fields in the processed image.]]

:::This linear, wide dynamic range characteristic is also shared by digital radiographic image receptors.

:*'''Digital Radiography (DR)'''
:::Considerable research has been conducted in recent years into the development of flat panel image receptors for digital radiography.  This research has extended from the development of active-matrix liquid-crystal flat panel displays ([[W:AMLCD|AMLCDs]]) for application in, for example, portable computers.  The underlying technology of AMLCDs is a large area integrated circuit called an [[W:Active_matrix_addressing|active matrix]] array which consists of many millions of identical semiconductor elements deposited on a substrate material.  An intensifying screen or a photoconductor coupled to such an active matrix array forms the basis of flat panel X-ray image receptors.

:::Such a receptor is illustrated in the following figure, where the active matrix array and associated electronic circuitry is mounted in a device which replaces the X-ray cassette in screen-film radiography:

[[Image:flatPanel1.jpg|thumb|512px|center|Illustrations of an active matrix array and its 
associated electronic circuitry (left) housed inside the image receptor and connected to a digital image processor and image display device, and of a 3 x 3 pixel section of an active matrix array (right), showing switches associated with each pixel, the switching control and pre-amplifier circuitry and connecting conductors.]]

:::Array sizes of up to 43 cm x 43 cm have been constructed with more than 9 million pixels (pixel size ~150 μm).  Operation of the array is controlled by a digital image processor which also stores and displays the resultant images.

:::The operation is illustrated in more detail in the right panel of the above figure.  Each pixel of the array has a switch (typically made from a [[W:Thin-film_transistor|thin film transistor]]) which is connected to switching control circuitry in a manner which allows all switches in a row of the array to be operated simultaneously.  The output from each pixel is connected in columns with individual pre-amplifiers.

:::All switches are kept in the off position during the X-ray exposure.  Following the exposure, the switches in the first row are turned on and the signal from each pixel is amplified by the pre-amplifiers, digitised in an analogue-to-digital converter ('''ADC''') and stored in the image memory of the digital image processor.  These switches are then turned off and the switches in the second row are turned on to acquire signals from the second row of pixels. This process is repeated for the whole array so that an image is acquired in a sequential, line-by-line manner.

:::Research developments have resulted in two distinct types of digital receptor:

:::*'''Indirect Image Receptors'''
:::::Indirect receptors are based on coupling an fluorescent screen to the active matrix array. Phosphors such as Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S:Tb and CsI:Tl have been used, and the light produced following X-ray interaction is detected by an array of pixels consisting of photodetectors - see the following figure:

[[Image:flatPanel2_2.jpg|frame|center|Cross-sectional view of an indirect flat panel 
image receptor showing three pixels mounted on a glass substrate.]]

:::::Each photodetector generates an electric charge that is proportional to the amount of light striking it, and this charge is stored until it is read-out by the switching control circuitry.  The detection process is referred to as ''indirect'' since the detected X-rays are first converted to  light, which is subsequently converted to electric charge.

:::*'''Direct Image Receptors'''
:::::Direct receptors are based on coupling a photoconductor to the active matrix array. Photoconductors such as amorphous selenium (a-Se) have been used, and the electric charge produced following X-ray interaction is detected by an array of pixels each consisting of an electrode and a capacitor - see the following figure:

[[Image:flatPanel2_3.jpg|frame|center|Cross-sectional view of an direct flat panel 
image receptor showing three pixels mounted on a glass substrate.]]

:::::This charge is stored in each capacitor until it is read-out by the electronic switching circuitry.  The photoconductor requires a voltage of the order of 5,000 V to be applied, using a surface electrode, so that the charge produced can be attracted to the pixel electrodes.  Other photoconductors under investigation for this application include PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PbO, TlBr and CdTe. 
 
:::::The photoconductive properties of amorphous selenium (a-Se) have been known for many years and have been widely applied in [[W:Xerography|photocopier]], facsimile and laser printer devices.  This direct imaging technique has evolved from xeroradiography, which was a popular medical imaging technique many years ago mainly for soft tissue imaging.  Here, X-ray absorption in the photoconductor results in changes in the distribution of the electric charge reflecting local X-ray absorption, i.e. a latent image is recorded in terms of the distribution of electric charge on the surface of an a-Se plate.  Methods of rendering the latent image visible include: 
:::::::*spraying charged toner particles onto the plate and transferring this image to paper; 
:::::::*scanning the plate with electric charge transducers (e.g. electrometers) and digitising the output for storage in computer memory. 
:::::The toner approach was that adopted in the original xeroradiography systems and is no longer in widespread clinical use, mainly due to developments in film-screen technology.  The scanning electrometer approach has been applied to the clinical imaging of chests with the Philips Thoravision system.  This involves use of an a-Se layer deposited on a cylinder.  The latent image is recorded on the surface of the layer and the drum is subsequently rotated past a linear array of tiny electrometers.  In comparison, the direct image receptors use an a-Se layer in intimate contact with a two-dimensional array of pixel-sized electrodes, as we have seen above.

:::Important design features of flat panel image receptors include the '''pixel size''' and the '''fill factor'''.  Pixel size undoubtedly affects spatial resolution and sizes of the order of 100 - 200 μm are typical.  The fill factor is the percentage of a pixel area which is sensitive to the image signal - be it electric charge or light photons.  It is never 100%, given the need to accommodate conductors (~10 μm wide) which input switching signals and which output image signals, as well as the thin film transistor in each pixel.  

:::Digital image processing techniques are typically applied to acquired images before they are displayed.  These include logarithmic transformation, to correct for exponential X-ray attenuation, and contrast enhancement, to optimise the displayed gray values.  Other digital processing techniques are also necessary to overcome limitations associated with the manufacturing process for individual image receptors.  These include flat field (i.e. uniformity) corrections, to overcome spatial sensitivity variations, and median filtering, to remove the effects of defective pixels. 

:::Advantages of the indirect and direct image receptors purport to include a large, linear dynamic range, similar to photostimulable phosphors, and superior [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Fourier_Methods#Modulation_Transfer_Function|modulation transfer function]] ('''MTF''') and detective quantum efficiency ('''DQE''') compared with both film-screen and photostimulable phosphor systems.  Such receptors are currently (i.e. in 2006) being introduced by major medical imaging companies and it is likely that their clinical application will become a significant feature in coming years.

A final point to note is that both CR and DR receptors can be used for dual-energy radiography in either of the following configurations:

:*Two exposures: where two separate exposures are used in applications where patient movement isn't an issue; and

:*Single exposure: where two imaging plates separated by a filter are mounted in a dual-energy cassette to record the low energy image on the anterior plate and the high energy image on the other.

== Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) ==

This technique has its origin in a nuclear medicine procedure where transmission for two gamma ray energies was used to determine bone mineral density.  The procedure is referred to as '''Dual Photon Absorptiometry''' and typically used the isotope &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Gd, which emits gamma rays at 44 and 100 keV.  As a result of limitations in photon flux and practical considerations, the radioactive source has been replaced by an [[W:X-ray_tube|X-ray tube]] (XRT) in the DEXA technique - just like scanning radioisotope sources have been replaced by XRTs for attenuation correction in SPECT imaging.  This method has found widespread clinical application for the assessment and monitoring of [[W:Osteoporosis|osteoporosis]] and has surpassed the main alternative technique, Quantitative Computed Tomography ('''QCT''') in terms of accuracy, precision and radiation dose.

Two general approaches to generating the appropriate X-ray energies have been developed.  In one approach, the kilovoltage and filtration are switched rapidly during image acquisition, e.g. from 70 kVp and 4 mm Al filtration to 140 kVp with an additional 3 mm Cu filter.  In the second approach, a single X-ray energy with two different filters is used, e.g. 80 kVp with alternatively no added filtration and a [[W:Cerium|cerium]] or [[W:Samarium|samarium]] filter.  Cerium has a K absorption edge at 40.4 keV, and samarium at 46.8 keV, and both materials generate a hardened beam compared with the unfiltered spectrum.

The DEXA technique typically involves an X-ray tube and scintillation detector mounted on a C-arm (see the figure below) so that the patient is exposed to a pencil X-ray beam scanning in a rectilinear fashion.

&lt;center&gt;

| [[Image:qdr4000.jpg|frame|center|DEXA scanning apparatus with an under-couch XRT and pencil-beam detector.]]
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The pencil beam is used to reduce the detection of scattered radiation and the scintillation 
detector typically consists of a [[W:Cadmium_tungstate|CdWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] or [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Scintillation_Detectors#Fluorescent_Materials|NaI(Tl) scintillator]] coupled to a photomultiplier tube.  The filter assembly is used to switch filters and calibration standards into and out of the pencil beam at appropriate intervals.  Scan times with this approach are of the order of 2 to 5 minutes, depending on the examination, which are reduced in second generation instruments where a fan X-ray beam and a detector array are used.  By rotating the C-arm around the patient during the scan in the second generation devices, a CT image can be formed.  The output of the scintillation detector is fed to a computer for dual-energy data processing and image display.  A host of body composition parameters can be derived from the image data, e.g. [[W:Bone_mineral_density|bone mineral density]] and [[W:Body_fat_percentage|soft tissue composition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Creating Energy&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Energy is used for many purposes, as a culture becomes more complex the uses for energy diversify. 

==Basic energy uses==

The prime need for energy use in all parts of the world is for food preparation, preservation in hot climes &amp; cooking. In cold climates it is essential for heating living spaces.

==Energy Sources==

*Firewood
*Solar energy
**Solar Energy for cooking
**Solar energy for water heating
**Solar energy for creating electricity
*Hydroelectricity
*Hydromechanical
*Wind energy
*Connection to the network

===Firewood===

Firewood is the oldest and often most accessible energy source. An open wood fire can be used to cook food. There are many types of stoves and ovens that use wood to create heat for cooking and for heating of living spaces.

It is important to consider the source of the firewood; in many areas in the world people have cut all the trees down in an area to supply firewood or building material leaving no trees for future generations. As a general rule for every tree that is cut down 3 new ones should planted. 
 
===Solar Energy===

The energy from the sun can be used to heat water or even cook food; this is the best way to do this from an environmental point of view. It creates no pollution and uses no resources apart from those used for its fabrication.

====Solar Cooking====
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Solar-Panel-Cooker-in-front-of-hut.jpg|right|thumb|400px|This image is borrowed from the Wikipedia article on Solar Cooking[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Cooking]], it would be best for a new photo or diagram to be created for this project. It should also be drawn in a style that is suitable for educational purposes. Use the following disclaimer template [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:PD-self PD-Self]]
]]

Solar cooking has been used for centuries by explorers travelling in areas without access to wood to create fire. Since the 1970´s general interest has increased because of the energy it saves. 

The simplest design is called the CooKit designed by Frenchman Roger Bernard en the early 1990´s; it is made from cardboard tinfoil a heat resistant plastic bag and a dark coloured pot.


'''See links below for more information.'''

====Solar for Heating Water====

Solar water heating systems are very efficient. In developed countries where it is common to heat water with electricity or gas from a centralized system, the cost of the installation can be paid back from saving in energy costs. 

For rural development simple solar heating systems can be used to heat water even in areas the electricity or gas network has not yet reached.

Solar heating of the water is also called solar pasteurization; by heating the water many viruses and bacteria that cause diseases are killed. Hot water can also be used to clean living spaces and cooking and eating utensils more effectively.

====Solar for Generating Electricity====

Using solar energy for creating electricity is an environmentally friendly process but is unfortunately not very efficient, primarily because of the cost of fabrication of the solar panels.  It is a very good technology when small amounts of energy are needed; to supply power for school computers etc.

If electricity is needed at night then a battery system must be added to store the energy. 

===Hydroelectricity===

If there are waterways nearby, dams are a very easy way to create energy in mechanical form; this can be turned into electricity with a turbine and generator.

The main problem with damming waterways to create energy is the change in ecosystem it creates, and the negative effect is has on the movement of silt downstream, the probabilty of the dam silting up, &amp; the  migration of fish up and downstream. 

It is very important to create fish passes (ladders) so that the natural migration of fish can continue.

Small scale hydroelectric sets can be placed directly in streams with little or no civil engineering needed other than to anchor the set.

===Hydromechanical===
This is a very old technology, &amp; is simply extracting energy as torque, via a paddle-wheel of some sort, &amp; applying it to a set of grinding wheels, hammers

===Wind Energy===

Wind energy was first harnessed in Persia around 200BC to grind grain, shortly after the technology was copied by the Romans and consequently spreads across Europe where it has been used for pumping water and grinding grain until the early 20th century. 

The first wind-,turbine used to create electricity was constructed in the United States in 1888, since then they have been used for pumping water or generating electricity in isolated areas around the world primarily on farms.

Wind turbines range in size from small 30 cm diameter models used to generate small amounts of electricity, to 10m high 2m diameter wind-turbine that typically has many blades, to giant 100m high 120m diameter wind-turbine that produce up to 5MW of energy.

In rural areas where it is not possible to connect to the electrical network, wind-turbines can installed to pump water and generate electricity.

==Energy Storage==

Electrical energy can be stored mechanically or chemically. The most common mechanical storage is by damming water; this can be done by waiting for it to flow into a dam or by pumping it up into a dam using excess electricity in a network. 
Batteries use a chemical process to store electricity. This process is not very efficient, batteries are expensive to make &amp; dispose of, and even rechargeable ones have quite short life spans. Therefore it is best to try and avoid storing electricity and only create it when it is needed.  That is why developed countries have large electrical networks to supply the electricity as it is generated.

==Connecting to the Electrical Network==

The first electrical network was connected in New York in 1883 by Thomas Edison the American inventor at the worlds first Research &amp; Development centre. Since then the network has grown across the globe with most most developed countries in the world having centralized networks by mid 20th century. 

Because alternative energy sources are only available when there is wind or sunshine, having a village connected to the electrical network means that excess energy produced from generation installations can be sold and when there is no wind or sunshine needed energy can be purchased. This is more efficient and environmentally friendly than using batteries.

==Environmental Considerations==

Energy creating generally uses up resources, which should be replaced if possible; trees cut down for firewood should be replaced with 3 trees planted. 

Energy creating also produces Carbon Dioxide and other gases which pollute the air. CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) is one of the known Greenhouse gases, which may be linked to Global warming. 

Whenever possible it is best to use renewable energy sources like solar or wind energy, and also try and be inventive about the way of using energy to minimize the amount that is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The mass of a star - along with its chemical composition - are key to its behavior. Once these two features of a star are determined, one can calculate the temperature of the star's core and the pressures of its gases as well as the strength of the gravitational force acting within the star itself. The star's mass and composition can, therefore, determine the star's size and luminosity.

How, then, do we begin to calculate a star's mass? Binary stars can help us determine the mass of stars. 

Binary systems are composed of two stars that orbit each other. Mizar and Alcor, for instance, are two stars that are '''apparent''' (not actual) binaries; they appear to be very close together in the sky, they are actually distant from each other. Mizar, however, is a true binary, made up of Mizar A and Mizar B, with a period of 10,000 years.

Because binary stars' orbits depend on their gravitational attraction to each other, the measurement of their orbital distance and the length of time it takes them to complete one orbit can be used to calculate the summation of the stars' masses. Hence, the following equation can be used:

&lt;math&gt;(M_1 + M_2)P^2 = (D_1 + D_2)^3 = R^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; are the masses of the two stars, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the period of the orbit, &lt;math&gt;D_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_2&lt;/math&gt; are the distances from the center of each star to the center of mass of the binary system, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the total separation between the centers of the two stars, or &lt;math&gt;(D_1 + D_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Astronomers usually express the masses of astronomical objects in terms of our Sun's mass, where one solar mass is approximately equal to 1.99 x 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms, or about 4.39 x 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; pounds.

An '''astrometric binary''' is found by observing a star's proper motion. If it is wavy, that indicates the presence of a binary; non-binary stars have a straight line proper motion.

An '''eclipsing binary''' is detected by observing a star as it becomes occluded by its twin. An example of this is Algol (Beta Persei in Perseus).

There are three different types of binary systems of stars which provide information about the masses of those stars. '''Visual binaries''' refer to those stars which can each be visibly seen by astronomers through telescopes. The masses of these types of stars can be calculated when they are near enough to the Earth for astronomers to determine the size and tilt of the two stars' orbits about each other.

Another type of binary system that provides information about stellar masses is known as the '''spectroscopic binary'''. Using spectroscopic observations of the two stars, the doppler shifts of the two stars as they orbit each other can be measured and astronomers can collect sufficient data in order to find estimates for the masses of those binary stars. In this type of binary, astronomers are only able to conclude upon a lower limit of the masses because they must first know the orientation of the stars in their orbits. If the two stars do not form an '''eclipsing binary''', then one of the stars never passes in front of the other, so astronomers are unable to calculate the orbit's orientation.

As stated previously, the use of binary systems to calculate star masses often leads to limited information. The above method of determining mass is very useful given that the other values are known, but obtaining these needed values can prove to be troublesome. When observing an astrometric binary, for example, we are unable to see the exact orbits. Moreover, even mapped orbits are problematic because they are two-dimensional representations of a truly three-dimensional motion of two stars. In either case, additional information is needed to calculate the orbits and masses of the stars more accurately. As a result, it is oftentimes easier to calculate the '''total mass''' of the binary system.

Astronomers have calculated that all stars that have been measured to date have masses that range from &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{50}&lt;/math&gt; to 50 solar masses.

The mass of a star can then be used to determine its '''escape velocity''': the velocity necessary for an object to escape the star's gravitational force. The escape velocity becomes greater as a star is more massive but decreases with the star's radius. The formula for calculating escape velocity is

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac {2GM}{R}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is ''mass'', and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is ''radius''.

==Elements==
Besides providing light, stars have another important role in the development of life: creation of elements! Stars produce many elements during their life cycles, which are thrown off through their solar wind, when they blow off their outer atmosphere and form planetary nebulae and most spectacularly, when they go supernova. Indeed, all elements, except for hydrogen and helium, were produced by stars. This means that the material making up plants, animals, even you, was at one time manufactured by a star! The famous astronomer Carl Sagan once observed, &quot;We are made of star-stuff.&quot;

Main sequence stars are made up of hydrogen (H) and helium (He). Red giants are made of elements heavier than helium, up to and including iron (Fe). Iron is the most stable element, meaning that it's the hardest to transmute. Supernovas produce all elements heavier than iron, up to and including Californium (Cf).

      <text xml:space="preserve">
The Solar System consists of eight planets circling a central star - the Sun.  The eight planets fall into two distinct groups.  The four innermost planets are very close to the sun, are formed of rocky materials, and are relatively small.  The four outermost planets are far from the Sun, are formed of gasses, and are relatively large.  The Earth is one of the four innermost planets, so they are called the '''terrestrial''' planets (''Terra'' is latin for earth, so ''terrestrial'' means &quot;earth-like&quot;.  The four outer planets are called the '''Jovian''' (''Jupiter-like'') planets.

The terrestrial planets are, in order of distance from the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.  All of these planets are made of rocky substances, primarily nickel, iron, and silicon.  The Jovians are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium gas.  The terrestrials orbit the Sun at distances between approximately 0.3 and 1.5 ''Astronomical Units'' from the Sun (an ''Astronomical Unit'' or ''AU'' is defined as the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, so the Earth is 1 A. U. from the Sun).  In contrast, the Jovian planets spread from 5AU to 30 AU.  The terrestrials are fairly small;  the Earth is the largest of the four, and Mercury is only about 1/4 the diameter of the Earth.  The Jovians are relatively large, from 4 to 11 times the size of the Earth.

All of the terrestrial planets are presumed to have formed through the same process, so all should share common properties.  The terrestrial planets are different than the Jovians because a planet close to a star forms under different conditions than if it is far from the star.  The terrestrial planets formed separately in different orbits, so there are significant differences between the four.  The four terrestrials have many things in common, but each one is unique in its particular size, atmosphere chemistry, year, etcetera.

==Mercury==
&lt;u&gt;General Information&lt;/u&gt;

[[/Mercury/|Mercury]] is the closest planet to the Sun. Its orbit is a mere 88 Earth-days, meaning that in the time it takes for the Earth to make one full revolution around the Sun, Mercury makes a little over four revolutions.

Solar days on Mercury are extremely long. It takes two orbits about the Sun for Mercury to complete one full rotation around its axis relative to the sun, so most points on the planet experience direct sunlight for a (Mercurial) year at a time.

Mercury has a highly elliptical orbit, finding itself a mere 0.313 AU from the sun at Perihelion (closest point to the Sun) and at 0.459 AU at Aphelion (farthest point from the Sun). This stretched orbit, combined with a thin and nebulous atmosphere, result in Mercury having wild temperature swings: temperatures during the day tend to exceed 800 degrees F, while temperatures during Mercurial night tend to drop 1100 °F to a frigid -300 °F.

Mercury can be thought of as a ball of iron, wrapped in a blanket of molten material, covered in a rocky jacket.

==Venus==
[[/Venus/|Venus]] is the second planet from the sun, and the only terrestrial planet to rotate in a retrograde manner.  Venus has a sidereal day (rotation period relative to the distant stars) lasting about 243.0 Earth-days, or about 1.08 times its orbital period of 224.7 Earth-days. Because of its retrograde rotation, its solar day is &quot;only&quot; about 116.8 Earth-days, and it has about 1.9 solar days per orbital period.

The surface temperature of Venus is highly uniform, about 462 °C (about 736 K/864 °F) &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Venus (Planet).&quot;The Encarta Concise Encyclopedia. 19 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;. Every 500 million years, the surface of Venus melts, and solidifies again.

Normal telescopes cannot penetrate the very thick atmosphere, but radar can be used to map out the topography of the land.

==Earth==
The planet [[/Earth/|Earth]] is the planet on which all known life in the universe lives. It is the third planet from the sun and the largest terrestrial planet. 

Life on Earth is made possible by its massive reserves of liquid water. No other body in the solar system is known to have massive quantities of liquid water, though several Jovian moons are suspected to have oceans under their crust. 

The Earth's only natural satellite, the Moon, is the largest satellite in the solar system relative to its planet. This means that the Moon and Earth are sometimes considered to be a double planet. The Moon is also the only celestial body aside from the Earth that has been set foot upon by humans.

==Mars==
The highest mountain on [[/Mars/|Mars]] is Olympus Mons. The northern hemisphere is dominated by volcanic plains; the south by heavily-cratered highlands. The surface is very dusty, and covered with dunes. The sky is a pinkish-orange, from dust storms.

Mars has a chaotic terrain. Astronomers believe it was created when magma melted underground permafrost, causing the ground to collapse. Valley networks are believed to have been caused by rain, and water flowing under ice.

Dried lake beds indicate the presence of water in Mars' past. Another indicator is calcium carbonate, found in a Martian meteor in 1996. Yet another is the presence of outflow channels (believed to have been caused by underground permafrost melted by magma) and alluvial fans. Evidence of seepage flows have also been found. These occur when water breaks through ice and cascades down a cliff.

Martian craters are different from the craters found on the Moon, Venus, or Earth. They're surrounded by mud flows.

The first to map the surface of Mars was Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaperelli in 1877. He observed a series of lines criscrossing the Martian landscape, which he called ''canali'' (channels). Some astronomers translated ''canali'' as ''canal'', implying that they had been built by intelligent beings.[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_102.html] This idea was advanced by Percival Lowell in his books ''Mars and Its Waterways'' (1903) and ''Mars as the Abode of Life'' (1908)[http://www.nasm.si.edu/ceps/etp/mars/percival.html]. It was later discovered that the Martian canals don't actually exist, and were very likely an optical illusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is estimated that the number of the stars in the universe is around &lt;math&gt;10^{20}&lt;/math&gt;. This is calculated based on the fact that there are about &lt;math&gt;10^9&lt;/math&gt; galaxies in the universe, each of which is composed of an average of &lt;math&gt;10^{11}&lt;/math&gt; stars each.

A '''nebula''' is a cloudlike object. Scientists can determine what type of nebula they are observing by examing its spectrum: an emission spectrum indicates glowing gas, while an absorption spectrum indicates a mass of stars. The Pleiades, for instance, has absorption spectrum.

Two kinds of nebulae are '''open clusters''' (loose groups of a few hundred stars; e.g. Pleiades, Hyades, Ursa Major) and '''globular clusters''' (spherical nebulae with hundreds of thousands of stars, such as M13 in Hercules and M3 in Canes Venatici). Most nebulae appear as a hazy patch when viewed with a small telescope. Dark nebulae are gaseous clouds that block light. This is where stars form.

Stars are created when gravity collapses dust and gasses together.

== Questions!  ==
Hi Pete - good to hear from you.  You gets loads of brownie points from me for user the &quot;edit summary&quot; apart from anything else - a rarity here!

So some answers (accurately my thoughts - answers will be yours!).  Quite a lot of wikibooks seems to have been created enthusiatically and then abandoned (I've only been here a couple of weeks myself but I was and still am on Wikipedia too).

Take a look at the history of the page you are interested in.  When was the last consistent contribution by a named editor (IP's kinda don't count)?  Go to that editors user page and look at &quot;user contributions&quot; - that will give you an idea of whether they are still active but on other books maybe.  If they are a message on their talk page should get you some answers.  Frankly if they aren't active make it your way (any changes are always reversible effectively).

Until I got here I'd not done much page moving but it doesn't hurt &lt;g&gt;.  As to the effect on links you can always look at the &quot;What links here&quot; in the toolbox but in practice you can check out &quot;Module cleanup&quot; (under &quot;Tools&quot;) and the look at &quot;Redirects&quot; there.  Anything is fixable!  I'll happily help if needed.  Consider posting in the &quot;Staff lounge&quot; too.  A very small but friendly bunch and that applies to the very few active admins too.

Feel free to get back to me if I can help at all and best of luck with the change in direction - I've done a bit of &quot;late learning&quot; too but not as ambitious as yours.  You know where I am - all the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:03, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

PS - most of my &quot;best&quot; ideas came from looking at pages I like and copying the layout, wikitext, whatever! - H


:Thanks Herby. I'm certainly familiar with the &quot;start and abandon&quot; thing. I've done it on a number of software projects myself. Fortunately, for a project like this, people can step in at any time and continue the work, which is nice. I'm very busy these days, but I'm taking organic chemistry right now and I'm finding that if I have to write about it, then I have to know it well enough to write about it and that's helping me learn more. I also tend to remember the stuff I write myself better than what I read, so part of it is just an exercise in studying for me.

:As for the edit summaries, I set my preferences to remind me. As a software engineer, we use software for keeping track of code changes and it's REALLY, REALLY valuable, especially when you wonder, &quot;Why did I do that?&quot; So, unless I'm simply fixing some spelling or formatting, I'll generally leave comments as to why I made the change I made.

:Thanks for the tips on how to maintain the links and tracking down active authors. Those will be really helpful (well, the first will. The second will only be helpful if there are any active authors...) Thanks again. [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 16:19, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

::I understand the idea of it helping the study - had such a thing existed when I did mine it probably would have helped a lot.  I'll help if I can (but the chemistry knowledge is VERY out of date!) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:31, 12 November 2006 (UTC)


:::I'm not too concerned with the &quot;knowledge&quot; aspect. I have a lot of resources. 4 organic chemistry textbooks, a fantastic professor, and the web. In making sure that what I write is accurate, it really reinforces all the information in my head. Once I'm done with organic chemistry, I may end up contributing to other books (biochemistry, anatomy, physiology, etc) as I take the classes, since it's clearly helping me to learn the stuff better.

== Importing from Wikipedia ==

Hi Pete, sorry I misunderstodd the question on the staff lounge :). If you've been gone for a while and arte now returned, you might not know about the [[Special:Import]] function we have now. If you want to &quot;harvest&quot; wikipedia atricles for making chapters of the book, just request them on [[WB:RFI]]... this imports all revisions of the wikipedia article, so (a) you don't have to start every chapter from scratch, and (b) it's all good with the copyrights.

We can import templates as well as articles, of course :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:59, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

:Hi Pete - told you they were nice folk (mostly &lt;g&gt;)! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:03, 12 November 2006 (UTC)
:BTW the &quot;undelete&quot; request could be addressed to Johnny too (or another admin or staff lounge) - not sure the page you put it on gets much attention! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:06, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks for the help guys. The undelete request went to the undelete request page. That's where the image cleanup said to put it. I can send it straigth to Johnny, though. I still have a lot of work to do on the organic chemistry book. There's a lot of cleanup, some reorganization to make things flow a little better, and so forth. Once that stuff is done, I'll probably want to import some templates from Wikipedia to add to the articles. In As an example, the reactions are all done as an appendix, which is really fine, but when talking about structure, generally, there are reactions that are specific to certain structures, so having links to those from the structure pages would be useful, and I think the template that I specified in the staff lounge is appropriate for that.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:Pdavis68|Pdavis68]] ([[User talk:Pdavis68|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pdavis68|contribs]]) 18:11, 12 Nov 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

:::The structure here is a bit &quot;loose&quot; - if in doubt - staff lounge/user talk page will probably get the quickest response.  In passing, a reminder to sign talk page stuff stuff tho I can't talk cos I just missed one on Johnny's!.  Also &quot;Recent Changes&quot; can help you see what is going on and where activity is. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:18, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

== Org chem ==

Hi Pete
I've merely removed the link. The page is still there but I've asked for it to be deleted.

I tinker with Org Chem from time to time but mostly I'm doing the A-level Applied Science book. The two overlap a bit, mind. Anything you think I could tackle in Org Chem? [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 16:34, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

:Honestly Ewen, the Org. Chem book needs so much work, you could pick almost any page and find a good bit of stuff that needs to be added, fixed, or whatever. I don't want to drag you away from the A-level Applied Science, unless you feel a strong motivation to get into the organic chem. For myself, I see it like this: I'm currently learning organic chem and working on this book is simply my way of studying. As a writer, I try to make sure what I write is correct, and that means I need to really understand it well. Since I have a long way to go, I'm just looking at the book as a long-term studying aid and will devote as much time as I can in an effort to better understand it all. So I'm in no particular rush to have anything done to it, but I'm certainly not opposed to help. I guess, more importantly, it would be nice to have someone I could bounce ideas off of and get recommendations. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 16:44, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== Navigation popups ==
Could check this out if you want - hover mouse over link and voila - preview!  Just don't tell eveyone &lt;G&gt; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation_popups].  There are other useful bits around too - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

:Herby, I'll check it out. Relly, what I'd find more useful (and I may try to code this myself), is to have the preview pop up in a separate browser window. I have two monitors and what I usually do, particularly when editing an existing document, is show the original in one browser on one screen, and edit it in another browser on the other screen. So being able to popup the preview in a separate window and place that in the other screen would be nice. I might be able to take that script and modify it to do that. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 18:47, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

:Herby, no bother at all. I chimed in on the topic. My issue, really, is simply time. I have a tendency to want to jump into things with grandiose plans and other priorities destroy my plans. So I'm taking my contributions here, one step at a time. I'm going to contribue to the book as it's convenient for me and as it serves my own selfish purposes. I'll help out in other areas when asked and if I have the time to spare, but work and school are absolute priorities to me right now. I'm considering very seriously going to med school and to keep that option open, because of grades when I was younger, I need to get pretty close to straight As, which means I devote extra time to school to make sure that happens. Anyway, just wanted to make my position clear. Happy to help where I can, but my time is limited.

::I guess I was looking to confirm a suspicion that you could be interested in the project as a whole rather than a particular area.  Time is always an issue - here is voluntary! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:33, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Herby, I am interested in the project as a whole, and to be honest, I think that time would best be spent trying to get the site better known. I've been using Wikipedia for a couple years now but I came across wikibooks by complete accident. I'm not completely out of touch with what's going on on the internet. I'm a regular Slashdot reader, and maybe it's been mentioned on Slashdot.
:::My honest opinion is that the site should make the books that are complete (or more so than say, organic chem) very visible and books that aren't so complete (like organic) less visible. I'm not really sure how you do that. But here's my thinking. When new people come to the site, you want them to see mostly finished products. You want them to look around and say, &quot;Wow, they're really producing something here.&quot; And if they want to get involved and dig a little deeper, they'll find there are other books that need lots of work. But, as they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression, and the first impression people get of the site shouldn't be, &quot;Wow, they have a long way to go...&quot;
:::I think this would drive more interest in the site as a whole and probably get a lot more people editing. For books that are complete, people ought to be getting out there on other web sites and recommending and linking to the books. There ought to be tons of incoming links to those books. I think it's going to be the only way to drive up the editorship significantly.
:::Anyway, just my opinion. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 13:55, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

== E-Z notation of Alkenes ==

Ewan, I noticed you've been doing some work in the Stereochemistry section. Something that seems really out of place to me is that the E-Z notation for Alkenes is discussed in both Chirality/R-S_notational_system and Chirality/Diastereomers. Where it isn't discussed is in the Alkenes/Naming_alkenes section. I think both of those sections ought to be collapsed into one section and moved to Alkenes/Naming_alkenes. I also think the cis-trans naming stuff should be moved Alkanes/Naming_alkanes. Do you agree? If so, I'll be happy to do it if you want, but I just didn't want to step on anything you're currently working on.

Pete,
I'd like to have a single section for stereochemistry with quick summaries where relevant on the alkanes, alkenes, etc pages. Cis/trans isomers are not limited to alkenes (1,2-dichlorocyclohexane, for example) so although the alkene section should have a brief account of cis/trans isomerism I think it would be best to have the main discussion of these isomers in a stand-alone section.
[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 14:53, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
:I've centralised the stereoisomerism section by cutting and pasting material from the large sections under 'Enantiomers' and 'Naming alkanes'. I'm not sure 'Enantiomers' should be retained - enantiomers are simply chiral molecules so the 'Chirality' section is the one I've used to stash all the relevant material with 'Enantiomers' reduced to a stub.

:Under ''naming alkanes'', ''naming alkenes'' and ''cycloalkanes'' I've referenced the stereochemistry area and edited the discussion to a few lines pertinent to alkanes, alkenes or cycloalkanes respectively.

:[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 15:39, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

::I think you misunderstood my original note. I suggested moving E-Z to alkenes (to which it's specific) and cis-trans to alk'''a'''nes since cis-trans applies to cycloalkanes and they're covered in the alkanes section. Alkanes always comes before alkenes in the learning, so there's no point in rehashing it there, but to me, these issues have more to do with naming and less to do with stereochemistry. They're simply naming conventions. Stereochemistry, on the other hand, is about structure and geometry. The only naming specific stuff that I think should really be there is the R/S, d/l, and (+)(-) stuff which is directly related to stereochemistry. Anyway, that's just my personal opinion, and I'm flexible, but that's the way all 4 of my organic chemistry books organize it and it simply makes sense to me. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 17:12, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

:::I'm not sure that's the way to do it, but who am I to judge? On the one hand, following the standard textbook organisation makes sense. On the other hand, this is an online book with hyperlinks - a traditional linear structure is not necessary.

:::E-Z is not specific to alkenes; cycloalkanes can/should be named using E-Z notation. Putting cycloalkanes before alkenes (if we follow a linear sequence) creates a problem: A reader might expect cis/trans E/Z to be under alkenes, but we're putting it under cycloalkanes because they come first. Hmm. I've been trying to make brief notes on these topics in the cycloalkane and alkene sections with a reference to the main chapter on stereochemistry with the technical discussion of how to use CIP priority rules, etc. I'm sure that merging the various pieces into a single main section and little referring sections has been beneficial; but where to put the main section?

:::BTW: Let's post everything here. I'll put your Talk page on my watchlist and then I won't miss your replies. I should have thought of that sooner. Duh! I'm not the most experienced here myself... Of course, if it's one particular page we're discussing, each page has its discussion page...

:::[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 20:12, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

::::&quot;''Of course, if it's one particular page we're discussing, each page has its discussion page...''&quot;

::::This is true, however the discussion is in regards to which page it all belongs. You're right, we might be better served discussing it somewhere in the book, though I don't think there are any other people working on the book right now.

::::Although the IUPAC specifications don't use the word &quot;alkene&quot;, they use the term double-bonded atoms. The E-Z is used because the cis-trans system is inadequate for tri- and tetra-substituted alkenes. I suppose you could end up with double-bonded sulphers or phosphates other atoms capable of 4+ bonding pairs that might appropriately use E-Z, though I cannot think of a single example where this isn't handled by functional group namings. Can you provide an example of a non-alkene using the E-Z system? I have no recollection of ever seeing it associated with a non-alkene and can't find anything in the IUPAC specs that lead me to believe that it can be. I could very well be wrong, though.

::::The truth is, as long as the stereochemistry stuff comes before the alkene section, I suppose it's fine. I'd be more concerned if it came after the alkene section. For now, I guess we can just leave it the way it is and worry about it if there's ever a major re-ordering of chapters. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 21:02, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

:::::I forgot to address your comment: &quot;Putting cycloalkanes before alkenes (if we follow a linear sequence) creates a problem&quot;. I completely agree and that's something that ought to be fixed. Currently Cycloalkanes and alkanes are handled together and that needs to be fixed.  -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 21:03, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

::::::The firstsite that I used for the IUPAC rules isn't an actual IUPACsite,butgenerally has  easier to follow interpretations of the rules.But I just checked the  [[http://goldbook.iupac.org/E01882.html|IUPAC Gold Book]] and it very specifically says alkenes and  &quot;related systems&quot; and lists a few examples, all double-bonded. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 21:24, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

:::::::Oh, you found that site too! It's worth listing as a link for the book. You're dead right: E/Z notation is not for cycloalkanes; R/S notation does the trick. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 21:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

==Image deletions==

Hi Pete... your best bet it to just mark them for speedy deletion... use {{tl|delete}} to do that. 

BTW: have you considered uploading to [[commons:Main Page|Commons]] rather than to here?

Pete

I found good referencing trick for citing the same reference serveral times. First time, use ref name=whatever (and /ref as usual). Subsequently, use ref name=whatever/. I edited the [[Organic Chemistry/Alkenes]] page to include this system. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 15:57, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
::Thanks Ewen. I was wondering about that. Seemed kind of redundant to have it twice down there, but didn't know how to fix it.
::On another topic, do you know where (if anywhere) organic chemistry students hang out on the internet? I mean, are there forums and stuff where chemists ask each other questions? Not just kids trying to blow stuff up, I mean... I saw a posting on Usenet where a guy wanted to synthesis 2R-2-hydroxypropionamidine. This is quite a ways out of my league, but I gave it my best shot (13-step synthesis). But I would have liked to have a place to ask questions of other chemists. I pepper my professors with so many, I'd like to take some of the weight of my many, many questions, off of them. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 00:48, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is intelligent life other than us humans in the universe: whales, dolphins, elephants, pigs, seals, great apes, and surprisingly octopuses. But none of these is ever likely to build spaceships or transmit signals into space, and we have difficulty understanding the other intelligent species on our planet. 

We have an intense curiosity: are we alone in the universe as a technological civilization? Some people would like to believe that other civilizations, perhaps with creatures even more different from us than elephants or even octopuses are far away in space, and that those creatures have something that we can learn. 

To find such intelligent civilizations deep in space we need first to find signals from deep in space. That won't be easy; even radio has been broadcast for a short time (about 85 years as of 2008), a short time compared to human existence. We might also look for planets that have conditions similar to those of Earth -- similar in size and temperature. Extraterrestrial civilizations are unlikely to be found on a gas giant planet or a planet of the Moon's size. We also have to be lucky enough to find a congenial planet with a civilization that has been sending signals of its own sophistication for a long enough time to reach us. If some sophisticated civilization has been sending signals to us for forty years but is fifty light-years away from us, then we on Earth will not get them for another ten years, and then only if we are tuned in. A civilization so sophisticated as ours was in 1875 would have given no evidence of its existence (such as electric lighting) visible even from the Moon -- even if we then had some fine art, literature, and music. 

What about alien visitors? Some people believe that some UFOs, or '''U'''nidentified '''F'''lying '''O'''bjects are visitors from space. Almost all prove to have simpler explanations such as mirages, optical illusions, aircraft, and weather balloons. Even the planet Venus, bright enough to be visible by day is often seen as a UFO. Most scientists discount stories of visitors from outer space even if they think visits from distant space possible. Not until we actually see a creature like &quot;ET&quot; or, worse, the alien visitors of the movie ''Independence Day'' can we claim to have met alien visitors. Space travel is difficult and time-consuming. Species with lifespans similar to ours are unlikely to travel to and from &quot;promising&quot; planets such as their and ours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Doppler effect''' or '''Doppler shift''' describes a phenomenon in which the wavelength of radiated energy from a body approaching the observer is shifted toward shorter wavelengths, whereas the wavelengths are shifted to longer values when the emitting object is receding from the observer. This happens with any form of any energy emitted in waves, including sound and light. Sound propagates in a different manner from electromagnetic energy, but the effect is analogous. 

With the sound of a moving object, like with a train, the wavelength of the approaching train horn will sound like a buzzing noise at first getting louder intill it passes you and then fades away at a lower tone. That is because the wavelengths that you are hearing is being squished in the front of the train and then stretched out as it passes by. When the wavelength is shorter (coming closer to you)  the frequency of the wavelength is going to be bigger, with a higher pitch. The opposite happens when the wavelength is longer; the frequency will be smaller, which is an effect that rapidly changes to a lower pitch as the train passes, going away from you. This works with light waves as well, in terms of visible light. Approaching objects shift toward shorter wavelengths are called blue shifted. Where as the light of receding objects have longer wavelengths, those wavelengths are known as red shifted.  As shown in the diagram below if you’re looking outward from the telescope, you can see the red shift going out toward an object, or in this case an unseen planet. Then there are the blue shifted wavelengths that are coming back towards the telescope from the unseen planet. 

The relative speed of stars moving toward or away from the Sun, as detected through the doppler effect, gives clues to the Sun's motion through the Milky Way Galaxy as well as other information about the motion of stars, star clusters and gas clouds in space. The relative motions of binary stars (two stars orbiting around a common center of gravity) can be detected in the variations of their light, and in fact even some binary stars have been detected that cannot be seen as separate stars, but whose binary nature is known from the variations in their combined spectra.

Since both sound and light waves have red and blue shifts, Edwin Hubble was able to use the doppler effect to discover that our neighboring galaxies are receding from the Milky Way. This lead to his conclusion that the universe was expanding. The red shift or more specifically known as the Cosmological Red Shift because of its implications for cosmology; the study of origin and evolution of the universe. Scientist could even go further into discovering more of the universe when they realized they could add velocity to Hubble's equation. Using the shift spectrum they now can find the distances based off of those observations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Asteroids are rocky or metallic solar system objects smaller than planets, whose orbits usually lie between Mars and Jupiter, although some venture close to the Sun and even pass dangerously close to Earth. They range in size from a maximum of several hundred kilometers, to an undetermined small size that merges into the category of meteoroids. Some meteoroids are unquestionably of the same composition, origin and structure as asteroids, just smaller. The age of asteroids is derived from that of meteorites, are thought to date from the very early periods of the Solar System, and to have been little changed since then.

There are tens of thousands of asteroids large enough to track, and perhaps hundreds of thousands of smaller size that range into the meteoroids. More than 1000 asteroids of 100 meters or larger (about the length of a city block) that pass close enough to the Earth to be of concern are being tracked.

In October, 2008, a small asteroid roughly the size of an SUV was discovered on a collision course with Earth, only about 20 hours before it impacted the upper atmosphere. The impact produced a fireball explosion approximately one kiloton of TNT in strength, or about one twentieth of the strength of the WWII atomic bombs dropped on Japan. However, this produced no dangerous radiation and occurred harmlessly far above the Earth's surface. Fragments survived and fell over Africa, about 5 kg of which were recovered in the Nubian Desert of Sudan, making this the first time an object had been tracked before impacting Earth, and fragments later recovered. Preliminary investigations are confirming the nature of the asteroidal/meteoroidal connection.

The first asteroid was discovered on the first day of 1800, by Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, who was part of a larger group of astronomers informally known as the &quot;Celestial Police.&quot; The group had been convinced of the existence of a previously unknown planet between Mars and Jupiter, as apparently predicted by a mathematical relationship called Bode's Law (or the Titus-Bode Law). Soon after Piazzi's discovery, which he named Ceres for the Roman Goddess of Grain, others were discovered and their relatively small size deduced. Too small for full planets, they became known as asteroids, or &quot;starlike bodies,&quot; or somewhat more appropriately, &quot;minor planets.&quot; Ceres, was not only the first but the largest, at 950 km in diameter. It is so large that recently it has been designated as &quot;dwarf planet&quot; rather than an asteroid.

The asteroids are thought to have been small bodies left over at the formation of the Solar System, which were prevented from forming into a larger planet by the overpowering gravitational influence of &quot;nearby&quot; Jupiter. It is likely that some of the original asteroidal bodies collided and broke apart, resulting in the many fragments found today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are different terms for the same object, depending on where it is observed. In space, it is a '''meteoroid'''. A '''meteor''' is a meteroid that has been captured by some object's gravitational field (e.g., the Earth), and is falling toward it. '''Meteorites''' are meteors that have landed.

There are three kinds of meteors: irons, stones, and stony-irons. They usually come from asteroids or the Oort Cloud.
*'''Irons''' are composed of mainly iron.
*'''Stones''' are rocky, and are composed of silicate minerals.
*'''Stony-irons''' are composed of silicate and nickel-iron minerals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Comets were previously thought of as a “dirty snowball” but due to the fact that a comet’s has more dust than ice, they are now referred to as an “icy dirtball”. The nucleus is mainly made up of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water), with some parts NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (ammonia), CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (methane), and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide). When the Big Bang happened over 4.6 billion years ago the hydrogen and helium accreted into the first generation of stars, which quickly became supernovae during which the heavier elements (collectively called metals) were produced and in turn condensed again with hydrogen and helium to form the second generation of stars. Much of the &quot;metals&quot; condensed at that time to form the terrestrial planets, but some of that material became small lumps of frozen gas and dust. These lumps are located in the outer region of the solar system, where temperatures are cold enough to produce ice thus keeping the lumps frozen. That region is called the  '''Oort Cloud''' or the '''Kuiper Belt.''' [http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/comets/Oort_cloud.html&amp;edu=high] The Oort Cloud is estimated to contain 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (one hundred billion) comets.

As the comets orbit our sun, they may be disturbed by close encounters with other objects and some of those move out of the Oort Cloud and toward the sun. As as they approach, their frozen gases become vaporized and dust is ejected and they form streamers called tails. The tails tend to flow behind the nucleus of the comet as the gases and dust are easily influenced by the forces applied to them by the sun's photons of light bouncing off them and by its electromagnetic field that acts on the charged particles. Comets have two '''tails''': the ion tail (blue, composed of gas), and the dust tail (yellow). Meteor showers, like the Perseid or Leonids, occur when the Earth travels through a comet's dust tail. 


One of the most famous comets is Halley's Comet, which was discovered by Edmond Halley in 1705. The comet had last been sighted in 1682; Halley predicted it would return in 1758. Unfortunately, he died in 1742, so he was unable to see his prediction come true. The comet was subsequently named after him.

Halley's Comet has a period of about 76 years. It came by the Earth last in 1986, and will return in 2061.

==Chemical Diversity in Comets==
[[Image:Comet-Hale-Bopp-29-03-1997.jpeg|right|620px|thumb|Wikimedia commons image Philipp Salzgeber|Hale-Bopp Comet.]] It has been postulated that the chemical diversity observed in the population of comets found in the Kuiper Belt (region extended after Neptune orbit) as well as Oort cloud (spherical cloud lie roughly 50,000 AU from the Sun) is  primordial.  

The chemical abundances were observed in both classes of comets: Oort cloud comets and the Jupiter-Family of comets whose population consisting of short-period comets formed in the Kuiper belt Differences were noted between the two groups. This can be attributed to several factors including differences in the chemical and physical environments in comet-forming regions, chemical evolution during their long storage in the Oort cloud and Kuiper belt, and thermal processing by the Sun when entering the inner Solar System. The chemical composition of comets is investigated by remote sensing using spectroscopy. This investigation is indirect, since only the gas and dust of the coma can be observed after the nucleus ices have sublimated from the nucleus.

Observations were made at millimeter/sub-millimeter wavelengths with the IRAM 30-m, JCMT, CSO and SEST radio telescopes. Six Jupiter-family, three Halley-family, and fifteen long-period comets were observed from 1986 to 2001. The eight molecular species were HCN, HNC, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO, CO, CS, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. HCN were detected in all comets, while at least two types of molecules were detected in nineteen comets. It was inferred that the HCN abundance relative to water varies from 0.08% to 0.25% from the sub-sample of comets for which contemporary H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O production rates are available. HCN is the molecule which exhibits the lowest abundance variation from comet to comet with respect to other species and was found in all the 24 Comets. HCN was found only in the four Comets and low CO abundances was measured in Jupiter-family comets, while several Oort cloud comets exhibit high CO abundances &lt;ref name=&quot;Biver, Bockelee,Crovisier&quot;&gt;Biver, N., Bockelee,D., Crovisier,J., 2007 “The chemical diversity of comets dates back   
to their origin”, Observatoire de Paris, LESIA, and CNRS&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the observation 23% of CO molecule with respect to water was observed in 5 comets. While 0.035% of HNC relative to water was observed  in 5 comets. Fifteen comets exhibited CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN up to maximum 6.2%. And H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CS was found in 13,11,9 comets respectively. They were found at a concentration maximum up to 1.3%, 1.5% and 0.17% respectively relative to water&lt;ref name=&quot;Biver&quot;&gt;Biver, N.,March 2002 “Chemical Composition Diversity among 24 Comets Observed at Radio wavelengths”, Earth, Moon and Planets, Volume 90, Pages 323-333&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Comet C/2001 Q4 (NEAT)==
[[Image:Comet-Neat-C2001-Q4.jpeg|right|404px|thumb|Wikimedia commons image Rochus Hess|Neat-C2001-Q4 Comet]]

Comet C/2001 Q4 NEAT was discovered in August of 2001 in the course of the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program. The comet was found on Charged Coupled Device (CCD) images and the astronomers were able to confirm the discovery on August 24. The comet was described as a round nebulosity measuring about 8 arc seconds across at the distance of 10.1 AU from the Sun. The total visual magnitude was 20.0. Its perihelion date was 2004 May 26 and perihelion distance was 1.00 AU. It has an unusual, almost perpendicular retrograde orbit which brings it into the inner solar system by a deeply southward path. It initially emerged from its remote home where it spent most of its time near the south celestial pole&lt;ref name=&quot;Russo&quot;&gt;Russo, et. al. 2007, “Nature”, Volume 448, page. 172-175&lt;/ref&gt;.
The comet brightened slowly during the remainder of 2001 and throughout 2002. It appeared fainter than magnitude 15 at the beginning of the 2003, but it steadily brightened as the year progressed, to magnitude 12 around mid-September. In September amateur astronomers could easily mark the time of comet in the Southern Hemisphere began supplying regular visual observations of this comet, at which time the diameter of the coma was typically measured as 0.6 to 1.2 arc minutes. In CCD images amateurs began observing a short fan-shaped tail pointing northward in July as on its approached to the Sun. In late September, the tail extended about 0.8 arc minutes toward the northwest. As 2003 came to an end, the comet became slightly brighter than magnitude 10, with a coma diameter of about 2 arc minutes. A faint, fan-shaped tail extended about 4 arc minutes toward the east. Finally, Comet C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) entered the inner solar system in 2004, reaching perihelion of 1 AU. It's peak magnitude of 3.3 rendered it clearly visible to the naked eye.  C/2001 Q4 is referred to as an Oort cloud comet as it originated from Oort cloud. It is composed of HCN, CO, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and other species&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray&quot;&gt;Gray,C.L., Cohran,A.L.,2008, “A Chemical Survey of 73 Comets Conducted at McDonald Observatory”,B.A.A.S.,40,16.02&lt;/ref&gt;.

We know how a comet is formed because of the recent discoveries made in 2009 by NASA’s Deep Impact which impacted Comet Tempel 1 in 2005 that revealed what exactly a comet’s nucleus is made of and its structure.

I think this needs a bit of information on recovering if you've totally b0rked a system by mashing your xorg.conf file. Most of the time you can get to a terminal, which is fine (you can edit, restore a backup or dpkg-reconfigure. But once I completely mashed it - I couldn't Ctrl+Alt+F2 or Ctrl+Alt+Backspace. And of course, restarting automatically started X, so back to the Black Screen of Death I went.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Could the author of this book please indicate in the recipe whether they are referring to temperatue in celcius or fahrenheit?  240 and 180 doesn't really help but I'd assume that it's celcius. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 23:50, 11 November 2006 (UTC)


Sorry!  All temperatures are fahrenheit.  I added this to the directions section.  thank you.

== Request/Question ==

When I was younger, my grandma made Pecan Turtles using homemade caramel made from sweetened condensed milk. She would boil the unopened cans in a large pot of water until they were solid, but still soft and slightly runny. It was solid enough to spoon onto the turtles but not especially runny. Unfortunately I don't have her recipe, so I don't know how long to boil the cans. Has anyone ever heard of making caramel this way and know how long to boil the cans? I think it'd make an interesting addition to the article as a simpler way to make caramel. [[User:75.206.209.156|75.206.209.156]] 07:01, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

Boiling (in water) restricts the heat to 212°F/100°C, which is way too low to cause changes in the sugar required for true caramel.  OTOH, heating ''unopened'' cans past the canning temperature (near boiling) is dangerous!  It's likely that some other (non-candy) process was thickening the 'milk'.  Why not try it (boiling them) and see?  A little experimentation at that point might get you close enough. &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=What is an identity?=

An identity is an equation that holds true for all values of the variables appearing in it, because it either is a definition or is the logical consequence of a definition.  An example of a definitional identity is  &lt;math&gt;\tan(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;  An example of an identity that can logically be proven to hold for all values of its variable is the Pythagorean identity expressed in trigonometric form:  &lt;math&gt;sin^2(x)+cos^2(x)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Try to transfer the idenities in right angle trig over to here.

==Misleading page name==

I agree with the implication of the above comment.  The page title implies that if you click on the page you will find a list of trig identities.  Instead there is just a definition of identity along with two examples to illustrate the definition.  At least some basic identities should be put into this page.  But then we need to decide what to do with the pages that the identities are transferred from.  [[User:Douglas W. Mitchell|Douglas W. Mitchell]] ([[User talk:Douglas W.

==1. Define the characteristics of an orchid. ==
[[Image:VanillaFlowerLongitudinalSection-en.png|thumb|right|500px|Longitudinal secion of a flower of Vanilla planifolia]]
Orchids are monocot plants characterised by the presence of three sepals , two petals and the third petal modified as a lip.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==2. What are the two main groupings of orchids? Name and show examples of each from a live plant or picture. ==
There are five identified groupings of orchids. (Also see [[W:Taxonomy_of_the_Orchid_family|Taxonomy of the Orchid family]])

* [[w:Apostasioideae|Apostasioideae]]: 2 group(s) in this sub-family and 16 species, south-western Asia
* [[w:Cypripedioideae|Cypripedioideae]]: 5 group(s) in this sub-family and 130 species, mostly from the temperate regions of the world, some in tropical America
* [[w:Vanilloideae|Vanilloideae]]: 15 group(s) in this sub-family and 180 species, humid tropical and subtropical regions, eastern North America
* [[w:Epidendroideae|Epidendroideae]]: more than 500 group(s) in this sub-family and more or less 20 000 species, cosmopolitan
* [[w:Orchidoideae|Orchidoideae]]: 208 group(s) in this sub-family and 3,630 species, cosmopolitan
The last two, [[w:Epidendroideae|Epidendroideae]] and [[w:Orchidoideae|Orchidoideae]] are the largest subfamilies (main groupings).

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Neuwiedia griffithii.jpg|Neuwiedia griffithii (in the subfamily Apostasioideae)
Image:Pinkslipper.jpg|Pink Lady's Slipper (in the subfamily Cypripedioidea)

Image:VandaMissJoaquim.jpg|Vanda Miss Joaquim (in the subfamily Epidendroideae)
Image:Orchis conica Mallorca 02.jpg|Neotinea tridentata (in the subfamily Orchidoideae)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==3. What are the differences between epiphytic, parasitic, and saprophytic orchids? ==
===Epiphytic===
An [[w:epiphytic|epiphytic]] is an organism that grows upon or attached to a living plant.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:DirkvdM red flat epiphyte.jpg
Image:DirkvdM epiphytes.jpg|Epiphytes on a tree
Image:Epiphytes.jpg|Epiphyte assemblage of orchids and bromeliads
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Parasitic===
[[W:Parasitic|Parasitic]] is symbiosis or &quot;living together&quot;, a phenomenon in which two organisms which are unrelated co-exist over a long period of time, usually the lifetime of one of the individuals.  A parasitic relationship does not benefit the host and can, in fact, be detrimental to it.

===Saprophytic===
A [[w:Saprophytic|saprotroph]] (or saprobe) is an organism that obtains its nutrients from non-living organic matter, usually dead and decaying plant or animal matter, by absorbing soluble organic compounds. They cannot make food for themselves.

==4. Discuss the distribution of orchids, making particular reference to the occurrence of these in your area. ==
===Distribution===
Orchids are [[W:cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]], occurring in almost every habitat. The great majority are to be found in the tropics, mostly Asia, South America and Central America. They are found above the Arctic Circle, in southern Patagonia and even on [[W:Macquarie Island|Macquarie Island]], close to Antarctica.

The following list gives a rough overview of their distribution:
* tropical America: 300 to 350 genera
* tropical Asia: 250 to 300 genera
* tropical Africa: 125 to 150 genera
* Oceania: 50 to 70 genera
* Europe and temperate Asia: 40 to 60 genera
* North America: 20 to 30 genera

==5. Name the main cultivated genera of orchids. Identify three from plants or picture. What is cultivar? ==
Most cultivated orchids are tropical or subtropical, but quite a few which grow in colder climates can be found on the market. 

Temperate species available at nurseries include:
* [[W:Ophrys apifera|Ophrys apifera]] (bee orchid), 
* [[w:Gymnadenia conopsea|Gymnadenia conopsea]] (fragrant orchid), 
* [[w:Anacamptis pyramidalis|Anacamptis pyramidalis]] (pyramidal orchid) and 
* [[W:Dactylorhiza fuchsii|Dactylorhiza fuchsii]] (common spotted orchid).

The main cultivated genera of orchids is [[W:Epidendroideae|Epidendroideae]].

Image:Phaius rosellus (1847).jpg|Phaius rosellus
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==6. Discuss the main essentials to observe in the cultivation of orchids. Grow at least one orchid for at least six months. ==
* Light - is important in all living things.
* Temperature - mature plants need a 15-20 degree F temperature difference between day and night.
* Water - seedlings need more moisture, mature plants must dry out between watering.
* Humidity -
* Fertilizer - remember that these are usually parasitic plants.
* Potting - plant in material that allows good aeration and drainage.

The Wikipedia article [[w:Hippeastrum|Hippeastrum]] has detailed instructions for growing this orchid throughout the year.  Another common houseplant orchid is the [[w:Cymbidium|Cymbidium]].

Another option is to grow your orchids using hydroponics, which satisfies a requirement of the Voyager curriculum.  Again Wikipedia has an article called &quot;[[w:Hydroponics for orchid cultivation|Hydroponics for orchid cultivation]]&quot; which is filled with important details.

Have a fun time growing your orchid(s).

==7. What are the main uses of orchids? What orchid is used commercially? ==

=== Main Uses of Orchids ===
* The underground tubers of terrestrial orchids (mainly Orchis mascula) are ground to a powder and used for cooking, such as in the hot beverage salep or the so-called &quot;fox-testicle ice cream&quot; salepi dondurma.
* The scent of orchids is frequently analysed by perfumists (using Gas-liquid chromatography) to identify potential fragrance chemicals.
* The other important use of orchids is their cultivation for the enjoyment of the flowers.

=== What orchid is used commercially? ===
* [[w:vanilla|Vanilla]] is a flavoring derived from orchids in the genus Vanilla native to Mexico. The name came from the Spanish word ''vainilla'', meaning ''little pod''.

==8. Know the laws in your area (if any) that protect wild orchids. ==
===Navasota Ladies'-Tresses===
The '''Navasota Ladies'-Tresses ([[w:Spiranthes parksii|Spiranthes parksii]])''' is on the Federal endangered species list
* http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/endang/plants/navasolt.phtml
'''Reason for Concern:''' Navasota ladies-tresses is endemic to the Oak Woodlands and Prairies region of east-central Texas. Once thought to be extremely rare, it is now known to be locally common in parts of its range. However, many of the sites are near an active coal stripmining operation. Other sites are within the area of Bryan-College Station and are threatened by the rapid development of this metroplex.

* [http://www.nativeorchid.org/howYouCanHelp.htm How YOU Can Help to Protect Wild Orchids]

===Pink Lady's Slipper===
''Cypripedium acaule'', or Pink Lady's Slipper, is endangered in Nova Scotia, Canada, and in the U.S. States of Georgia, Tennessee, Illinois, and New York.  Because of a fungus association needed for growth, and the high acid this plant needs, C. acaule is very difficult to grow in the average garden and is unlikely to survive any attempts at transplantation. It should not be removed or disturbed if found in nature.


===Showy Lady's Slipper===
''Cypripedium reginae'', or Showy Lady's Slipper is endangered (or extirpated) in the U.S. States of Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A Bit About Me==

My name is Pete Davis. I'vebeen a software engineer, professionally, for roughly 20 years. I currently live in Fayetteville, Arkansas, USA and work from home as an independent contractor. I have moved around quite a bit in the past 10 years or so. I spent the first 10 years of my life growing up in arkansas, followed by about 20 years in the Washington D.C. area and since then have lived in Playa del Carmen, (Southern) Mexico twice for a total of about 3 years, and lived in the Washington D.C. area and Arkansas in between those two times in Mexico. I am now back in Arkansas, I suspect, for quite a while.

Idropped out of school at The George Washington University in WashingtonD.C. about 15 credits shy of a B.S. in Computer Science. I am nowpursuing dual B.S. degrees in Biology and Biochemistry at theUniversity of Arkansas and trying to decide if I want to follow it bypursuing a higher degree in one of those two areas and doing researchor if I want to go the medical school. Being a doctor has been a drema for quite some time, but I'm also very interested in medical research and I suspect that's where my true talents may lie.

As for previous writing experience, I've written a number of articles for computer magazines and have had a book published in the field, though it has been some time since I've written professionally. Back in the days before the internet (think [[w:Bulletin_Board_System|BBS]], [[w:CompuServe|Compuserve]] and [[w:GEnie|GEnie]]), I also published two online programming magazines: While in college, The Pascal Newsletter (A.K.A. PNL) and later, The Windows Programmer's Journal (A.K.A. WPJ).

==My Contributions==

I am currently working on the [[Organic_Chemistry|Organic Chemistry]] textbook.

I also plan on getting involved in the [[Chemical_synthesis|Chemical Synthesis]] textbook at some point. That book, BTW, is not meant to be an anarchist's cookbook kind of book. Currently it has synthesis of explosives and the people involved in it and I want to make it a more general synthesis book.


To date, my primary contributions to the Organic Chemistry text have been in:

* [[Organic_Chemistry/Alkenes|Alkenes]]
* [[Organic_Chemistry/Cycloalkanes|Cycloalkanes]]
* [[Organic_Chemistry/Foundational_concepts_of_organic_chemistry/Visualization|Visualization]]

I'm personally of the opinion that the Organic Chemistry text still needs a great of work to become a usable textbook. That's not to say that there aren't some good and complete sections, but it is far from complete enough to teach a class from. I hope to see it get to that point some day, however.</text>

==1. What are the 3 major classes of platyhelminthes and describe them.==
The Monogenea, Trematoda, and Cestoda are the three major classes of parasitic flatworms, though the Turbellaria used to be considered a part of this class*

Monogeneans are largely ectoparasites on vertebrates like fishes; trematodes are the flukes, most of which live inside the organs of a variety of vertebrates as adults; and cestodes are the tapeworms, living in the intestines of a variety of vertebrates as adults (this is why your pets get annual shots—so that they don’t experience cestodes or trematodes—otherwise, pets could die as a result of an infestation of these worms.)

All Platyhelminthes are hermaphroditic in nature, meaning they can fertilize themselves.

*Turbellarians are, for the most part, free-living and non-parasitic, and thus do not in reality conform consistently with the rest of this class which is parasitic in nature.

For sake of completeness, it should be noted that the Monogenea are listed only on the most recent, scientific websites as part of the platyhelminthes classification.  Most websites still refer to the pre-1999 classification of the platyhelminthes, making Turbellaria a class within that classification.

==2. Name an example of a nematoda and describe its lifecycle.==

Nematodes are also known as roundworms or eel worms.  Examples include Lungworms, Hairworms, the Potato cyst, and stomach worms.

There are hundreds of types of nematodes.  

There are three types of lifecycles present simply in the portion of this classification that infect plants:

Nematodes that are migratory ectoparasites are those that find plants as hosts (plant-parasitic).  Migratory ectoparasites only feed on the surface cells of the plant (they don’t burrow into the plant).  Pin, ring, and mint nematodes are examples of this type of nematode.  

Their lifecycle:  Eggs are laid only in the soil and develop until a first stage juvenile nematode is present. This nematode molts for the first time while still within the egg and it is the second stage juvenile which emerges from the egg into the soil. Moving through the soil, this nematode finds a root and inserts its stylet into one of the surface (epidermal) cells on the root surface. After feeding for some period of time, the nematode withdraws its stylet and moves on to feed in a new location. When the nematode has grown to a certain size, it molts a second time to become a third stage juvenile and later a third time to become a fourth stage juvenile. After a fourth and final molt, the nematode becomes an adult.

Migratory endoparasites are similar to the Migratory ectoparasites, except for the fact that they burrow into the plant to feed.  Migratory endoparasites lay the eggs inside the host plants.  The first stage juvenile molts inside the egg.  The egg hatches once the juvenile has entered its second stage.  Once released into the cortex (inside) of a plant, the juvenile will molt three more times, becoming either male or female.  The eggs of the female will be laid in the cortex of the plant host.  At any stage, juveniles may move to (hence the term migratory) and infect new plants.  

 
Sedentary endoparasites enter their host species setting up a permanent feeding station.  Eventually a mature female will lay her eggs inside the host plants.   The first stage juvenile molts inside the egg.  The egg hatches once the juvenile has entered its second stage.  This second stage is the ONLY stage that is infectious.  It will leave the host plant and burrow into a plant, and release enzymes that change the chemical composition of the plant cells surrounding it.  These adapted cells become the embedded nematodes food source as it grows into a sausage shape, entering stages 3 and four and eventually laying its eggs before dying.

Hairworm life cycle:  The hairworm eggs hatch in water releasing stage to juvenile stage hairworms.  Grasshoppers are their eventual host, though scientists are sure how the hairworm larvae get inside the grasshoppers.  Eventually, through several moltings, the larvae that have gotten inside the grasshopper fill the grasshoppers whole body cavity releasing a toxic mixture of chemicals that causes the grasshopper to commit suicide by jumping into water.  Once the grasshopper parasite host is dead, the adult hairworm emerges from the grasshopper, and repeats the lifecycle by laying a batch of eggs.

==3. What are the three major classes of annelida and how do they move?==

The three classes of annelids are Polychaeta (marine annelids); Oligochaeta (marine, freshwater and trrestiral annelids such as earthworms); Hirudinea (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial leeches). 

The Polychaeta move with bristles (Setae) that extend out from parapods, side flaps that extend from their bodies.  The bristles look and act similar to legs, and help the polycaet swim or burrow.

The Oligocaeta and Hirudinea move by contracting muscles in their body in a sequential fashion, forcing their coelomic fluid to change the shape of each segment, thus moving their body forward.  The setae bristles assist in anchoring them as they move forward.

==4. Answer the following:==
===a. Distinguish between the following body structures: coelomates, pseudocoelomates, and acoelomates.===

All of the following body structures contain bilateral symmetry.  That is, they are symmetrical alone a defined plane.  One example of bilateral symmetry is that if a person looked in a mirror and imagined a line extending from the middle of his/her head down to the floor, the body on the left side of the line would be a “mirror image” of the part of the body on the right side of the line.

Coelomates have a complex body cavity.  Organs are suspended from the body wall.  Mollusks and humans are just a few of the animals that share this body structure.
Pseudocoelomates have a simple fluid filled body.  The organs of these simple animals often float within the body cavity.  Nematodes are the most numerous members of animals that have this body structure.
Acoelomates lack internal body cavities.  Acoelomates include flatworms and ribbon worms.  For example, flatworms have organs, but do not have a fully formed digestive tract or a way to transport oxygen through the body.  Therefore, each cell is required to handle respiration individually.
http://www.bookrags.com/Animal 

===b. Which body structures are common in the three phyla of worms?===

1. Coelomates (segmented/annelida)

2. Pseudocoelomates (roundworm/nematoda)

3. Acoelomates (flat worm/platyhelminthes)

==5. Be able to demonstrate three ways to purify water.==

The following advise on how to purify water for drinking. Please note that this is general advice; before drinking any water, you should check with local authorities as to its suitability. Be cautious of water containing particulate or solids, or polluted with unknown chemicals.

According to the Red Cross, to purify drinking water use any of the following methods:

1) Boil for five to ten minutes

2) Add ten (10) drops of household bleach solution per gallon of water, mix well and let stand for thirty (30) minutes. A slight smell or taste of chlorine indicates water is good to drink.

3) Add household tincture of iodine in the same manner as bleach above.

4) Use commercial purification tablets, following package directions. Two commercial brand names as Halazone and Globaline

==6. Complete the following:==
Note:  Such organizations as adra.org and worldwater.org provide information and resources for both parts of this question.

===a. From what you have learned about worms. Why is the availability of fresh water so important to human health, especially in third world countries?===

To get you started:  Fresh water that is free of organisms, including the parasitic worms we have studied, assists persons in living longer, avoiding disease, and living higher quality lives.

===b. Organize a fund raiser to support organizations that strive to provide freshwater to third world counties.===
For fundraising ideas, visit the NAD Pathfinder Forum at http://www.pathfindersonline.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=9.

==7. Describe a spiritual lesson about living water from the Bible.==
John 4 contains the story of the woman at the well who received the instructions from Jesus about receiving living water.  Consult the SDA Bible Commentary and your choice of Bible version (www.biblegateway.com) for the complete story. Also, Psalms 1:3 and Jeremiah 17:8

[[This quantum world/Serious illnesses/de Broglie|'''&lt; PREVIOUS''']]
&lt;/div&gt;
==Schrödinger==
If the electron is a standing wave, why should it be confined to a circle? After de Broglie's crucial insight that particles are waves of some sort, it took less than three years for the mature quantum theory to be found, not once but twice, by [[wikipedia:Werner Heisenberg|Werner Heisenberg]] in 1925 and by [[wikipedia:Erwin Schrödinger|Erwin Schrödinger]] in 1926. If we let the electron be a standing wave in three dimensions, we have all it takes to arrive at the Schrödinger equation, which is at the heart of the mature theory.

Let's keep to one spatial dimension. The simplest mathematical description of a wave of [[wikipedia:wavenumber|angular wavenumber]] &lt;math&gt;k=2\pi/\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and [[wikipedia:Angular frequency|angular frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2\pi/T = 2\pi\nu&lt;/math&gt; (at any rate, if you are familiar with [[wikipedia:Complex number|complex numbers]]) is the function
:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t) = e^{i(kx-\omega t)}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Let's express the [[wikipedia:Phase (waves)|phase]] &lt;math&gt;\phi(x,t) = kx-\omega t&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the electron's energy &lt;math&gt;E=h\nu=\hbar\omega&lt;/math&gt; and momentum &lt;math&gt;p=h/\lambda=\hbar k:&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)=e^{i(px-Et)/\hbar}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The [[wikipedia:Partial derivative|partial derivatives]] with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; are
:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{\partial\psi\over\partial x}={i\over\hbar}p\psi\quad\hbox{and}\quad
{\partial\psi\over\partial t}=-{i\over\hbar}E\psi.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We also need the second partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2} = \left({ip\over\hbar}\right)^2\psi.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We thus have
:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
E\psi=i\hbar{\partial\psi\over\partial t},\quad
p\psi=-i\hbar{\partial\psi\over\partial x},\quad\hbox{and}\quad
p^2\psi=-\hbar^2{\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In non-relativistic [[wikipedia:Classical physics|classical physics]] the [[wikipedia:Kinetic energy|''kinetic'' energy]] and the ''kinetic'' momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of a [[wikipedia:Free particle|free particle]] are related via the [[wikipedia:Dispersion relation|dispersion relation]]
:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;E=p^2/2m.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;This relation also holds in non-relativistic quantum physics. Later you will learn why.

In three spatial dimensions, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of a vector &lt;math&gt;\textbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;. If the particle also has a potential energy &lt;math&gt;V (\textbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; and a potential momentum &lt;math&gt;\textbf{A}(\textbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; (in which case it is ''not'' free), and if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; stand for the particle's ''total'' energy and ''total'' momentum, respectively, then the dispersion relation is
:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
E-V = (\textbf{p}-\textbf{A})^2/2m.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;By the square of a vector &lt;math&gt;\textbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; we mean the [[wikipedia:Dot product|dot (or scalar) product]] &lt;math&gt;\textbf{v} \cdot \textbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. Later you will learn why we represent possible influences on the motion of a particle by such [[wikipedia:Field (physics)|fields]] as &lt;math&gt;V(\textbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textbf{A}(\textbf{r},t).&lt;/math&gt;

Returning to our fictitious world with only one spatial dimension, allowing for a potential energy &lt;math&gt;V(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;, substituting the  [[wikipedia:Differential operator|differential operators]] &lt;math&gt;i\hbar{\partial\over\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\hbar^2 {\partial^2\over\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; in the resulting dispersion relation, and applying both sides of the resulting operator equation to &lt;math&gt;\psi,&lt;/math&gt; we arrive at the one-dimensional (time-dependent) '''Schrödinger equation''':
{| style=&quot;border:5px solid lightsteelblue&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;
i\hbar{\partial\psi\over\partial t}=-{\hbar^2\over2m}{\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2}+V\psi
&lt;/math&gt;
|}
In three spatial dimensions and with both potential energy &lt;math&gt;V(\textbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; and potential momentum &lt;math&gt;\textbf{A}(\textbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; present, we proceed from the relation &lt;math&gt;E-V = (\textbf{p}-\textbf{A})^2/2m,&lt;/math&gt; substituting &lt;math&gt;i\hbar{\partial\over\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-i\hbar{\partial\over\partial\textbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\textbf{p}.&lt;/math&gt; The differential operator &lt;math&gt;{\partial\over\partial\textbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector whose components are the differential operators &lt;math&gt;\left({\partial\psi\over\partial x},{\partial\psi\over\partial y},{\partial\psi\over\partial z}\right).&lt;/math&gt; The result:
:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
i\hbar{\partial\psi\over\partial t} = \frac{1}{2m} \left(-i\hbar{\partial\over\partial\textbf{r}} - \textbf{A}\right)^2\psi + V\psi,
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is now a function of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{r}=(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t.&lt;/math&gt; This is the three-dimensional '''Schrödinger equation'''. In non-relativistic investigations (to which the Schrödinger equation is confined) the potential momentum can generally be ignored, which is why the [[wikipedia:Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger equation]] is often given this form:
{| style=&quot;border:5px solid lightsteelblue&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;
i\hbar{\partial\psi\over\partial t}=-{\hbar^2\over2m} \left({\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2} + {\partial^2\psi\over\partial y^2} + {\partial^2\psi\over\partial z^2}\right)+V\psi
&lt;/math&gt;
|}
The ''free'' Schrödinger equation (without even the potential energy term) is satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t) = e^{i(kx-\omega t)}&lt;/math&gt; (in one dimension) or &lt;math&gt;\psi(\textbf{r},t) = e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)}&lt;/math&gt; (in three dimensions) ''provided that'' &lt;math&gt;E=\hbar{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;p^2/2m=(\hbar k)^2/ 2m,&lt;/math&gt; which is to say: &lt;math&gt;\omega(k)=\hbar k^2/2m.&lt;/math&gt; However, since we are dealing with a [[wikipedia:Differential equation|homogeneous linear differential equation]] — which tells us that solutions may be added and/or multiplied by an arbitrary constant to yield additional solutions — any function of the form
:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\psi(x,t) = {1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\int \overline{\psi}(k)\,e^{i[kx-\omega(k)t]}dk=
{1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\int \overline{\psi}(k,t)\,e^{ikx}dk
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;with &lt;math&gt;\overline{\psi}(k,t) = \overline{\psi}(k) e^{-i\omega(k)t}&lt;/math&gt; solves the (one-dimensional) Schrödinger equation. If no integration boundaries are specified, then we integrate over the [[wikipedia:Real line|real line]], i.e., the integral is defined as the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{L\rightarrow\infty}\int_{-L}^{+L}.&lt;/math&gt; The converse also holds: every solution is of this form. The factor in front of the integral is present for purely cosmetic reasons, as you will realize presently. &lt;math&gt;\overline{\psi} (k,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wikipedia:Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t),&lt;/math&gt; which means that
:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\overline{\psi}(k,t)={1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\int \psi(x,t)\,e^{-ikx}dx.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; exists because the integral &lt;math&gt;\int|\psi(x,t)|dx&lt;/math&gt; is finite. In the [[This quantum world/Serious illnesses/Born|next section]] we will come to know the physical reason why this integral is finite.

So now we have a condition that every electron &quot;wave function&quot; must satisfy in order to satisfy the appropriate dispersion relation. If this (and hence the Schrödinger equation) contains either or both of the [[wikipedia:Potential|potentials]] &lt;math&gt;\textbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, then finding solutions can be tough. As a budding quantum mechanician, you will spend a considerable amount of time learning to solve the Schrödinger equation with various potentials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A few notes:

* This wikibook is starting in userspace because I want to get a good chunk of it done before I put it into the main space. I don't like the large number of wikibooks that have been started and left to languish because nobody ever actually put a lot of time into them. When it's to that point I'll put it into the main namespace.
* I'm aware that there's already a C++ Programming wikibook. It seems geared more toward those who are already programmers (token &quot;what is a foozle?&quot;) chapters to the contrary) and, in my own opinion, doesn't teach very well. I asked a friend of mine, a technical user but not a programmer, to read over it; got much of the &quot;eyes glazed over&quot; look. To those who would say &quot;edit it&quot;, I reply that it is more a question of style and approach than content, and something that is difficult to change in an already-written text.
*This is aimed more closely at the &quot;for dummies&quot; market than most. This isn't to say it won't be comprehensive, but it will spend more time on the whys, rather than the hows, than most other texts do.

Leave feedback if you'd like, I always enjoy reading it.

== [[User:Blacken/C++ Concepts and Programming]] ==

I guess I'm going to have to be one of those &quot;just edit it&quot; people. While the existing wikibook does seem to assume a lot that a reader knows how to program already, I'm hoping to make it easier for readers not familar with programming and am always on the look out for inaccaracies with the C++ Standard. I'm not sure when you've last taken a look at the wikibook, so I invite you to take another look.

:I've seen what you've done thats why I commented. Really I believe our aims are the same or can be the same. Wikibooks are always in progress and the C++ Programming has a bit of history, including previous mergers and renaming. It even says on the main page its aim is to teach from introductory to advance. I agree it has a medium to more advance feel to it right now, but that doesn't mean its not ment to have introductory contents for beginners as well. Personally I'd welcome any attempts to improve where it fails and make it less dry and more fun to read. I think our philosophies about teaching from what you've said are the same. I can understand though how that book can be hard to contribute to, thats part of what I've been trying to fix. Oh and I didn't start the book, I've just been trying to make it a better book. I'm also not trying to say your POV is wrong, I'm just trying to show that I believe our aims to be close enough that you may want to think about helping out an existing book. I'm curious to see/know what improvements you would make or failing that see what becomes of your book once you've put more work into it. So far it looks like it might overlap with ''C++ Programming''. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 20:26, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The dialog is confusing because of the switch between the $3000 example and a $2000 example. If intended, there is not enough explaination. If not intended, it leaves one confused. 

Also, a question comes to mind about what would happen if the price fell to $6, or $4 in an unsuccessful negotation. Would the value not also be zero? ... how is this actually handeled when it comes to simultaneous equations?
:thanks, this module needs alot of work. the 2000 3000 disparity has been corrected thanks for pointing it out. &quot;if the price fell to $6, or $4 in an unsuccessful negotation. Would the value not also be zero?&quot; The example states that the price will fall to $5 if the negotiation is unsuccessful. This is fixed. Say if you want to consider if the price shall fall to $6 if unsuccessful, then you will need to solve
::11y + z = 3000
::6y + z = 0
:instead, which yields y = 600 therefore z = -$3600, and so the option is 600*8-3600 = 1200 which is more expensive. As one would expect. Will improve with time. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 08:32, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

Logical fallacies are also known as &quot;verbal fallacies.&quot; In establishing a grounded argument one needs to have a claim supported by evidence. Reasoning is used to make the evidence as relevant in making the claim valid. But sometimes due to faulty reasoning that leads to failure to provide sufficient claim makes the argument weak. Here are some of the most common examples of fallacies:

'''Faulty Cause and Effect Relationship'''
Also known as &quot;''Post Hoc'' fallacy.&quot; It assumes sequence of events for a casual relationship, holding that the chain of events are closely linked to one another where the first event caused the second and so on.
  example: &quot;Construction workers are dumb.&quot;

'''False Analogies'''
Analogies always compare two or more situations that reflect some degree of resemblance. In this case two situations are wrongly made to resemble each other leading to false analogies.
  example: &quot;Japan quit fighting in 1945 when we dropped nuclear bombs on them. 
           We should use nuclear bombs against other countries.&quot;

'''Bandwagon Appeal'''
This stems from the wrong reasoning that everyone is doing it, so why shouldn't you? But in reality everyone is not actually involved in the act and it holds wrong reasons to do it.
  example: It doesn't matter if I do not cite the sources of my reference, no 
           one else cares to do it.

'''Either-or'''
It suggests that there are only two choices in binary opposition for a given complex situation. This is rarely the case in actual situation.
  example: &quot;Either we eliminate the regulation of business or else profits will 
           suffer.&quot; (It ignores hosts of other possibilities for incurring losses)

'''Ad Hominem'''
Literally means &quot;to the person.&quot; This form of faulty reasoning aims toward personal attacks against an individual as opposed to rational reasoning.
  example: My opponent is against the supporting the bill; I think he probably 
           has some vested interest for not supporting it.

'''Ad Populum'''
Literally means &quot;to the people.&quot; It is based on using readers' prejudices and biases instead of sound reasoning.
  example: We cannot allow to open Indian restaurants in this suburb which is 
           predominantly white based. Indian cuisine is very hot and spicy, 
           and therefore, unhealthy for our diet.

'''Begging the Question'''
It occurs when the claim is passed off as an evidence by assuming as stated in fact what is supposed to be proved.
  example: &quot;People should be able to say anything they want to because free 
           speech is an individual right.&quot;

'''Slippery Slope'''
It follows that certain chain of events will happen anyways and will lead to another.
  example: &quot;If we grant citizenship to illegal immigrants, no one will bother 
           to enter the country legally.&quot;

'''Strawman'''
Setting up the counterarguments as weak so that they can be easily rejected.
  example: &quot;Environmentalist won't be satisfied until not a single human being 
           is allowed to enter a national park.&quot;

'''Red Herring'''
It is a tactic that introduces a false or irrelevant claim to distract the readers from the main argument.
  example: Personal income taxes should be reduced because there are too many 
           essential bills that need to be paid.

'''Polarization'''
It resorts to exaggerations of positions or groups by situating their claims as extreme or irrational.
  example: &quot;Feminists are all man-haters.&quot;

'''''Allium vineale''''' ('''Crow Garlic''') is a perennial bulb in the genus ''[[../Allium/]]'', native to Europe, north Africa and western Asia, but present elsewhere as an invasive weed of gardens, woodlands, and lawns.

==Description==
All parts of the plant have a strong garlic odor. The underground bulb is 1-2 cm diameter, with a fibrous outer layer. The main stem grows to 30-120 cm tall, bearing 2-4 leaves and an apical inflorescence 2-5 cm diameter comprising a number of small bulbils and none to a few flowers, subtended by a basal bract. The leaves are slender, hollow. and tubular, 15-60 cm long and 2-4 mm thick, waxy textured, with a groove along the side of the leaf facing the stem. The flowers are 2-5 mm long, with six petals varying in colour from pink to red or greenish-white. It flowers in the summer, June to August in northern Europe. Plants with no flowers, only bulbils, are sometimes distinguished as the variety ''Allium vineale'' var. ''compactum'', but this character is probably not taxonomically significant.

==Ecology==
It is a weed in grain fields, as grain products may become tainted with a garlic odor or flavour in the presence of aerial bulblets at the time of harvest.  Wild garlics is resistant to herbicides due to the structure of its leaves, being vertical, smooth and waxy.  Herbicides do not cling well to it and are therefore not as effective.

The species is introduced in Australia and North America, where it has become an invasive species.

==Uses==
Crow Garlic can be used as a substitute for garlic. It imparts a garlic-like flavour and odor on dairy and beef products when grazed by livestock. 

==Control==

This book will cover the rigorous template of statistical mechanics, which has many uses in abstract physics that build up into many theories on many different materials, the most important of which being Thermal Physics.
=Prerequisites=
The following are some good things to have under your belt to understand this material:
*Multivariate Calculus
*Introductory Physics
*A very brisk notion of quantum numbers and the Schrodinger equation (in other words, just the main idea of what they are)
For Thermal Physics, the above is suggested (except for quantum numbers/Schrodinger ideas) and:
*Partial Differentials

      <text xml:space="preserve">== United States ==
The Stock Market building resembles the New York Public Library. On the entrance building the sign reads &quot;New York Stock Exchange&quot;. This is the heart and soul of all of the United States' major financial institutions. It is today what Fort Knox was almost two hundred years ago - the place where billions of dollars of wealth changes hands daily. A symbol of capitalism in action. 

The New York Stock Exchange has been the targeted by terrorism in the past. Terrorists believe that destroying the exchange would be a huge blow to the USA. However, physical destruction of the building would have little effect as the majority of the exchange trading is computerized with backup computers located in a different locations.

All US major companies, for example Microsoft, IBM, Ford, General Motors, General Electric, Citigroup and Lockheed Martin trade their stock in the NYSE. Anyone can own a piece of any corporation that is publicly traded by purchasing some shares and becoming a stock holder.

=== How the Stock Market was founded ===
Let’s see how the stock market founded. Two hundred years ago in front of Trinity Church in Manhattan a few business men got together to exchange merchandise with each other. At that time the monetary system we know today did not exist. Paper money did not exist - gold and silver coins were used. These unknown businessmen made an agreement amongst themselves that promised a share of the value in ships transporting goods from abroad. This was the beginning of a new trade that eventually lead to the NYSE being born.

Years later during the American Revolution the United States Government needed money. In their effort to raise capital for the  war, government bonds were invented. Our forefathers needed money to continue their cause so they asked people to lend money to the Government. The people were issued with a &quot;bond&quot; showing how much they had lent, which paid interest every year. After the term of the bond expired, usually thirty years, the Government repaid the money. These bonds are now known as Treasury Bonds and are sold throughout the world.

Then in 1792 twenty four businessmen gathered together and signed an agreement to do business among themselves. This included selling shares, or part of their companies, to each other. The modern New York Stock Exchange was born. 

The industrial revolution brought more prosperity for Wall Street. Everyone was interested in having &quot;a piece of the action&quot;. Not all the stocks being sold were of good and reliable companies, and the NYSE would not deal with them. So, these stocks were sold outside of the building -  by the curb. At that time these kinds of deals were referred to as “curb treading&quot; - eventually they would become the American Stock Exchange (AMEX).

Today NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX have been combined. They are located at 60 Wall Street, New York City which is part of lower Manhattan.

I hate to bring this up so soon, but one of your recent edits was brought up as a speedy delete. [[Stanford Shopping Center]]. Before I take any action, I'd like to know what you plan to make from this book, or whether or not you are just testing wikibook's capabilities. From the looks of it, you seem to want to write a wikipedia article. While I'm not a wikipedian myself, it would seem like that would be a better wiki for what you were trying to do.

So I wish you good luck with your projects here, and hope you have a good time. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 20:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Visualization ==

Visualization is absolutely crucial in organic chemistry. Being able to picture the 3-dimensional structure of a molecule in your head, rotating it around, seeing how it interacts with other molecules; these are really important skills that you need to develop if you want to understand what's really happening in organic chemistry.

Some people are born with this skill naturally, but even if you aren't, like anything else, with practice, you can become better at it. So if this is difficult for you, spend time working on it. Most people willing to put the effort in, before long, have that &quot;Aha!&quot; moment, where they suddenly just get it. Once you &quot;get it&quot;, you really don't have to work at it anymore. You'll be able to look at a molecule, regardless of how it's drawn, and you'll just know what it looks like in 3-dimensions.

Many people find models very useful. As mentioned in the foreward of this book, there are places where you can [[../../Places to buy organic chemistry models|buy molecular model kits]] and there are sites that offer free online software like [http://jmol.sourceforge.net/websites/ Jmol], for moving models around virtually, with your mouse. Take advantage of these kinds of tools, because if you don't understand the 3-dimensional aspects of organic chemistry, you're not going to really understand organic chemistry.

Organic chemists have developed a number of ways for describing molecules. Some of them explicitly show the 3-dimensional structure, some imply it, and some don't show it at all and simply assume that that the reader has enough background to be able to visualize it without aids.

[[Image:MethaneVariations.png|frame|center|Different ways of rendering the methane molecule]]

For example, in the figure above, the simplest organic molecule, Methane, is shown rendered in 5 different ways. At the far left, simply the text CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This indicates 4 hydrogen atoms attached to a carbon atom. But this doesn't tell you anything about how it looks. An organic chemist doesn't need more information than that. Any organic chemist knows what a methane molecule looks like. However, for more complex molecules, even for the best organic chemists, knowing the components often isn't enough to visualize the structure.

The second drawing provides a little more information. You have the carbon in the center and 4 hydrogens attached to it. This provides a little more information, but it provides no insight into the 3-dimensional structure. This kind of drawing is called a '''Kekulé structure''', after Friedrich August Kekulé, or a '''line-bond structure'''.

The third drawing is a very common rendering in organic chemistry, often called '''dash-wedge notation'''. The 3-dimensional structure of a methane molecule is that of a tetrahedron. Think of it as a pyramid with a triangle as the base (as opposed to a square base, like the pyramids in Giza). Then picture the hydrogen atoms at the 4 corners of that pyramid, one at each corner of the bottom and one at the point at the top, and finally, the carbon in the very center. The angle between each hydrogen bond in a methane is at what's called a '''tetrahedral angle''', which is 109.5°. 

That's what the dash-wedge model is a little better at showing. To picture a molecule in dash-wedge notation, think of the carbon and two hydrogens connected by solid lines (the one on the right and the one below the carbon) as being all in the same plane as the screen (or paper). The solid wedge represents a bond coming out of the screen (or paper) towards us, and the dashed-wedge is that of a bond going away from us.

This common form of rendering will frequently give the reader a good idea of the 3-dimensional structure of a molecules of moderate complexity.

For more complex structures, sometimes 3-dimensional renderings are needed like the 4th and 5th images. For methane, this is a bit overboard, but as the structures start to get more complex, a more complex method of rendering is needed to accurately describe the shape. The 4th image is called a '''ball and stick model''', with the hydrogens represented by white balls and the carbon in the center is represented by a grey ball.

Finally, in the 5th image, called a '''stick model''', forgoes the actual atoms and simply shows the bonds. Color changes represent different atoms. In this case, the grey near the center, represents the carbon and the white on the ends represents hydrogen.

[[Image:Cyclohexanevariations.png|frame|center|Different ways of rendering the cyclohexane molecule]]

The figure above shows 5 different renderings of the cyclohexane molecule. Cyclohexane consists of a ring of 6 carbon atoms, each with 2 hydrogen atoms attached to them. The hexagon on the left shows the carbons with their 2 hydrogens. Often, however, a cyclohexane is drawn as simply a hexagon, with the carbons and hydrogens simply implied.

The second image shows the ring at an angle, but like the first, gives little insight into the structure beyond the fact that it's cyclic.

The third is a ball and stick figure, much like we saw for methane. As you can see, the carbons are not all flat. This particular [[Organic Chemistry/Alkanes/Cycloalkanes|conformation]] of cyclohexane is called the chair configuration. Conformations of cyclohexane will be discussed more later on.

The fourth is a stick figure of cyclohexane, also in the chair conformation.

Finally, we have the filled version of the cyclohexane molecule. The surfaces represent a sort of field around the molecules that represent the boundaries of how close atoms can approach, also called Van der Waals surfaces. This representation isn't used as often as others in organic chemistry.

== Summary ==

As we've seen, there are a variety of ways to represent molecules in organic chemistry. If any one method is most important to learn, it's the dash-wedge notation, as this will be used throughout this and other books when describing the 3-dimenional nature of organic molecules. You should be able to look at it and immediately know which bonds lie in the same plane, which ones are coming towards us and which are going away. Once you're comfortable with that, you'll find that further visualization of more complex molecules becomes much easier.

'''''Tegastes acroporanus''''', also known as the '''Red Acro Bug''' for the red coloration on its body and its prey, ''Acropora'', are copepods in the family Tegastidae. They are parasitic on the hard coral reef building corals in the genus ''Acropora'', and feed on these corals exclusively. Though it has been found on all types of ''Acropora'', it seems to be less predominant on species with large, “hairy” polyps such as the species ''A. millepora''. Being a copepod, they are very small, and many times can be hard to see with the naked eye. However, their existence on a suspected affected ''Acropora'' can be determined either by looking for the typical symptoms of ''T. acroporanus'' or by shining a flashlight on the suspected ''Acropora'' and looking for tiny fluorescent specks, caused by the light bouncing off the red pigment in their bodies.  

When on an ''Acropora'' they remain, for the most part, stationary and will spend most of their time consuming the tissue of the acropora. They are very difficult to dislodge once stationary, using their appendages to latch onto the ''Acropora'' and are not removable even by suction or strong water movement, which may in turn, damage the ''Acropora''. A small number will leave a coral if the coral is disturbed and will swim in the water column, looking for another host.  

First reports of this aquatic pest came in the early 2000s and the infestation sped quickly throughout the marine keeping hobby around the world with the popularity of coral fragment trading.  Due to the potential threat of this parasitic copepod to the hobby, many different treatments have been tried and testing through the years and it is now possible to stop or at least slow the infestation of ''T. acroporanus''.

== Symptoms ==

While ''Tegastes acroporanus'' or the red acro bug is a parasite on ''Acropora'' corals, it does not always kill them.  The overall health of the host prior to infestation, the overall health of the aquarium system, and the degree of colonization will contribute to whether or not an affected ''Acropora'' can withstand the infestation

There are several possible signs of an infestation of red acro bugs:
* reduced extension of polyps and/or the coral tissue
* change in coloration, typically involving a loss of colored pigments from tips and branches, and a change to a more uniform brown color
* reduced or stalled growth rates
* loss of tissue pigmentation including the loss of zooxanthellae pigmentation resulting in a bleached appearance
* local or colony-wide tissue loss, possibly as a result of colonization stress rather than from direct consumption of tissue by predation
* death of the colony

== Treatments ==

=== The Dorton Treatment (dosing Interceptor) ===
{{howto}}
{{inappropriate person}}
Warning: Use this medication at your own risk.  While most recorded usages of this treatment have yielded a positive effect, there is always a risk with usage.  The medication Interceptor was not designed for usage in marine aquariums.  

In 2004, a &quot;cure&quot; to red acro bugs was posted on the forum Reefs.org by the user DustinDorton. It involves the usage of a dog heartworm medication called Interceptor, made by Novartis. Interceptor is the industry name for milbemycin oxime, which is an active chemical against nematodes (or heartworms in dogs) and some arthropods, such as the red acro bug.  

The dosage used in an aquarium to kill red bugs is 25&amp;nbsp;mg per 10&amp;nbsp;gallons of actual tank water. That is 25&amp;nbsp;mg of the entire tablet. Each tablet in the pack of 6 will treat about 380&amp;nbsp;gallons. The tablets are ground with a mortar and pestle into a fine powder.

The entire volume of water in the system must be considered as the pill will dissolve into the whole system, not just main aquarium. Thus, it is necessary to take into account things like the sump, a refugium, the water in a skimmer, calcium reactor, canister filter, or any large pieces of plumbing.  Also, before adding the medication to your tank, turn off your skimmer and any UV sterilizers and ozone generators.  Then, remove any mechanical filtration and carbon if present. 

Remove any shrimp or crabs that you want to save. They will have to stay out of the system for the duration of the treatment. However, be warned that if you add them back to your tank, there is a slight chance that you will re-introduce the red bugs to your tank. 

The next step is to dissolve the medication into some aquarium water, a process that will likely require stirring, as the powder is not very water soluble. Then, spread the mixed water evenly across the surface of the water. Your tank should remain perfectly clear and look normal the entire time. The bugs hang on well into the 4th and 5th hour of the treatment as their appendages will still be hanging onto the flesh.  Many of the bugs may even hang on for days even after they are dead. 

If anything goes wrong during treatment perform a water change ASAP and add a large amount of carbon to your system. 

After 6 hours, a 25% minimum water change is performed and as much activated carbon as you can fit should be added to the tank. In the initial tests, crustaceans that were reintroduced to a tank after a 25% water change and carbon were unaffected by the medication. 24 hours later the water should be changed again and the carbon replaced.  There is no maximum for the water changes or carbon, the more you do the better. 

The treatment needs to be performed a minimum of 3 times as the medication does not kill them at every stage of their life. Thus, even though most adults may be killed in the first treatment, there may be some juveniles and eggs that remain which were not affected by the treatment. The third treatment is a “just in case” treatment, its goal is to get any bugs that could have possibly survived the first two. 

The most likely side effect of this medication is that it will likely kill off most of the crustaceans in your aquarium, including all crabs, shrimps, mysis shrimp, and copepods. As mentioned, if you want to save any of your crustaceans you have to remove them before treatment. Also, if you have any fish or other animal that relies almost exclusively on micro-crustaceans for food, it may be better to evacuate them to another tank as this treatment will likely wipe out most of your micro-crustacean population.

Research indicates that the dragonface pipefish, ''Corythoichthys haematopterus'', is a natural predator of the red acro bug.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I got your message, and I am glad to have your help, or any help that we can get. Your project of recording audio books sounds like an admirable one, and I do agree that the [[Human Physiology]] book would be a good candidate for such treatment. I have been working on that book, although I haven't had as much time recently to work on it as much as I would like.

If you could read and record that book (or any other book), it is likely that we could host the audio files on the wikimedia download servers (if there weren't more appropriate places for them). Also, if you find errors in the books while reading, you are more then welcome to step in and fix them up as well.

The [[Human Physiology]] book was written by a class of nursing students, over the course of a single semester. These students are all hard workers, but are not all necessarily the most fluent of writers, so there is going to be some roughness around the edges. Please let me know if you need anything. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:36, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

'''Gözleme''' is a savoury traditional Turkish pastry dish, made of hand-rolled dough that is lightly brushed with butter and eggs, filled with various toppings, sealed, and cooked over a griddle.
The name derives from the Turkish word &quot;göz&quot;, meaning &quot;compartment&quot;, in reference to the pocket of dough in which the various toppings are sealed and cooked. Traditionally, this is done over a saç griddle.

Toppings for gözleme are numerous and vary by region and personal preference, and include a variety of meats (minced beef, chopped lamb, fresh or smoked seafood, sucuk, pastirma), vegetables (spinach, zucchini, eggplant, leek, chard, various peppers, onion, scallion, shallot, garlic), mushrooms (porcino, chanterelle, truffle), tubers (potatoes, yams, cassava, radish), cheeses (feta, Turkish white cheese, lavaş, kaşar, kaşkaval), as well as eggs, and seasonal herbs and spices.

A modern variation is honey and banana served hot with a slice of lemon.

== Ingredients ==
Serves 10

* 5¼ cups (600 grams) of [[Cookbook:flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 2½ teaspoons (15 grams) of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 teaspoons (7 grams) of [[Cookbook:Yeast|dry yeast]]
* 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1¼ (300 grams) of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* ½ cup (100 grams) of [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* ⅓ cup (65 grams) of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter ]]

== Procedure ==
[[Image:Istanbul turkey restaurant pancakes.jpg|right|thumb|Preparing gözleme; Istanbul, Turkey.]]
===The Dough===
# Sift flour in a large bowl, reserving one cup of flour. 
# Sprinkle with salt and mix. Make a hole in the centre. 
# Combine yeast and sugar in a small bowl. 
# Add ¼ of a cup of warm water, stir. Pour into hole in the centre of the flour. 
# Cover yeast with some flour. Let stand for 10 minutes to rise. 
# Stir in remaining water, blending thoroughly. Knead for 5 minutes to form a medium soft dough. 
# Cover and let rise in a warm place for one hour or until double in bulk. 

===The Gözleme===
# Place dough on lightly floured board. Divide into 10 portions with floured hands. 
# Shape into balls; roll each ball out with rolling pin into rectangles 5 mm thick. Brush with oil. 
# Fold opposite edges over, bringing edges together in centre. 
# Spread filling over half of pastry. Then fold other half over filling shaping into an oblong. 
# Seal edges well, pressing slightly. 

===The Cooking===
# Heat griddle or a cast iron skillet. 
# Grease with butter and place gözleme on griddle. 
# Brown on both sides. Serve hot. 

[[Cookbook:Ayran|Ayran]] is almost always served with gözleme.

My objection [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=696100 here]]

Your objection (recent) [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3ARequests_for_adminship&amp;diff=746624&amp;oldid=745940 here]], I must point out that I selected the one that you state clearly the viewpoints that I find myself sharing with you.

You logic on the rejection of my objection (and to my view of the need of consensus but this is not the point we are addressing now, I will gladly engage you on that point on the discussion of the proposed decision policy ) is (older that the validation) [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3ARequests_for_adminship&amp;diff=696974&amp;oldid=696798 here]], the flaw or opposing views, as I see it, is you converged on my points to validate an objection but on my objection you chose to ignore it (not the problem on the table now).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:39, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

Call your attention also to the comments made by others regarding the validity of my objection. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:41, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

So and taking even you objection text like &quot;things have changed&quot; it is clear that the objectives or requirements to get the admin flag are mutable without necessarily affecting those that already have it and even you seem to evolve your personal requirements for an approval vote lets extrapolate this to a change in your views on the restrictiveness on granting an approval (or that a significant number of people that share your views are not present during a vote) it is easy to see that having the admin flag is not a certainty of trust or knowledge. (I could probably be more specific and point you situations were users were granted administrative flags under circumstances that bypassed those presets).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:01, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:There is a big difference between the two candidates. Az was particularly active, especially in fighting vandals and cleaning up vandalism. The other user was not active in any respect. I dont see these two issues being the same at all, and I didnt reverse myself. We can talk about the other issue about me promoting Az despite your objection if you want, but i am not likely to admit fault on that issue either. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:13, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

::Well I can point one that you should clearly remember, the approval of Darklama (I also voted in opposition first and changed later but not because of trust or based on the users knowledge), but lets take that as example as you are particularly up-to-date on my still pending requests, the user performed several actions against stated policy (page moves, heavy structural changes), just before and after he was granted adminship (even you stated that on the call for comments), this is not to say he does not perform in general a good job or that I wish to have him lose his admin flag, it is just to demonstrate that there are a myriad of facets that should be considered when placing so much faith on a user just because he is an admin, it is incontestable that this specific user performed more good than wrong but admins shouldn't have a special hold on what is or not correct, as I said somewhere else admins are normal users on a specific task. (I'll go more deeply on this on the discussion of the revision for the specific policy)

::The consensus issue will be raised on the proper policy as I know you don't share my view on the strict use of it.

::I know that candidates aren't the same but was an opposition (you used the same logic to approve other users), I chose that because its use was similar in the value and content not the target, each user is different.

::Would you agree that an user can easily bypass the check and balances to get the admin flag then ? Any user could easily reproduce the valid work Az performed (with the same level of interaction with the rest of the community) and be granted the flag that doesn't provide any clue about the level of trust or knowledge or will to be involved on community matters in the long run, that is why I opposed at the time, your logic with the other user is even harder, the user already had the flag but lost it due to inertia (was he less trustworthy or with a lesser degree of knowledge, who can say), but I share your vote on that case (I must point out that I didn't particularly like how the removal of older admin flags was performed but I will also address that later). 

::Can we then agree that even if stated as a requirement trust and knowledge it shouldn't be blindly given to any user just because he has the admin flag ? or better yet only to users that have it ? That is what I was aiming to on that discussion a user should be only judged by performance and actions if he is or is not an admin is a lesser issue, I never wanted to be an administrator not because of the &quot;responsibility&quot; or anything like that just because I had no need to, if you place so much importance on that flag I will consider in 6 moths applying to it (that will be fun).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:40, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:::It is true that what AZ did (and still does a great deal) could be reproduced by other users. However, I think that it's difficult for someone to put that much work into things like vandal fighting and cleanup, etc, and not wanting to get involved with the community as a whole, especially since the point of doing that kind of stuff is to help protect the community from those that would harm it, and to improve it. However, I do understand your argument and to some degree I agree with you, that the newer admins may not have as much experience\community trust as older (not necessarily admin) contributors. 

:::That being said, I think that if a contributor can show that he or she really knows the ropes, has shown a true desire to get involved with the community, and would make good use of the admin priveleges, no matter how long the person's actually been around, he or she should be allowed to have it. There has to be some limit of course (that's what the 200 edit thing is for; people who are involved with the community will likely have relatively little difficulty reaching that due to all the different reasons there are for making posts) but I think it's not as clear-cut as you seem to be implying especially with your quoted objection to AZ's adminship nomination. Maybe it would make more sense to use as a guideline the number of edits in namespaces ''other'' than the main space, but I digress. &lt;small&gt;Revert me if you don't think it's appropriate for me to talk here but I wanted to keep it all on one page. &lt;/small&gt;[[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 03:49, 15 March 2007 (UTC).

::::Well, you got more or less the jest of what I was attempting to reason with [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]], note that I'm not in any way diminishing anyones work here, I was addressing the way, or if you will, the special consideration that [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] seems to attribute to the admin flag, nothing more (this is based on talks I have had with him and by several posts I have read here and there, I may be giving to much of attention to this point but it was on topic), administrators it is my view are here voluntarily and to provide a service to all not to archive any kind of special status, in a perfect world all would be granted adminiship or even checkuser rights, so, why not let anyone be an arbiter, if anything breaks no harm can be done to the community and the policy can be reworked later if we bar the access to people at the start without a clear justification we are only empowering the segmentation of what constitutes Wikibooks, the community.
::::As a side note and on the same topic, take for instance this page I had done some work and noticed the edit of Darklama and so did not fallow on what I will say next about this section [[Help:Administration_FAQ#Who_monitors_the_conduct_of_an_Administrator.3F]], this kind of information or concept is not only inaccurate but can provide to be dangerous it builds expectations of indeed getting above the others, humans are creatures that are in general driven by very basic instincts or formulate specific goal base decisions, one of the most damaging needs we have is to get above the crowd, known as the ego factor. It should be made clear that administrators aren't a special brotherhood with a secret sign, or right of decision to pass personal judgments, or have special powers, they are simple users like anyone else, granted that they should have some knowledge or have shown interest on the wellbeing of all but lets be fair and admit that this is probably hard to prove and very simple to simulate and ultimately people are people there will always be disagreements and attempts to engrandize oneself, we should attempt to perform above all this but we shouldn't be blind to the facts.
::::In specific to that section, I will let the time pass a little so not to offend or repeat the previous mistake in reverse, it is clear that Admins aren't monitored by the others admins only (Darklama solved only part of the problem), they are monitored by all users, any user can request the pulldown of the administrative flag and any user should (there are no clear policies yet) be able to request administrative  actions to be reaccessed or even reverted, by preventing an outside party or non administrators to participate in the decision process if the involved parties agree, is to me just wrong.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 06:49, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

::::PS: Call you attention to consider expressing again your support  [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Technical_Chat#Wikijunior_Namespace]], txs --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:Administrators must satisfy a vague set of requirements on activity, as well as satisfy vague requirements on their trust and knowledgability. Once those conditions are satisfied (and what it takes to satisfy them does change with time), that user is still subject to a vote of their peers as to whether or not to get adminship. Admins are just like ordinary users, and they are treated as ordinary in all discussions and votes. No special attention is paid to admins because of the flag. However, admins have been voted into a position of trust by the community, and that is a milestone that should not be ignored completely. I don't believe that people who aren't qualified to be admins should serve as arbiters, or bureaucrats, or checkusers. You may see these as all different issues, but I see them as the same: You must first prove that you are trusted (through an admin vote) before you can move on to higher levels of responsibility in the community. 
:In the USA, for instance, any person is entitled to run for president. In practice, however, the only people with a good chance of winning are state governors and US Senators. To the public, people who have already passed the hurdle to become a senator or govenor have less to prove of themselves then a non-politician does. I am not trying to draw a direct parallel, because adminship is not a position of power or control in the same way that presidency is. The point remains: Before moving to a higher rank (or a higher position of responsibility), you should first prove yourself by attaining a lower rank. In other words, you have to work your way up the ladder.
:In response to your comments about Darklama, you need to keep in mind that the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] guideline is very vague about these kinds of points, and [[User_talk:Panic2k4/blocks_and_other_bits#Comment_by_User:Whiteknight|my comments on Darklama's additions]] served more as a personal interpretation of that guideline. In actuality, Darklama's edits were protected by the '''Be Bold'' directive, and it's only after your complaints are lodged that the decision making process begins. Should he likely have discussed changes with you before making them? Yes. Was he required to ask you before he made those changes? No. If you read the text of these policies and guidelines carefully, Darklama was perfectly in accordance with the edits that he made. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:18, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

::Ok this is my last post on the subject with you because I can't believe you are seriously defending you point or that this will lead anywhere.
::How can you so adamantly defend the validity of the vote for adminiship if you consider the number of users we have on wikibooks (heck, consider only half or a third) and the average number of votes that can give one the flag (7 max) and on top of that there is no compliance with the consensus rule, you can only be joking about it or do you really believe that those votes represent the community ?
::I have proven several weaknesses to the identity of users, shown that a user can easily bypass the checks and balances, show that consensus is not fallowed, I believe if so inclined a few users that get admitted as administrators can remove the administrative flags of most of the older (a good enough proposal and good timing is all it's needed) and virtually control wikibooks, can't you see that if we start centralizing and empowering a segment of the community over the rest we risk such events or even if not started with that express intention such patterns of behavior can emerge.
::This is why I place so much importance on the strict use of consensus.
::I was not discussing Darklama I was commenting on past events and your own comments at the time, but again if we fallow consensus the status quo is maintained, that is all I was asking at the time and still require in several of the changes I initiated dialog and requested the user to give a validity to, the BEBOLD expressly states a limitation to that right and extends into how carefully it should be used, in that particular case Darklama was aware that I didn't agree with several changes he made when I was blocked. Move of pages go above simple edits, no policy, not even BEBOLD can be used to validate the moving of pages from an active book (where someone is working) without discussion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

::: I think you're not assuming the good faith of the administrators, Panic; I know you may have some bitterness towards them but most of them started with a clean plate before making their own decisions, they weren't trying to &quot;control wikibooks&quot;, and they're still not. It just so happens that most of the users on Wikibooks prefer to focus on content rather than doing things like voting on policy and on adminship, and that most of those users that are active in policy happen to be administrators (partly ''for'' that reason; as you pointed out, there have been failed rFas due to insufficient community involvement and knowledge of policy). No, the policy is not ''exact'' on what they mean by &quot;having enough involvement&quot;, this is left open for a reason and that's to allow flexibility for each new rFa that's out there.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Mattb112285|Mattb112285]] ([[User talk:Mattb112285|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattb112285|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

::::I assume good faith dealing with any person as a rule, not only on wikibooks, but trust and respect is earned and can be lost and levels of both are not fixed or generalized, one has trust and respect for friends and parents but they are no equal, they depend on actions and perception, actions can be simulated and the last one can be fabricated.
::::Several events have indeed left a scar, reading things like this [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AChazz&amp;diff=765914&amp;oldid=765011 here]] (random example) and watching intentional misrepresentation of facts have indeed eroded my level of faith on some administrators and that &quot;group&quot; of users  in general. But as I have said people are people and each user is unique.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:15, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The community is small, and that's why a relatively large portion of the community appears to be admins, and also why admins can be elected with relatively few votes. You haven't &quot;proven&quot; any weaknesses in the identities of users, nor the falliability of admins, nor in the abuse of consensus. You have given your opinions on the matters, and I have disagreed. Also, there is plenty of accordance with the concensus rule. Concensus does not now and has not ever required 100% agreement. Furthermore, '''Be Bold''' enables users to act without gaining concensus (barring argument, of course), and [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] is only a ''guideline'', not a ''policy'' (I wanted it to be a policy, but the community decided to have more flexibility in the matter). 1 arbitrary disagreement among 7 strong support votes cannot and ''will not'' stop a measure from passing. I heard your objection, and I acknowledged it, but as the acting Bureaucrat I didn't believe that your objection was enough to stop Az's promotion. In that case, adequate consensus was achieved, and I stand by my decision 100%. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::::#weaknesses in the identities of users - If I was so inclined I would get a user approved as admin just to show that it can easily be done.
::::#falliability of admins - both SB Jhonny and Darklama have failed on admin taks, I don't intend to rehash the subject but you own words admited to errors, errors anyone can commit but should be strongly avoided by admins nonetheless.
::::#abuse of consensus - I don't agree with you definition of consensus nor how you have used the word, 7 to 1 is not consensus it's a vote by majority, I have addressed those on my essay.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:15, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:#You could certainly try to do this, I am highly doubtful that you would succeed. Plus, if you could &quot;pretend&quot; to be worthy of being an admin for a while, it would certainly raise questions as to why you have't been worthy of the honor on your primary account. At this point, additional sockpuppets, if they were discovered, would likely lead to you being blocked again. 
:#Your frequent insults of both SBJohnny and Darklama are annoying. In admin tasks, I dont believe that either have made any mistakes. Admins are empowered to use their best judgement, and both SBJohnny and Darklama have used their best judgement in handling situations. That you have an issue with either of these admins is to be expected, but it isn't proof of wrongdoing. If you dont like them, nominate them for removal. 
:#7 people with good reasons, and 1 person with bad reasons ''is concensus''. In concensus, the ''quality of the argument is more important then the quantity of the arguments''. Numerically, the vote could have been 3-5, but if the 3 had better arguments, the vote would have passed. I did not view your argument as being of particularly high quality, and I made a note of that. You would do well to read the full text of [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] so that you understand exactly what we mean by the word &quot;consensus&quot;. How we have defined that word may be different from the way your dictionary might define it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:23, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:::#I never tried or worked with that as a target, even if I did perform regular admin tasks, fighting vandalization  of pages etc.., but will try it in 6 moths, and one of the points that we diverge is that I don't consider the task to be an honor but a vocation and a different way of contributing to the project nothing more.
:::#I don't regard it as insults, SBJohnny acknowledged as much and you own assessment of some actions of Darklama also address some failings (do you need the links to the relevant subjects?), I also have acknowledged my errors. I'm not ashamed of addressing them also. I state again that I don't want to nominate them for removal of the admin flag but I will use even my own errors to demonstrate some view points and try to make committing them again harder.
:::#Again, this point will not be solved as you are irredeemable on you view point, but you make a god point against your own definition, so you now have the sole hold on accessing the quality of votes or if they should count, funny that one, well this is why I stopped voting on the RFA. And will fight to show the community the fragility of using your definition.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::::We have 3 bureaucrats precisely so that I dont have unilateral control over RFA votes. According to the decision making guideline, &quot;votes&quot; (and that really is an inappropriate word) are measured by their quality. This is a necessary safeguard against sockpuppetry, and it also helps to distinguish between people who are non-committal, and people who are passionate about a particular option. As a final note, it isn't &quot;my definition&quot;, it is &quot;Everybody's definition except yours&quot;. You seem to be the only person who doesnt understand or doesnt agree with the decision making policy, so don't single me out as being some kind of evil perpetrator of a bad definition. Since this is my talk page, and since i am tired of these acusations, I am likely to delete any further references to that effect on sight. Read the guideline, all the details are spelled out. You are always welcome to propose a change to the guideline, I would be surprised if it got much support. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:05, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This module describes the differences between WordPerfect 12's 'normal' new operating mode and its Classic Mode, which emulates WordPerfect 5.1.

Abbreviations in this module:

*WP 5.1: WordPerfect 5.1 DOS, not the Microsoft Windows version
*WP 12: WordPerfect 12 Windows

__TOC__

===The Classic Mode===
====Note about how this is written====

====General impression of the Classic Mode====
Much in the Classic Mode is not like the real thing, WP 5.1. For example Shift-F1 does not evoke the normal WP 5.1, but the WP 12 menu. So you have to know that you have to choose Customize to change the keyboard (template) setting. In WP 5.1 you could choose the Keyboard template directly. Also Ctrl-F8 evokes the WP 12 Font menu. F2 evokes the WP 12 Find and replace menu. And of course pressing F2 to start searching doesn't work, you have to press Enter to start searching. And there are many more of such differences. Very shameful is that pressing F3 does not evoke the normal WP 5.1 Help where you would get help about a function by pressing the key combination under which that function was.

====Function keys and other keys====
=====A note about how we write about function keys here=====
We've chosen to give the function keys names ourself, those are often a compromise between their WP 5.1 name and their function in WP 12.

=====Key combinations with F1=====
F1 (Undelete) has clearly not been debugged. The menu is familiar: &quot;Undelete: 1 Restore 2 Previous Deletion&quot;. But what the menu options do are definitely WP 12 functions and not what the menu should do as being part of the Classic Mode. Restore is the same as Undo, still quite similar to WP 5.1 but former WP 5.1 users who used deleting and restoring text to cut and copy text will find that is not working in the Classic Mode. The Previous Deletion option works as WP 12's Redo. It is not bad to have WP 12's Undo and Redo but it would be nice if this was written correctly in the menu. And it is definitely not WP 5.1 style.

Shift-F1 (Settings) is really a turnoff for the real WP 5.1 fan. It invokes the WP 12 Settings menu which is completely different. Features are arranged completely differently and some vital WP 5.1 features are missing. For example adjusting the display colors is impossible. So if you want white letters on a black background for maximum contrast that is not possible. Of course artistic display color settings like blue for bold, yellow for underline and the mix of the two colors, green for bold and underline are not possible, but that is not an omission in the Settings menu but something that is impossible in the Classic Mode. (Although of course this could be done with complicated macro's, but that is not the topic of this article.) Another unlucky thing is Settings (Shift-F1), Customize, Keyboard. In the WPDOS 5.1 keyboard a lot of keys have assigned to them Feature 34288. Not really very clear in case you are really used to the WP 5.1 function keys and want to assign for example to Ctrl-Shift-F3 the PerfectExpert because F3 is the ordinary Help. Also unlucky is the order of Shift, Ctrl and Alt. Between just Ctrl and just Alt there's Ctrl-Shift, not really good to get an overlook of the key combinations that were used in WP 5.1.

Ctrl-F1 (Command) is handy. In WP 5.1 you get a menu with the choices DOS prompt, DOS command and possibly Copy to WP Shell Clipboard. Copy to WP Shell Clipboard is obviously an obsolete and unneeded command in a Windows program. have to press a key to get a DOS prompt or a DOS command. In WP 12 Classic mode it directly opens a command window (MS-DOS prompt) where you can execute more commands or just one if you prefer so.
 
=====Key combinations with F2=====
F2 (Find&amp;Replace) evokes unfortunately the WP 12 Find and replace menu, and of course pressing F2 to start searching doesn't work in that menu. You have to press Enter to start searching. But there is another disadvantage that is more serious. Pressing function keys to insert codes does not work, you have to select each code in a list in the menu Match, Codes where you can type in the code to select from the list. But what a small group of people will also miss is that it is not possible anymore to use a one character wildcard in a search. This was done with Ctrl-X in WP 5.1. 

Shift-F2 (Search Backwards) unfortunately doesn't work. This has a logical explanation. It is impossible to type in the Find and Replace when the focus is on the Find Prev button.

=====Key combinations with F3=====
Very shameful is that pressing F3 (Help) does not evoke the normal WP 5.1 Help where you would get help about a function by pressing the key combination under which that function was. You get the ordinary Windows help. Moreover pressing a letter to get help about a subject starting with that letter is not possible. (You would retype the letter one or more times to page down through the list of help topics.)

Ctrl-F3 (Window/Lines) seems to work excellently and invokes a classic WP 5.1 Ctrl-F3 menu. But a weird thing is that the menu has an option WP Info, an option that is not in the WP 5.1 menu. But what people that make readme.txt files that have to be read in older versions of Notepad will possibly regret is that it is only possible to draw graphical lines. This is something that is missing in the Classic mode, line drawing for use in a fixed width character font for readme.txt files. Note that in later Windows versions also proportional fonts can be used in Notepad to display the text, and the default font is a proportional font. So for readme.txt files for later Windows versions drawing lines with asterisks or similar character has no use, unless you want to impress the users of your program with what you can do in Notepad. If they switch their font to Fixedsys or Courier they can see all your tables made with asterisks and underlining with underline characters (&amp;#773;).

Alt-F3 (Reveal Codes) is a little bit disappointing again. Well it closes or opens the Reveal codes subwindow but the colors in this window are definitely not the familiar blue screen colors. It is possible to change to colors yourself but it would have been nicer if the change of Workspace to Classic Mode would also change the colors of the Reveal Codes subwindow. Fortunately a powerful WP 12 feature of the Reveal Codes subwindow still works. You can click on a code to edit it and sometimes you can also edit related settings.

=====Key combinations with F4=====
F4 (Indent Left) and Shift-F4 (Indent Left&amp;Right) works exactly as you would want it to work.

This is not the case for Ctrl-F4 (Move) which should give you the possibility to Move or Copy a Block but which either gives the menu that you would get in WP 5.1 when no block was selected, or even more confusing gives you a Close window dialog box. This random behaviour is a serious bug. The workaround is clumsy. Use on the menu bar Edit, Cut or Edit, Copy. You will unfortunately have to do that with the mouse. Retrieving of Blocks works fine. Retrieving of tabular columns and rectangles works fine too, but is rather confusing to use as you will have to use the menu bar to cut or copy them.

Alt-F4 (Selection On/Close/Exit) is again a case of something that is not really a bug but that is really clumsy. Pressing Alt-F4 once switches on selection/block, and you can use the arrow keys and other movement keys to select text without having to constantly press Shift like you normally need to do in other Windows programs. But there's nowhere an indicator that says that selection is on, so that is sloppy. And pressing Alt-F4 again has not the effect it should have: selection off. Instead of that it brings up an Exit dialog box. To switch a selection off you need to click anywhere in text, clumsy for users who preferred and didn't need to use the mouse in WP 5.1. For the use of Alt-F4 instead of F7 see F7.

=====Key combinations with F5=====
F5 (Open File/List) works as you would expect. It opens the Open File menu dialog. But previewing a file without opening it is not possible, and sometimes that is just what you want, to get a quick impression of a file without leaving the Open File menu.

Shift-F5 (Date/Paragraph) has a bug again. When you choose for Define it works as Date Text.  
(edited, after experience in COREL WP X3 (13): in the classic menu, Date Text and Define both have D highlighted as their mnemonic character, but 1 and 6 as their respective numeric option number. If 6 is entered, the WPX3 Define paragraph box opens and you can indeed &quot;Define&quot;).

Ctrl-F5 (Document In/Out) has the option DOS Text, which gives the following option that some users will really like: Retrieve (CR/LF to [SRt] in HZone). This can even be used to reformat a readme.txt file that has been formatted by line breaks which show up as [HRt] in WP 12. By saving the readme.txt as DOS text and retrieving it you can nearly get all the paragraphs right. The HZone is the hyphenation zone, which actually consists of a left and a right zone. When a line break is in the hyphenation zone in a DOS text WP 12 will recognize that it is not the end of a paragraph but just the end of a line. Of course for that the margins and font size have to be set such that the end of the lines that are full of words are within the hyphenation zone. Use a rather large hyphenation zone, and don't forget that you have to use a fixed width font. In WP 12 only Courier New is available for this.

Alt-F5 (Reference) looks fine. It has a lot of the legacy menu's that all bring you finally to the appropriate WP 12 menu.

=====Key combinations with F6=====
F6 (Bold) works for switching on and of Bold when no selection is on. When F6 used to make a selection Bold it is not working, it has no effect. Another bug unfortunately.

Shift-F6 (Center) works fine.

Ctrl-F6 (Special Tab) doesn't work that easy as in WP 5.1 but offers the new possibilities of WP 12.

Alt-F6 (Flush Right) works fine and produces a [Hd Flush Right] code that only flushes right one line, which is exactly what it should do. Funny is that it is still possible to make text overlap, but someone has to be really clumsy too do that, so we don't consider this a bug. You don't need to shield your user of every little mistake he could make, especially not if he has the powerful tool of Reveal Codes to correct any silly mistakes.

=====Key combinations with F7=====
Very importantly, F7 (Close/Exit) does not work most of the time to close windows. But you can use Alt-F4 (Close/Exit) instead of F7. The fact that F7 doesn't work most of the time is clearly a serious bug. As for allowing the use of Alt-F4 instead of F7 we think this is a good thing. It is definitely not WP 5.1 like but if both F7 and Alt-F4 would have worked it would have been more user friendly for most users than with just F7 working for Close/Exit. Often F7, when it works, and also Alt-F4 invoke a Close document dialog box when closing the last menu, which is clearly another bug.

Shift-F7 (Print) works fine. 

Ctrl-F7 (Foot/Endnote) has a lot of legacy menu's and looks fine.

Alt-F7 has a lot of legacy menu's. And for making Tables you even get the WP 5.1 prompts &quot;Number of Columns:&quot; and &quot;Number of Rows:&quot;, really legacy WP 5.1 style! Math doesn't work like in WP 5.1 in a table made with tabs. It only works in a table and it evokes the formula bar in that case.

=====Key combinations with F8=====
F8 (Underline) works fine for switching on and off underline without selection switched on. When F8 is used to underline a selection it does not work, but turns the selection off. Another bug unfortunately. F8 can of course be used as a workaround key to turn a selection off with the keyboard which is not possible otherwise.

Shift-F8 (Format) is really a delight for the WP 5.1 fan. It is only a shame it doesn't evoke a full screen menu but apart from that the menu structure is the one you know from WP 5.1.

Ctrl-F8 (Font) evokes the WP 12 Font menu. That menu is about as efficient as the WP 5.1 menu's but it is not legacy WP 5.1. Ctrl-F8 has unfortunately also a problem, when it is used when a selection is active. When a selection is active you get Page Setup, and not the Font menu window. This is a serious bug and there is more than one workaround, but they are all clumsy.

Alt-F8 (Styles) evokes the WP 12 Styles menu.

=====Key combinations with F9=====
F9 (ENDFIELD) works exactly as it should work and inserts the merge code ENDFIELD.

Shift-F9 (Merge) evokes the WP 12 Merge dialog. This dialog is a little bit clearer than the prompts of WP 5.1.

Ctrl-F9 (Merge/Sort) gives the user the choice between Merge and Sort and brings you to Windows menu. The option Convert Old Merge Codes has been added to make the menu familiar but only brings up a pop-up window saying it is an obsolete command which perfectly makes sense. 

=====Key combinations with F10=====
F10 (Save As), Shift-F10 (Open File), Ctrl-F10 (Record Macro) and Alt-F10 (Play Macro) all evoke the right WP 12 dialog box.

=====Key combinations with F11=====
F11 (Reveal Codes) works fine. Shift-F11, Ctrl-F11 and Alt-F11 should have had no function but give Italics, Large and Very Large. Not WP 5.1 but definitely not a problem.

=====Key combinations with F12=====
F12 (Selection/Block) has the same problem as Alt-F4 (Selection/Block). See Alt-F4 for more details.

Shift-F12, Ctrl-F12 and Alt-F12 have no effect just as they shouldn't have.


=====Key combinations with edit keys=====
Home doesn't work like it should work. In WP 5.1 it is a &quot;prefix&quot; key to tell WP 5.1 how far you want to move. In WP 12 Classic Mode it just works like in WP 12 WordPerfect mode, the ordinary Workspace. This is really a turnoff. It is possible to get in front of any codes with Home and Ctrl-Home. Just press the key(s) twice. In WP 5.1 you'd have to press Home three times for that. It works, but really is not WP 5.1 style.

End of course doesn't work as it should work either. End brings you to the end of the line like in WP 5.1. But Ctrl-End brings you to the end of the text, and doesn't delete the par of the line right to the cursor. 

Del really doesn't work like it should work. When a selection is on Del deletes the whole selection without asking &quot;Delete selection?&quot;. But worse is that when you would delete a code and just want to go on deleting text only you have to press reply No to each window asking you whether you want to delete that code. In WP 5.1 pressing Del again would be seen as no by WP 5.1. Much more clever. 

Ins works the same as in WP 5.1.
 
PgUp and PgDn are also like in windows. They don't bring you a page up and a page down but a screen up and a screen down.

=====Other key combinations with Shift, Ctrl and Alt=====
Shift-&lt;edit key&gt; makes a selection just like in windows. And pressing an edit key deactivates the selection like in windows. The fact you can use the traditional WP 5.1 way to make a selection and use the windows way might seem an advantage, but it is quite confusing because Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V don't work. The weird thing is that Ctrl-X works normally. It was clearly not well thought of how this works. Together with the bug in Ctrl-F4 (Move) this is really clumsy.

A lot of the Ctrl-&lt;letter&gt; combinations have functions assigned to them and some evoke the macro ctrl&lt;letter&gt;.wcm. This is again a weird choice Corel has made. In case you want to make a macro you would have to find out what letters are used and what are not. Moreover in WordPerfect 5.1 most Ctrl-&lt;letter&gt; combinations where unused by most users (you could use them as merge commands but there were easier ways to insert merge commands). What is really a shame is that Ctrl-V doesn't work for combining to characters in a special one. Only a small group of people will miss Ctrl-X for inserting a wild-card character when searching, that stands for one random character.
HOWEVER, you can write a simple macro for Ctrl-V using the (WPCharactersDlg ()) command in the macro editor (Ctrl-m), which brings up the window of symbols, and you can then compose (e.g. acute accent by typing ',e) and press enter. It's a tiny bit slower. ANYWAY, regular wordperfect mode in Windows versions just uses ctrl-W to produce the same result and always has done so.

====Display colors====
''Yet to be written.''

====Menu bar====
Really weird is that there is no WP 5.1 menu bar. It is not that hard to make a menu bar with the WP 5.1 menus and menu options left and at the top, and to add to the bottom and to the right WP 12 menus and menu options. Of course it is not that hard to make it yourself but it should have been included.

====Application Bar====
The Application Bar could have been better. We have to admit it is not that important and the bottom line of the screen of WP 5.1, the WP 5.1 Application Bar was not perfect. But the way the Application Bar is in the Classic Mode really misses the style of the WP 5.1 Application Bar. That not the full name and path is in the Application Bar seems a wise decision. But the icon for the shadow cursor should have been written in full, as should have other icons have been written in full, to make the Application Bar less distracting by a lot of funny icons.



====Conclusion about the Classic Mode====
''The conclusion may still change depending on our findings.''

The Classic Mode is not at all a bad compromise between the WP 5.1 user interface and the WP 12 user interface. But a lot could be improved without making the user experience for both the more WP 5.1 oriented users as the WP 12 oriented users any worse. For most die hard WP 5.1 lovers the differences between the Classic Mode and the real WP 5.1 in my opinion are just too great. Even by tweaking a lot of settings other than just switching to Classic Mode the difference between the Classic Mode and WP 5.1 are large. There's clearly room for Corel to improve the Classic Mode, although for a group of users it will be a wonderful working Mode.

      <comment>Sorry to delete a whole section without talking. I did some research as to what the anon/inline difference was, and I found [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/89040 this], so I don't think inlines should be taught anymore.</comment>

This section discusses anonymous functions and function handles. Both of these are ''portable'' in that rather than having to write an equation multiple times in a program, you can just define it once and then call it whenever you want to use it. In addition, function handles in particular allow you to pass an equation to another function for direct evaluation as needed. Anonymous functions are useful for command-line evaluation or for multiple evaluations in the same m-file.

== Anonymous functions ==

An anonymous function can be created at the command or in a script:

 &gt;&gt;f = @(x) 2*x^2-3*x+4;
 &gt;&gt;f(3)
 ans = 13

To make an anonymous function of multiple variables, use a comma-separated list to declare the variables:

 &gt;&gt;f = @(x,y) 2*x*y;
 &gt;&gt;f(2,2)
 ans = 8

It is possible to make an array of anonymous functions in MATLAB 7.1 but this will become outdated soon so using this construct in a distributed program is not recommended.

To pass anonymous functions to other functions, just use the name of the anonymous function in your call:

 &gt;&gt; f = @(t,x) x;
 &gt;&gt; ode45(f, [0:15],1)

== Function Handles ==

A function handle passes an ''m-file function'' into another function. This of course lets you have more control over what's passed there, and makes your program more general as it lets you pass ''any'' m-file (as long as it meets other requirements like having the right number of input arguments and so on). The functionality is similar to that of function pointers in C++.

To pass an m-file to a function, you must first write the m-file, say something like this:

 function xprime = f(t,x)
 xprime = x;

Save it as myfunc.m. To pass this to another function, say an ODE integrator, use the @ symbol as follows:

 &gt;&gt; ode45(@myfunc, [0:15], 1)

One advantage of using function handles over anonymous functions is that you can evaluate more than one equation in the m-file, thus allowing you to do things like solve ''systems'' of ODEs rather than only one. Anonymous functions limit you to one equation.

=== How to write a function that accepts a function handle ===

You can also write your own functions that accept function handles. Simply define them as variables in your header, and then call them as if they were functions:

 % myadd adds two variables together
 function result = myfunc(func, a, b);
 result = func(a, b);
 
 [in a separate m-file]
 function sum = myadd(a, b)
 sum = a+b;

The command you send to myfunc looks like this:

 &gt;&gt; result = myfunc(@myadd, 1, 2);
 result = 3

      <text xml:space="preserve">The bagpipes are a woodwind instrument, and with all woodwinds, they are affected by the environment in which they are stored and played in. This can result in problems with the care and maintenance of the bagpipes.

==Wood maintenance==
A woodwind instrument, being made of wood, expands and contracts slightly with the rising and lowering of humidity. If the wood is allowed to dry out, the wood can crack. 

On the subject of oiling, there are different schools of thought.  Certainly blackwood is naturally an extremely oily wood, even when it appears to be bone dry.  Many pipers never oil sets made of blackwood to no apparent detriment.   Others oil only the exterior.  If oil is applied, it should be done lightly, and not too often.  Woodwind instrument dealers or bagpipe will sell suitable oils; other substitutes, such as olive oil, vegetable oil, mineral oil, engine oil, etc., are not substitutes!

==Hemping==

Hemping is the process of coating a joint with hemp. In order for bagpipes to perform well, joints must be properly hemped so they are airtight but moveable. Overhemping a joint should be avoided. Various types of hemp are available - it is actually made for cobblers, but are ideal for bagpipes - but the most convenient kind is the pre-waxed yellow hemp.  The black hemp is coarser, but more moisture resistant, and can be useful for joints such as the blowpipe which get very wet. If unwaxed hemp is used, it needs to be coated before use either with beeswax or cobblers wax.  

Hemp should be wound onto the join evenly and under firm tension, building the layers up one by one.  A piece of timber can be used to roll the joint on a flat surface: this compresses the hemp down and speeds up the process of &quot;bedding in&quot;.

In general, PTFE (plumber's tape) should not be used as a substitute for hemp, though some players use a very fine layer on tuning slides to assist in fine tuning.  There is a school of thought which counsels against this, claiming that PTFE can become embedded in cracks and force them open.  Whether this is true or not is not clear.

==Seasoning the bag==

Natural leather bags usually require a dressing which renders the inside of the bag airtight yet moisture absorbent; this dressing, and the process of applying it, is called seasoning.  It is important to note that some bags are treated in such a way that they do not require seasoning, so it is important to check!  Synthetic bags, made of nylon or gore-tex, do not require any seasoning (though they do need to be checked regularly for airtightness), and should be kept as clean and dry as is practicable. 

Historically, seasonings were concocted from various widely available substances - honey and treacle were popular - but nowadays commercial preparations, such as Hardie's and Robertsons are available from bagpipe dealers.  The recipes are trade secrets, but are widely presumed to be largely glycerine.  Directions are unique to each product, but in general the best approach is to use generously - at least a cup or more -  and once worked into the bag fully, allowed to drain out back into the container for re-use.  Metal containers for seasoning are now mostly a thing of the past, but if encountered these should be transferred into a plastic container, as once opened the seasoning reacts with air and the tin and will go bad.

Natural bags do have a limited lifespan: sheepskin bags may last only a year (or even less if used in wet weather or if neglected), and hide bags may last four or five years (though they are now uncommon as they are very poor at controlling moisture).

==Reed Manipulation==

Only a certain amount can be said about reed manipulation on the printed page, perhaps the best of which is: don't!  Nowadays, we have many excellent reed makers and it should not be hard to find reeds that work well at a comfortable pressure for anybody.  There are individuals who specialise in picking reeds for mail order customers who cannot visit a reedmaker personally.

Before altering a reed, it is very important to look for other causes of a problem, such as dirt and gunk built up inside the chanter.  In general, a new reed can be gently squeezed at the top of the reed (too much will damage the cane: no more than is required to close the lips together is about right), to ease it slightly; if it is still too hard after squeezing, the best approach is to discard it in favour of another.  However, it is possible to remove a little cane in order to ease a reed if needed; this should be done with a very sharp knife or fine sandpaper, and be done a very little at a time: every cut or scrape will make an audible difference, and cane cannot be put back on!  This approach will also alter the pitch of the reed, and so should be done with care.

==Chanter Reed Problem Solving==

===Reed Too Hard=== 
* Gently squeeze lips of blade
* Lightly sandpaper or scrape blades above sound box
* With a pair of pliers gently close staple - this is an extreme measure and is likely to destroy the reed.

===Reed Too Weak=== 
* Open reed with a mandrel
* Snip a tiny amount off the lips of the blades
* Dispose of the reed and get a new one
===Top Hand Too Sharp===
* Raise reed in reed seat
* Sandpaper or scrape the upper part of the blades (not the lips)
===Top Hand Too Flat===
* Seat reed further into chanter
* As a last resort, snip a tiny amount off the lips of the blades.
===Individual Note Flat===
* Use a small file or very sharp scalpel to undercut the top of the hole. DO NOT MANIPULATE THE CHANTER UNTIL YOU HAVE EXHAUSTED EVERY OTHER POSSIBLE OPTION
===Individual Note Sharp=== 
* Apply tape to the top of hole
* Occasionally, single notes can be brought into tune with small movements of the reed - this is particularly true of D, F, and high G.

===Dull Sounding Reed===
* Reed may have become dry, so moisten either by blowing into it for a period of time for a slightly dry reed, or soak the reed in water and allow it to dry naturally
* Lightly sand the lips of the blades (This will sharpen the top notes)
* Reed may just be bad, toss
===Squeaky Reed===
* Try remedy for weak reed
* Reed may just be bad, toss
===Reed Choking=== 
* Reed is probably be too strong, or bad blowing
* Check for possible leaks
* Could be a bad chanter or incompatible reed

===Double Toning F=== 
* Carefully squeeze sound box until you feel the reed give a little. You may need to perform the squeeze a few times but the problem should disappear as the reed comes down in strength
* If it appears in a played in reed, bin it.  You might be able to fix it by cutting and scraping, but the reed will never be reliable.

===Scratchy High A=== 
* Wait until you have played the reed for a couple of hours, and if the problem continues, try using very fine sandpaper to sand the tops of the lips

==Drone Reed Problem Solving==

===Drone Reed Too Weak===
*Move the drone bridle away from the tongue seat

===Drone Reed Too Strong===
*Move the drone bridle toward the tongue seat

:Good idea.  I've never done a transwiki before or else I would.  Anyone...? - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 06:59, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

:Before this is moved or merged anywhere, there is a lot of bad or misleading or only vaguely correct information.  Chanters usually fall out because the hemp dries out, not the wood.  Whether or not you should oil depends on the type of wood: African Blackwood should not be oiled, and olive oil and neatsfoot are not suitable.  When hemping, the whole piece of hemp should be waxed; cobbler's wax is useful in providing a firm grip on the wood for the first turns.  There is no need to rehemp unless the hemp is rotten or poorly applied to begin with (most new sets of pipes are badly hemped, though).  Natural bags can be cured so as not to require seasoning, so you need to know how your bag was cured.  A bag needs seasoned whenever the insides of the bag do not slip against one another smoothly.  Clean the seasoning from the stocks before leaving the bag overnight (or it will cool into solid lumps that are a pain to remove).  After a months regular practice, any leather bag is going to be as unhygienic as it is going to ever be.  A regularly played sheepskin bag will only last a year anyway, and an unregularly played sheepskin bag is worthless.  Squeezing a staple with pliers leads to non-functioning reeds - pick ones you can play in the first place.  Don't throw away easy reeds, keep them for beginners.  Don't soak a reed in water unless you are going to chuck it anyway. 

:I can see how we could in theory have an encyclopedia article on bagpipe maintenance, but this is not it.  And I don't think it is worth keeping, here or elsewhere, either. [[User:Calum|Calum]] 23:01, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
